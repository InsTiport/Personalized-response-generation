  Q.  How was your round?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I got off to a horrific start.  Chip, 3-putt on the first, started with a double and then came back good with four birdies.  I birdied the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 8th, and 2-under at the turn and dropped one on 11 and another one on 15.  So back to level, and then birdied 16, 17 and just missed a 2 1/2, 3-footer on the last for birdie.  So could have been a nice finish with three straight birdies but wasn't to be.   
 Overall I'm happy with the score.  I'm in 2-under after being 2-over after one.  With the come back I think we're in decent shape and hopefully play better tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Feel better about your position?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  I know I can pretty much win any tournament that I tee it up in if I play well enough, so I think it's more, you want to try and play as well as you can if you put yourself in position.  It's basically a matter of going into the last nine holes on Sunday.  That's when you want to be able to have a chance and not be too many shots behind.   
 Obviously I would like to be a few in front.  It's all about positioning yourself and being up there when Sunday arrives, that's the main focus.
