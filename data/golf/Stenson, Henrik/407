  Q.  Obviously you're winning, you're just not making it quite easy on yourself out there?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  No.  It was different.  Yesterday I got off to a really good start.  I made five birdies in the first eight holes and was 4-up.  And then I stumbled a bit, hit a couple of wayward shots and then Allenby made some good putts and put pressure on me.   
 Today I was 4-up through eight.  It came down to me making some good things and Trevor missed a few putts.  And then he just started to play really, really solid and I couldn't throw that extra gear in, so he made birdie on 9, 10, 12, 16 and 17.  So he puts out five birdies together, back to all square.  That was why we ended up in playoff, not necessarily because I made a lot of bogeys.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel a little charmed?  Do you feel like you've worked pretty hard and made the shots you needed to make?   
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, especially in the playoffs.  I made some important three- or four-footers to stay alive and he missed a couple of chances.  I think he would have been -- I wouldn't have been as disappointed, I guess, after the playoff if I would have lost as he is, because he had better chances than I did.  I'm just happy I hung in there and made the putt on 5 when I really needed to and a great up-and-down on 7, and he couldn't match that birdie.
