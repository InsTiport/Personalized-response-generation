 Q.  Henrik, how was it for you?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm pretty pleased both with the score and with the way I played.  I thought I played fairly solid.  I hit a lot of good shots and hit most of the fairways, most of the greens.  Yeah, I kept it pretty tidy and stress free most of the round.  Managed to sneak a couple of putts in, as well.   
 Q.  How are the greens this afternoon?  A lot of guys said it was quite bumpy out there?  
HENRIK STENSON: I think they made a correct assessment.   
 Q.  A lot of positives going into tomorrow.  What are you feeling for tomorrow morning?  
HENRIK STENSON: I'm just going to try and carry on.  If I can play the way I did today for the next three days, I hope I can be there or thereabouts on Sunday.  It's a long way before the back nine on Sunday, so you've just got to keep on making birdies and keep it in play.  If I can keep on doing more of the same, I hope I can get into the position we want to be.
