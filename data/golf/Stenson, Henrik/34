Q. A day in which you played some sparkling golf.  You must feel that's deserved this afternoon?
JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously when you go out against the world's best players on the other side, you deserve nothing.  You are to earn every point.  Nothing is given out there.  For me to come out and play with Henrik, someone I've had a lot of success with on the golf course is the perfect scenario for me, like you said, to top off this morning.
Q. Does this feel like a big scalp for you?
HENRIK STENSON: It's always nice when you take down two players like Rickie and Dustin, but the whole American Team has some heavy players.  Every point is hard to get and we're just very delighted to get this one home.
Q. Feels like a momentum-swinging afternoon.
JUSTIN ROSE: Unbelievable, yeah.  I don't quite know what the other scores are.  I know Sergio is heavily up with Alex Noren and the other match might be 3-up, as well.  So hopefully they will finish up here shortly which will be great for the team to recover and fresh legs in the morning.  That was obviously our goal was to try to finish the match as soon as you can because after a long day of 36 holes, you want to play as little golf as possible.
