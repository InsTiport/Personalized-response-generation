   HENRIK STENSON: We've had a great time all week. We played fantastic today. Obviously, to go out and shoot that score. We felt like we could have a chance if we got going, and we did. I haven't had a win so far this year, and I got one now, so I'm very pleased with that. And Robert can stack it up with all of the other ones he has already. 

 Q. Seeing the 63 Spain shot on Friday, that was pretty special; did you use that? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: We thought it might be our turn today. 
 We knew we needed to play better than yesterday. 

 Q. You've had a great season, so must be nice coming in the end. 
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm starting to run out of tournaments here. It's nice to get a win. 

 Q. You've both played Ryder Cup, it must be special to win for Sweden.
