Q. What do you make of a 68 to start?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm pretty pleased with that.  The rough is really thick here this year and a lot of emphasis on hitting fairways and greens, and I think I did that.  I think I hit all fairways on the par 5s and hit them all in two and 2-putted them.  That's where I made most of my score today.
Wasn't really in trouble many times, other than a missed wedge on 10 that left a really difficult 2-putt and I 3-putted that one.
Probably made a 12-footer on the second for birdie and that was pretty much it.  Good pace on the greens.   Didn't leave me too much work.  They get a bit trodded up in the afternoon here.  They have been very soft due to all the rain.
So you don't really want to stand over too many four- or five-footers and my playing partners then missed a couple of those.  I was fortunate enough I think to make most of them, and I had good pace on my long putting.  Not too much stress out there today.
Q. I imagine with the breeze picking up, that was welcome in the heat, but did that make a difference to the way the course played, as well?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's always a bit tricky to get your irons spot on when the breeze is on.  I think it went from probably half a club to just a little bit more, a club and a half, something like that.  It was a little tricky at times but I think I managed pretty well.
Q. Physically, managing that pretty well?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's okay.  I can feel my right knee a little bit but it's hopefully nothing bad.  I hope it's kind of settled in.  Otherwise, eventually I will have to have another MRI to see if I made some damage to it.  I hope not, but so far, so good.
