Q. Final round, your thoughts?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm very happy with the week and the way I played in general.  I came here looking for a bit of form and some answers, and I think I got a lot of them.  Still a work-in-progress.
I wouldn't say I'm playing my best, but I hit a lot of good shots and kept it together, tidy, in tough conditions both yesterday and today.  The good stuff's really good and there's still a few things that we can improve on, but all in all, I'm very happy with the way I played.  We came very close.  We were right up in contention and that's where we want to be.
Q. Obviously the Race to Dubai, how much strength can you take from this week going into the rest of the season?
HENRIK STENSON: I think I picked up some clarity on a few things with Pete, my coach, and you know, I'm going to keep on working away on those.  Most of the short game and putting felt good this week.
So yeah, it was a nice way to start this four-week trip and hopefully we can carry on this momentum in the next three weeks.
Q. Obviously conditions worsened day by day.  How were they out there today?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it was tough.  That wind was blowing hard, and as you can see -- as you know, on this golf course if you hit the wrong shot at the wrong time, it's going to penalise you.  Certainly it penalised DJ a number of times today.  That's why he came back to the rest of us.
I mean, I played pretty strong and then I hit one bad shot with possibly the wrong club, as well, on 17.  That kind of ended my chances to win the golf tournament.  But I'm not going to let that spoil all the positives, so very pleased.
