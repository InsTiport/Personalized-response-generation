 Q.  You've won at East Lake once before.  You've got to feel pretty good about your chances.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm happy with that.  This week proved to be better than I expected.  When I came here two years ago I didn't feel like it was a golf course that really suited my game.  But it played a little bit tougher on a few occasions, as well, and I surprised myself and managed to throw in a really low score in the second day.  I'm very pleased with the way the week progressed for me, and main goal was to stay in the top 5, and I managed to do that.   
I had my own little fight with Bubba.  I knew I had a two-shot advantage over him, and we were really tight on the points, so if I could keep him behind, I would stay in that fourth position the way it was looking.  He got really on fire.  He was 7-under through 13 for his round, and 13-under in total, so I was really trying hard to catch him, and he must have dropped one coming back home somewhere, and I managed to pick up a few, so I tied him.  So I'm still in that fourth position.  As we know at East Lake, even if you don't win, it's always better to be fourth and fifth, and those points can prove crucial in the end.  Again, very pleased to be top 5 heading in there and looking forward to next week.   
 Q.  The fact that you've won there before, you've won a FedExCup there before, do you think that gives you a little bit of an edge over the other guys?  
HENRIK STENSON: Coming in there undefeated, one for one?  I just know it's a golf course I really enjoy playing.  It's Bermuda, and that really gives you a good advantage if you hit a lot of fairways and greens, and that's obviously what I did in '13.  We'll see if I can bring a solid long game that sets up nicely for the week, and then it's down to how well you chip and putt.  All in all, I'm happy pretty with my game, and yeah, we'll see.  We're at the races and happy to be there, and a lot of things can happen.  It's going to be an exciting week.
