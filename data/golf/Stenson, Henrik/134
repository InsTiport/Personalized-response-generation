HENRIK STENSON: Not much to comment on.  I haven't hit a shot.
Q. Is that a benefit?
HENRIK STENSON: Well, I think -- I mean, I got to move around a little bit.  I did my warm-up and just when I was about ready to go, they called it for thunder and then unfortunately we couldn't resume today.  So it's going to be a long day tomorrow, and I mean, I don't know if it's a benefit or not, not having started.  Every hole I didn't play today, so I'm going to play that tomorrow.  But it's the same for everyone in the last group.
So just hope we can get as much golf as possible in tomorrow.
Q. What's kind of the mind-set going in, knowing tomorrow is going to be a long day, especially since you've played a lot of golf lately?
HENRIK STENSON: You've just got to get some good sleep and make sure you eat enough and drink enough, plenty during the day, because it will be a long day.  It's normally the mind that gives up before the body.  If you're getting fatigued or tired, it's normally the head that gets tired.  The body is normally fine to play two rounds of golf.  You've just got to make sure you have plenty of energy and plenty of sleep, and, yeah, one shot at a time and one hole at a time.
