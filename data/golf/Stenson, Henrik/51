 Q.  Overall takeaways from the week?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I think there's a lot of positives.  Obviously it's always disappointing not to win when you got a chance, but I think there's not much to do against Rory McIlroy Roy shooting 64 on a final round on this golf course.  It's certainly tricky enough out there at times and he just played too good, I think, to have anything to let us have a chance to make that many birdies coming in.  So, yeah, I left a few shots out there, for sure, but it happens and I take more positives than negatives, obviously.  I got the pace wrong on a couple of putts and whipped it by on 15 and I left it short on 16.  They're very slick and undulated and when you get the grain slightly wrong, you're going to look a little bit of a fool at times.  It's very shiny around the hole and you got to get the pace right and I was off on a couple of them.  I was a little bit deflated when I 3-putted 16 from fairly short range and then was kind of limping in from there on.   
 Q.  Coming off of the missing the cut last week at the Valspar, what changed to get you to where you were this week?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, my putting was really good this week.  I did some work on that early this week and then there's been long-term progress on the long game, really.  I haven't felt comfortable with my swing and my long shots for quite some time and it's starting to come along in the right direction for sure.  I hit a lot of good shots out there this week, even though maybe the confidence is not as high as some of the shots were, so we'll keep on working on that and it's a good time of the year to start playing well.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the state of golf right now with some big names, Tiger obviously playing well, heading into the Masters.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's exciting.  I'm sure this was an exciting tournament to watch and every credit to Rory for finishing it off the way he did and I gave it as good as I could, but I don't think I would have had a 66 in me today, given the way I played, so we might as well save that one for another time.
