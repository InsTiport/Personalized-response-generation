Q. How would you assess your round out there?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm doing a lot of things good, but the long game is not where I need to have it. Today it was a challenge to climb up the leaderboard and that was kind of the sad let down this week, too many unforced errors earlier, didn't really feel like I hit that many poor shots today, but I'm just not quite getting it close enough and I can't challenge off the tee the way I would have liked to either. So I'm playing my way around this golf course in a pretty smart and good way, short game and putting is pretty good and I'll keep on fighting. I made a lot of par saves when I had to and I'm just not making enough birdies to challenge the best.

Q. How much different was the course today than the first two days?
HENRIK STENSON: It was a big difference. I played late yesterday afternoon and the greens were getting firm and crispy and quick and this rain definitely softened them up and you could be more aggressive. Sometimes I think spinning back was more of an issue than holding it, like it's been some earlier in the week. So, yeah, it was definitely some low scores out there today and you could see that both from Jon Rahm and Rickie and a few others, they got it going. Rory played great, he got a couple of good breaks today as well, and that birdie on the last I guess definitely puts him in the, within an arms reach of Patrick here, depending upon what happens on the last. 

Q. Do you feel like if you can get some of those little things squared away, do you think you have a low one in you tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON: If everything goes my way, possibly, but not really. I mean, I feel like I'm going to go out and try and finish with a solid round tomorrow, hopefully, and I think I'm a bit too far back, but we're going to come here tomorrow and keep on trying.
