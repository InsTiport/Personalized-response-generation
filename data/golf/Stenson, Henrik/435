 Q.  That was a hell of a match. 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Never experienced anything like it, not when I come out on top at least.  Both of us just played solid today I'd say.  I was a couple down early and managed to turn it around there with the birdies on 9, 10, 11 to go 1-up, then he got back on 12. 
 I hit probably one of the few bad shots I hit all day second shot from middle of the fairway on 13, and he got up-and-down and I three-putted from long-range. 
 Made a good birdie putt on 15 to go all square again, and then ended up with a slight right to left downhiller on 16, hit a decent putt, and it just slid away a little bit.  Hit a poor second putt, missed -- went 1-down again. 
 17, he sort of made a blunder, was in the bunker, and I gave myself a good birdie chance.  Missed that and he missed his par putt.  All square coming down the last.  I hit a really bad drive into the shit and had to take a drop. 
 He laid up or got a second shot just short of the green, and I just took dead aim with pitching wedge and hit a really good shot from the position I was in.  He hit a good chip and just missed from four or five feet, four feet. 
 I don't know, exhausted. 

 Q.  A bit of a roller coaster out there? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Definitely.  I mean, as I said, we both played good and it was a good match.  It's just when you're back and forth -- I was hoping at least I'd get a chance on extra holes. 

 Q.  But you didn't give up after that drive.  It was in a horrible spot there. 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, it was just under a bush, yeah.  It just shows you, you never give up.
