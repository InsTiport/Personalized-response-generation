Q. 5-under, your thoughts on that?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm pleased with that.  It was a good back nine.  Happy to get the round finished.  We had to rush a little bit here to get on 18 and hit it on the green in two, which is nice.  Then we just tried to get that down in two.  It's hard with the pace in the dark, and hit it about four and a half feet by, so I had a little tester coming back.  But a nice putt and closed out the day nicely.
Q. You must be quite happy with how solid it's been.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's been really good when it's been on, and then there's been some very poor shots in between.  But I managed to save myself a lot.
Putting has been solid.  The greens, there's not a lot of undulation on them, but we have that grain going, so you can have a 15-footer and the grain is going in two or three different directions.  Normally it's hard enough to read the greens and start the ball on line, and then you have to figure those things out, too.
Very pleased with the way I rolled it for the three rounds, and I hope I can keep on doing that tomorrow.
Q. In the final group tomorrow; I guess that's right where you want to be.
HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely.  Certainly if I'm coming in two or three behind Sergio, something like that, that's where you want to be, and try and apply some pressure on the front nine.  Anytime you can be within a couple shots heading into the back nine, you can make it happen.  Yeah, I'm very pleased with the day's work.
