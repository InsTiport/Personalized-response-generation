 Q.  How good was that?  
HENRIK STENSON: It was a sweet putt to make on the last.  Probably felt like I was playing better on the front nine yesterday than what I did today, but today I kept it going all the way to the end.  Made some great putts for birdies, some good saves.  It was not a bogey on the scorecard.  So nice way to finish with a bogey-free 65.   
 Q.  I appreciate the leader was so far in advance, but did you set yourself a target, got to finish second here?  
HENRIK STENSON: I'm chasing Danny on The Race to Dubai, and so is Rory, and so I could see Rory was going at it.  So I just tried to keep up and it was nice to sneak that one in the last to go one ahead of him.   
 Q.  It's significant, isn't it, so actually move right up there on The Race to Dubai with the events that are remaining.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's going to be tight all the way to the end, and that's the way we like it.  It would be nice to go into the last one knowing that if you win in Dubai, you win the overall.   
Yeah, I'm going to try and put some more good golf out there and some more birdies.   
 Q.  And there's plenty of good golf, isn't there, so many positives about your game?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, especially the putting I would say this week.  I shot some great scores on the weekend but I was putting solid all week, made some great putts here and there.   
Back home to Orlando, do a bit of work with Pete and then hopefully I can just carry on for the final two weeks.
