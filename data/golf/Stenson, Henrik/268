 Q.   5‑under par,71 today, how did it go out there?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, actually I felt I played a lot better today than yesterday.   The conditions were tougher, and a little bit disappointed with the score.   But I'm happy with a lot of myself.   I hit some good shots.   Definitely better‑ball striking today than yesterday, so made a few putts, but the greens were a little bit bumpier in the afternoon and it was tough to make those good birdie chances I had coming in.   
Then disappointing bogey on 17 and good par save after hitting it in the water on 18.   But you have to go for it when you have a decent number, but I didn't catch that 3‑wood, so it was always going to be wet.  
   
 Q.   You haven't played here since 2010.   Is it good to be back and playing the way you are playing?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I love the atmosphere.   It's a lot of familiar faces and it always feels good to come back here.   Whether the course suits me, that's a different story, but I certainly made a bit of a change and managed to turn it around so far this year, but in the past I haven't really done much good.   I'm here looking to improve on that.  
   
 Q.   Obviously a lot of people are talking about the possibility of you going to world No. 1 this week; is that on your mind, is that extra pressure, or not?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Of course it's a little bit on my mind; if everyone keeps on asking me the question, it's going to be hard not to have it on your mind.   
I know the recipe to get there would be to try to play good golf and focus on the things out there, so that's what I'm trying to do.   I was quite pleased with the way I played today.   Just didn't quite get it going but still two days to go.
