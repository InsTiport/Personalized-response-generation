Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I felt that way.  Of course it was not the afternoon, evening that we wanted yesterday, to get the news.  I was still out here getting physio treatment.  And, yeah, it was kind of surreal and to find out that my suitcase and all my clothes were gone, that was a bit weird.  And I still had some dirty laundry in another bag, so I managed to wash some of that up.  Boss provided some other stuff.  And yeah, we can keep on going, obviously.  But it's not happy news, is it?
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: Not that I'm aware of.  I'll be out there looking tonight (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I think it was anger from the word go.  I was also happy that my family wasn't there, and maybe a little disappointed I wasn't.  But what can you do?  I think over time I've been quite lucky with those kind of situations.  So I guess sooner or later, there's always a chance it might happen.  And unfortunately it did.  And it was this week.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: Well, I was more yesterday.  I wasn't looking forward to having four hours of semi-chaotic and police running around the house, and having to go out.  Had been out there a long day.  Would rather just go back and wind down and take it easy.  That was all I was looking forward to and that didn't happen.  I had to get some new gear and so on.  But all in all we're in good shape.  And nothing happened to any person, which is the main thing.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: Actually they missed my carryon, so I still have my stuff.  If they're listening, they didn't get the full jackpot, but they got obviously a lot of valuables, watches and other things.  But they were clearly targeting me, because they were there when I was out playing, and they figured out that the house was empty when I was away, and they stole all my gear.  Normally I don't think burglars would take clothes.  That doesn't feel like the normal kind of thing that you would take.  But all my gear is gone.  If you see people Bossed up in this way, feel free to ask what they were doing between 12 and 4 yesterday.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: There's many different ways, I think.  Obviously I had a car this week with The Open logo.  I took pictures with some people that obviously I don't suspect in any way, but you know how social media works, if someone takes a picture in front of the house, it might be tagged where the picture was taken, and someone puts one and one together, so there's many, many different reasons or ways it could have happened.  I don't know, I just know that I don't believe in a coincidence that it was just a normal burglary, and it just happened to be my house for the week at the same time I was out playing.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I think it will make me a little bit cautious of a few things going forward, yes.
