Q.  It was a good win?
HENRIK STENSON:  Absolutely, I'm very pleased bouncing back after a shocking weekend last week.  I was hanging in there.  Paul played good.  And we both played pretty good today.  It was a good match, I think.  And I just tried take stay two behind.  I was 2 down after the turn, so try to stay within the striking distance.

And he missed another great up and down on 13, where he missed    got bogey there.  And I got one back on the next, as well.  It was even after 14.  And then struggled a little bit off the tee on 15 and got away with a halve and then a good shot on 16 and knocked it in, took the lead.  And then again misread the wind a bit on 17 and got in the back left bunker and just scrambled it, really.  Made it from six or seven feet for the par and the halve, and stayed 1 up.  I hit a great 3 wood on the 18.  But again he bounced back from the tough lie and I just misread the pace and under hit it quite a bit.  So I left myself a long birdie putt and missed that one and he missed his.

I'm very pleased with the outcome and the way with I hung in there and bounced back from last week.
Q.  Of course in match play
HENRIK STENSON:  Especially in the beginning it was    I drained it from 30 feet on the first, and he hit it pretty close.  And you feel like something that's a six foot, then all of a sudden you've got a bit longer one.  I had a good shot on 2 and he hit it to a foot with a 4 iron.  So he was all of 1  or 2 up on the front nine all along there.  And I was very happy that I could catch him on the back nine.
Q.  You've played a lot of match play recently?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I think that definitely helps.
Q.  You know the main things you need to do?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah.  You're coming up the last couple of holes, and for some reason, whether both players are playing bad or good, it always seems to go to 17 or 18.  It's always tight finishes.
Q.  It's slightly different from stroke play.  It's the same pressures, but
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, you could say, coming up the last holes there, it's like when you're right up in the mix in the regular stroke play tournaments.  So you get that pressure every day and in each match.  Of course you can play really, really well and all of a sudden Paul is 4 under through 9 and I was 2 under.  Normal stroke play you wouldn't be unhappy to be 2 under and cruising along.  But you feel you need to put a little gas on it and try to make some more birdies.
Q.  Any thought for tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON:  No, I'm just very pleased to get through this first round and then bouncing back from last week.  It's a new match tomorrow and try to prepare and be hungry tomorrow.
