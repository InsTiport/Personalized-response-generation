Q. Justin, you were sent out first to build on the late momentum that Francesco and Tommy provided with winning their match late on.  How does it feel to do just that?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah.  I had a little chat with Rory in the team room.  I had that quick 30-minute turnaround.  It was a tough loss this morning, maybe a game we could have won.  So to turn it around was important.
Bumping into my partner on the way out, Henrik and I have had great vibes in this event.  So to rekindle that was the perfect thing for me this afternoon.  And Rory gave us -- he said to me, come on, put some blue on the board, give me something to chase or give me and Poulter something to chase.
Q. Henrik, how does it feel to have 50,000 people willing every putt you hit into the hole?
HENRIK STENSON: Good.  No, the atmosphere is fantastic.  It's what makes the Ryder Cup.  Obviously for us playing at home, we got the full support, and it's a joy to be out there.
