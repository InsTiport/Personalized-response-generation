 Q.  69, happy with that?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, pretty pleased.  I started off the day with a bogey and I came back with a couple of nice birdies.  You know, it's a bit of a mixed bag with the long game.   
I've got a few things I'm working on and not really firing on all cylinders.  Still hitting a number of nice shots out there and I guess the part I've been the most happy with is the putting grip.  I've been putting solid both days and made my fair share I think.  So that's kind of what keeps the scores together.   
 Q.  You said in the preview, you haven't played in five weeks.  Happy with the score so far?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I think so.  With a five-week break, I mean, I practiced some and played some before I came out here, but practise and playing social rounds is different from tournament game.   
Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with the first two days, for sure, and see if we can keep on heading in the right direction.   
 Q.  An unlucky break on the fifth, hitting the flag.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it was actually on the fourth, Jason hit just left of the pip and hit a sprinkler and bounced 30, 40 yards into the water had a ready Saturday.   
On the next, I flew my second shot straight into the pin.  I guess I didn't deserve to get that birdie putt.  I had a really tricky birdie putt instead of maybe a fairly easy one, but that's the way it goes.   
I think I had a lucky break on the back nine on -- I can't remember which hole -- 11, and I had a really lucky bounce and ended up making birdie.  So I guess it all evens out in the long run.   
 Q.  All in all, happy with the position you're in?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I don't even know where I'm at, but I'm just trying to focus on my game and play as well as I can, and so far, so good.
