 Q. Can you talk about where you stand going into tomorrow? I know the finish wasn't what you wanted but are you pleased with where you stand?
 HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely. I'm still in pretty good shape and as I said, I would have liked to finish a bit better. And that's just the nature of the golf course. You get a bad lie and you didn't hit the it way you want to. I ended up dropping that one on 16 there from a semi-plugged lie from the bunker. It's just one of them times when one can get away from you.
 17 I hit a good shot and was a little too heavy with the putter, even though I was very light with it, and hit it five feet by and missed the one coming out. I bogeyed those two. 
 And the rest I'm very pleased with and still you've got to have tons of patience out there, and you have to accept the bad breaks as well. If I had my bad breaks on 16 and 17 today I can hopefully finish a bit better tomorrow.

 Q. Is it more disturbing, because you hit good shots into 17 and 18?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, as I said yesterday it was going to be tough to get close to the pins today. Of course the one on 17, it's almost like you wonder why the ball didn't roll back down to the hole if you just start it and it goes five feet by, it shouldn't ever stop then, it should come back off the bank in the first place almost. But it's one of them -- I guess you learn something new every day, don't you? 

 Q. Could you feel the course getting more difficult as you're going through the back nine?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'd say so. The greens are quick and firming up and possibly in the afternoon you get a little bit more grain on them. And there's a lot of tricky putts out there. And I was still putting pretty good and had quite a few long attempts that just knocked by. I could have easily made a few more earlier in the round. And then obviously a little better finish, and it would have been a happy days, but I'm still quite pleased.

 Q. You've had some success here in the limited time you've been here, what would you attribute that to and do you think that helps you at all tomorrow?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I like the golf course. I like the design. And obviously it fits my eye pretty good. And I hit a lot of 3-woods around here to put the ball in play, and also to shape it right-to-left, kind of comes in handy on quite a few holes. It's just a golf course I feel happy playing and I've done well here.

 Q. You've also had experience and success fending off Tiger in Dubai in '07. If he makes a charge tomorrow how will that experience help you knowing that you've been able to withstand that?
 HENRIK STENSON: If you won tournaments where he's been in the field that's always pleasing and makes it even better. I've played a lot with him and I'm sure he's going to come firing on all cylinders tomorrow like he always does on Sunday when he has a chance to win. The key is just to stick to your own game and hopefully play better than he does.

 Q. Does getting into the final pairing matter, was that on your mind at all coming in the last couple of holes?
 HENRIK STENSON: No, I'm just trying to play one shot at a time and finish as well as I could. It's like I've had questions in the past if I preferred to be in front or one back, and I always prefer to be one ahead than having to make up rounds. So I try to press on.

 Q. As difficult as this golf course is playing and assuming that it plays just as difficult tomorrow, do you think you have to shoot anything better than even par?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I think so. I think a couple under, at least. I don't know how many -- it's always hard to know how much the breeze is going to be and so on. But it all depends on how everybody finishes up today, as well. From where I am I definitely see myself having to shoot under par tomorrow to have a chance to win.
