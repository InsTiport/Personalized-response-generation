 Q.  Nice start. 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, it's definitely something to build on.  I would like to be I guess 5-under or I dropped a shot on 7 there, 3-putted from long range. 
 So I guess that was the only bogey on the card today.  I didn't play extremely, extremely well but I sort of kept it in play and gave myself a few chances.  Hit a couple of good shots close.  So yeah, it was pretty solid round, solid opening round. 

 Q.  Some quite tough pins out there in places? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  A few holes.  The greens are much, much quicker and smoother than the last few weeks, so, you know, when you've got longer putts, it's a little bit tougher to get the pace right I think.  But I much more prefer these ones.  It's probably as good as we've seen them at the Classic. 

 Q.  Did you put better than what you did last week? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  I was putting better today.  I had one on 5 and 8 from good range, almost made both of them.  Except for those, no, it was just the 3-putt on 7.  It was pretty solid on the greens and I kept the ball in play most of the day. 

 Q.  Are you happy with the way you hit the ball today? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, pretty much.  It can always be better but overall it was, yeah, pretty solid and not too much to complain about. 

 Q.  How do you tackle the 18th? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  I just try to hit a 3-wood on the left-hand side a little bit, I pushed a fraction today and just gave me a little bit too long on the second shots, I just laid up and unfortunately the bad wedge in there. 
 But I think I will play that one a bit more defensive instead of trying to whip it around the corner, just try and hit a good 3-wood.  And if that sets me up for another 3-wood or a rescue that would be fine.  Otherwise I'll just lay up.  Pitching seems to be pretty good. 

 Q.  And family is watching this week? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yes, family is out there and a few friends.  You know, I seem to have picked up a few more friends and supporters here in Dubai, so it's always nice when they are out watching. 
 Ten rounds a year, compared to some other places, I get more practise on this tournament course.  It's good to have a bit of local knowledge and that always helps. 

 Q.  Nice having a tournament where you can stay in your own bed? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, definitely, to be three minutes away, that certainly is something you wouldn't mind doing.
