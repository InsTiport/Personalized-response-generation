  HENRIK STENSON:   I mean, I'm mixing some really good stuff with some poor stuff and making some nice putts and some great saves.   It's a bit of a mixed bag, but it's great to be out there on Saturday afternoon playing in front of these crowds.   Every time you kind of hit a good shot, you get the response.   So it's a great atmosphere out there and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   You've been able to dig yourself out of trouble in the last three days.   Is that a comfortable feeling to know that you can go out there and have a bad hole or two and then come back and find some strokes back?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I'm not worried that the wheels are going to come off tomorrow because they have been off so many times already.   It's just fun to go out and try and make birdies and save myself out of impossible situations when they occur.   I'll have a good time tomorrow.

Q.   Do you look forward to doing at your final shot at 18 tomorrow? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, I mean I'm going to try to stay patient in the beginning.   If you are within three or four shots entering the back nine, you are always going to have a chance.   We'll see if we need to start take more chances.   But I can only do the best I can with whatever game I have.   If it's enough, it's enough.   But the way Peter and a few of the other guys are playing, it's going to be a tough day to beat them tomorrow.

Q.   Do your emotions generally stay the same when you are having some success, some trouble or do you have to try to keep your emotions in check out there? 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, absolutely.   I'd be lying if I said they were the same.   It's definitely a little bit of a roller coaster sometimes.   At this course I have got to try and stay very patient and not lose your head when you are making an easy mistake or two.   That kind of happens to everybody around here.   So I've had a bit of that already this week.   So hopefully I can stay away from most of that tomorrow.

Q.   In you could comment in Swedish on your position going into tomorrow. 
HENRIK STENSON:   (In Swedish.)
