HENRIK STENSON:  It's been a tough day for everybody out there, with the course being that firm and tough pins the last day, it's just    it's such a battle, and very I'm happy.  I made some important putts, and especially the one on the 18, off the fringe, after missing the tee shot.  So it was worth a few points rolling that one in.
Q.  Are you playing next week?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, playing BellSouth and then The Masters, yeah.
Q.  You have to like your game as you head towards The Masters?
HENRIK STENSON:  It's been a struggle all week for me, tee to green.  I'm just going to try to improve on that next week.  But this whole week comes down to attitude and the fighting and the grinding.  It's been    the mental side has been world class.  I couldn't have managed my shots better at all.  I fought hard out there and I got my reward with this good finish and it all comes down to fighting spirit, I would say.
Q.  Being on such a big stage in golf, in one of the last few groups, you have to be pretty proud of the way you played?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, especially to hold it together when you're not feeling good, you know.  It's one thing being out last and you're playing great when everything is running for you.  But when you're struggling on every shot to try to hit it where you want to, it's an effort and I'm very happy with that.
