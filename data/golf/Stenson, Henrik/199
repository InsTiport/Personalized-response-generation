Q.   Battled and got the victory today.   What was the biggest key for you today?
HENRIK STENSON:   I putted better.   I played surprisingly well yesterday.   I hit a lot of good shots yesterday and I should have won that one.   It was really sloppy on my end to not close out the match.   I had a six, seven footer on 17 to win the match, missed that one.   I couldn't get up and down to halve the last to take that.   And I thought it was half games, I hadn't read the papers carefully.   It's all kind of coming out a bit flat.   I think they try to get something going here with the change.   But now in my group we're all done, except John has already gone through, with two wins, he's got himself through today.   So no one has anything to play for tomorrow. 

Q.   How do you approach tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, I take it as a glorified practice round, I guess. 

Q.   We talked earlier in the week and you mentioned the fact that you've been sick and lost a bunch of weight.   Do you feel the strength in your game improving now?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, it's coming along.   I'm starting to feel better.   The good thing is I can be in the gym on Saturday now and start building myself up again and my golf game feels pretty good given how little ‑‑ I've virtually practiced nothing for a month now, just managed to scrape by at Augusta and then I've been sick three out of those four weeks. 
All in all I'm actually pretty happy where I'm at.   And I've got something to build on and hopefully I can come game ready at Sawgrass next week.
