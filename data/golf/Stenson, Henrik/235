 Q.  You've missed the last two Ryder Cups; good to be back?  HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely.  What a great week it's been, coming through and playing well here.  Some of the guys did some amazing jobs today.  G-Mac turning his match around and Jamie winning his match here and winning The Ryder Cup for us.  It's been a great week, and really, really proud of our team and it's been a fun week.   Q.  Obviously you did particularly well up until today, missed the putt on the last, which I'm sure disappointed you, but talk about the week in general how you gelled together and became unbeatable.  HENRIK STENSON: We had some good chemistry going and great playing going, as well.  It was a fantastic week and a really nice partnership that we can hopefully bring on in two years' time again if we both make it there. That was fantastic, and then yeah, of course it's disappointing, you always reflect on what happened just recently, and I really wanted to win my singles match today, or at least get a halve.  Stings to miss a 4-footer on the last and lose the match, ^ but the important thing is we won The Ryder Cup and it stays in European hands.   Q.  A word for the fans?  HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, they have been brilliant; thanks a lot, from the bottom of our hearts, it's been amazing to play in front of our home crowds like this.  Excellent.   Q.  How good is the party going to be?  HENRIK STENSON: I think it's going to be pretty good.
