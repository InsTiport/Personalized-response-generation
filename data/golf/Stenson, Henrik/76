Q. A 72, how was your day?
HENRIK STENSON: I think it was the most fun I've had on the course for a long time.  I actually felt like I had the potential to hit a lot of good shots.  It hasn't felt like that for quite a while, so I'll take the positives out of that.
I created quite a lot of chances, and yeah, I didn't get the putts to drop today, which is always frustrating.  Then kind of rolled the dice a little bit on 16 trying to drive that one, and ended up in a bad spot and made five.  Yeah, things weren't going our way.
Q. Not saying that you are not on top of your game by any means, but could you identify a particular problem?
HENRIK STENSON: Well, the long game hasn't felt good for a long time.  Even though my so-so is never that bad, but I know how good it can be.  So if you have a high level, you always want to try and be there, and when it's not, it doesn't feel 100 percent.  So we're working on some things, and like I said today, it actually felt better even though I didn't get the result that I wanted.
