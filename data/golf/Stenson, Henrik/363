 Q. Where is your game at at the moment?
 HENRIK STENSON: Double C, hopefully moving in the B direction. 

 Q. What positives can you take?
 HENRIK STENSON: Well, a lot of good pitches and putts. 

 Q. What was today like, after you've grinded and grinded and grinded? 
 HENRIK STENSON: Pretty pleased with knowing this was going to be the last couple hours at the course, and as I said, it's been a long week for everybody. I can only imagine how hard the green keeping staff have worked, endless hours and middle of the night to keep this course playable, given the amount of rain that they had. 
 It's been a tough week for all the volunteers and the players and caddies and officials, so I think the end of the day, everybody is going to be happy that we got it around. You know, somebody is going to walk away with the trophy being very happy. 
 Overall, it might not go down as the greatest championship in history given the conditions we played under, but we got it through. 
 I'm heading straight to Munich in Germany in a couple of hours from JFK, so I've got a Junior Pro-Am tomorrow afternoon and Pro-Am Wednesday and we go again, and it's all down for a rainy forecast, so it's happy days. 

 Q. Are you going to hold up well? You probably could use the rest. 
 HENRIK STENSON: I've got two weeks off after that, so I'll try to make it through another wet week in Germany in the sense of lots of rain, and then I get some rest before the British Open. So hopefully I'll be back fresh for the next major championship.
