  HENRIK STENSON:   I think it was a very interesting playoff.   All of us were kind of happy to be there.   I didn't have a good start to the round and all of a sudden I picked up I think five shots.   So five shots in four holes, and it got very much interesting all at once.   So happy with that.   
A couple of close breaks, lipout on 15 in regulation, good par save on 16, and then almost holed a bunker shot on 17 and hit a great putt in regulation on 18.   I thought it was in, just hang up on the high side, hit not a good one on the first playoff hole.   Thought that one was going to have a good chance to go in, as well, and then I learned from my first read on the fourth extra hole or whatever it was and made a long putt when they hit it close.  
On 17, with that setup you just take your chances.   Hit a pretty decent 3â€‘wood but it was two, three yards too far right and went down the hill into the water.   Sad part is when you shave a bank like that, the only lie you get, the ball sticks.   It was like sitting down in a hole, so I didn't have much of a chance to make good contact if I still wanted to get it to the hole.   
So I took my chances, thinned it a little bit and that was the end of that.   
   
 Q.   Lovely sporting thing to do to make the concession.   
HENRIK STENSON:   No, absolutely.   He hit some good shots and all four of us, I don't think anybody expected to be in a playoff, so I think we were all pretty happy with that.   You know, just obviously you always want to win, but I can't say I'm too disappointed with that.   I'm only disappointed with the bank on 17 really.
