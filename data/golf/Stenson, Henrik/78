 Q.  On top of the leaderboard at the BMW.  How does it feel?  
HENRIK STENSON: It's a pretty tricky day I would say.  We have pretty strong, gusty winds out there now and the pin positions on a few holes are a lot tougher than yesterday.  So I think the course plays a whole lot tougher.   
And I'm not on top of my game by any means but I think it was a good kind of professional fighting display and we kept it pretty tidy, anyway, and made a couple of birdies when we had the chances and didn't drop too many.  You don't have to be ashamed of 3-under I guess around here.   
 Q.  A few good sort of mid-range par putts today, which kept the momentum going, I'm sure.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I managed to make those.  Not too many of the birdie putts.  Made one or two.  The greens are a little slower and sometimes you're not quite getting there.  Every time you feel like you want to try and force it, you seem to hit it four or five feet past.  You don't want to be standing over those all day because you're going to miss one or two then for sure.  But I managed to stay away from that, and like I said, kept it fairly tidy despite not playing my best.   
 Q.  What were conditions like out there today?  
HENRIK STENSON: It's tricky with the breeze.  I mean, it was windy early on, as well.  Not as much as it is now but I guess with kind of the storms moving around in the area, it whips it up a little bit and the pin positions on 12, 16 and a few others are really tricky and you're going to see some disasters around there I think when you get it slightly wrong and the wind grabs it.  It's very easy to hit it in the water on 12 and 16 today.
