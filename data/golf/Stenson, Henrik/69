HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it was certainly a tougher day again.  I think most of the good scoring today would have come fairly early in the day.  And it was a day where you feel like you want to go out and make birdies like you made yesterday in the good conditions, but the wind picked up as we went on and the pin positions are certainly tougher today.  So whenever you're out of position, it's easy to make mistakes.  I made a few on the front nine and they cost me.
I hit the turn at 3-over.  And I had to dig really deep to make a couple of birdies coming home, and kind of get the day back in order.  I don't think level par is a bad score, but it cost me with a bad start.  That kind of cost me.  I was always fighting to come back.  And it would have been nice to be a couple of shots better, for sure.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: It's been great.  The crowds have been amazing.  The reception over the last couple of days, walking up basically to every green and down every fairway has been amazing.  They certainly didn't forget what we did last year.  So for me, together with the Ryder Cup, it's the best feeling to play golf in front of these fans and get their appreciation.  So it's been a great week.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I'm going to enjoy the last week of summer back in Sweden or whatever the weather might bring us.  But going to have some time with family and friends, and that will be the last days I spend in Sweden until next summer.
So heading into the Akron, got some work to do there.  And I'm changing my setup with irons and wedges.  So it's going to be a week of trying to get into that before the PGA.  It's a work in progress.  There have been some highlights throughout the week, I'd say, and especially the way I played and putted yesterday.  So there's certainly some positives to bring, even though I didn't feel like overall I played my best.  But I haven't done that for a while.  So we keep on working away.
Q. (Inaudible.)
HENRIK STENSON: I'm going to four wedges.  I haven't had -- I got a new set of irons kind of gradually lofted to make -- to bridge those gaps and I'm putting four wedges in instead of three.  I only tried it briefly once before, but I feel like I want to give it a proper go and it's obviously going to give me a little bigger gaps between the other irons.  So I've got some work to do on the TrackMan there.
