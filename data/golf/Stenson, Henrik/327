Q.   Henrik, 5‑under par 67 in round 2.   Are you happy with that?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah.   I'm pretty pleased.   I mean it had the makings of an even better round.   Last year I think I shot 8‑under on the Palm Course in the second round.   And made a nice birdie on 9 to make the turn on 4‑under and had a great birdie putt on 10 that just knocked by, and then hit a good tee ball that ended up in a divot on 11 and followed that up by bogey on 12. 
So 10, 11 there could have been a couple of birdies, and that's the way it goes sometimes.   I didn't feel I had the best of breaks those couple of holes, but then I made three straight birdies 14, 15, 16.   So pretty pleased with it overall.

Q.   The Palm generally plays a little easier than Magnolia.   Were the conditions right today for scoring?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah.   I think so.   We probably had about a club of wind, something like that.   So it's playing fairly easy out there.   And the par‑5s are easier on the Palm.   So you should pick up a couple shots compared to Magnolia. 
And I played my first this event last year.   And I kind of expected both courses maybe to be a lot of birdie opportunities, but there's definitely a couple of par‑4s at Magnolia that can come up and bite you.   So I will go two rounds there at the weekend, and if you can stay away from trouble on those ones, yeah, it's a wide‑open tournament, I think.

Q.   You can turn this into a pretty good year with two good rounds Saturday and Sunday.   How are you approaching?
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, absolutely.   It's definitely been an improvement this year.   I've played reasonably well both over here and in Europe.   It's hard when you've got dual membership and only playing a minimum amount of tournaments on both tours to end up in the top.   So I'm pretty pleased so far, and keep on working away, and seems like I'm playing better and better.   So I hope to finish off the year in good standing.
