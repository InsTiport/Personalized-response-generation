  First Round 67 (-5)

 SCOTT CROCKETT: Henrik, thanks for coming down and joining us. A round of 5-under par to start. Just give us your thoughts on that.
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, very happy with the start. I'm just happy to be here. I was I think the last player to be in the tournament at the close of entry, so not like other years I've been exempt a bit earlier than this year. So happy to be here. It's a course I enjoy playing, and I played fairly well. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: You're only one of five players who have played in all five of these events. It would have meant a lot for you not to be here; these are the type of events you want to play in.
 HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely. HSBC have been putting on a fantastic event for us here over the last six years and they are a great supporter to golf worldwide, so I'm happy to be a part of this it tournament, and, yeah, it was one of those probably the year I really wanted to play it the most when I wasn't exempt. So I was very pleased to get in. 

 Q. Curious if you could just comment on your game this year and what's not been up to standard for you?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's been probably the worst season out of these last six or seven, something like that. 
 Yeah, it's been a tough year. We had our second baby early on this year and I kind of missed out on a few events. Then I didn't get going. I was sick -- I've been sick quite a lot, as well. I had to pull out of the Match Play with some virus and a couple of colds. 
 Then I picked up another virus straight after the British, so I was more or less down for eight weeks in total. Just chest infection and all this, and I went over and tried to play at the PGA and win them but I really shouldn't have been playing, but had to keep my numbers up. Yeah, it was a rough patch there. 
 But overall I've been struggling across the board, with long game and short game and mentally as well. I've just not been on most of the season and I got two Top-10s in Europe and third at the British Open. So it's not been a good year for me. 
 But I hope I can turn that around. I'm obviously heading in the right direction with this first score here this week, and got The Race to Dubai final, as well, to try and wrap up the year in better style than I have been playing. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: Well played today.
