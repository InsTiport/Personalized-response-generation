 Q.   Quite a way to win the match.   Talk us through the final shot.   
HENRIK STENSON:   He was putting a lot of pressure on me coming in.   I felt pretty confident after 14.   I was 3‑up with four to go and I knew I needed a halve to go through.     
Of course you want to win your match when you're 3‑up at that stage.   But then I 3‑putted from very far away on 15 and he hit a good first putt, almost made it for eagle and 2‑putted for birdie.  
Then I thought what I needed to do on 16 when I just trickled it up there to a foot and got it for par and then he managed to chip‑in from off the green for birdie to take it 1‑up with two to go.   
Now it's getting a little bit more interesting, but he didn't hit the best of approaches on 17.   So I felt like if I can stick my lob‑wedge in there a little bit past and try to spin it back, and came out with a nice flight and knew it was going to be pretty good but a bonus that it went in the hole and spectacular way to finish.   
   
 Q.   You told us you had not touched a club for a couple of weeks; are you getting more into it, is the game feeling better?   
HENRIK STENSON:   I probably played a little bit better the first day than yesterday but the back nine was good yesterday and today was pretty nice, as well.   Got to have a good start but he was always hanging in there.   Every time he missed the green he got up‑and‑down and I had to make birdies to win holes which you kind of expect.   I was playing nicely and he came back and I returned the favour to him on 17, so nice to not have to go down the last.
