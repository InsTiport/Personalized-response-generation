 Q.  Do you feel like you left a couple out there or you got the most out of how you were hitting?  HENRIK STENSON: I didn't bring my A game for sure.  It was a battle.  I think I hit five fairways in total, and three of them were 16, 17, and 18.  To be 3-under par for the round after a round of 13 holes, even though, as you know, a lot of the fairways are sloping.  So actually a few of the decent tee balls ends up just in the first cut.  But still I was playing either from the first cut or from the rough most of the day. So considering that, to shoot 2-under is a pretty good round here.  It's a tough golf course, and if you don't bring your game to shoot under par, I guess you've got to take the positives.   Q.  And 5-under means you're going to be around 9.  Two guys go out there and shoot 63 today.  Is that possible for you tomorrow?  HENRIK STENSON: I need to play better, that's for sure.  I think it's always possible to shoot a low number.  I've done that in the past and would like to play well.  I'm looking at the long-term picture.  I definitely need to play better than I did out there tee to green.  It's below my normal standard. Got some work to do.  It's a work in progress, but it's still coming along.  I think, even though you're not playing well, as good as you want, but you're still shooting good scores, it still shows at least the mind is in the right place, and you're making the most out of your chances and keep on saving yourself when you're not in position.  So I'm really happy for that, but I'm wishing for a little bit better tee to green.   Q.  A lot of important tournaments coming up, obviously next week.  Are there signs that good stuff is coming?  HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I'm hoping so.  It's been -- I had a good start to the season, and then those illnesses, I was basically out for the whole month.  That kind of put a bit of a hold to my season and lost the momentum. In the summertime, when there's a lot of golf and you're traveling and all the rest of it, it's hard to pick that up.  Looking ahead now, I'm hoping to put some good work down and pick up some form again. Looking ahead at 2016, it's going to be crucial to have a solid start to that year because of the traveling and the scheduling and everything else.  It's going to be pretty messy in the summertime.  In the long term, I want to get some good work done and kind of find some momentum at the end of this year and into next year.  And then we should be good for next summer.
