 Q.   Not a single birdie on the scorecard on Thursday, making up for it on Friday with eight.   What changed?   
HENRIK STENSON:   You had to mention that, didn't you.   To be honest, it was pretty much only on the greens.   I played nicely yesterday but I couldn't make one single putt out there and had to finish the day with a bogey on 18 of course to make it feel even better.  
Today I got off to a great start.   Made I think a 60â€‘footer with a triple break on 10, and just played nicely and made a lot of putts.   
   
 Q.   Played well at the PGA Championship a couple weeks ago.   How much of this is a continuation of your good form at Valhalla?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I've just been trying to work hard at my game to get it back where I want it, and it's in the right direction for sure.   Of course it's nice to get a score like this on a tough day, so this is a nice position for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   You won the Playoffs a year ago.   How much confidence do you take from that, knowing that you've done it before and you're the most recent one to do so?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, of course it's possible, and it would be good for me, a good week here at The Barclays, because I was 70th when we started.   So it would be nice to improve on that a little bit and slowly but surely go in the right direction towards Atlanta.   
I'm just hoping I can continue with some good play over the weekend, and of course I know I can do it again.
