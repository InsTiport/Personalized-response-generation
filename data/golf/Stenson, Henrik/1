  Q. Just get some comments, I know with your Orlando connections and I know this event means a lot to you.
 HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, obviously great to be back out and playing at Bay Hill this week.  Got a lot of good finishes in the baggage from previous years and we'll see if the game is good enough at this point to challenge for another one.
 But no matter what, it's good to be out here, I believe we're going to have some fans out there as well, so, yeah, just good to be out playing golf again.
 Q. Health, how is the health, everything good?
 HENRIK STENSON:   Other than a little plunge in the ski slopes like two and a half weeks ago, we got some sore ribs still, so maybe not a hundred percent, but it seems to be working hitting golf shots and practicing, so, yeah, fingers crossed that's not going to be a problem.
 Q. Last thing, with Mr. Palmer's legacy to this game and obviously his involvement at this tournament, just talk a little bit about what, not only what he meant to the game, but really what he still means to the game.
 HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, we still very much feel his spirit and his presence here at his own event, but also in the game of golf in general.
 So much work for charity and I got two of my kids are born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital here in Orlando.  So, yeah, he's a huge figure in the sport and big thanks for everything he did throughout his career and after.
