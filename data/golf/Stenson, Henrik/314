Q.  Nice playing out there.  Do you feel like the greens were
a lot different today, speed-wise?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, gosh, the one on 18 was
ridiculously slow.  I hit that one in practice and it was kind of
hard to get it up to the top of the crest, before it started going
down, and even though I knew it was a slow putt, I still -- I hit
it and I thought I did my best, and I got it up over, and it just
completely hit the breaks and the downslope.  So I didn't think I
did a bad first effort, and still left me a nasty six-footer
coming down that I missed.
That was probably one of the most sour ones.  Because I
got it up in decent position on 18.  Finishing with a par.  I had
a bit of a rocky start, a couple of bogeys early on, and then
unfortunately I couldn't take my opportunities on 5 and 9; I had
decent chances for birdie.  And just didn't get the breaks that I
needed on those two holes.
And then I was hanging good and it's tough to get close
on these greens, and didn't really have any close calls for
birdie.  A couple of chances, but sometimes you're on the wrong
side of the pin, as well, so you get slick putts.  I needed to
pick up one or two even on the back nine or 5 and 9.
Overall I was pretty happy with the way I was hanging in
there.
