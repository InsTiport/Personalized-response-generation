 Q.  2-under par round of 70, what was that like for you?  
HENRIK STENSON: It was a battle, I'd say.  Didn't hit many fairways at all today and the rough is not as high and maybe difficult as previous years but still thick.  It's hard to make a good contact.  There was a lot of scrambling, the odd chip-in and a couple of good putts.  It was a good fight in there to keep it together.   
 Q.  You mentioned your chip-in on your seventh hole, I believe.  Talk us through that?  
HENRIK STENSON: Just hit a little 60-degree there.  Played it just short of the green and made a little hop and lucky that it goes in but it was pretty nicely played shot and yeah, those are the little things that helps on a day like today.   
Had a couple that were kind of sneaking by.  I felt like I left one or two maybe on the greens, but all in all, I was pretty pleased with the score and kind of where we got it despite not having our best day.
