HENRIK STENSON:  It has been gradually coming back. I played really solid at the Lancome but the putting was so-so and then the long game was really good in Germany and I was very happy with 17 under par for the final three rounds. I have carried it on this week, I was really solid again yesterday, should have scored better but I kept my confidence high. Still playing well and hitting good putts, it is nice to be back nearly in contention and with two more days to go, I am hoping for a good weekend.
