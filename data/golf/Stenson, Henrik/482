Q. That was a good little run you put together?
HENRIK STENSON: Yes it was a good spell although I just missed out on that one on the14th which was a bit so-so, but I have been playing solid all day and I am looking forward to the rest of the tournament.
Q. Playing like that, it must have been a pity to stop?
HENRIK STENSON: Well when you are playing nicely and have the momentum going you always want to keep on going but it is no use playing in the dark is it.
Q. Did you feel the run of birdies coming?
HENRIK STENSON: Not really, I was just trying to plug away and hit one shot at a time.
Q. Have you found it difficult with the stop-start?
HENRIK STENSON: It is never easy but it has been working out pretty good for me so far and the more experience you get with that, the more years you spend out on Tour, the more used to it you get, so there is not too much to worry about, and I just play when they say I should play.
Q. Try to hit the ground running tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON: Obviously I need to make up a lot of ground to be able to catch Adam but we will give it a shot.
