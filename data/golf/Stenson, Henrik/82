Q. You shot over par but still nicely in contention.
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it was a battle.  It was tough conditions and didn't get off to a good start.  Played pretty poorly in the beginning and hit a couple wayward shots, and you're paying the price in these conditions.
With the firm greens being new, it's hard to get up-and-down when you're out of position.  That was the case early on, but I was hanging in there battling pretty good and got a few back coming home.
Q. Do you take positives out of the fact that you didn't drop a shot on the back nine?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I think you have to do that.  I mean, it's just a little frustrating at times, because of the downwind and the firm greens, you can't really get close, even though you're hitting a really good shot.  You can't really get close without taking silly risks.
Yeah, you have to make some long-range putts if you want to make birdies on a few of the holes and I hit a couple of good ones on 16 and 18, very close, and didn't drop, so maybe tomorrow.
Q. 4-under after three rounds, what can you take from today's round?
HENRIK STENSON: Good battling, especially on the back nine there.  I was getting a few shots back coming home.  It was tough for everyone.  Hanging in there, even though we didn't play particularly good, and had a rough start.  So hopefully we'll get off to a better start tomorrow and make a few putts.
Q. How much did the wind change direction out there?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm not sure if it changed too much overall.  Maybe a little bit but it just always swirls here.  You've got to trust where the wind should be if you knock it above the tree line.  It is a tricky golf course, because to me, it's a bit like target golf, but it's still on a linksy-style golf course within the trees.  Yeah, I kind of struggled to see where they were landing on a lot of the holes.
Q. What will you be ironing out before tomorrow?
HENRIK STENSON: I'm working on my long game.  That's not working too well, and I'm doing some FaceTime catchup with Pete.  Yesterday I was in my boxer's swinging away, so we'll see what tonight offers.
Q. Very difficult day out there, but you're still very much in contention.  Can you just sum it up?
HENRIK STENSON: I played poorly in the beginning.  Got off to a bad start and had to really battle hard and get it back on the back nine, in particular.  Got a few back coming home.  It was tough for everyone and we're still at the races.
Q. How deep did you have to dig particularly on that back nine to turn it around like you did?
HENRIK STENSON: Well, we were up and fighting all week.  It's not a golf course I've played particularly well at over the years and that seems to continue.  But I've been fighting this week and putting pretty good.  I just want to be there with a chance tomorrow afternoon, and hopefully I can get off to a hotter start tomorrow and put myself right in the mix in the back nine.
Q. Fighting the conditions, as well, today.  How different a course was it today in this wind?
HENRIK STENSON: It is difficult, especially downwind.  The greens are new and you can't really spin the ball that much.  A lot of times, I think most of the players feel like they land the ball in a good spot but still releases over the back.  It's just hard to get close to the pin, and you're not making too many birdie putts from 25, 30 feet in these conditions.
Q. A few shots to make up tomorrow, but how well placed do you feel heading into the final day?
HENRIK STENSON: It could always be worse but it could have been better, as well.  I like to be at the top of the leaderboard.  I always like having the mind-set that the other guys have to play better than me if I'm in the lead.
So now obviously it's the reverse situation, and I have to go out and make a few extra birdies and hopefully put some pressure on the leaders.
