Q.   Assess your week.   Pretty good. 
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with that.   We'll see if I finish tied second or second on my own there. 
But all in all a good week.   It was a one‑horse race the last day.   Jordan was pulling away from everyone.   Played with him yesterday and he played fantastic, so all credit to him. 
I'm finished here with two wins, and I'm not too disappointed myself getting a defense there in Dubai and sneaking in another good finish here and some World Ranking position points before the end of the year. 
I'm looking forward to my break, and be back at it in January again.

Q.   How does the end of your season push you for 2015?
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, I just got to leave the 2014 season with a bit of momentum.   You know, looking ahead to next year pretty pleased with my scheduling.   Feel like I'm going to be back into having a bit more time to rest and practice in between my tournaments. 
No, I'm looking forward to it.   Going on a nice break now.   A bit of snow and a bit of skiing with the kids, and should be ready to go in January. 

Q.   Talk about what you saw out of Jordan this week and how impressive he was on the course. 
HENRIK STENSON:   No, he was in pretty much full control of every part of his game.   He drove it nicely; hit some good iron shots; and his pitching and putting was phenomenal. 
So whenever he didn't have a birdie chance, he always saved himself and got away with par.   So it was a one‑horse race here like I said, coming into Sunday.   All the rest of us had to do was battle it out for second, really.
