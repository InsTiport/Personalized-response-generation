 Q.   How good is 4‑under?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, it was an interesting day.   I got off to a flying start, probably the best start I've ever had here at Wentworth and just nearly made that long birdie putt on 6 and made a clumsy bogey on 7.  
Felt like I lost a lit of momentum but things were going nicely and I made three birdies in a row, and I was 5‑under through 14 but the shot of the day was my 7‑iron on 14, almost got it to the hole there and just a tap‑in birdie.   Run into some trouble on 15 and 16, doubled 15 and bogeyed 16, and then 40‑minute rain delay on the course and finished with two birdies.   Overall very happy with that, some good stuff.   
   
 Q.   When you are starting like that, do you think to yourself, why did I miss this tournament for a few years?  
HENRIK STENSON:   No, not so much that.   It's probably my best score around here, I don't know.   I doubt I've been much better than 4‑under around Wentworth in the past.   
Got off to a good start and working on some things.   I was still struggling a bit with some wild tee shots and didn't feel that confident with the swing at times but putting was good and 4‑under is a good round.  
   
 Q.   Having played the course now in competition rather than just practise, do you feel that it is different than perhaps to what it was last time?  
HENRIK STENSON:   I think the only difference to the Pro‑Am yesterday was lots of rain overnight and the greens were a lot softer than in practise and that was a big difference.   Slight changes in setup compared to when I last played in 2010 but overall it's the same course as I played back then, and just going to dig deep and try and move on with some more good scores as the week progresses.
