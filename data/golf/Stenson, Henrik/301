 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, I mean to be honest, I was ripping it when we started off the rain delay.   I thought this was nice.   And obviously I was in the driver's seat but still a lot of holes to play and a lot of guys behind me.   And I knew they weren't going to back off.   I hit a couple of loose ones, and made one or two nice birdies.   And of course the bounce back on 17 after missing the approach and then holing the bunker shot.   It made it a little easier coming up 18.   I was kind of expecting standing over a five, 6‑footer there, instead it was the winning shot and closed out the tournament more or less.   I forgive myself that three‑putt on the last.  
   
 Q.   It's been well reported you're the top five player of the world.   You went into a bit of valley with your game professionally, top 200 in the word.   You fought yourself back, and you're once again a PGA Tour winner.   What are you most proud of?  
HENRIK STENSON:   It was frustrating times, of course.   But I never questioned my ability to play good golf and compete with the best.   So at least I've always had that, given the tournaments that I won in the past and so on.   But still a lot of hard work and I've got to dig in deep to get back into good shape.   And have a great team around me, everything from caddie, physio, my coach, swing coach.   So they are a big part of this and great family and friends with huge support and I'm getting the fans more and more as well.   So it's fun out there.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned your swing coach, Pete call as.   He said the scary thing about you is that you may not believe yet just how good you are, saying that complimentary.   Do you believe something different now about who you are with this victory professionally?  
HENRIK STENSON:   No, not so much.   I probably still don't believe it.   I don't believe it.   But like I said, the great thing is you're never finished with this game.   I want to keep on improving, getting better and better.   And if I keep on adding a little bitty hope I'll make it tough on the guys a few more times this year.   
   
 Q.   Perhaps your best week ever, how would you describe it?  
HENRIK STENSON:   It's been a great week, ball‑striking wise, and the putter was working nicely for me here on the weekend.   It's nice to come through and win a big event after all the good finishes and close to winning like I've been the last couple of months.   It's great to get one my belt.   And this doesn't make it any less sweeter going into the last two FedExCup tournaments.  
   
 Q.   You're the highest player on the planet right now, why?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Don't burn yourself.   No, it's been long, hard work getting back to this place.   And playing as well as I've done in these last couple of months, there's no magic, no quick fix.   It's just hard work.   And I've got a great team around me.   Thanks, guys, they definitely will be part of this.   And I've got a lot of support from my family and friends and fans out there.   
   
 Q.   Your wife and family is here.   It's been four long years.   This has got to be a great feeling?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah, absolutely.   To win on the European Tour and last year, and to win again on the PGA Tour.   It's been a good four months, and I hope I can keep it going.
