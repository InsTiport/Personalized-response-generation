 Q.  Looks like you're hot on the trail now? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I was struggling in Abu Dhabi, so I was hoping to come out and be a little bit better off the tee and I was.  Still not 100% but definitely in the right direction so I'm happy with the start. 

 Q.  Guess this course has always suited you with your length off the tee, but with the changes in the rough this time, is it playing right into your game? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Well, if I hit it in the rough, it should do, but you know, yeah, it's a bit patchy.  Some areas are still pretty thick but you can get good lies, as well.  So it's a little bit of a luck when you hit in the rough what kind of lie you get.  But if you do, you can definitely get it out. 

 Q.  Is it different for you here being based in Dubai; in terms of preparation, do you have an advantage over the other players? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  I think just playing these tournaments for the number of years I've done it sort of gives you the idea of how to play the courses and obviously I played very well this week.  So it gives you good confidence and then it's always nice to come back. 

 Q.  And how was it last week when you really found yourself in a position to win again? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, as I said I was not striking it great, so that was the only disappointment; that I didn't feel that I had the fifth gear with me.  But it was great to be up there. 

 Q.  Are you going to keep things under control or allow yourself excitement about your chances of winning this week? 
 HENRIK STENSON:  I hope I can have a better game off the tee and give it a rip on the weekend.
