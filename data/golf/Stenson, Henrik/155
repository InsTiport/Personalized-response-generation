 Q.  Our on the PGA TOUR, where do you feel your game is in the big picture with what you're hoping to accomplish in 2016?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's pretty good.  Put a lot of work in.  I didn't feel like at Doral and last week at Tampa that I really got it together even though the short game bunker shots and pitching was really good in Tampa and, I like I said yesterday, I hit it the best I hit it all year in the Pro-Am yesterday.  Couldn't quite bring that to the golf course.  If it was there yesterday it's not far away.  We keep on working away and feel like we're in decent shape.   
 Q.  Henrik, really nice round of golf today, no bogies on the card.  5-under.  Your thoughts on how you played.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I played really, really good in the Pro-Am yesterday.  Hit the ball as well as I've done all year and couldn't quite bring it as good on the course today but it was still good enough to shoot a good number and tied the scorecard and didn't drop any shots and rolled a couple of good would ones in.  In terms of iron shots, the one into 1 and 2 were the two highlights of the day, I'd say.   
 Q.  Kind of a quiet opening 9 for you.  You make the turn 1-under.  But take us through that finish at 6, 7 and 8 when you made three birdies in row.  
HENRIK STENSON: Hit a good tee ball on 6 and it was a full 3-iron second shot, just trickled through.  Hit a nice chip in 12 yards or something to three, four feet, birdied that one.   
Then hit the middle of the green on 7 and rolled in about a 25-footer for birdie.   
Then hit a good 7-iron to 10, 12 feet up the hill on 8.  I left myself the right putt on 8 for sure and it was nice to make three in row.   
 Q.  Thoughts on the course with the new grasses.  Looks like it's in great shape.  
HENRIK STENSON: Absolutely the best I've ever seen.  Really happy they went through the hardship changing it up and it's definitely paid off.  In beautiful condition and the rough is pretty juicy and the greens are running pure.  Really nice to play.
