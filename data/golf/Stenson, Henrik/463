Q.
7 under for the tournament.  On Thursday when you teed off, did you expect that would be a great score for the week?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah.  I mean, that's my best finish in a major, so that's good.  I played not as good as I wanted on the weekend.  More than anything I didn't score as good as I would have hoped.

Overall, it's a good week, and it's something to take something positive out of and think ahead to next week.
