Q. Can you talk about playing in the conditions, other players were talking about crusty greens --
HENRIK STENSON: It's kind of the same.  I mean, it's a little frustrating I feel with the wind, some of the shots I go for, I don't really feel like I get the wind right and of course the ones you don't quite hit the way you want to, you're going to struggle a bit.  It's hard to get it close.  Hit a lovely shot into 16, landed about three or four paces past, and all of a sudden it just releases over the green.  On another time, you land it short and it might stop.
So it's a little difficult to get that pace or the reception of the greens perfect, but I'm pretty happy.  I was hanging in there.  I did some great par saves.  I did a couple of birdies, but let one or two good, and didn't quite feel like it was going my way.
But I'll try to finish with a strong round tomorrow.
Q. You started the week not feeling so well, and you said you really wanted to work better on your long game and you're happy with the putting.  What's going to be one focus we'll see from you tomorrow in the final?
HENRIK STENSON: It's going to be more of the same.  I'm very happy with the work I've done this week.  It's not quite there.  Not my A Game, I know that much, but I'm still there and thereabouts.  It would have been nice to finish a couple of shots better today to have a little bit of a shorter distance out to the leaders.
So we'll see.  We can always shoot a good score.  We've done that before on Sunday.  So we'll go out and try and finish strong tomorrow.
