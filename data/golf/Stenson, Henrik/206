 Q.   In in 30, pretty good back-9 for you.   
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah.   Finished with four straight birdies and I made some great putts there.   Hit some solid shots as well but, yeah, all in all a great comeback.   Didn't start off that great but I was hanging in there and then really got things going on the back-9.   So, pleased with the today's work.  
   
 Q.   You showed some patience in the middle of the round.   Were you able to refocus?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah.   Didn't feel like I was in the best place there for the front-9 or parts of the front-9 so I was really -- I kind of kicked myself in the butt a little bit and got more the result we wanted as well, which is not always a guarantee, of course, but if you stick at it and more likely to get what you want.  
   
 Q.   How about that 42-foot birdie putt at 17?   What were you thinking?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Get in, looks good.   No.   Of course it's a huge bonus to make one of those.   I was putting lovely all day, especially the ones on my birdie attempts from further away.   I kind of left myself some smelly ones.   I holed out nicely.   
I would have been happy with two-putt, of course but that was nice to see that one go in and hit another solid putt on 18 and made another birdie.   Finished with four straight ones here is going to move you forward.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about your back-9 how it changed from the front.  
HENRIK STENSON:   Yeah.   I made a couple of mistakes on the front-9 and still made a couple of birdies but made two bogies and the key moment was really par save on 7.   Had a 10-footer down the hill for par and stayed at the races and didn't go too far behind.   
I managed to turn things around starting at the 10th.   Nice fairway bunker shot, 8 feet.   Made that for birdie and made a great up and down on 12 out of a bad spot in the rough and just got four in a row here coming in.   Some nice putts and nice shots.   Very pleased with that.  
   
 Q.   How are you liking the greens so far?   There's been a lot of talk about them this week.  
HENRIK STENSON:   They struggled a little bit with them.   I got no complaints.   The way I've been putting I've been rolling it nicely and hit good putts, of course they're more likely to go in.   But it's a different surface than we normally used to, normally be quicker and firmer which makes it tricky.   
Now I think the scoring shows that as well, softer and you can attack a bit more towards the pin positions.   You can be a bit more aggressive than any other year I played.
