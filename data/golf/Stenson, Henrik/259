  HENRIK STENSON:   It's a little bit wet out there on the course, but we were quite lucky.   
   
 Q.   First round, two birdies.   Second round, four birdies.   Today, seven birdies.   So what will we see tomorrow?  
HENRIK STENSON:   Well, I had an eagle the first day, as well.   Four birdies the second day, you're right.   
The only sad part, I dropped my first shot of the week on 16, so 52 holes without a bogey was nice as long as it lasted.   I'm quite pleased with my round today and my back didn't feel that great, either.   So I need to go get a little bit of treatment.   So given that, I'm pleased to shoot 6‑under.   
   
 Q.   So how do you spend the rest of the day?   
HENRIK STENSON:   Some physio treatment and then just a quiet dinner with the family.   Due to the weather tomorrow, we are not going to be up early, so it not going to be a late night.   
   
 Q.   Shooting 66, moved nicely up into position.   
HENRIK STENSON:   As close of a leaderboard as I've ever seen.   So many guys shooting low numbers.   Obviously the course is set up for a lot of birdies, but it's going to be a day tomorrow, I think where the lead can change hands more than once.   So yeah, it's good to move into contention a bit more.   Still a lot of golf for the leaders to play and we'll see where we're at.   But all in all, a good day.  
   
 Q.   Was it like playing a good course all together today?   
HENRIK STENSON:   We were quite lucky with the weather.   It didn't rain too much on us.   A couple of holes it was coming down pretty hard but other than that, it was a decent round.  
It was playing a little softer and I think the biggest challenge for me is to keep my iron shots not spinning back too much, because I was getting backspin on 6‑irons and 7‑irons so that makes it a bit tricky in that direction.   
Normally I like if it gets a bit firm so I can hold the greens, and the others might not be able to do it.   Now it the opposite; I struggle to keep it on there.  
   
 Q.   What's the game plan for Sunday?  
HENRIK STENSON:   You've got to shoot low if you want to have anything to do with the trophy I think.   Yeah, I think we'll just try and make a few good putts tomorrow and try to keep playing reasonably well.   My back wasn't feeling too great today, so I'm going to go and get some treatment from that now and hopefully that feels better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What's the problem?   
HENRIK STENSON:   It was a bit irritated in the lower left side this morning and then it kind of got gradually worse.   I didn't feel it when I was walking but now towards the end I could feel it walking, as well.   Need to get some attention, some love to that area.
