 Q.  A 69, how was that?  
HENRIK STENSON: It was tough out there.  It's a tough day out there.  It was blowing pretty hard.  I think the forecast is for possibly stronger winds tomorrow.  It was a good rehearsal for tomorrow's task then.   
Hit a lot of good shots out there.  Got some things both technically and mentally that I'm working on and I think I did that very well today.  You know, yeah, I hit some really good ones, and when I didn't, I kept it in play and saved myself.  It was nice to make that par putt up the last there and not finish with a bogey.   
Yeah, we're in pretty good shape, even though it seems we're playing for second place.   
 Q.  What was the difference between the first nine and the second nine?  
HENRIK STENSON: I just hit a couple of better shots.  The front nine, I played okay.  It wasn't too bad.  But it was gusty.  It was tough and I just didn't really get close to any pin positions and didn't give myself a lot of birdie chances, and I did that on the back nine and took a little bit more advantage of that.  You know, coming home in 4-under is pretty good today.   
 Q.  You say you're playing for second place.  What's your game plan for tomorrow?  
HENRIK STENSON: My game plan is going to be the same.  I've got a game plan how to play my best or what I think is my best on this golf course and I'm going to stick to that.  It's been working pretty good so far.   
But if Dustin keeps on playing the way that he's done this week, I think it's going to be a one-man show tomorrow.  But you never know, tough winds, and this golf course has a couple of holes where you certainly can have a number.  It's never over until it's over.
