 Q.  Any bright remarks about the course?  
HENRIK STENSON: Well, I mean, it's a difficult golf course.  I expected it to be a difficult week, and I guess it's lived up to those expectations and beyond.   
It's not unusual that we kind of end up in these discussions, where the players and, you know, fans think it's either too hard or fair or whatever.  But it is what it is, and I'm pretty happy with the way I played today.   
I was really doing well on the front nine and let a couple go on the back nine and got on a small bogey train 13, 14, 15.  So that kind of made the day a little bit less good, but all in all, we're still at the races, and we got an outside chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  Borderline, over the line, where is it?  
HENRIK STENSON: I'd say it's a little bit over the line.  I don't know what the polls are saying at the moment.   
 Q.  But to shoot 4 over, you're right in the hunt.  That's a testimony to how difficult this course is playing for everybody.  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it is.  It's small margins to start with.  But in the afternoon, when the greens get baked and with some of those pin positions -- I mean, the greens aren't running perfectly smooth in the first place.  But then in the afternoon, when they get crusty and baked, it's like glass around the hole.  You can barely touch some of the putts going downhill, and you could easily three or four-putt from three, four, five feet.  So you've got to be extremely careful and hit a lot of good putts out there.   
I felt like I left a few coming home, but everyone else was struggling too, I think.   
 Q.  What can the USGA do, either with water tonight or a little more gettable pin positions than they had today, to make it a fair competition tomorrow?  
HENRIK STENSON: I think we'll just see what they do tomorrow.  I don't think they're interested in listening to my remarks or anyone else's remarks because then we would have seen maybe slightly different pin positions and setup over the years.  So it is what it is, and we'll be back out there fighting it out tomorrow.   
 Q.  What do you think they might do exactly?  
HENRIK STENSON: I don't know.  You better ask them, not me.   
 Q.  Did you expect the conditions to be this tough today, or do you expect it more tomorrow?  
HENRIK STENSON: No, I kind of expected both days if we got this sunny, windy weather, and we got that.   
 Q.  So your thoughts on the position you're in going into tomorrow.  You're right there in the hunt?  
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, it's a hard golf course to make up shots, so you're going to need a bit of help.  I mean, if you're playing early, like I guess Daniel and Tony did today and played really well, it must have been a little bit easier to make that score in the morning than in the afternoon, I would imagine.   
But it's still a heck of a round of golf for them and put them -- I don't know what time they teed off.  It was 10:00, 11:00-ish, something like that.  They would have been finished more or less when the leaders teed off.  So to go from there right into contention and almost in the lead is a big jump.   
 Q.  (No microphone).  How far back is too far?  
HENRIK STENSON: I don't know.  We'll see tomorrow.
