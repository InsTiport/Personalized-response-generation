 Q. Talk about the day a little bit. 
 HENRIK STENSON: I didn't get off to the best of starts with a bogey on 10. Managed to make birdie-birdie on 11 and 12, so got it back. Made a couple of par saves, made the turn at 2-under, and had it at 3-under after 11. Then just a couple of bad shots on 7 and 8, really. Cost me two bogies. So stepping on the 9th tee I wasn't too happy but made a good pass with a 3-wood and then hit a real stinger from almost 300 yards to the pin and got it to about 20 feet. Managed to make that one. 
 They even put it up on the board before when I was reading my putt. They said finished with the eagle. So that extra bit of heat is probably what I needed to roll it in. So it was nice to bounce back with that one. 3-under still feels like a decent score and keeps me in there. Lot of red numbers out there today.

 Q. That was a touchy one, huh, that putt? 
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, you could almost sneeze that one down in the hole. That was a touchy putt, and very happy to make that one. Just like Jason said earlier, the greens are very receptive, and that's why we see such low scoring out there. 
 I guess in combination with a little breeze and also the rough is much nicer to us this year than previous years.

 Q. The last couple rounds have been really good, so your comfort level must feel good?
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I've been struggling with my game and I'm still not quite there. I love this golf course. I enjoy playing it. And that certainly helps. That gets me going.
