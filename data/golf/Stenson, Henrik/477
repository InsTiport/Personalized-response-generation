HENRIK STENSON:  I didn't get off to the best of starts, so I'm very happy with the way I fought my way around out there today.  But I'm a little bit unhappy with the way I finished obviously, but sometimes you get the bad breaks and it wasn't really my day for the good breaks out there today.  I'm quite happy with the way I kept it together.
Q.  How were the conditions out there?  How was the golf course playing?
HENRIK STENSON:  It's playing much tougher with the breeze being up.  It's stronger than yesterday, so I guess there will be a few guys dropping shots out there, so it's just dig deep and try and keep it together, and I came back well in the middle of the round there.

Yeah, so I'm looking forward to the next two days.
Q.  How is your mindset heading into the weekend?
HENRIK STENSON:  I'm happy.  I thought it was probably the best out there that I kept my patience.  On a day like this it's easy to let it go away if you get angry for your mistakes.  I just kept my head in the right place and fought my way around there.
Q.  Play well this weekend.
HENRIK STENSON:  Thank you.
Q.  Was there anything you were happy with that you did well, part of your game?
HENRIK STENSON:  As I said, I kept my head and made some better shots in the middle of the round there.  On a windy day if you miss one it drifts away a little bit on the wind or miss it on the wrong side as I did on 18.  It hits a tree and gets stuck next to the trunk and then hit a branch on the next one, and all of a sudden you end up making bogey or double bogey.

It's a bit like yesterday, dropping a shot or two at the end of the round never feels good.  But what can you do, recharge and go out fresh tomorrow and try and get it back.
Q.  Were you up against the trunk of the tree?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I mean, I had a bit of a swing but not really.  I needed to go a bit shorter and I was standing a bit funny.  Really anywhere else would have been all right, to get it up next to the green, or at worst I would have made 5, but I sort of was in a bad spot and I hit another branch further on and it kicked left, which is the wrong side.  Those things happen, it's golf.
Q.  You're pretty familiar with those trees on that hole.
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I mean, it just happens.  In a crosswind you don't want to leak it right and you've got to get over on top of it a little bit, and it stayed on the left side, hit a branch.
Q.  Are things like that common in Europe, crosswinds like this?
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, we play a fair bit of golf in the wind over on the British Isles and even mainland Europe, so I'm not that unfamiliar with it.
Q.  Do you chastise yourself, though, when you finish like this, or do you just    are you harder on yourself when you finish like this?
HENRIK STENSON:  I tried my best on every shot.  That's all you can do really.  Of course I'm disappointed with a few things out there, bogey on 10 from the middle of the fairway with a wedge and stuff like that, but you've got to keep it going.  You've got to leave it go and keep on going.
Q.  Great position, though.
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, obviously 5 under would have been better than 3, but that's the way it is, and I'll take it from there on.
Q.  They moved up the times for tomorrow.
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, I heard it looks like there's some bad weather coming in.
Q.  You guys are probably used to that.
HENRIK STENSON:  Yeah, just stay relaxed and do what they tell us to do.
