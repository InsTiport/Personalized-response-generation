 JOE ROTELLINI: I'd like to welcome everybody to Waynesborough Country Club.  I certainly want to thank you for coming out today.  This turnout is really fantastic and we certainly appreciate the support that you are giving us.
We have a lot of things on the agenda today.  I'd like to -- I am going to speak about a few things, talk about the format.  Then really I am going to turn it over to our head table here.  We have some very fine people here speaking today.
What a great weekend of golf it really was.  You had Len Mattiace coming back from multiple strokes to win the Memphis event.  Len has been in our field the last two years and he has really one of the true fine men on the PGA TOUR.  So it is nice to see him win for the second time this year.
If you watched the U.S. Senior Open down in Caves Valley, again, what a great finish there, a well-known veteran SENIOR TOUR player against a player that had a solid career on the PGA Tour, now the Senior PGA TOUR, but what a great finish at that great event down the road in Atlantic City.  We had the ShopRite Classic, it really looked to us from what we had seen, that there was some fine support there from the community.  This we can coming up, again, down the road in the other direction west in Hershey we have the BUY.COM Tour at Hershey  Country Club so this is really a nice week for local golf, but also on a national scene because there was some really interesting things.
For the media today, as you have checked in, make sure if you have not registered at our table make sure you do so before the end of the day.  We will follow up with a letter to you talking about when the actual golf day and the starting times.  It is August 12 and we'll let you know when golf will begin and get all the particulars to you.  So make sure, if you have not checked in, you do so before you leave.
When you checked in you received a media packet.  It had a lot of neat information.  It had some previous press releases; some new ones that we're releasing here today: 
General information on the tournament, bios of our guest speakers, information on SEI Investments, our title sponsor, and also a Tour Media Guide.  Again, if you did not receive that information when you registered, make sure you do so on your way out.
The conference is being recorded, but it's also being produced back in New York where you can get a transcript of the conference by either going to www.asapsports.com.  We'll also put it on our web site either today or tomorrow.  So if you need to go back and review anything from today you are able to do that.
The format really I am going to speak very briefly.  I am going to touch on a few subjects.  Then I will introduce each speaker that we have today.  At the end of our last speaker, we'll open up for any questions and answers for your guests.  Then after, if you'd like to do some one-on-ones, I know people are on some tight deadlines, but if you can grab them and get some interviews, we certainly want to try to help you with that.
First thing I want to do is acknowledge some people that are here today.  Our tournament staff, we started in 1999 for the inaugural 200 SEI Pennsylvania Classic, our staff has pretty much stayed intact.  That has been really good for us because continuity is very important.  And it has been very important for me, with my responsibility of moving back and forth here between here and Western PA, to have a good staff in place each year.  I'd like to recognize our staff here today.  They are around the room somewhere.  Some of them don't like to be noticed.  First is Jackie Allison our tournament service manager.  I think she's all the way in the back.  
(APPLAUSE)
Next is our sales manager Chuck Barton.
(APPLAUSE)
Operations manager, Chad Burgess is down this Florida.  We have restructured our staff in regard to where they work out of.  He works out of headquarters to about six weeks before the event and he moves up when we start all the construction on the golf course.  So he's not here. 
We have also been fortunate to have some people help us in the office as interns and even though they have the title of interns we have really put them to work.  They do a lot of work for us in the office everyday.  They were a big part of helping us set up Media Day today and doing a lot of things that were important today like getting Pat and Robert down to film the commercials and getting Robert back to the airport and his family.  So we're very fortunate to have them with us, and in the back is Beth Fetter who assists Jackie with tournament services. 
(APPLAUSE)
And Joel Brown, who works with Chuck as well in our sales.
(APPLAUSE)
Also another young lady I'd like to recognize too.  She started with us in 2000, one of our key volunteers, and really whenever we need something done she's willing to do it, doesn't matter what it is.  She has a pickup truck and she halls things for us comes into the office, works the phones, she's a member here at Waynesborough, that's Tina Smith. 
(APPLAUSE)
We're back for the second time here at Waynesborough Country Club.  Really that's very exciting for us and the PGA TOUR.  Since we have been here in 1999 we started working with Waynesborough, it really is a pleasure because they are right down the road from our office right up the straight at Paoli.  They have been very cooperative.  Their staff -- a good majority of their staff have been involved with PGA TOUR or PGA SENIOR TOUR events in the past so it really makes our job easier.  The second time around in working with the club, it makes it easier as well.  Now we want to concentrate on making the event better. 
I'd like to recognize some key people here at the club that have made this relationship very special.  First the general manager Raymond Kondziela.
(APPLAUSE)
Head professional, Al Sutton. 
(APPLAUSE)
And a gentlemen who the pros were upset with two years ago because the greens were too fast is course superintendent Mitch Trent.
(APPLAUSE)
We also, along with these three gentlemen, the club has been very supportive in general.  Their membership has stepped up to volunteer for the event.  I will get into volunteering in a minute but two years ago provided us with  230 volunteers.  To date, today  we're close today 200 already.  So this says a lot about their membership  and how supportive they are of the event.  We also have some members of their board present too.  I hope I don't miss anybody.  But William Wadsworth, Judy Owens and John Snyder, board percent.  If you all could stand up and be recognized.  (Applause).
We thank you for coming and taking the time out today. 
Like I said, we're back here and we look forward to having another great tournament here.  Again experience is everything.  We all have experience with the event now, and we're ready to take it to the next level.  As I get into some points I want to cover, one of the main points I want to cover is volunteers.
Volunteers for our event is really the bloodline of what we're trying to do here.  As you can see, our tournament staff is very small.  As we approach tournament week, it grows a little bit because people from headquarters they come up and support us, but really we rely on volunteers to help us run the event. In 2000 we had approximately 1,230. This year we are trying to recruit upward of 1400 volunteers for the event.  We still have a lot of open spots; particularly in area of marshals.  Marshals take up about half of that number.   They are the people that are inside the ropes working with crowd control, protecting the players and making sure proper golf etiquette is being used by our spectators. 
So if you can help us promote that within the community, if you volunteered in 2000 and you haven't volunteered again this year please do so.  Or if you have some interest in volunteers, maybe at some of the other local events we really need your help. You do not have to be a golfer.  You do not have to understand the game of golf.  We have over 35 different committees to help us run the event.  Again, the key point about volunteering is by volunteering not only do you have a good time but really provide a great service.  PGA TOUR has given millions of dollars in charity since we have been doing this since the late 1930s, we have given close to 650 million dollars, averaging about 50 million a year.  The reason why we can give money to local charities is because of our volunteers.  Probably everybody in this room has a relative or a friend or a neighbor that has benefited or they have a relative or friend that has benefited from one of the charities on the PGA TOUR.  Really it is a great cause.  You get to meet a lot of people and have a lot of fun.  Again the more volunteers we have, the less people we have to pay to help us run the event which at the end of the day, translates to more charitable dollars back into the community.  So if you can really help us push the event, that would be great.  In your packet there's a volunteer application that lists all the committees, with our phone numbers, where you can call the office we can fax them an application, send it to them, they can go to our tournament web site, print the application, fill it out and fax it back in.
We have with our volunteer structure we have a handful of key volunteers that oversee different committees and they are very important to us.  They work extremely hard all year.  Volunteers only need to work a week but we have a handful that work year-round.  We have a couple our vice chairs here today that's Mark Himes (phonetic) and Rich Rumor (phonetic).  Stand up and be recognized, please.
(APPLAUSE)
Again without volunteers we can't do it.  We can't do it.
Also in your packet of information we have our corporate sponsorship information.  We still have some corporate sponsorship opportunities, hospitality, pro-am, branding opportunities, advertising, we still have those things available.  So again if you can help us get word out to local companies and corporations that may have some interest in entertaining their clients or employees, please have them give us a call and Chuck or myself will gladly speak with them, go visit with them, whatever we need to do to make it happen we are willing to do that. 
Again, that translates into charitable dollars as well because the more revenue that we generate for the event, once we pay all the operational costs, whatever is left over goes to local charities so the more revenue we bring in and the best we can keep our costs down, again, translates to more charitable dollars back into the community.
So please help us in regard to that and spread the word to local communities in the Philadelphia region.
A couple of other things I want to do before we get to our speakers.  Every year at this time we start to announce our charities where they are going to benefit from the event.  Right now we have three that we want to recognize today.  More will be coming as we get closer to the event.  As they become charities of our event we will do press releases to let you know that. 
But today we have three that are available here today.  One of our local charities is Paoli Memorial Hospital and representing them today is Russ Moore, Director of Development and Barbara Tikofsky (Phonetic), Senior vice-president.  Please be recognized. 
(APPLAUSE)
Another one of our charities and a repeat, Paoli Memorial Hospital was a charity in 2000.  Another repeat this year is the National Alliance for the mentally Ill, Chester County.   Representing them today is Carolyn Baker and Pete Izzo.  Please be recognized.
(APPLAUSE)
And lastly, one of the local charities that is a PGA TOUR charity as well it is a fairly new organization but they have grown very rapidly throughout the United States it really is a very special cause as well and that's The First Tee.  And here with us today, representing The First Tee of Delaware and Chester counties is executive director Greg Russell. 
(APPLAUSE)
Again, in your packet there are releases from the 2000 charity dollars that we presented to the community.  Also from last year event The Pennsylvania Classic, charity release is in there as well.
As we continue to grow the tournament throughout the Philadelphia region more and more people are stepping up to help us with the event.  So with that in mind, I think there's some more people in the audience I'd like to recognize as well.  I am not sure if Jesse is here or not, Jesse Walters from the Chester County Conference and Visitors Bureau. 
(APPLAUSE)
One of the biggest challenges when you put on a PGA TOUR event is working with the local township.  Pennsylvania as you know, it's all about townships and then the county but the township is really the first group of people that you work with, and this region to where Waynesborough is we're an east town township but there are some bordering townships that we need to work with, but we start with east town and we came into town in 1999 and we went down and met with the township.  There were a lot of open eyes there and not sure if we could pull this off but we worked very hard with them and they had been a great partner as well.  East Town township has been a great partner.  They have done everything we have asked of them, and Gene Williams, the township director, he can't make it today.  He's taking his daughter to her first day of college but we asked Tom Armstrong, Chief of Police to represent East Town.
(APPLAUSE)
Lastly what I'd like to do - this is a pretty neat story too   - again we talked about how people in the community are stepping up to want to help us.  We're getting phone calls saying, Joe, what can we do, what can we do.  Something that we want to announce today, I think is really important for the success of this event:  In the year 2000 we came into town and logistically we were looking to try and stage this tournament.  One of the biggest challenges the PGA TOUR tournaments have is general parking.  Majority of the golf courses on Tour they weren't made to host professional golf tournaments.  So you have to adapt and adjust.  In 2000 we had general parking by Immaculata College which they -  we were lucky to have them on board to let us have our general parking there.  This year we worked a little bit harder and found some different ways, and Episcopal Academy has stepped up being a fine partner with us, we're going to use a piece of property that they own just south of the club here at 252 in White Horse Road.  Now we are talking about having general parking less than three miles away from the club.  That is huge.  I think that really help ticket sales.  People understand now that I can drive, I can park, very close to the club, take a five minute air-conditioned shuttle up to the main entrance and be dropped back off at the end of the day at general parking.  Again that release is in your press kit along with announcing some players that will be at the event.  That's fantastic news for us. 
If you can help us spread the word as we begin our advertising campaign which will start in about two weeks, that will really I think pay great dividends for us in daily tickets.
I'd like to move on with the program now, start introducing our guest speakers.  The first person up three years ago we started the event.  Our first sponsor was Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  It all started with Arnold Palmer and Governor Ridge getting together, talking about getting  the PGA TOUR back in Pennsylvania because it had not been here since 1980.  The state stepped up and put their money where their mouth was and they stepped up and became one of our main sponsors.  Here today we have somebody from the governor's office.  Before I introduce him I'd like to recognize somebody else that is with him and that is the Deputy Press Secretary for the governor, Michael Lukens. 
(APPLAUSE).
Speaking on behalf of the Commonwealth, it is the Director of the governor's Southeast Regional office and that's Mr.  Robert Baker. 
(APPLAUSE). 
ROBERT BAKER: Before I make a few remarks on behalf of the Governor I would like to thank the media for this incredible turnout.  I think it really speaks to how important this event is to the region.  So from a politician for a change, thanks.
The Governor is excited to welcome the PGA TOUR to the Commonwealth.  On his behalf, I want to thank SEI Investments and all of the other corporate sponsors, for their efforts in bringing this world class tournament to southeastern Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania is a perfect spot for a tournament such as the SEI Pennsylvania Classic which will bring some of the game's top players to the area.  Pennsylvania has more than 600 public and private golf courses across the state that offer challenges to golfers of all skill levels, including mine, which is par 3, but the Pennsylvania Classic is more than just about golf.  It is significant tourism and economic development event for southeastern Pennsylvania.  Thousands of people will travel to this region to attend the tournament and be treated to golf being played at its highest level.  But the visitors will also stay in hotels in the area, they will eat in local restaurants; shop at local stores and they will visit local attractions.  So it is a win/win for Southeastern Pennsylvania because we get to host a world class family friendly professional golf tournament and we also get an opportunity to show some people what Pennsylvania has to offer as a tourist destination.  This event is good for golf and it is good for Pennsylvania's economy. 
We urge everyone to come to the tournament and to enjoy the golf and to see what Eastern Pennsylvania has to offer.  Thank you. 
(APPLAUSE).
JOE ROTELLINI:  Next is -- we have been fortunate to have someone from the mayors office join us today.  Actually I received a call late Friday night from the Mayor's scheduling secretary saying that he was making every effort to come today.  I spoke with Carolyn this morning.  He was in a cabinet meeting trying to get out. But he did not get out in time so he did not make it today. 
But really received some good news from Carolyn, this morning, the city is going to present us with a proclamation during tournament week, and the mayor is going to have a press conference down in City Hall, either on Monday or Tuesday, September 9th or 10th.  I think that's really special, so please keep that in mind as we get closer to that I am sure you will receive information from the mayors office.
But in the mayor's place we have somebody that's going to speak, but before I introduce this gentlemen, I'd like to recognize another person from the city that has really been a big help for us, we met back when we got into town in 1999 and each year Larry has been really trying to help us promote the event in Philadelphia. That's the executive director of Philadelphia's Sports Congress, Larry Needle. 
(APPLAUSE)
Larry has been a big help with us working with the mayor too so we really appreciative  your support. 
Representing the city of Philadelphia, the Assistant Director of Commerce, Mr.  Bill Fox.
(APPLAUSE).
BILL FOX: It is a pleasure to represent Mayor John Street of our great City of Philadelphia here today.  He sends his regrets.  His schedule prohibited him from being here. When he couldn't make it, he told his press secretary to send the best golfer on staff.  That's sort of like being the smartest kid in summer school by sending me. 
The Mayor is delighted that this prestigious SEI Classic is back in this area.  Our city can boast of our traditional annual event, Thanksgiving Day Parade, New Years Day Parade and our Broad Street run.  We have had two special events this year, the NBA All-Star game and the SEI Classic and it's no surprise Pat Croce  has had his hand in both.  The Mayor guaranteed two things.  One:  A week of weather like today.  Two, the drama and excitement of the last five holes that we witnessed yesterday in the Senior Open.  In closing, the mayor congratulates and thanks all members of the Classic.  Especially the people from SEI and the other sponsors.  And especially for the amount of money you raised for the local charities.  Thank you. 
(APPLAUSE)
JOE ROTELLINI:  I mentioned earlier our advertising campaign will begin in about two weeks.  Our adage we have been using, the DEM group has been really great to work with.  They are here today.  I'd like to give them some recognition as well.
Next on the agenda, is our SEI Investments, our title sponsor.  Again I keep referring back to 1999 but  that was a very -- obviously very important time of the event cause it really set the stages of what we're doing now.  The Tour headquarters, they were looking for a title sponsor for this unique event that rotates between Eastern and Western PA.  They came up with a couple different ideas.  We pitched them to local and regional companies and one of the first local companies to step up and have some interest is SEI Investments.  Since that time, they have really been a fine partner with us.  They brought some great things to the table that we have been doing and I think in return, they have been able to use this event in a very positive way for their clients and their employees.  Their employees too have stepped up and have done a great job volunteering for our tournament.  That says a lot about the camaraderie they have within their company. 
Before I introduce our guest speaker from SEI Investments, I'd like to recognize some members of their staff that are here today that we work with quite regularly.  I think they are all here.  Larry Wexler.  Kerry Caculen (phonetic),  Caryn Taylor-Lucia.  Michael Franks.  Diane Chambers.  And Stacy Guiles.  If you all could stand up and be recognized. 
(APPLAUSE). 
JOE ROTELLINI:  They have been very, very supportive in everything we have done.
Representing SEI is the executive vice-president Mr.  Carmen Romeo.  Carmen is on the board here at Waynesborough, and obviously is a member.  I don't know what kind of golfer he is.   He's never told us.  Maybe you have to tell us.  Carmen Romeo from SEI Investments.
(APPLAUSE).
CARMEN ROMEO: To answer your question I am not a very good golfer.  I am just a hacker like anybody else, but it is a delight to see the number of people that have turned out for this third event here at Waynesborough Country Club.  A lot larger crowd than the first media event that we had in July of 2000. 
In behalf of SEI, I want to thank the turnout today.  We're delighted to be part of this event.  It is a fabulous event for the area of Philadelphia.  It's in our own backyard.  We're located in Oaks Pennsylvania just up the road.  The charities that  benefit from the people that come out here to watch these great golfers play is fantastic.  We're delighted to have Robert here today to defend his Championship.  I pulled his bio from the internet site today and it said that some of his hobbies were fishing and fast cars.  Well, I hope you like fast greens as well because they are awful fast here at Waynesborough Country Club.  Believe me, you will see.
But you could handle them.   I am sure you will.
So we're delighted to have you here today, and to defend your Championship in September. 
So, in behalf of employees of SEI, and our clients who will enjoy this event as they have for the last for the last two years, again I want to thank you for coming out and let's get a great turnout here.  Thanks again. 
(APPLAUSE). 
JOE ROTELLINI:  Before we introduce our next speaker which is our defending champion I would like to have you look at -- we have four monitors in the room where we have a little highlight tape from last year's event.
(VIDEO PLAYED)
JOE ROTELLINI: Real quick on Robert.  He is one of only three players to win multiple events in 2000 and 2001.  Finished in the top-30 in 2000 and 2001.  Four-time winner on the PGA TOUR, 12-time winner internationally, three-time member of The Presidents Cup team.  This past weekend played really well, finished with 66, 66 to place 9th in Memphis.  So we're real pleased and proud that Robert took time out of his busy schedule to come be with us today.  He's heading  to Chicago right after this press conference to play in the Western Open.  Let me introduce our 2001 defending champion Robert Allenby. 
(APPLAUSE). 
ROBERT ALLENBY:   Ladies and gentlemen, it's nice to come back.  I think whenever you come back to defend a tournament it's always a nice feeling anyway.  It's kind of strange, Chuck before took me out around the course and I have never played here before, so I don't even know what to expect.  I saw some shots and of Chris DiMarco when he won here a couple of years ago.  Maybe he should be standing here this year and then next year I will go up and stand up at the other course.  But it will kind of seem funny but I went around the course and had a look, and I wish we could play more courses like this one, and the one we played last year. 
The Tour needs golf courses like this.  These are more traditional, and I think this is the way that -- this is the way that I would love to see the golf courses on the Tour go.  Because this is a classic design and it has been here a long time, and it's well established, and it's got just a beautiful countryside.  And I look forward to coming back here in a couple of months time to defend.
I don't really know what else really I should probably say, but if anyone's got any questions  -- do I open it up like that?  Would you like me to talk about something else?  (Laughter).
Obviously it's very nice to see so many people come.  I have been very fortunate three other times to defend a Championship, and all three of those times I have never seen this amount of people in the room at the Media Day.  So all credit to everyone here today and to the tournament for gathering so many people that can promote this tournament and really put it on the map where it should be because it should be one of the best tournaments there is on the Tour.  There's no reason why it shouldn't.  It's got great sponsors, great golf course, and if we can get a lot of people out to the golf course it is going to make it very exciting.  Hopefully I can do exactly what I did back then.  So I will definitely look forward to coming here and telling a few more players to get off their butts and come down here as well.  Thank you. 
(APPLAUSE).
JOE ROTELLINI:  As I had mentioned earlier, advertising campaign will begin in a couple of weeks but we're sell tickets presently through TicketMaster.Com.  Again if you can let the public know that tickets are on sale and you will see heavy advertisement starting in a couple of weeks and escalating to the time of tournament week. 
Again Robert, thank you for coming and congratulation on last year and hopefully you will be able to do it again this year here at Waynesborough. 
Our last speaker is someone that everybody in Philadelphia knows but I just wanted to touch on a couple of things.  He has graced the cover of many magazines, worldwide most recently he was on the cover INC. Magazine.  He's a NEW YORK TIMES best selling author.  And if you watched TV last night he's even trying his hand at acting which he does very well.  I don't know if there's anything, Pat, that you don't do well.  Everything you putt your hands on, you have mastered.  
As President of the  76ers, the team rose from worst to first.  His dynamic personality and business success has made him a true Philadelphia icon and that's one of the reasons why we approached him over the winter to be a part of our very special event.  Without reservation he accepted and he has been great to work with.  He came in early today with Robert and they were down on the 10th green and 90 degrees filming a commercial, doing a radio spot, you are going to see him on a lot of our advertising billboards, print, and like I said, earlier on TV and on radio.  He's really been very giving of his time.  We all know he's a very, very busy man.  Without anything further, I'd like to introduce our 2002 tournament chairman Mr.  Pat Croce. 
(APPLAUSE)
PAT CROCE:  Thanks, Joe.  Good afternoon.  It's great to see a lot of my old friends here.  I got involved as Joe said because I am a Philadelphian.  I am proud to be one and I believe that the SEI Pennsylvania Classic should be renamed the SEI  Philadelphia classic.  And the only way we're going to do is that if we have a great event, great turnout, great sponsorship, bring everyone out to the Tri-State area and just enjoy themselves at a great course.  I am also here because money goes to charities.  I heard three charities but they are all Montgomerie, Chester County, I want to hear some  Philadelphia city charities as well and again, they will be.  Right, Joe?   Just making sure. 
Robert, come on up here.  I had the opportunity to get to know Robert as we did this commercial.  And what I  didn't mention is one of the things I learned was he had eight Playoffs.  And he won every one of them.  In addition to that, he spends his time and his money and his talent with charities.  One of his big ones is with kids in Australia.  So I invite everyone in our whole Tri-State area to come out and watch Robert defend his title right here in September.  It's going to be gorgeous weather as we have been promised.  Are you going to win this baby again? 
ROBERT ALLENBY: I am sure going to give it my damndest.  I am going to try as hard as I can.  These guys  are good out here I am going to give it my best shot. 
PAT CROCE: We  welcome everyone to come out.  Let me leave Robert up here because I know you have questions for him.  Thanks. 
(APPLAUSE)
ROBERT ALLENBY: That's it, okay, bye.  (Laughter).

Q.   (Inaudible)?
ROBERT ALLENBY: It was kind of funny because -- not funny, it was not funny at all, but just thinking on that I think a lot of the players you know, we are there to play golf but at the same time there was a lot on everyone's mind, not just in this country, around the world.  Obviously coming from Australia we sent troops over as well, and I live here full-time with my family, and it was I guess like everyone, a shock, you know, you don't -- you can't -- ever before that you can't imagine that to actually happen.  It was like a movie, a movie gone wrong.  So going into that tournament you know, I practiced the week before on and off, and down at St. Louis where we called the tournament off for the American Express, and for all good reasons too.  I actually -- I wasn't sure if whether we should play this tournament or not.  But obviously the thing is we had to get back to our normal stuff, our normal day-to-day stuff.  We had to show the bad guys that we all can recover from this and the quicker we get back on our feet the better we are going to be. 
But that wasn't the reason why I played so well.  I said to my wife Sandy on the Thursday morning or actually the Wednesday night, I was just talking, I was saying I don't feel like playing.  I am a bit flat.  And the Thursday was the 20th, and that was my son's birthday.  And so anyway he was two years old, and that pretty much  -- I played Thursday and I don't think I  -- I think I did okay, but nothing spectacular.  We had a little party for him that night, and then I kind of saw reality and where my roots were, and just you know, I had to get  -- had to take that off my mind and put my son in my mind, and that's what I did for the rest of the three days.  Everything was about my son, Harry, and just having his second birth day.  It took my mind off of what was going on and went out there and performed really well . 
I can honestly say that mentally that
 was the best I have ever played mentally on a golf course before.  Obviously after 911 it's definitely a tournament that I will remember for a long, long time. 

Q.   Do you remember anything that you heard from some of the players that did play near 2000 (inaudible)  --
ROBERT ALLENBY: I had heard that  -- first of all, I watched it on TV I saw some shots, saw some holes and it looked like a great golf course.  And Chris was playing pretty awesome and again after the tournament, like a couple weeks later I played, and went out and played one of the tournaments and everyone said that the course was one of the best on the Tour.  And I was like, dan, I wish I would have gone.  Last year the tournament came and I thought, well, I know it's in a different venue but I am going do this time because I heard around this area or this whole countryside around here has got some great golf courses.  And so I went.  I saw it.  I experienced last year's and I thought that experience was pretty good and so I am hoping to try and repeat that at this venue. 
From what I saw today looks like a great golf course.  I think it sets up really well for he.  I hit the ball pretty long and pretty straight, and I know the rough was pretty long last time they played here, and I am sure it will be really long this time.  The greens looks like they have got a fair bit of trickiness to them, especially No. 9.  That looks pretty tricky.  So I am really looking forward to getting out here and playing.  It just  -- I think it suits my game. 
I love tough golf courses.  I love golf courses that are surrounded by trees down the side of the fairways.  It's got a lot of character.  It makes it fun to go out and play when golf courses have a lot of character to them.

Q.   (Inaudible)
ROBERT ALLENBY: It is not us that make those decisions.  We just use them.  (Laughter) Sometimes we get paid to use them.  But you know, I think a golf course like this one -- I think Chris was 14-under when he won here and second was 8-under.  So six shots is a big difference between first and second, and obviously this golf course sets up pretty tough, especially if they grow the rough.  Fairways are quite narrow.  Yet  -- if you  -- didn't matter how long the golf course is, if you have a golf course that got long rough, fairways are quite tight, and the greens are quite hard and fast, it doesn't matter how good technology is because you have got to hit the fairway.  You can use a broomstick and still try and hit it on the fairway as well -- using whatever -- the equipment that we use today.  The golf course like this you have got hit the fairway.  If you miss the fairway, it's going to be pretty hard coming into some of these greens.  Some of them look quite small.  Obviously there's some big ones out there, but they are not real deep.  There's a few wide ones and not a lot of depth in the actual greens and if the greens are really hard and fast that makes it pretty tricky. 
If you can toughen up the golf  course it's going to make it a lot tougher for us to play it.  Just look at the U.S. Open, a couple weeks ago, few weeks ago at Bethpage, I mean, that didn't look too easy; did it?  Technology didn't really win there too much.  But if that's the way you got to go, that's the way you got to go.  If you have got to grow 4, 5 inche rough, then what is wrong with that?  That can't be that bad.  I am not in a position where I can say stop technology.  I am in a position where I can just, okay, I will try that.  And go out and use it.  The USGA and the R&A  make the rules, and you know,  technology is a way of life.    Imagine having a TV like you used to have 40 odd years ago, whenever, the first TV that came out, look at the TV now, you can buy any size you want.  It is like a driver.  Now you can buy any size driver you want.  I mean, I probably rambled on enough with that.  Technology is technology.  That's just the way of life these days, and it is good for your game.  Isn't it?  (Laughter) I am sure they will come out with something soon though. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I think over half of the Tour flying private jets now.  So that's definitely made a wig change there.  The private jet industry is a boon (sic), so to speak, they have no   -- I guess we travel every week on an airplane.  I am sure there's a lot of people in this room -- there's a lot of people that travel on an airplane every week, or most weeks, and you know, obviously since 911 it has changed a lot of peoples attitudes and a lot people are more cautious and now people are spending a little bit more money to try and feel a little bit safer.  But that's a personal thing.  But I think we're very fortunate and very lucky that we have great sponsors for all these tournaments that we do play in that do allow us to be able to travel like that.  That's only because we have great sponsors, that we're able to travel the way we.
JOE ROTELLINI: Thank you very much.
