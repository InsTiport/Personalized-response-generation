 Q.  63 around the Old Course St. Andrews. Don't get many of them?  
JUSTIN WALTERS: No, I haven't shot anything under 69 or 68 in a long time. To do it here at St. Andrews, and the emotions I've been through the last few months, it's just so special.   
 Q.  144 in Race to Dubai; how do you feel like you've managed to turn the corner, because clearly you had to play some wonderful stuff to shoot a number like that.  
JUSTIN WALTERS: Well, been swinging really well all year mostly, from about U.S. Open when I qualified, and I got to The Irish Open and tore my hamstring, my calf, really badly, and really struggled to get right again after a while, and I finally got over that, and then I lost my dad.   
It was quite hard. I just kind of decided not to feel sorry for myself, really, and kind of dust myself off and come in here, it has a healing quality. I don't know, it's hard to describe. I was here with my dad when we lost Mum, and just thought I was back with him.   
 Q.  Lots of people out there who have been through pain like that before. In what way do you feel like you have a different mission with what you're doing? Do you feel like you're in a different place and do you feel like he's with you?  
JUSTIN WALTERS: Yeah, I don't think they ever go away to be honest. But like I said, I've been swinging really well for a while now, and I think I just had to let Justin get a game. I think for most of the time, it was just me trying to control things and trying to make things happen. Today I was just so much better at that.   
You know when you're practising and working on things, you can feel things turning. Certainly last week and this week, I could feel things turning a little bit. It doesn't always mean much. You can't go out there expecting anything. But just had a good time.
