  JUSTIN WALTERS:   Well, it's a lot better than I expected initially, but very, very excited.   I'm happy with the game and where I stand after two days, especially amongst a strong field, which I haven't had too much experienced with, so I'm super chuffed.  
   
 Q.   You're making birdie after birdie, there's so many chances out there.   
JUSTIN WALTERS:   Certainly if you drive it well, and then hit a few good shots, there's a lot of opportunities.   Most of the par 5s are reachable, so if you can put some good drives out there, you can attack.   
Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of birdies out there and hopefully they continue.   
   
 Q.   When you first got here, was it one of those courses where you stood on the tee and thought, I like this?   
JUSTIN WALTERS:   I certainly liked the look of it.   It certainly reminded me of Portugal a little bit, which I have good feelings from a month ago.   But yes, it's one of the most beautiful courses I've played in a long time, it's so well manicured, the trees, the weather, everything.   So I'm really enjoying being here.  
   
 Q.   I did wonder if you would reference Portugal, because there's so many similarities, we are right on the Med, probably a few more trees to get way around here.   
JUSTIN WALTERS:   There are a few more trees, and yeah at the moment, I'm trying to stay away from them.   
Certainly brings back a lot of memories from Portugal and it was a really emotional and special moment, so it's all continuing again.   On Monday we had my mom's Memorial service again.   I came into this week in a very similar mindâ€‘set.
