Q. Being inside the top three, were you nervous?
CATERINA DON: Of course, getting a chance to play on Saturday at Augusta is something I really look forward to, and I mean, I was a bit nervous.  I actually made a bogey, but yeah, I never wanted a putt like from two meters to play or not to play, so getting in with clear shots ahead to go there, was fine.
But you know, you never get not nervous if you have the chance to play there in a tournament like this.
Q. And so you started, you were 2-over after three today.  How did you bring it back?
CATERINA DON: I mean, it was a tough start.  I don't like -- they are beautiful, but I don't feel comfortable playing the second nine.  They are really tough, tricky, and on the fourth hole, so that was hole 13, I went into the trees, and I saved a par.  So that gave me confidence to go on to the second nine and shoot some birdies.
Q. I know you're going to play at Georgia, how did that come about?  You're from Italy.
CATERINA DON: I've played a lot of tournaments around Europe, and I went to Canada three times to play the world junior girls, and they contacted me after the world junior girls and I went to visit and I fell in love with the place.  It's really nice, and it's really nice that I get to play my first tournament in the US in Georgia really close to where I will be for the next four years.  It's a nice place.  It's really, really nice.
Q. So Saturday, how nervous will you be playing that course?
CATERINA DON: I mean, well, nervous, of course.  It's not an every day thing to play Augusta in a tournament.  I mean, it's going to be tough, but I want to go out and do my best, and then what will come, will come.  Happy for now, and I'll do my best and we'll see what comes.
