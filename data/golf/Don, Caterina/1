  Q. From Athens up the road, do you feel a local vibe here?
 CATERINA DON:   You know, it's really nice because you get a lot of support and a lot of people said "Go Dawgs" today and it's something that it's unusual for us and for women's golf, and I love it.  And I enjoyed being from Georgia today and I enjoyed every day and it's such a special support, especially from being like an hour and 30 from home.
 Q. Talk about the nerves you felt.
 CATERINA DON:   I was talking with ANA that played with me and I already played two years ago, and I had nerves and I was thinking, it doesn't change.  Like the nerves are still there and it's still very, very -- you know, your hands are kind of shaking on the first tee and when you hit that shot you're just so happy to be there.
 Q. Was it easier this time around?
 CATERINA DON:   I think the greens are a little firmer, and I struggled a little bit more today.  But definitely knowing the course, one thing I knew was that it doesn't play like a normal golf course.  Sometimes you get in a situation where you might have to chip when you're back to the hole and just let it run and accept that it's going to go maybe 20 feet by but that's the best you can do.
 Q. Can you tell us about your putt on 18?
 CATERINA DON:   It was just -- it had been a rough day and I didn't hit a good -- I hit a bad drive in the woods and I laid up and had not a really good number, and I finished on the top level.  Then my back was facing the hole and I made what I think is an incredible put.  I think it's a really nice way to finish this week.
