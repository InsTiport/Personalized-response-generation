Q.
You flew under the radar, but kind of a fantastic Sunday.
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, I played well today.  It was playing a lot different, the conditions.  The ball wasn't flying as far.  I played really well today.  It was one of the best rounds I've played all week, and the way the pin placements were and the conditions, I felt really good about it.
Q.  Are you surprised nobody else really took the charge?  Holmes has gotten to 20 under, but nobody else really made a huge difference today.
STEVE LOWERY:  Those greens are pretty tough.  I mean, it's tough to hole the putts and get them up there, but it's pretty tough to get them in.  I can see why on the weekend there was less guys making putts.
Q.  The young guys, Holmes, was steady Eddie, even par on the front side.  He obviously made some noise on the back side.  Are you impressed with his demeanor?  He's been a pretty cool customer.
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, he really is.  He was really impressive yesterday.  He drives the ball, everybody talks about that.  He made every putt yesterday and shot like 65.  It was just solid, solid play.
Q.  This round for you, what does it do for you in terms of confidence and going forward?
STEVE LOWERY:  Well, it was big.  I knew to have a big weekend, I was right around there, I just needed to have a good Sunday, and this week I did.  It'll give me a lot of confidence going into the weeks ahead.  Nice to get off to a good start this year.
