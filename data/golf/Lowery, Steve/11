Q.  Tell me a little bit about your round today.
STEVE LOWERY:  It started getting dark early out there at the end.  I played good, shot 3 under on the front, played okay, hit one shot in the water on 13.  So I played good, good solid day.
Q.  What was the best part of your round today?
STEVE LOWERY:  I drove it well and I made some good putts for birdies.  I think the driving was probably the best I did all day.
Q.  If there's something you can work on for tomorrow or something you can improve for tomorrow, what would it be?
STEVE LOWERY:  Getting some of those putts to go in probably.  I hit a lot of lips, and that's the way it goes.
Q.  Did the greens start to get more difficult toward the end of the day?
STEVE LOWERY:  They seemed slow.  I mean, the putting green is really fast.  The greens were slower than the putting green, so it's hard to get adjusted to that.
Q.  Do you have a plan for tomorrow?
STEVE LOWERY:  Just try to hit the fairway and try to hole some putts.
