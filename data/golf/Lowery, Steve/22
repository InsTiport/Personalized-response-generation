STEVE LOWERY:  You know, it was a game of momentum because of the break and everything.  I played good early, and then we had the break and kind of went out and made some pars and three birdies at the finish, so it's up-and-down momentum all day.
Q.  I'm sure you've been through rain delays before, but there's got to be a little something extra when you're at the top of the leaderboard.  Is there anything you do with a rain delay, maybe you've got a structured schedule of how you treat a rain delay?
STEVE LOWERY:  No, not really.  It worked to my advantage.  I had a double bogey on 17, so I kind of needed a break.  It worked out good for me to have a little break there, so it kind of worked out for me today.
