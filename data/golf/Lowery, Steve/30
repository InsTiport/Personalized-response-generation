JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Like to welcome Steve Lowery to the interview room.  Steve, thanks for taking a couple minutes to talk with us.  Great round today.  To know of birdies.  And some tough conditions. 
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Talk about it a little bit.
STEVE LOWERY:  It played tough today.  It was really windy and tough to pull the right club.  Couple of those elevations I think on 10 and 11 were really tough in the wind. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Questions? 
Q.  I remember in 1994 you said on 17 you hit driver, 5-iron up there and made eagle.  Some of the equipment has changed a little bit over the past few years.  What did you hit in there today and has it changed a little bit nor you?
STEVE LOWERY:  Well, that's a little bit unfair to say because it's playing straight down wind.  But I hit 3-wood, 8-iron today and I think Kenny Perry hit driver, wedge.  It's definitely changed a lot.  But the golf course is playing longer than it used to play.  The fairways are mowed in a certain way and the ball's not rolling out like it used to. 

Q.  Do you have any flashbacks to 1994?  Winning here is always a nice thing when you're going into the weekend?
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah it's always good to come back to a golf course you won on.  I eagled 17 yesterday.  So that's, that hole's been pretty good to me. 

Q.  Follow-up question.  You didn't play the British Open.  Is there any advantage for guys who didn't have to make that long trip and then come back here and it's more or less a seamless transition?
STEVE LOWERY:  I don't know about that.  The British Open is a great event, but obviously Ernie played great there and Steve Elkington might have been a little tired.  I played with him today.  He might have been tired.  But that's a great event over there. 

Q.  Back in 1994 were you aware that that's the same number of points you had after two days that you had then?
STEVE LOWERY:  No.  I had no idea.  The only thing I remember about that is that I won and I made two eagles on 14 and 17.  That's all I recall about that. 

Q.  You said the fairways are mowed a certain way here.  Is it like Augusta where they mowed them back toward the tee?
STEVE LOWERY:  I'm not sure, but I know in '94 I remember hitting a 4-iron into number one at least two of the days and I've hit 4-wood to it twice this week.  I don't know if they're just a little softer.  Obviously they built a few new tees since then.  On holes  8 and 14, I think.  But the golf course plays longer than it used to. 

Q.  Ernie had a pretty good day today too.  Do you bother about who may be chasing you this weekend?
STEVE LOWERY:  Not really.  My job is to play the golf course and keep playing the way I'm playing and that's really what I'm trying to do.  In '94 it kind of proved I was 10 points behind and won in a playoff.  So you can't really worry about what everybody else is doing.  You go out and play your game.  I shot 6-under today.  Some tough conditions.  And if I keep playing like that I got a good chance to win.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Can we go through your card birdies and bogeys. 
STEVE LOWERY:  Okay. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Started on 1. 
STEVE LOWERY:  I started on 1. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  You had a birdie on number 5. 
STEVE LOWERY:  Okay.  Yeah.  5 I hit a driver and an 8-iron about 12 feet there.  And then I made the putt. 
6, I hit driver and my gap wedge and hit it about three feet.  That was a tap in. 
7, I hit 9-iron to the green wasn't holding.  The ball probably rolled about 35 feet and I was able to hole that putt. 
9, I hit 3-wood and I think it was 9-iron right behind the hole there about 18 feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  You had a bogey on 11.
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, I made bogey on 11.  I made a good save on 10.  I made a good save.  I got up-and-down from about 70 yards for par. 
And then 11 I hit a good shot, misjudged the wind and it went over the green.  And really made a pretty good 2-putt.  Made about a six foot bogey putt there.  On 11.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  What club did you use.
STEVE LOWERY:  I hit, I was first one to hit in our group and felt the wind was in our face and hit a 6-iron. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  And then the birdie on 12. 
STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, I got kind of fortunate.  I was in the rough on the left and had a pretty good lie and hit a wedge out of there.  Kind of hit it soft in front of the green and rolled up about 12 feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  13.
STEVE LOWERY:  13 was into the wind I hit a driver and an 8-iron about 15 feet. 
17, I hit 3-wood, 8-iron in the bunker and hit the bunker shot out about three feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Couple more questions?  You guy's all set?  All right. 
STEVE LOWERY:  All right. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Appreciate it. 
STEVE LOWERY:  Thank you.
