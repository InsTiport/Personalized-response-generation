  Q.  Steve Lowery.  Comment on, first of all, that birdie right there, that almost eagle.  Definitely put you right in the cut line at this point.  Talk about your feelings on how much you needed that putt.   
 STEVE LOWERY:  Well, you know, I was trying to make it.  I made 6 birdies today so that one really wasn't any different than the rest of them.  You know, I played pretty good and made a few too many mistakes.  Made a couple of bogies, four bogies but, you know, I had a pretty solid day.   
  
  Q.  How much pressure do you feel?  You know, you're 146 in the FedExCup standing.  Do you feel pressure to move up this week to get in next week?   
 STEVE LOWERY:  Not so much.  Just wanting to play well, I think.  I've been hurt this year so I haven't played half the year that I normally play so it's a little different for me because I know I haven't played.  This is my 15th tournament.   
  
  Q.  In general, you know, in the past we've always had the people under the 125 number, the 70 number, the 30 number.  Is it weird now maybe with the focus earlier on different numbers and then maybe later in the year having that focus again?   
 STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, it's definitely different.  It's my 18th year.  It's never been that way.  It's a lot different.  You know, all you can do is go out and play the best you can do and finish good.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it's accomplishing any other excitement that they're trying generate?   
 STEVE LOWERY:  I hope they will the next few weeks.  I don't think it's as much of a buildup to it that it needs to be.  I don't think the fans know all the ins and outs of it.  Hopefully we'll see how it goes.
