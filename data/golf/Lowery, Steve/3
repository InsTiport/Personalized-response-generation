 Q. The opening round was the epitome of patience around here at Riviera. You started off with three birdies and then come to No. 8 and 9 and go, no, that's too good a start. Let me go back to even. 
 STEVE LOWERY: Yeah, exactly. You're expecting to birdie No. 1, I didn't. And I birdied No. 2 here. So it was a crazy day. I made some good putts and had an 8-iron from the middle of the fairway on 8 and made double bogey and then three-putted 9, so kind of gave it all back. 
 Kind of regrouped a little bit on the back and made a few birdies and kind of held it all together coming in.

 Q. How do you do that coming off a double bogey and a bogey to finish nine holes? How do you tell yourself just slow down, I've got nine more holes to play?
 STEVE LOWERY: Well, I didn't feel like walking up that hill, so I figured I had to do it on the back nine. I got up-and-down on 10 out of a bunker and that kind of calmed me down a little bit, for par. Just kind to just be patient and just -- I knew the golf course was tough, and there's not going to be super low scores here. Hang in there the best you can, keep hitting shots.

 Q. Were you surprised making four birdies on the back nine and getting in at 4-under?
 STEVE LOWERY: Maybe a little bit. DJ chipped in for 2 on 10 and kind of got the whole group woke up a little bit there and made eagle, and then I think we all birdied 11, so we had kind of a good vibe there after the first couple holes on the back. I made a few more putts than they did coming in.
