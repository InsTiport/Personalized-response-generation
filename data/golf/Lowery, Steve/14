Q.  Can you talk about your round today?
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah, it was a little bit different today.  Yesterday I made eight birdies.  Today started off, made a bunch of pars, bogeyed 6 and birdied 9 to shoot even on the front.

And then I played a little better on the back.  Birdied 10 and 13 and 15, and just kind of played solid.  I think I had five birdies and one bogey, a lot more consistent round today.
Q.  9 under, still obviously right in the middle of things.  Looking to tomorrow, what are your thoughts going into tomorrow?
STEVE LOWERY:   I'm playing good.  I think it's just a matter of going out and continuing to do what I've been doing.  I'm executing pretty well, so hopefully it should be same conditions.  The greens were a little rough in the afternoon, but temperatures are up, so we'll just have to see how it goes.
Q.  With J.J. Henry putting in a good round like he did today, obviously there's birdies to be had out here.
STEVE LOWERY:   10 under, that's pretty awesome.  You've got to tip your hat to that.  That's an unbelievable round.  We have two more days to catch him and we'll see how that goes.
