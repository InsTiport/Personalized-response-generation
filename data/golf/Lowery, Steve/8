 Q.  66 on the day today, though.  I mean, you were playing really well. 
 STEVE LOWERY:  Yeah, I hit 18 greens so I had 18 chances and hit one Par 5 in two, so played good and made a few putts early.  Just couldn't get them to go in late, but I played good. 

 Q.  Everyone's talking about how great the greens are out here.  They're really fast.  I saw a couple times you got above the hole, and when you do that you just can't be aggressive, can you? 
 STEVE LOWERY:  No.  It's defense when you get above the hole here.  You got to keep it below the hole and try to make them when you get the chances.  But, yeah, those downhill putts are quick. 

 Q.  Now, we are in Vegas.  Have you been having a good time? 
 STEVE LOWERY:  I always have a good time in Vegas.  I'm not a big gambler, so I stay a way from that a little bit.  But I have a good time. 

 Q.  Been to any of the shows?  Wifey doing any shopping? 
 STEVE LOWERY:  We've been doing a little shopping. 

 Q.  That can be dangerous in Vegas. 
 JOHN HUSTON:  That is dangerous.  Already been dangerous. 

 Q.  Well, 66.  Well done today.  Keep having a great week, Steve. 
 STEVE LOWERY:  All right.  Thanks a lot.
