 Q.   Tell us about that eagle on 9.   
STEVE LOWERY:   That last hole?   
   
 Q.   Was it a putt or did you knock one in?  
STEVE LOWERY:   No, I hit a 3‑wood from 253 yards about three and a half, four feet up there.   I was able to make it.  
   
 Q.   Into the wind sort of?  
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah, the second shot was.   The first shot was down to the right and the second shot was down into the wind a little bit, but I got a good bounce.  
   
 Q.   Heck of a finish.   2‑under.   That puts you right up there.   
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah, thanks.  
   
 Q.   How did the rest of the round go?  
STEVE LOWERY:   It got off to a little slow start, but I ended up shooting 3‑under on the front.   Started off kind of slow, but then played good after the last probably 15 holes I played good.  
   
 Q.   Did you start on 1 or 10?  
STEVE LOWERY:   Started on 10.   I parred 10.  
Bogeyed 11 and 12.  
Then birdied 13 and got going after that.   Kind of a slow start, but finished good.  
   
 Q.   Did the wind calm down during the course of the round?  
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah, it didn't blow that hard.   It can really blow here.   It was probably normal day here.   
   
 Q.   Did you play the course two years ago?  
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You're somewhat familiar with it.   Does that help?  
STEVE LOWERY:   Yeah.   It's in great shape, I can tell you that.
