SCOTT STROHMEYER: Wasn't too bad, because I just kind of had my head down.  My caddie and I were just trying to focus on one shot at a time.  I knew it was going to be tough to do that, and I was proud of myself for how I executed my game plan.   
I just didn't have my best stuff today as far as my golf swing.  Essentially was going to be tough to catch Ryan who played amazing.  But I'm pleased with my performance.   
 Q.  I think you impressed a lot of people, to say the least.  With a top 10 finish you'll be able to play in Vegas next week.  Can you absorb all that?  
SCOTT STROHMEYER: Just excited to have another tournament to play in.  After missing at first stage I didn't know if I was going to be playing the rest of the year.  Each event I can get in is going to be great.  Just trying to get as many points, money, however all that works out, to get some PGA TOUR status.
