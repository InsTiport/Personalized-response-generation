Q.   Just explain the ruling on Ryan. 
STEVE RINTOUL:   Yeah, Ryan Moore had an unfortunate incident on the 11th green where he had addressed his ball for a tap‑in.   The putt was only 12 inches long.   And he'd addressed his ball and then thereafter the ball moved, so under Rule 18‑2b, if you address the ball and the ball moves, you're deemed to have forced it to move. 
The new exception to the rule that's new this year that's got everybody hung up is the exception means‑‑ refers to if a wind or an outside agency like a bee or a fly on the green had caused his ball to move, we can get him out if he's virtually certain that he didn't cause it, it was the wind or the beetle or the fly.   But in this case we've got no wind, we've got nothing else down there, and the decision specifically refers to gravity.   If a ball moves because of gravity, that's just part of the game, just settled.   That's what happened to Ryan, the ball just settled, unfortunately, right after he addressed it.
