 Q.  Was there anything?  
STEVE RINTOUL: Yeah, one stroke.   
 Q.  What was the rule?  Do you have the rule number?  
STEVE RINTOUL: Yeah, it's 18-2b actually when a player causes his ball to move.  When we went through it with Harold in the fairway he told me he hadn't grounded a club behind the ball.   
In other words, he did nothing to cause the ball to move.  Afterwards, immediately afterwards in fact, the TV footage showed that ball had moved with his club grounded behind the ball, which Harold said, I don't think I grounded my club.   
 Q.  So when he saw it he realized...  
STEVE RINTOUL: And the way the rule reads right now, John, it's more likely than not that he did cause it to move.
