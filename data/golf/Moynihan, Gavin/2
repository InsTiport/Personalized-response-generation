Q. Couple of nice rounds to start your week here in France. 68, 69, 5-under par, good shape. What's your assessment of the way you put it together?
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, it's been good. Today was actually a bit better than yesterday. It was way tougher today, though. The ball was going a lot shorter. The wind at the start, the first seven, eight, nine holes, was probably the strongest I've played in a long time.
To be 2-under, bogey-free up until 14, which was a bit of a scrappy bogey, but overall a very good day. Especially with the finish, the last four, after the bogey on 14, it was good to have some good swings coming in. Very happy.
Q. Talk about those last four holes, because we know they are an iconic stretch of holes on this golf course. As a player, what are you staffed with to par for those last four?
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: I'm already looking for par -- just trying to give myself four good tee shots, four solid tee shots even. So if you hit tee shots away, two of them are actually birdie -- I flew it at the hole on 16.
Q. Give us the details of the shot.
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: 8-iron, 169 it was, smooth, because it was pretty good downwind in the air. I was thinking it was going to be 20-foot past going backup the slope and straight down. Thought it was going to go in the water at one point but it went down and obviously had spin coming out of the hole and spun back to probably 12-, 15-foot feet.
Yeah, everyone on the tee was reminding me of the car. I was happy with par, but I couldn't believe it stayed out.
