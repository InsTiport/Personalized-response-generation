 Q.  You told us yesterday the game felt better than it did on Thursday. How did it feel today, 68?  
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, it was bogey-free today, which around this golf course is probably stealing a few. Fairly good today. A few nice up-and-downs on the front nine to kind of just keep the round going. It was a nice day, as well. If you played well today, you could get a score. Yeah, very happy.   
 Q.  You birdied the 13th, which caused all sort of problems, we've seen 9s, double-bogeys, and you also birdied 15, one of the hardest holes on the course.  
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: 13, I had a NICE number, but 15 was like stealing one there. Doesn't really matter, downwind, into the wind, and maybe just hit the green in two and 2-putting it out of there. Had a nice putt out there about 15 feet past.   
Bottom line, play this week has been not stress free, but it's been good. Hopefully keep it coming for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Talk about stress free. Obviously you're in in the situation where you're in The Race to Dubai, but you said you're not going to focus on that. Is it literally tomorrow, focus on winning this tournament, and not letting the other stuff get in your mind at awe?  
GAVIN MOYNIHAN: I haven't thought about it once this week. I played Challenge Tour last week in Ireland and I played very chilled out golf. Similar conditions last week I think really helped kind of gear up for this week. It was tough. It was raining. Wind, long rough. So yeah, it's been a speedy transition last week to this week. Just free wheel it tomorrow again and see where that leaves us.
