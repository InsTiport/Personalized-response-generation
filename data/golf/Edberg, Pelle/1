Q. Thoughts on how you've come through a tough old day here?
PELLE EDBERG: Once again, I wasn't great off the tee.  I'm quite pleased with 1-under today.
Q. Said you were going to go away and work hard on that.  Did you find any benefit on the range?
PELLE EDBERG: I didn't actually, no.  But I think I hit it a little, little bit better today than yesterday but still, it's not even close to good enough.
Q. And yet, in winds like this, you've clearly got it around and showing some resilience.  That must make you very proud?
PELLE EDBERG: Very much.  So the rough is quite -- well, it's not that thick, so you do get away with some bad shots.  Two times today, I had to sort of chip sideways and I don't want to do that tomorrow.
Q. Do you tell yourself, look, I'm still in this and keep knuckled down?
PELLE EDBERG: Yeah, definitely, hopefully it continues.  There's not too many birdie chances out there and just keep grinding.  Yeah, hopefully can be up there tomorrow.
Q. Back to the range?  Thoughts on tomorrow?
PELLE EDBERG: Not back to the range.  Thoughts for tomorrow is I'm just going to try and do whatever I've been doing and hopefully hit a few more fairways and give myself a few more chances.
