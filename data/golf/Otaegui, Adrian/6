 Q.  That's a fantastic round of 65 to finish the tournament.  You were pretty hot around the greens today?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, has been a very good round for me, a very good Sunday.  I was disappointed yesterday with a level par round, playing solid and not putting well.  Today I kept playing the same but I putted much better.  So six birdies, no bogeys, is always a very good way to finish.   
 Q.  Is there a difference in the putting?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, I changed my putting grip, and that gave me a little bit more, I don't know, more feeling and rhythm, so I putted really, really good today.   
 Q.  To shoot two rounds of 65 on this golf course is impressive, and it is a low-scoring course but you can be aggressive?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: You can make birdies if you play well on this course.  You have to find the fairway and find the good part of the green, but I played really solid all week.  I'm very happy the way I played all week, and I'm good with the way I finished.   
 Q.  Only three dropped shots all week, and all those came yesterday, so that shows how good the game is at the moment?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, as I said, I played very good all four days.  Yesterday, yeah, I did a couple of mistakes and that's why I had those dropped shots.  But three rounds with no bogeys, is very good.
