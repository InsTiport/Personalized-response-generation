 Q.  You made a fantastic fight of it at the end, birdies on 16 and 17 but just not quite enough in the end?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yes, to be honest, I'm happy with the way I played.  I started well, giving me some birdie chances, which is what I wanted.  I played 3-under on the front nine, which was very good, and then just dropped a couple of shots on 11 and 13, which was a shame.   
I started missing some greens on the beginning of the back nine.  But after the second, I just said, well, restart from zero and see if we can make some birdies.  I'm happy with the way I finished with three birdies on the last five holes, so that was good.   
 Q.  All three scores under 70, normally that would be good enough to win a tournament.  So your game is in very good shape at the moment?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: I played solid the whole four days.  It was very, very regular, very solid play.  Obviously there are a couple of guys who played better than me, but I'm happy with the way I felt on the course after a big break, a big summer break.  And, well, I think I worked well from Monday to Wednesday, so I'm very happy now to be like this on Sunday.   
 Q.  Some massive crowds here over the weekend and they are very appreciative of the golf.  Is it nice to be part of the drama on the final day?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yes, it was very good.  All week the crowds have been there helping all the players and cheering for the players.  It's perfect for the players.
