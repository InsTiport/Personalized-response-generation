 Q.  A bogey-free round of 67, that's some going, isn't it?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: It's always very pleasant to not drop a shot at Le Golf National.  It was a good day.  I didn't know exactly what to expect on the course, but I played well.  I didn't make many mistakes.  I hit a couple of up-and-downs and four birdies, no bogeys, happy with that.   
 Q.  Sounds like you were in nice control in tricky conditions, because the wind suddenly picked up?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: The good thing is the wind is always the same direction.  At least today it was always the same direction so you could expect what the ball was doing.  It was a bit windy, as always, the fairways are quite narrow.  As I told you, I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  It's probably a bit strange playing in the last group when everybody else is kind of packing up and you're still playing.  You finished in style, didn't you.  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, it was very good.  I mean, it's always -- yeah, a little bit different to play on the last group but I woke up late today, so that was fine.  I didn't have to wait too much.   
 Q.  Are you feeling good in general terms about your game, given the result just the other week?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling well.  Today, as well, I felt well on the greens and around the greens, which is good.  So looking forward to keep it that way.
