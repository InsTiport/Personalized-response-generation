 Q.  You must be excited about tomorrow?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, yeah, long day.  Three rounds of nine holes.  I mean, we started early this morning, but I'm very, very happy with the way I played this afternoon.  I didn't really make too many mistakes.  Make three birdies, I'm very happy with it.   
 Q.  It's a sprint to the finish every time you go out and play an opponent.  Is it a format that you're enjoying?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, absolutely.  It's a format I really enjoy, when you play one against one.  Obviously playing with Matt, my friend, today, was a very, very good match.  I think it was very exciting until the end, and that's what this kind of match is, just exciting.   
 Q.  Did you have much chat out there?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: No, we were very focused when we were playing.  We obviously wanted to beat the other, but he's a good friend of mine, and I know he wish me well.  He will definitely win another time.   
 Q.  And a win in Belgium, it's 18 years ago since you were here, what would that mean?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: That would be great.  Still want to go step by step.  Still a few matches to play tomorrow.  That's it.  Just want to rest and focus on tomorrow.
