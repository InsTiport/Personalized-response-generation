Q. 2-under par through seven holes today, and all quieted down a little bit for you.  How did you see the round today?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: I think I played okay.  I think it was tough out there today.  It was windy.  I think it wasn't easy out there today.  I started well with a birdie on the first.  Then gave myself a few birdie chances.
Made another birdie on 7, and then just made lots of pars with some birdie chances, which was good.  Just the putts didn't really drop.  I mean, played under par again, still up there for tomorrow.  So it's okay.
Q. How much do you have to stay patient around this golf course?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Well, you have to stay patient, always, in golf, but yeah, especially today because as I said, the wind was up and some holes were not easy, and you had to be patient.
Q. How were the pins?  How did you find the setup today?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: As I said, it wasn't easy out there today.  Some pins were not easy, like on the top of the little hills and with the wind, it was not easy to hit your iron shots very close to the pin.
Q. You're three shots off the lead, as it stands, how excited are you about trying to win this tournament tomorrow?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, it's been a good week so far.  I'm feeling confident.  I'm playing well, so just want to keep going and see what happens tomorrow.
