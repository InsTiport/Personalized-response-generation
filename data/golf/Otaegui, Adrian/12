 Q.  After a run of quite a few missed cuts, you did well last week, and you've taken that form into the first round here?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, I made a few changes the week off just before Germany.  It seems like it's working.  I'm happy with that and I know it's the way to keep doing things.   
 Q.  You started on the back nine, two birdies early on.  How important on this golf course is it to get red figures on the board early?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Well, obviously it's very good always to be on the red in this course.  I started with a very good 8-iron on 11, just to one foot, and I chipped in on 12.  So after that, I mean, obviously you get some confidence.  I drove the ball well.  I hit some good 3-woods off the tee.  Yeah, swing was good.   
 Q.  Birdie on 18, as well.  A tough closing stretch here.  That's always pleasing, I suppose, to get a birdie on one of those four holes?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, it started raining and the weather wasn't great on 18.  It was downwind so I hit a 3-wood just on the fairway and 8-iron to three feet from the hole and holed the putt.   
 Q.  Started this tournament well last year, I think a 67 on the opening day last year and sort of fell away.  Obviously determination this year that hopefully you can maintain over the weekend?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, as I said, I'm confident with the swing.  I'm going back to the range now.  Just try to consolidate that.  Really looking forward to the end of the week.
