Q. Give us your overall assessment of the round.
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Obviously it wasn't very easy out there this morning.  I felt the ball wasn't flying a lot, especially with the irons.  I'm still happy with the round, 2-under.  The course is not easy.
I played well.  I felt well.  I just bogeyed two bogeys and both on par 5s, which is a little bit frustrating.  But it's still a good round.
Q. You're trending in the right direction, some good results over the last three events.  Do you feel like your game's heading to the right place?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, I feel my game well.  I think my long game is very good at the moment.  I felt better, as well, on the short game today.  Just want to keep going and keep feeling well on the course.
Q. What's the game plan for tomorrow?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Same as today.  Try to hit fairways, hit greens and hole putts.  Obviously the course is not easy.  Pars are good in most of the holes but just try to take the birdie chances.
