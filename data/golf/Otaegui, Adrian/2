Q. What are your reflections on this round of 67?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: I'm very happy with the way I started obviously with two birdies in the first two holes, and then I had lots of birdie chances on the front nine.  I managed to make two more birdies on 7 and 8, and then I had some birdie chances on the back nine, as well.  I think I played very well from tee-to-green.  I just didn't hole a couple of putts, but I mean, I'm happy with a solid round.  Obviously no bogeys is always good.
Q. Now you're in touching distance of a win tomorrow.  How does that make you feel at a Rolex Series Event?
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, I'm obviously very happy to still have chances on a Sunday.  I mean, that's what we always want, and then I just want to play well tomorrow.  Just keep enjoying.  I'm really enjoying this week.  Keep with that confidence and see what happens at the end, but most important thing for me right now is to keep going and keep controlling what I'm doing.
