 Q.  First dropped shot of the week on the first hole but from there on, another pretty solid round of golf?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: As you said, I missed the first tee shot and made a bogey on the first but then I've been able to save par on the second and third and from the fourth, I played really good golf and gave myself more birdie chances, and again, conditions were quite tough at the end with the wind picking up, so 4-under is a good round for the second round.   
 Q.  When you see the scores are low, does that put more pressure on you because you know that you've got to score low to stay in contention in?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Actually, I've been trying to do my best and trying to be focused on myself and I think I did well today.  I just tried to play my own game, go hole after hole, shot after shot, and then we'll see how it was at the end.  So I managed to be patient and to do that today.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about the game over the first two days?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: I think I'm pretty pleased with all parts of my game at the moment.  I felt confident from tee-to-green.  I gave myself birdie chances.  I was good with the iron shots, attacking the pins on the right side, and I felt good with the putts, as well.  I felt good.   
 Q.  And how much are you looking forward now to heading into the weekend in contention, final event of the year and an event that carries such high prestige?  
ADRIAN OTAEGUI: Yeah, obviously looking forward to play some good golf on the weekend.  Enjoy myself as much as possible, and we'll see how it finishes.
