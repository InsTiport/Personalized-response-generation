 Q.  Made quarters last year; now you've taken the next step.  You don't have much time to process, but how does it feel?  
JOHN PAK: Awesome.  It feels great.  Yesterday I was like, You can't do worse than last year, so it was a great feeling just to be out here in the morning.   
But winning and getting into the semifinals is a great feeling.   
 Q.  How much did it help winning 2, 3, and 4, right out of the gate to build a cushion against a really good player like him?  
JOHN PAK: Yeah, I mean, Won Jun is a really great player.  I have a lot of respect for his game.   
You know, having a 3-up lead after 4 was really helpful because gave me a little cushion, as you said.   
 Q.  He makes a run at you and takes the lead.  How do you not get ahead of yourself and not overdo things?  
JOHN PAK: You know, I tried waiting for him to make a mistake, but he just didn't.  I had to start attacking some pins.  Made a good birdie on I think 13 and 16, and then 17, and, you know, really helped me out there.   
 Q.  Tell me about the birdies on 2, 7, and 13.  What did you hit and what happened on those holes?  
JOHN PAK: On 2 I went for it and he was in a little bit of trouble.  Hit a 3-iron right at the pin.  Was a little short.  Left it in the bunker and got up and down for birdie.   
On 7, I actually went for the green with a driver.  Was just short, right of the pin.  Got up and down for another birdie.   
What other hole?   
 Q.  13.  
JOHN PAK: 13, the first day wasn't covered by that tree on the right.  I took a driver this time.  Hit it to about 15 feet and made another birdie.   
 Q.  Thanks, man.  Good luck this afternoon.  
JOHN PAK: Thank you.
