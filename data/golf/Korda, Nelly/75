 Q.  What was kind of the story of the day for you?  
NELLY KORDA: You know, I played pretty solid.  Just made a couple mistakes.  I mean, Lexi played really well, so...   
 Q.  She didn't leave a lot of openings.  There were a couple, but not a lot.  
NELLY KORDA: No, she didn't.  She played really solid today.  I mean, she hit probably I think almost every green.  She made I think just two mistakes but bounced back really fast.   
She played really solid.   
 Q.  You got within two on the back nine.  What were you thinking at that time?  
NELLY KORDA: I was just thinking take it shot by shot.  I made a really bad mistake after that birdie and just kind of -- she just kind of ran with it after that.   
 Q.  The birdie-bogey swing there?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.   
 Q.  You've seen her play a few times.  What impresses you most about her game?  
NELLY KORDA: I think how powerful she is.  You know, even though she's so powerful, her greens in regulations are really high.  When you look at long players you can see some inconsistencies, she's pretty solid all around.   
 Q.  You have a lot to build off this year.  When you look back at the year, how satisfied are you?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I'm really satisfied.  Finally got that first win under my belt.  I'm happy that it's off-season now.  I get to relax a bit.   
I'm really happy with how this year ended, and hopefully I can build on that next year.   
 Q.  Speaking of next year, Solheim Cup year.  How important is that to you?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I mean, playing for your country is probably one of the highest honors.  I'm not going to try to think about it too much.  I'm just going to go play my game, and if I get in it, great.  I get to play for my country.   
If I don't, I'm going to still be rooting my country on.
