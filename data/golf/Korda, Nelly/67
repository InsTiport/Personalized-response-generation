 Q.  Obviously you wanted the last one, but you gave it a really good push today.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I did.  I'm proud of the way I played.  I made stupid bogey, but that's the only mistake I made.   
Then I gave myself an opportunity on the last couple holes.  17 just burned the edge, and then I lipped out pretty hard on 18 unfortunately.   
But, I mean, I'm bummed, but I'm not too bummed because I played well this week and I'm happy with the way my game is trending.   
 Q.  Were you looking at the leaderboard at all for a specific name?  
NELLY KORDA: I was.  I have a friend out here and right as I got on the tee on 10 she was like, Oh, my God!  Jess made an eagle.  I was like, Oh, my God!  Where did she make the eagle?  I don't know.  My dad texted me.  (Laughter.)   
I was trying to watch and I saw her at 21 and I'm like, Oh, damn.  Need to catch up a little.   
 Q.  So you were very much aware of where she was?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.  There are not that many leaderboards, but once I saw, yeah, I always looked.   
 Q.  Does that give you an extra fire?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, a little.  I was trying to make the last putt obviously to get tied for the lead, but to push her down, too.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.   
Obviously at the end of the day we're trying to beat each other, but I'm proud of the way she played this week her first week back, and I'm sure she is as well.   
 Q.  What about Jin Young Ko's game out there?  You guys were trading birdies.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, she was playing really solid.  She hit it really close.  She just putts really well, I mean every week.  She's such a consistent putter.  I think everyone will say that out here.   
That's a strong part of her game.   
 Q.  ANA is next for you.  
NELLY KORDA: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  You're obviously playing really well.  Is there any added pressure for ANA?  
NELLY KORDA: I don't know really look at rankings or anything too much.  I mean, obviously it's cool I'm inside top 10 in Rolex, but every week is a new week; everyone starts from zero.  I approach it that way.   
I'm just going to focus on trying to get ready and play my best golf.  That's all I can do.   
 Q.  Do you prefer a tournament like this where you might have to birdie every hole coming in?  
NELLY KORDA: I like both.  I like the challenge of you have to make pars, but I also like the challenge of you have to make birdies jus to stay inside the top 10.   
I mean, where I started today I would probably be 20th.
