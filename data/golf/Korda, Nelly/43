 Q.  Backing up a very good round, and how about a round without any dropped shots. That's got to feel good?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, feels like forever since I've had a round like that but definitely feels good, especially in the wind today.   
 Q.  It's not easy out there but the scoring was good, playing with MJ, you must have thought, what's happened to her. She got off to a fast start.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, she was dropping some bombs, and I was like, okay. But I like playing with her. I think it was my first time ever playing with her and she's such a kind person, so it was a lot of fun today.   
 Q.  Many highlights in your round. How about the 2 on 17?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, all I was thinking about is trying to get to double digits because I know MJ is playing really well. I'm just trying to give myself a chance to go into the weekend.   
My shots around the green were good and it's definitely tough out here today. Still a lot of golf to be played but definitely excited.
