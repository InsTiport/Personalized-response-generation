 Q.  You sit at 5-under for the tournament.  
 You've improved every single round in this event so far.  What have you learned about Hazeltine national?   
NELLY KORDA: It's tough.  You know, you just try to hit as many fairways and greens as possible and you give yourself as many birdie opportunities as you can.   
 Q.  You took advantage of the birdie opportunities.  What clicked out there?  
NELLY KORDA: Really my drives and had low irons.  I made sure that I was able to get to the pins.   
 Q.  You were 3-under on the par-5s today as well.  
 What did you see on those that let you take advantage?   
NELLY KORDA: My distance off the tee really helped me out there today.  I actually went for two of them.  So, yeah that helped.
