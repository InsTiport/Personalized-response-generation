 Q.  5-under to finish off your day on Sunday.  Tell me about your round out there?  
NELLY KORDA: I started off really hot, started off with three birdies in a row, and then I made that awesome eagle on No. 6.  The back nine was kind of slow.  I'm not really too happy with it, but if I can finish inside the Top 10, that would be great.   
 Q.  Tell me about the eagle on 6?  
NELLY KORDA: I actually didn't hit it that good.  I was telling it to go, and then it hit the downslope, and it just rolled in.  I was in shock.  It was definitely the highlight of my tournament.   
 Q.  So this looks like it's going to be your best finish in a major.  What kind of confidence does that give you moving forward, especially in major competitions?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, definitely I'm really happy with the way I've been playing lately.  Just trying to move up the leaderboards, especially in majors.  It's where everyone wants to play well.  So just the fact that I'm getting confidence in them and moving myself up and showing everyone that I can actually compete at majors is definitely a big boost in confidence.  So I'm just going to try to keep working forward and see where it goes.   
 Q.  Your sister, there are still a lot of people out on the course now, but your sister's right near the top of the leaderboard.  Would you be surprised at all if she won?  
NELLY KORDA: No, not with the year she's having this year.  She's playing really great.  Hopefully she does win, but there is still a lot of golf to be played and the wind is picking up.  I think the conditions are getting a little bit harder.  Down the stretch nerves are going to play a huge role, so we'll see.  But I'm hoping she does win.
