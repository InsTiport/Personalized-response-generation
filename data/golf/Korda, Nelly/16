Q. Nelly, well played today.  Let's go back to earlier in the week, you were talking in your pre-tournament press conference how before Arkansas where you finished in a tie for third that you changed up your practice ahead of the play.  What was the change and how much has that helped you for this week?
NELLY KORDA:   For sure.  I mean, it was more of work on the putting greens during practice round days, and even just like after my round and after my practice was done I would come out here and hit a few putts because at the end of the day golf is all about confidence, and if I'm stroking it good and give myself shorter par putts, don't roll birdie putts by, it means it a lot easier.
Q. Your best finish on the LPGA Tour on this golf course is tied for 13th.  That was a couple of years ago.  But if you compare your performance now here today, we're here in September, it's Bermuda, feels a little bit more like home.  Did you feel more comfortable today with these conditions on this course?
NELLY KORDA:   Kind of.  It's very firm out here.  It's kind of -- it's very different I would say.  Even when I was home last week and practicing on Bermuda, it's really soft.  It's like a different monster, actually.
