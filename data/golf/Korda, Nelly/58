 Q.  Nelly, tough way to finish with that bogey on 16.  Overall, still very much in the tournament.  How do you feel about your position through two rounds?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, it was tough to bogey my first hole out today.  But I like where I am at right now.  I'm inside the top ten at 2 under.  I'm four shots off the lead.  There's still a lot of golf to be played.   
So I'm just going to try to minimize my mistakes, because I've had a very colorful scorecard the past 36 holes.  So I'm just going to try and focus on that.   
 Q.  What kind of things do you feel like you need to improve on, going into the third round today?  
NELLY KORDA: Just hitting more fairways and greens.  If you hit fairways, it's so much easier to hit the greens.  But, I mean, out of the rough, it shoots or it doesn't even fly out.  And with the false fronts, it's kind of hard to judge.   
 Q.  What do you think about when you look at the leaderboard and you see you and your sister both in the top ten, top five going into the third round of a Major championship like this?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I mean, it's exciting.  I'm sure my parents are really excited.  They've been walking 36 holes the past two days.  So yeah, I mean, it's exciting.  I don't think we've been, both of us have been in a top ten in a Major before so it's something new.  We're both really looking forward to the weekend.
