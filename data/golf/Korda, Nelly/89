Q. Yesterday was good, today was really, really good.  What was the big key out there today?
NELLY KORDA: I think my back nine I birdied the first three holes, and then I birdied the last three holes.  That definitely helped a lot.
Q. Are you becoming a bigger fan of this course?
NELLY KORDA: I like it a lot.  It definitely fits my eye, and hopefully it treats me well over the weekend.
Q. To be in contention, how good of a feeling is that going into the weekend?
NELLY KORDA: I mean, whenever you're in contention, that's like the goal.  Everyone goes into every tournament wanting to win.  To be on top of the leaderboard feels really good, and I still have 36 more holes, so I'm definitely excited for it.
Q. I think you birdied half your holes today.  When you play like that, does it feel like you're in a zone and like you're not going to hit a poor shot or you can make every putt?
NELLY KORDA: You're definitely in a zone, but obviously there are four shots -- I actually only hit one bad drive today, and the key on this golf course is to hit as many fairways as possible, and I was doing that today, and I had short wedges into the greens, so whenever you have that, it makes it a little easier.  But nothing out here is easy.
Q. Do you feel comfortable near the top of the leaderboard?
NELLY KORDA: I like it, yeah, of course.  I've been on top of the leaderboard a couple of times this year, and I've just learned to stay patient and just take it shot by shot.
Q. Do you feel like -- this goes exactly against what you just said, but I'm wondering is there also a sense because there's a lot of birdies and low scores here that an aggressive style is what it's going to take to get through this weekend?
NELLY KORDA: I kind of have a game plan, and I've just been sticking to it for the past two days.  Today it worked out really well.  I was hitting it really well.  You know, I mean, when you have wedges into the greens, you are a little bit more aggressive, so I'm just going to keep the same game plan for the weekend, not change anything.
