Q. Nelly, what a day today, a little bit of everything. You must be happy with your round one.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, definitely really happy. It was a tough one out there. The wind was really strong and I was just happy to get it under par and to shoot such a great score.
Q. You had a little bit of flair in there, as well, out on 15. A cheeky look to your caddie, Jason. What did you talk about before that hole-out?
NELLY KORDA: Well, actually, when I holed out, it was just like, finally, because I've been so close this year, and it's lipped-out a couple of times. Finally when it went in, it felt really good.
Q. You're known for length off the tee but you're also a really consistent player. What do you work on to keep that consistency going?
NELLY KORDA: I think just on my irons a lot. I make sure to dial in my irons quite well. I think that's kind of what I've done really well this year is I've raised my greens in reg, and I've given myself a lot of opportunities.
Q. Another one here in Chinese Taipei. Talk to us about coming back at defending champion. It must feel so special.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, it's definitely so special. I'm recognized by so many people now and everyone is really rooting for me. They are like, "Again! Again!" Hopefully I can get it done but there's still a lot of golf to be played.
