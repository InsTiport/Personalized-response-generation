Q. To finish strong on 9, how good a feeling is that?
NELLY KORDA: Really nice.  I mean, my putter hasn't really been working that well today, and to finish on the one birdie putt is really a boost in confidence.
Q. How good do you feel about the position you've put yourself in after day one?
NELLY KORDA: Good.  Anything under par is good.  I mean, it's just the first day, so there's still a lot more golf to be played.
Q. What did you learn about this golf course that maybe you didn't know before?
NELLY KORDA: It's firm.  I mean, on No. 7, I hit a pitch shot just short of the green, and it jumped up on top of the green, so you have to be careful about some of these shots positioning-wise.
Q. Was it difficult your first eight holes?  Is it difficult to stay patient when you're playing well but not necessarily making the putts?
NELLY KORDA: It's definitely hard, but it's good to have someone like my caddie alongside me just to tell me to stay patient, like they'll fall.  I hit a really good chip shot on 18, which was my ninth hole, that kind of started my day there.
Q. Is making a Solheim Cup push anywhere in your mind as you've come out the last few weeks?
NELLY KORDA: I mean, it would be a huge honor to represent my country, and it's definitely a goal of mine one day.  But I'm just -- I just want to play solid golf, and everything else will solve itself.
