Q. Bogey-free round today.  How would you sum up your day out there?
NELLY KORDA: Scrambling pretty much.  I had 24 putts and I started out with six 1-putts in a row, so I was making a lot of up-and-downs today.
I was missing in the right areas, so the chip shots weren't as tough.  But other than that, I'm really happy with how I ended up today.
Q. How was it playing with your sister for the second straight day?
NELLY KORDA: It was nice.  It's nice playing with somebody you know everything about, so you have everything to talk about.
Q. What do you guys talk about?
NELLY KORDA: Legitimately everything.
Q. Do you talk about golf?
NELLY KORDA: No, not at all.  Sometimes like when we hit something bad, we're like, what was that.  But other than that, it's the last thing we talk about is golf.
Q. How were the conditions?  It's pretty windy out here.  Was that a factor for you?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, it's windy and the pin positions are tucked in really hard positions.  So it's definitely about positioning yourself, and if you miss, then miss in the right areas.  But that barely happens.  But today it was happening a lot, so was pretty lucky.
Q. Your rookie season is winding down here.  How would you assess your season so far and as it comes to an end here?
NELLY KORDA: I think I've had a pretty good season.  Obviously I would have liked to have a couple better finishes.  But fairly pleased with my season.
