Q. I'm here with Nelly Korda.  Fantastic round here at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup.  Talk us through a little bit of that round and how were you feeling out there today on the course.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I was pretty solid today.  I had eight birdies and two bogeys.  I was hitting it really solid and making some key putts out there.
Q. Were you feeling any different from yesterday at all?  Any difference on the course compared to the last two days?
NELLY KORDA: No, not really.  I've just been really solid tee-to-green.  Struggled a little with the poana greens.  I grew up on bermuda grass.  Other than that, I've been really solid.
Q. What's it like adjusting it that, other than bermuda?  Being from Florida, how is it adjusting to the weather and every thing like that?
NELLY KORDA: That's why we arrive on Mondays, Sundays, to get used to it, kind of practice a little, and then get it going on Thursday.  It's the same for everyone.
Q. You've had quite the momentum coming into Founders Cup.  Do you think that's boosted your confidence at all coming into this weekend?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, of course.  I'm just going to try to stay solid like I have been these past few tournaments and just going to take it shot by shot really.
Q. And out there on 18 green, seeing the Founders, this is such a special week for the LPGA in general.  How is it special to you?
NELLY KORDA: Just seeing them and seeing what they went through and the reason why we're out here this week, it's really special for us to come off the 18th green and thank them.
