 Q.  Talk about your round today.  You're in a good position.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I played really solid.  I started off a bit slow because the first three holes playing into the wind, it's cold in the morning, they're really long.   
So I saved a really good par on No. 3 and kind of got going then.   
 Q.  You'd turn around and look at your sister every once in a while.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, we got a good meet up on 17 tee when it was backed up there.   
 Q.  You played really well here last year, too.  What do you like about this course?  
NELLY KORDA: You know, I watched my sister play out here a number of times.  I don't even know how many.  I just kind of feel at home because.  I've seen this golf course so many times.  I feel so comfortable out here.   
But, yeah, I mean, it's wide and it's a bermuda-style golf course, and I grew up in Florida.  That's the reason why I'm also so comfortable out here.   
 Q.  Had you played it at any of those other times when it wasn't part of this tournament?  
NELLY KORDA: No, never.  First time was last year.   
 Q.  You guys have had some nice moments together.  Had another one last night.  What was it like to be up on the stage with her?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, it was amazing to see her.  She was a bit nervous doing that speech, but I'm so proud of her coming this far, how she started the year to how she's end the year.   
Yeah, it was great.   
 Q.  We know how eager she was to speak to you after you won.  What about when you saw her?  Was there anything?  You guys have a little celebration?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, actually when I walked out of the house she had this huge poster on our car that said like, Congratulations.  It was misspelled but it was like swinning instead of swinging.  She was like, almost perfect.   
It's a massive poster.  It's on social media.   
 Q.  When you came out the morning after you arrived?  
NELLY KORDA: No, she got here -- because she lives on the other side of Florida, so she lives at east coast and I live on the west coast and our coach is on the west coach.  She drove over Wednesday to see me and coach.
