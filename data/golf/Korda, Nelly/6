Q. 2-over 73, day one here at the U.S. Women's Open.  Cypress playing a little tougher than Jackrabbit today.  What were your thoughts on day one?
NELLY KORDA:   Definitely a little fidgeting when it came to on the greens.  I was hitting it really good, had a couple of opportunities on the front nine, but I didn't really kind of figure it out until the last couple holes where I finally made a birdie on, I think, No. 16.
Q. 2-over par, still three rounds left in this championship.  A lot of golf to be played.  What excites you about tomorrow and then hopefully the weekend moving forward, going into Jackrabbit and then two rounds back at Cypress?
NELLY KORDA:   Just more rounds under pressure.  I'm just really happy that I got it done today, and I played really solid, so the more rounds under pressure I play, I think the better it'll be.
Q. Looking forward to the next three rounds, just what does this championship mean, the U.S. Women's Open, to a player who's been here before but still, this championship, the magnitude, what does it all mean?
NELLY KORDA:   It's pretty much the "it" championship.  It's the one that as a little girl you dream of winning.  There's a lot of history.  It's 75 years this year, so it definitely would be a huge honor to win, and hopefully one day I can get there.
