  Q. It was a goal I know to try to make it an all-Korda Orlando sweep.  How important was the start today, three birdies in the first six holes?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, honestly I did not play very good golf today, and I just stayed really solid.  Honestly, I don't even know what I did.  It was definitely very stressful.
 Q. Why emotional?
 NELLY KORDA:   I think it's just all the stress from today.
 Q. How much of a good influence -- you gave Jason some props yesterday.  When you said you weren't playing your best and some of the putts were starting to get tentative but you didn't make any mistakes, how important was he?
 NELLY KORDA:   He was really important today, honestly.  I would not be where I am without Jason.  Sometimes I do get a little annoyed when he's too positive.  He honestly deserves so much.  I would not be here without him.
 Q. It's a bit of an anomaly on an international Tour, but this is your first win on home soil.  Does that make it just that little more special and get that monkey off your back, so to speak?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, and obviously winning in front of my parents, too, that's a first, so it's really nice.
