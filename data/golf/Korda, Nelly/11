Q. Good start.
NELLY KORDA:   Thank you.
Q. I would imagine a good start here and when you can really shoot low, get into that confidence to find a low number over the weekend is a good thing.
NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, for sure.  I actually was 3-over through a couple holes today.  I dunked it on No. 8 and then made a birdie on No.  -- no, wait.  Yeah, dunked it on 8 and made a birdie on 9, so got me back to even.
I played really solid on the back nine.  I got to get my wedges a little dialed in, but definitely a good day.
Q. Talking to Stacy Lewis yesterday and she said it's one you have to play a few times to really get a grasp on it,  and then you can really kind of make a dent here.  Is that something that you see?
NELLY KORDA:   For sure.  Coming from Florida I'm not used to po greens.  I have a lot of wedges in and I have to play for a longer shot because it just rips back with spin.
Honestly, I had like -- on one hole I had 20 yards of rip back.  Yeah, so it's definitely a course that you need to play a few times to kind of get the handle of.
But I'm glad with the way I ended today.
Q. And we got a couple questions sent in about little bro.
NELLY KORDA:   Yeah.
Q. What's it been like to see him perform the way he has?
NELLY KORDA:   Honestly, it's been awesome.  Jess and I have been waking up early for every single of his matches.  He's super excited.  He's worked really hard over this break we had the past couple months where we didn't play sports.  He deserves it.
Q. Your dad over there at all or not yet?
NELLY KORDA:   No.  So actually they were supposed to come out to KPMG, but little did we know we can't have guests.  Now since he's in a groove they don't want to go there and disrupt him.
Maybe they'll fly over later on.
Q. Any good family texts over the last few days?
NELLY KORDA:   Oh, yeah.  It's a lot of LFG, LFG, LFG.
