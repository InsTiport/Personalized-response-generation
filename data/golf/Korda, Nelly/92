Q. Nelly, you just told me that you like this golf course.  You've played four events so far this season, a couple top 20s, including a T5 in the Opener.  Do you feel like a confident player out there?
NELLY KORDA: I mean, definitely I'm having a great start to the season.  It's definitely a big confidence booster, especially playing out here.  The fairways are really tight.  The rough is really thick here.  So just trying to hit as many fairways and greens as possible, so I definitely -- that confidence definitely helps with that.
Q. You mentioned that you've played in this tournament a couple times as an amateur.  How different is it now this being your rookie year having some professional experience under your belt on the LPGA Tour?
NELLY KORDA: I mean, definitely playing Symetra last year helped, as well, but just knowing that I earned my spot here this year is definitely a huge confidence booster because when I played as an amateur, I was always like, oh -- I didn't have as much confidence as I do this time around.
Q. What kind of tips has your big sister given you?
NELLY KORDA: Nothing this week.  I also played Q-school out here, but I've played this golf course enough so I don't need any sisterly tips.
