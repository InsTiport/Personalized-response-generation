  Q. Nice little round out there today, but you also have some big news across the ocean there.  What's it like with your brother doing so well over there at Roland Garros?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, it's really cool actually.  He finished his match when we were driving over and my heart rate was definitely too elevated going to the golf course.  It should not be that elevated.  But it was really fun.
 Q. Are your parents here this week following you?
 NELLY KORDA:   No, they're at home.  They were going to come out to KPMG but found out there are no guests there.  They're not sure what their plans are going to be.
 Q. I got to ask too, is there kind of a family race to the first one to secure a major maybe?
 NELLY KORDA:   Never really -- we never really talked about it.  Maybe.
 Q. What's it like being able to have that kind of -- I know I saw you guys on social posting about it too -- but just to see all his hard work pay off?
 NELLY KORDA:   It's super special.  I mean, he put in an a lot of hard work over the past couple months and it's really cool to see it pay off.
 He's playing his idol next round, so that's going to be really cool to watch.
 Q. So you do have a dog also named Rafa, correct?
 NELLY KORDA:   Cat.
 Q. Cat, okay.  Cat named Rafa.
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, that we name after Rafa.
 Q. So have you talked to him since he's played today?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, he usually calls us when he's in the locker room right after his match, so it's a lot of LFGs and let's go.
 Q. When did he realize he was facing Nadal?
 NELLY KORDA:   He kind of knew.  I mean, Nadal was going on after him, so, I mean, once he won he knew.
 Q. Is your family excited?  Have you been blowing up the group chat?
 NELLY KORDA:   Oh, yeah, definitely blowing it up.
