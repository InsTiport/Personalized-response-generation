Q. Watched a fabulous round of golf out there today, 63.  Looks to me like you're playing really aggressively.  Is that the feel that you want to bring to this golf course?
NELLY KORDA:   Oh, definitely.  You have to shoot a really low number out here to even be in contention, and so you have to be very aggressive.
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow.  Going to be a couple back.  Do you have a number in mind, or are you just going to go out and take it low as you can?
NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, going to take it as low as I can.  It's going to take a low one to win tomorrow.  Just going to stick to my game plan, try to have fun out there, and try to shoot a low one.
