 Q.  Nelly, another solid day, obviously. Take me through what's been going right and just how much you're enjoying the Florida Bermuda.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I had a really great front nine today. I shot 5-under. Definitely hit the brakes on the back. Started missing my shots a little. But all in all I've been really hitting it solid, giving myself a lot of good opportunities, and I think that's what's really going well this week.   
 Q.  Is it safe to say even with a stalled back nine, where you're at with your game, maybe mentally, this is one of the best places you've been in your career?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, definitely. I still make a lot of mistakes. I still get frustrated. I think that's going to be for the rest of my career. But I'm definitely happy where I'm at going into the weekend and definitely in contention, I hope. But I'm just going to keep playing my golf and see where that leads me.   
 Q.  When you say hopefully have that kind of mentality for the rest of your career, does that just show the desire you have to come out and win each week?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, definitely. That's definitely my goal every week, to get myself into contention and just to take it shot by shot. That's really my mentality.   
 Q.  $1.5 million on the line, obviously. In contention for the weekend. What would it mean to cap off the year with a third win?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, it would be amazing. You know, I've just played a lot of good golf this year, and hopefully I can build off of that and carry that into the weekend. But I'm excited for the off-season. Hopefully I can cap it off this weekend, but if not, I'm just going to build from that going into next year.   
 Q.  Where did it start going off the tracks a little bit for you, and was it just one area that started not going right?  
NELLY KORDA: Today?   
 Q.  Yeah, on the back nine.  
NELLY KORDA: Just kind of didn't make -- I didn't kind of take advantage of my opportunities. I missed a couple shorter putts that I could have made, and then I made kind of a stupid bogey on one of the holes, and then obviously 16, too, that was just not great. You know, it's going to happen, and I just have to learn from that.
