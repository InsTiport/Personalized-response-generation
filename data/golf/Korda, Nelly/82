 Q.  How was it playing out there today?  
NELLY KORDA: It was good.  You know, I played with Stacy and we played really fast, so it was a good tempo all day.   
Really enjoyed it.  Wind wasn't that strong.  Wasn't as bad in the morning, and so I'm kind of happy I got out early and got my round in because it's really getting hot out there now.   
 Q.  What was the difference today from the first two days?  
NELLY KORDA: I hit more fairways and I hit more greens and I holed more putts.  (Laughter.)  So everything was better.   
Kind of struggled the first two days to kind of find my rhythm.  Something just clicked today and I was rolling it really well and hitting it well.   
Hopefully I can carry that into tomorrow.   
 Q.  So you were on the cut on the number?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.   
 Q.  So then how did that feel...  
NELLY KORDA: I don't like that feeling.   
 Q.  But I mean today to be able to get that monkey off...  
NELLY KORDA: When I got in off my round, because I was in the morning, I was like, Ah, I don't know.  I guess I'm going to look at flights to get back home.  I'm glad we didn't.  (Laughter.)   
Yeah, it was a little bit nerve wracking, but as I said, I got out there early in the morning and the conditions weren't as tough.   
So I'm kind of happy.  There are some low scores out there, and I think there will be for the rest of the day.  I'm just happy that I got it done.
