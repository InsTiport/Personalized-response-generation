Q. How much did you want that last one to go?  Were you paying attention to the leaderboard at all?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.  I had two opportunities.  I missed one on 17 and that one kind of came close.
If it's not your week, it's not your week.  I'm happy with the way I finished.
Q. Were you looking for your sister's name up there, too?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.  I actually was just watching the TV.  She had a birdie putt; she missed it.  Hopefully she has a good last couple holes.
Q. Was there something on the line this week between the two of you?
NELLY KORDA: It was the season, yeah.
Q. Oh, the season.
NELLY KORDA: Whoever finishes higher on the Money List, loser has to get the winner a bag of choice.
Q. That could be costly.
NELLY KORDA: She already told me what she wanted last week.
Q. That's confident.
NELLY KORDA: I know.
Q. How much is it going to set you back?  How much will it cost?
NELLY KORDA: I don't know.  She hasn't told me what bag.  She told me, I already know what I want.
Q. Oh, I got you.  What's it mean to get a top 10?  Looks like you're going to a top 10.
NELLY KORDA: Hopefully.  It's a good cap to the year.  There are still a lot of holes to be played down the stretch.  If I'm in the top 10, then great.  I played well today and I'm happy with the way my season ended.
I'm just looking forward to getting some rest and starting up next year.
Q. Was what the biggest learning curve for you this year?
NELLY KORDA: Probably trying to stay patient.
Q. Yeah.
NELLY KORDA: I was in contention a couple times this year and kind of let it slip away.  That's going to be the main goal for this off-season, is just to kind of hit it shot by shot.
Q. Did you do your own thing most of the year?  How much did you and your sister...
NELLY KORDA: We both did our own thing.  We probably roomed together seven times.  That's it.  All of Asia I was rooming with friends and she was rooming with friends, too.
Q. Got it.  What was the most fun part of your year?
NELLY KORDA: Probably going to Asia.  I've never been to Asia before, so just traveling the world.  I think anyone can say that when they haven't really played golf all over the world.  It's definitely a highlight.
