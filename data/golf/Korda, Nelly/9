  Q. What a great round her at Lake Nona.  Six birdies on the front nine.  How was your round today?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, it was good.  I started on the back nine.  Had a few mistakes there.  I think I made three birdies, three bogeys.  Turned out even and gave myself a lot of opportunities on my back nine.  I capitalized on them, so that was nice.
 Q. Right off the bat do you think that's when the momentum started for you?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yes, for sure.  Once I started to get more looks at birdie I got a little more comfortable.  As I said, I just made a little too many mistakes on my front nine.
 And it was weird, I mean, I hit solid shots.  They just went over the green.  You kind of screw yourself a little.
 Q. I heard the pin locations were really tough today.  Do you think that's the toughest condition out here for this course?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, they tuck them quite well.  It's either they're very close to the back or they tuck them behind bunkers, so honestly sometimes you just have to go center of the green and give yourself a two-putt.
 Q. You're a risk taker.  This week the Aon Risk-Reward Challenge is 15, the Par-5, dogleg left.  How do you plan on dealing with that hole each day?
 NELLY KORDA:   Well, I sniped it into the water with my second shot today, so hopefully I don't take that route on the weekend.
 But, yeah, I'm just going to stay aggressive.  It's a bit of an interesting green.  It's firm, so the second shot is definitely going to play a big part into that, especially with the water being so close on the left.
 Q. Final question:  We have the weekend still.  What are you looking forward to doing out there and what are your goals?
 NELLY KORDA:   Just staying aggressive and consistent, trying to hit as many greens and give myself as many looks as possible.
