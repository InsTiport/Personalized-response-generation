  Q. You come out and shoot a 66; temperatures were in the low 40s when you tee'd off on 10.  What was the game plan when you woke up this morning?
 NELLY KORDA:   I actually just told my caddie, I'm like, Thank God we're starting on the back nine, because the front nine has some longer holes and they were all playing into the wind.
 It was pretty cold this morning, so I was really happy that I was starting on the back nine.
 Q. Been a tough year for a lot of people.  One bright spot, you go into an airport these days and you see yourself and your sister on the cover the Golf Digest Magazine.  What has been the response to that great achievement?
 NELLY KORDA:   I mean, it's been amazing.  It's a huge honor to be on the cover.  It's been really cool seeing all our friends, when they're flying through different airports, snap the cover and send us a text or even put it on their Instagram, so it's been really cool.
 Q. You have a great record here.  Three Top 10s in three starts.  What's top of mind as you try to bring this great championship home on the weekend?
 NELLY KORDA:   Just try to stay aggressive, stick to the game plan, and take it shot by shot and see how it goes.
 Q. I was out on the same nine that you were playing; wind blowing straight into; felt like 30 degrees.  How were you able to make turn at 5-under par in those conditions.
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, it was a little nippy.  Not going to lie, I didn't feel my fingers on the range.  I stayed aggressive, hit some really close shots, and capitalized on them.
 Q. You have really good history on this golf course; second in 2018, T3 last year.  I feel like these are the same questions I ask and you Lexi.  What is it about this golf course that you play so well?
 NELLY KORDA:   I don't know.  I just feel super comfortable out here.  I guess it's because I grew up in Florida.  Just the style of this golf course, I just feel super confident out here.
 Q. You've had a great year.  We can go to ANA and what you did, so close to wining that one and consistently talking about your performance.  But with the COVID year and being here with such a big paycheck, how important is this golf tournament not only to you, but to the LPGA Tour?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, for sure.  It's such a big event.  It's our season championship.  We all love coming back here.  We all love coming to Tiburon.  CME is such a great sponsor and they keep elevating women's golf.
 We're making strides in the right direction every year.
