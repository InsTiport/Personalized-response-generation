 Q.  Three birdies, just one bogey on the card.  If you look back on this round, are you satisfied with what you did out there?  
NELLY KORDA: You know, I hit it really well today.  I just couldn't get my putter going, so obviously that's something I need to work on the next three days.  But I'm happy to get it in under par.   
 Q.  What are the challenges out there on this course?  
NELLY KORDA: I think it's definitely a ball striker's golf course.  It's a little longer, so you have to be pretty consistent, and as you said, the scores are pretty low, so I'm trying to get it as close as possible.  But I just think the greens are a little slow, so just kind of getting the speed with the aim kind of is a bit of a struggle right now.   
 Q.  You've obviously risen on the world stage.  When you come to a major championship, what are your expectations?  
NELLY KORDA: I'm just trying to stay as relaxed as I can.  My coach and I, we kind of made a plan of just taking it shot by shot, and that's all I'm going to do.  I'm just going to take it shot by shot this week and see how it goes.  I'm not going to put too much pressure on myself.
