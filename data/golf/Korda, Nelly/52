Q. Always good to end with a bogey-free round.  How were you feeling out there today?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, felt a lot better.  Yesterday I was a little fidgety on the front because I hadn't played for three weeks.  I came off a missed cut, so got the bad round kind of out of the way yesterday and was really aggressive today.
Made some solid putts and took every opportunity I could.
Q. What were you able to do during your break to just refocus after L.A.
NELLY KORDA: I didn't play golf for a week.  (Laughter.)  I just worked out, hung out, went to the beach.  Kind of gave my mind a rest.  I was on the road for six weeks and that takes a toll on you.
Just made sure I relaxed.
Q. How much does that do for your confidence level heading into this tournament?
NELLY KORDA: Definitely, yeah.  I don't think I've ever had a bogey-free round out here and I missed the cut last year, so I'm just happy to be in the cut line.
Q. What do you think you'll need to improve on to attack the weekend?
NELLY KORDA: I think I did everything pretty well today.  Just going to stick with my game plan and go forward.
