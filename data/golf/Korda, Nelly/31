Q. Back-to-back Playoffs on the LPGA Tour, and you got the job done in the end.
NELLY KORDA: It was a little bit harder than I wanted it to be but happy I got it done.
Q. Let's talk about that incredible 3-wood into 18. Was it a 3-wood?
NELLY KORDA: No. It was actually a 5-hybrid. But I kept telling myself, from the heart, from the heart, from the heart, because I was very nervous because it was my first playoff. The wind kind of brought it back in.
I made a couple 3-putts on the back. It just gets away from you so fast, and Caroline made a couple putts and she was one ahead of me on 17. I was like, geez, I have to make a birdie here.
Jason gave me a little pep talk going from 17 to 18, win or get into a playoff, so he was definitely great today.
Q. How special to win with your sister here?
NELLY KORDA: It was great. I had a couple tears going down my face when she hugged me.
