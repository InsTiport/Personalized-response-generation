Q. So 6-under today.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.
Q. Coming off a win, totally in form, talk about your round today.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I was hitting it really well.  Made some solid putts.  Made a long putt on 9 and then made a good up and down on 10.  Kind of got the ball rolling on the back nine as well.
I'm just hitting it really solid and just have a bit more confidence obviously coming off of last week.
Q. Sure.  It's been hot.  Temperatures are so hot.  How are you managing to keep your body cool?
NELLY KORDA: I'm from Florida.  I practice in the summer, so it's maybe a little hotter, but I'm kind of used to it.
Q. Question for you and your sister.  The purse/bag competition, did Jess already pick her bag from last year, and are you still going to be doing that this year?
NELLY KORDA: I won last year, and actually, yes, I'm actually traveling with it.
Q. What did you end of choosing?
NELLY KORDA: A Louis Vuitton duffle bag.  She got the same one the year before and I was like, I kind of want one, too.
Q. Awesome.  Do you have your eye on something else for this year?
NELLY KORDA: No.  She is definitely more of like the person that likes those designer bags.  I'm not so into it.  I am, but she's way more into it than I am.
Q. Cool.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah.
Q. How are you going to prepare for tomorrow's round?
NELLY KORDA: Rest.  You know, it's such a long day out here.  As you said, it's really hot.  All I can do is rest and recover and try to bring it tomorrow.
Q. Have you talked to Jess about this course and her not being able to defend her title from last year?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, obviously she's really upset she can't be here.  No, I know she's been watching on TV and she's a little jealous that I'm out here and she's home on the other side of the earth.
But, yeah, going to take it day by day.  It's all in the family.
