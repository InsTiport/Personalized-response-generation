Q. What a tough finish.  You must be feeling extremely disappointed, but it was a very exciting finish.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I had a bunch of putts that were really close and a lot of them lipped and burned edges.  It definitely hurts, but that's golf.  There's going to be another tournament.  There's going to be another feeling like this.  Just have to keep going forward.
Q. You stayed up there and you stayed in it the whole way through, and you gave yourself every chance.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I definitely fought till the end.  That's definitely 100 percent true.  But I mean, sometimes it just doesn't work out, but I'm proud of myself for fighting till the end.
Q. Seemed to be a battle for the whole day.  No one could sort of keep clear and those putts weren't dropping.
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, exactly.  You just had like a tough back nine.  I mean, we only had two birdies on the back nine.  Brooke made birdie on 18 and I made a birdie on 10.  Other than that, we weren't making any putts on the back nine.
Q. How did it feel coming up the last hole?
NELLY KORDA: I felt good.  I hit it really close.  Unfortunately I didn't make the putt, but that's golf.  There's going to be more.
