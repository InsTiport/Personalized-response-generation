Q: Are you excited to be here at this inaugural event?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, Iâm very excited. I got to explore Shanghai a bit on Monday and itâs a really colorful and vibrant city. Itâs really nice being here.
Q: How is the course?
NELLY KORDA: I played the pro-am today and itâs a tough track, so Iâm really excited to see how this week pans out.
Q: These pro-am parties are really important to meet a bunch of people, and fun too, right?
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, itâs really important. You know, in Asia itâs a lot of fun, everyone comes out and we just have a blast at these things.
