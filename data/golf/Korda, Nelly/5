  Q. For you guys, I'll start with you, Jessica, does the dynamic of the way you compete during a tournament change when you're paired alongside your sister?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Not really.  I played well.  Hit some great shots here and there.  But in terms of like competing, no, not really.  I'm definitely a bit more at ease.
 Q. Do you find yourself paying more attention to what she's doing than you ever would for any other competitor?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Yes, absolutely, 100%.  She's done a couple things like, What?  But, yeah, definitely.  I'm obviously rooting her on like every putt and chip.
 It was fun.  She was making birdies on top of me and I was like, Come on.  Let me have one.  She goes, Yeah, but it's fine, yours was longer.  (Laughter.)
 Q. The last time you were paired together was the final round at Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions.  Afterwards you compared notes on what you saw out of each other.  Can you share some of the observations that you shared after that?
 NELLY KORDA:   After Diamond?  I don't know, I mean, I was definitely (indiscernible) it that day and I just remember I started so far back.  I know that I gave her a read on I think 14, and right as she was walking off I was like, Do I get a present for that?
 JESSICA KORDA:   She called me in the car after so I sent her a present.
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah.
 Q. So that's comparing notes.  Obvious question, bragging rights, or is that something -- is there a lot of needling out there at all?
 NELLY KORDA:   No.  I think it's just fun for us.  We have a lot of fun out there.  And then especially with our caddies, too, because they're good friends.
 JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, we definitely don't have that, what you guys want us to have.
