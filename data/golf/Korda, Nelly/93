 Q.  Another sister act here.  All smiles for these two.  I know you would like to have 18 back, but still really well-played by you both.  Nelly, you came in first, you played behind her.  Is it better to be in the front or the back?  
NELLY KORDA: I don't know.  How was the view?   
JESSICA KORDA: We never saw you guys.  I've only played behind her, so I don't know what it's like to be up front.   
 Q.  When you're out there, how much are you trying to keep -- obviously you're busy with your own game, but how much are you trying to watch and see what your sister is doing?  
NELLY KORDA: I tried to look back couple times.  It's kind of hard out here.   
JESSICA KORDA: Probably didn't see me too often.   
NELLY KORDA: They were a little behind; we were pretty fast.   
But I tried to look back as much as possible.   
 Q.  Jessica, I know you're a little under the weather, but still in really good position to get this victory.  What's the focus going into tomorrow?  
JESSICA KORDA: Honestly, it's Friday today, so I'm just happy to finish another round.  Excited for the weekend.  Hopefully it's a good one.   
 Q.  Nelly, how about for you?  Watching your sister play well, this big event, and also your first experience in something like this.  What's it been like looking at your entire first season?  
NELLY KORDA: It's been a lot of fun.  Obviously there has been a lot of up and downs, but more ups than downs obviously because I'm here.   
But I'm having a lot of fun.   
 Q.  You shot one better today.  Going to make her buy you dinner tonight?  
NELLY KORDA: I don't think she's going to get out of the room tonight.  (Laughter.)   
JESSICA KORDA: Definitely not leaving again.   
 Q.  Well played, ladies?  
JESSICA KORDA: Thank you.   
NELLY KORDA: Thank you.
