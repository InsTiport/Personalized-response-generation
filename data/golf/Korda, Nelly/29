  Q. A pair of 72s.  You said yesterday you struggled to walk through the opening three holes.  How would you describe it out there today?
 NELLY KORDA:   A little better.  It died down throughout our round yesterday but it stayed very consistent throughout the round, actually, so I think conditions were a little tougher, actually, today.
 Q. Some relief, though, you just said kind of a bit of a sigh of exhalation when you walk off the golf course, just glad to get in and done on a good number?
 NELLY KORDA:   Definitely.  It's playing so hard out there because you feel like you're playing two different golf courses, going out you have right-to-left wind and coming back in you have left-to-right, so you're kind of adjusting your swing the whole entire way.   It's tough.  I definitely lost a lot of balls to the right on the back nine.
 Q. How much is it testing you mentally trying to focus on what you're doing and also having that important dialogue with your caddie?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, it's tough out there.  Staying positive is definitely a big part of playing well this week, and thankfully my caddie really helps me in that part, and so far, we are doing well.
 Q. When you look at that leaderboard in a great position, what's at the forefront of your mind as you try to put yourself in a great position with a chance to win this championship come late Sunday?
 NELLY KORDA:   You never know what the wind or the weather is going to be like.  There's still 36 holes.  Going to try to hit as many fairways and greens as possible.  Going to try to give myself as many looks and see where it goes.
 Q. Looks like you're having fun out there with Georgia.  Did that help keep you relaxed and not thinking about conditions too much?
 NELLY KORDA:   For sure, we were like, are you scared over one-footers, too, with this wind, because we were like shaking over it with wind and the gusts.  She's like, me, too.  I'm like, okay, good.
