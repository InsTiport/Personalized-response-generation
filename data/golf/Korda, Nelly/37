 Q.  Nice opening round. 5-under par. Birdie, eagle, birdie finish. Talk me through your round.  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I mean I started off 1-over through a couple holes and then I made three birdies in a row. Kind of hit the brakes on the back nine, but then I finished really nicely. Not complaining about that birdie, eagle, birdie finish.   
 Q.  You've had success on this golf course before. It's kind of like a major championship golf course. When you're out there, does it feel like that?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I mean, definitely it's a tough golf course. It's playing a little different from last year. I think the fairways are fluffier so I think it's playing a little long and the greens are a little firmer.   
You know, it's bermudagrass. I've grown up on that. I feel like I'm at home.   
 Q.  What about just sort of the overall feel of the tournament now that you're in the middle of it?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I always love playing in Florida and I love coming to this event. I really enjoy this golf course and the crowd. I really enjoy having my family here. My entire family is here, so it feels great this week.   
 Q.  What's sort of clicked on the last three holes to get you that finish?  
NELLY KORDA: I don't even know. (Laughter.) I just hit it really close on that par-3; made a really good putt off the green on 17; then I also made a pretty good putt.   
So, I mean, I just hit really good putts on the last three holes.
