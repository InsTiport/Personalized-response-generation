  NELLY KORDA:   I did have a lot of fun today with my game.  But I played solid.  You know, was a little different today.  Was a complete opposite wind, so had to really adjust to that.
 Q. This is a course that I feel like a lot people are know for going low, too.  When did you really start feeling it click, especially with those few birdies on the first couple holes?
 NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, I was just hitting it solid and hitting my lines on the putting green and they were just rolling in.
 They're po greens and I'm not really used to poana a greens; I'm used to bermuda.  It's a very big difference.
 But I'm glad I putted well this week.  Just going to take it to next week hopefully.
 Q. Next week, another major right in front of us.  Feels like we just had ANA.  But from what you learned from your experience at ANA and just a great week here, what do you hope to take away as you begin next week preparation?
 NELLY KORDA:   You know, consistency is key, and the more rounds you play under pressure the more you learn.
 You know, I'm just going to take what I learned at ANA, stay calm, and just play my game.
