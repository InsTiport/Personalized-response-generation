Q. How pleased are with you that number given how tough conditions were today?
NELLY KORDA:   Very pleased.  I have never played in that type of wind the first couple of holes.  It's definitely calmed down a little, but I had a hard time walking the first three holes.
Q. What happened with your swing?  Commentators commented about your rhythm and quality of your golf swing as we've seen so often on the LPGA Tour the last couple of years, how tough is it to maintain that rhythm when it's howling like it was?
NELLY KORDA:   It's crazy.  They say when it's breezy, swing easy, but you also have to get it to the hole.  It's like a combination of everything.  But yeah, it's crazy because I'm tall.  The wind kind of swayed me around a little bit more.
Q. It's a great venue.  You've had an early look in practise in round one.  How much do you love the challenge of Royal Troon?
NELLY KORDA:   Yeah, it's an amazing golf course.  Even the views are breathtaking.  During the practise round, I didn't think it was going to play so different, but I like it.  I like a challenge and we'll see what happens the rest of the way.
Q. What's at the forefront of your mind in terms of your approach to this golf course, but also mentally, what you need to do to be in the hunt come late Sunday?
NELLY KORDA:   You're going to make mistakes, so try to minimize it as much as possible, and just keep your head high because a positive attitude goes a long way.
