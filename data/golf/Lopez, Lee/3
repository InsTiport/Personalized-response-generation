LEE LOPEZ: People started going oooh and then the huge cheer just went up.  So we didn't see it go in.  I think we were -- I hit a 4-iron, I was 195 to the pin, 167.  So we were just playing to that to the front of the green, downwind left to right.
Q. Did you hit it exactly the way you drew it up in your mind?
LEE LOPEZ: I knew exactly when I hit it, I was like, well, it's going to have to get unlucky for this to not end up in a good spot.
Q. An annual habit?
LEE LOPEZ: I know.  I'm okay with it.  And it was actually on a Saturday last year, too.
Q. Third round?
LEE LOPEZ: Yep, uh-huh.
Q. How many career hole-in-ones have you had?
LEE LOPEZ: To be honest with you, this is only technically my second.  Last year being my first, but I did have a hole-in-one when I was 11 years old at this little par-3 course.  Everybody says that doesn't count, but in my opinion that counts.
