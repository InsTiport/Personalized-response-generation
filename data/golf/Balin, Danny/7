  Q. Take us through the experience and what went on today?  
 DANNY BALIN: Yeah, it's definitely been a great week all week to be able to have my friends and family here with me and to be playing in the PGA Championship. It's what every golfer dreams of.  
 Today unfortunately I had a couple of bad breaks, and yesterday, and couldn't really get anything going. Today I got off to a good start and then on the 4th hole I hit a drive into the rough and made triple and didn't come back from that.   
 But overall, you know, it's been a great week and take a lot out of it. I learned a lot this week and just going to practice a little bit harder.  
  
  Q. What's the biggest thing you're going to take from this week?   
 DANNY BALIN: Just the little things, still young to the game and all of these guys practice hard. Just keep practicing as hard as these guys. It seems like I have the game to compete with them, just have to do the little things.   
  
  Q. Cool to be one of only 20 of 3,600 guys who tried to qualify?  
 DANNY BALIN: Yeah, no doubt about it, out of those 20 from across the country to represent everybody as best as possible; this is a world-class event. It's been unbelievable and representing The PGA of America is great and hopefully come back next year.
