Q.   Kind of a tale of two rounds today, huh?
DANNY BALIN:   Yeah, got off to a difficult, struggling start.   The wind was whipping this morning.   It was very difficult, hit a couple bad shots, but played the back nine real well.   I think I ended up at 1â€‘under on the back nine, so that was nice, something to build on and something to take away with me going forward. 

Q.   You've played a few days in a row now.   What do you take from this week? 
DANNY BALIN :   I take a lot of positives away from it.   I've just got to play my game and stick to what I know how to do.   Like I said, nothing came easy this afternoon, or this morning, I guess.   Just got to keep doing it.
