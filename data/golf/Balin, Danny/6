  Q. Obviously not how you wanted to start. Talk a little bit about the day.   
 DANNY BALIN: Yeah, just missed middle of the fairway on the 1st hole, put it in the bunker, gave myself a chance for par and missed.   
 Then the 2nd hole from 94 yards I think it was, didn't look that way, I hit it over, and you can't hit it long, made double. That's just kind of how my day went.   
 I shanked a 6-iron on the 4th hole into the water and then three-putted for 6, and when you're coming from that far behind, it's tough.   
 You know, I made a couple pars kind of to end it up, but the first four holes kind of just got me.  
  
  Q. Caddies said that the bunkers are very difficult, a lot of -- all three of you guys were in bunkers. Talk about how difficult the bunkers are.   
 DANNY BALIN: Yeah, it's not that they're difficult, there's just a lot of sand in certain spots and the ball is plugging, and the greens the way they are and some of the pins in these situations are in the positions that they are, you can't get it close, and it's just trying to get it on the green. With as much sand as is in there, it's tough, you can't get it out.  
  
  Q. Obviously 81 is not what you wanted, so what do you want to do tomorrow? What's going to be the goal tomorrow?  
 DANNY BALIN: Just go out there and have fun. I don't know if I can shoot 59 to maybe make the cut on the number or maybe 60. I'll do my best, but just at least hit it the way that I know how to hit it and play the way I know how to play and give myself as many chances as possible and just enjoy the day with all my family and friends and just the crowds being out here in a major.
