Q.   You've got the ability and the talent and so forth, and for some reason or another, you just can't get over the hump.   What do you analyze about the week you had? 
DANNY BALIN:   It was a great week.   I played pretty well.   Just a couple 3‑putts with the rain and the green speeds kind of fooled me a little bit.   But I'm right there.   I hit it good.   I feel like, like you said, I have to get over the hump and one of these years it will happen. 

Q.   You're always here. 
DANNY BALIN:   Yeah, always here.   Just have to get out of your own way, play and not think about it, and I thought I did this year but just struggled this morning with the putter.   Had three 3‑putts in the first three holes, and as you know, you can't have 3‑putts and you can't give strokes away. 

Q.   Now, you had to endure like the first wave of folks on a wet Oak Hill; is it going to be much better for guys out here for scoring based on what you've seen?
DANNY BALIN:   If it's not raining, it will be a lot easier, but the greens will be receptive.   I think the hard thing this morning was just the rain; you're wet, and it's tough to kind of stay dry and keep the grips dry and hit good quality shots. 
I figure it will be a little bit easier for them.   The greens, they are running beautifully, and they are soft, so you can attack some of the pins.

Q.   Wouldn't surprise you to see a great score?
DANNY BALIN:   Not at all.   Webb Simpson is playing good right now, so I think there are going to be some good scores out there today. 

Q.   Do you rely on a swing coach or anything?
DANNY BALIN:   Yeah, I spend some time with Bobby at Old Oaks Country Club.   I spend a couple hours with him here and there.   I understand my golf swing now and I spend a lot of time practicing and working on it. 
I'm right there.   I've just got to keep doing it.
