 Q. Are you happy with that?
 IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, a little disappointed at the end but I got a great shot into 15 and 3-putted it; a poor shot into 16 and missed the green just right, and thought I hit a good chip just short and missed the putt. 
 But overall, I holed some nice putts, and missed a couple at the end. But it was a bit of the good, the bad and the ugly. Just struggled with my driver again -- well, not so much my driver, 3-wood more than anything I struggled with. So got to keep working on that and get some confidence with it.

 Q. Strange weather; one minute it's coming down, and the next it's sunny. 
 IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, I think that's all right, though. The last few greens have a bit more grain on them than some of the other greens. So you've got to be careful on the last few holes. I don't know if a lot of shots been dropped on the last few holes, but I would say a lot of 3-putting been going on. They have got a bit of grain on them, yeah. I missed one on the 15th, as I say. You can see the grain on it. I just miss-hit it a bit and off it's gone. 
 So, I'm pleased, off and running. Haven't lost the tournament from there, anyway.
