 Q. What's your thought on the fans shouting out?  
IAN WOOSNAM: I hate it. I really do. I think golf's about enjoying the good shots and being polite and saying the correct thing. This, "get in the hole," and whatever, I hate it.   
   
 Q. Was it totally silent when you were doing your thing back in the day?  
IAN WOOSNAM: Pretty well, yeah. Yeah. You would get the very odd one person who would be a bit rowdy, he had maybe had too many drinks, but it seems to be really all the time now, doesn't it? I hope they get thrown out.
