Q.   On practice ranges around the world, they were wanting to ask you just‑‑
IAN WOOSNAM:   Who wanted to ask me? 

Q.   It's part of the PGA Communications Office.   Just doing a side story.   Just what some of the best practice ranges that you've been to around the world are. 
IAN WOOSNAM:   I would say Augusta is one of the best ones now.   Muirfield Village, I think.   That's a question I haven't really thought about that, really.   Those are definitely two of the best ones that I've been on.   Wentworth?   No. 
God, I could be here for half an hour thinking about that one. 

Q.   What are some of the things like at Augusta and the ones you mentioned that make it a great range?
IAN WOOSNAM:   Well, I think a great range is where you can go to both ends or, I think, especially at Muirfield village, I remember Jack Nicklaus ‑‑ I haven't been there for a few years ‑‑ but you can go to wherever it's playing into the wind.   And Augusta is that way.   They have shaped the practice range, now you can practice playing your draws and you can practice playing your fades.   That gives you a good imagination for when you're going on the golf course.
