  Q. Good day on the great old links?   
 IAN WOOSNAM: Well, it was like I was a different person to what I was yesterday. That's the way my game is at the moment. One day I play all right and the next I don't play so well. I just kept on battling and 1-under is not too bad and I'm in with a shout really.  
  
  Q. Will you go to the range now or putting green? What do you do?   
 IAN WOOSNAM: I go home and have a bit of relaxation and have some food.  
  
  Q. 1996, you won The Scottish Open here and you find yourself in the same position coming from behind; can you draw on '96?   
 IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, I think so. I think I'm the sort of person, I get on the range, I start hitting the ball well, I start hitting the ball well on the first few holes, I feel like I can make a score then but it all depends on how I start. If I start good, I think I'll have a chance.   
 But for me, tomorrow, I hope the wind blows. I think it will be better if it blows a little. I feel like if I hit the ball low, I'll be better actually. Sometimes I hit it a little bit too high and I think if I start hitting it lower to the ground it will be a little bit better think.
