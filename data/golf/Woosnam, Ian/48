IAN WOOSNAM:  I'm looking forward to the week. I have just played it this morning for the first time this week and the rough is a bit patchy. You can get a good lie or a bad lie. The greens are in good shape, fairly fast. It is going to be a good week, let's hope the weather is good.

This is a course I have played really well on, not particularly well at this time of year but in the match play I play better. But you never know. I have been showing a little bit of form, made three cuts in a row and maybe I can get it going around here.
