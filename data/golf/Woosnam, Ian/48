IAN WOOSNAM:  I played slightly very good. No, played fantastic. That was about five off the pace of what I should have been really. Played brilliant.
Q. What has changed it around?
IAN WOOSNAM:  I have changed my swing. I didn't putt that well -- the greens were  a little bumpy towards the end. After all the weather there were a few footmarks.
Q.  How long to change your swing?
IAN WOOSNAM:  Six days since last week. I am swinging flatter now. Working with Bob Torrance again now so it has put me in the right lines. Just started working with him middle of last week.
Q.  Are you swinging it more like you used to?
IAN WOOSNAM:  Yes, but it is really difficult on my back. It is just going to take time but it shows today I can do it.
