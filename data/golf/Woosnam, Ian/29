Q.  Ian, how does it feel to be European captain when you see the scoreboard saying Europe, 10, America, 6?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  I've got to say, we're getting closer to our mark, but we've just got to get over that hurdle tomorrow.
Q.  One of your main responsibilities, to choose the pairings.  I know you don't like taking responsibility for these things, but you've done a cracking job.
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Yeah, we've but the some good pairings together.  Disappointing for Padraig and McGinley, but they are playing the two best players in the world.
Q.  Is this the best European Team ever?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  I've got to say in strength and depth, it is one of the strongest we've ever had, well, the strongest we've ever had.
Q.  The Irish will be celebrating, thinking this is over.  What do you say to them?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Don't get too excited.

You know how strong America is in the singles.  It just shows you the rookies came out pretty good today.
Q.  Tom has got to put his big boys out first.  Does that make your job easier?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  That's what we've got to discuss now in the team room.
