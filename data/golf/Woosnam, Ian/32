Q. Darren Clarke, obviously some people questioned that pick.  You must be completely delighted with the justification he's given you today.
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Absolutely, Darren is right up there.  I know he's not playing this afternoon, but he's just ready to play every single game.
Q.  Give us a sense of your afternoon pairings, what were you thinking there?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Well, I think everybody is playing so well, and I just felt    I just wanted to give everybody a game, and everybody is going to play on the first day, which is fantastic.
