Q.
Ian, your thoughts on a nerve jangling afternoon?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  What a game of golf that was, wasn't it?  I'm so happy for the boys.  It's, what, two points ahead?  I don't know what we are.  But what a putt there; always down to Monty, isn't it?  Every single one of them played great, and we played every single player today.
Q.
You put Monty and Lee together for the first time.  Was that your idea or theirs?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  I thought they looked great together, and I thought, you know, they were both playing very well and I thought they'd be hard to beat.
Q.
How do the emotions compare to being a player?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  It's just the same, but I think being a captain, you're looking after 12 guys here, and it is a little bit different.  You just want to try and get it right, and we've got it right on the first day.
Q.
What's the game plan tomorrow?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Well, try and get my strongest team out there again.
Q.
Are you going to mix up those four ball pairings from this morning?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  We'll see.
