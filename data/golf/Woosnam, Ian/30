Q.
Ian, in the context of the match, how big was the point or the half a point that Paul and Robert won?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Massive, I think.  Getting half a point, again, this morning is terrific for our side.  1Ã ½ to 2Ã ½ is terrific.  It's another half a point towards the 14Ã ½ we're looking for.
Q.  You were confident coming in, but to win all three sessions, has that exceeded your expectations?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  It has actually.  We'll have to see what happens this afternoon.  This course is playing long, it's wet.  There's some different pairings this afternoon.  We'll see what happens.
Q.  Still not counting any chickens?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  No, you can't.  Anything can change.  There's been terrific golf, again, by Zach Johnson.  He played fantastic this morning.
