Q.  Your team have just created history by winning three consecutive Ryder Cups.  How does that feel?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  Very emotional.  I just can't say enough about my team.  They played absolutely fantastic, on edge for a little bit there, but I know as that blue started getting more and more on the board -- I've just got to say thanks to the fantastic crowds today.  They've been unbelievable on the first tee.  And they've really got behind us and I think that's made a lot of big difference.

History, I can put it out to fold and they can go for the fourth on their own.
Q.  Has there ever been a better atmosphere in a Ryder Cup?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  It's never been like this before.  They've made history with this crowd here.
Q.  Has it exceeded your expectations?
CAPTAIN IAN WOOSNAM:  I knew it was going to be loud.  I've got to say, as well, I've got a fantastic back room staff, as well.
