Q.   74 today, but you're still right there in the thick of things.  Talk about how you come into tomorrow knowing the golf course a little better?

IAN WOOSNAM:   It depends on what the conditions are going to be tomorrow.  It was pretty calm today.  You're not going to get much smoother than this.  Foursomes are very difficult.  You've both got to play well to score well in foursomes.


Q.   Bradley, you've been playing out here for two days.  Is there anything you go into tomorrow knowing, okay, he is a little bit better at this hole I can go for it.  Now that you know the course and you know your partner.

BRADLEY DREDGE:  When you play more and more on a golf course like this, you get comfortable with certain shots and there are going to be certain holes where I'm going to be more comfortable than Ian, and Ian is going to be more comfortable than me.  With that in mind, perhaps tomorrow I'll have a different strategy on one hole than I did on the first day.  You take that into account and just play accordingly and just hope you get the best results.
