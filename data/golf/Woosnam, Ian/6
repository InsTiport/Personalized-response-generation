 Q.  Bit of a grind but still very much in the mix.  
IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, I played really solid golf.  Just had a squall -- sat down for five or ten minutes, tried to hit one over the bunkers and just got stiff.  Couldn't find my ball.  One bad shot, can't find my ball.   
Then on 10, I birdied -- I made a five, then birdied the next, birdied the next.  10 I just pushed it a little bit and went around that bunker on a terrible lie and pitched it on.  Then had another horrendous lie on par 3, the 12th.   
And then I hit in another bush on 13, so it just wasn't going my way.  Played some good stuff, so it was encouraging.  Just came up a little short.   
 Q.  You did get into the red numbers, so you must be encouraged by that.  
IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, take the double bogey out, it's there.   
 Q.  Very much in the mix, terrible weather tomorrow.  Going to have to use some magic?  
IAN WOOSNAM: With the rain in the morning, maybe I might not get out of bed (chuckles).
