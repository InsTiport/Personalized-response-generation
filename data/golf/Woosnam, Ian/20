 Q. What were your thoughts about the course today? 
 IAN WOOSNAM: It played fairly fair, I think. I didn't think it was too unplayable. A good score was out there if you played well. Just made too many mistakes.

 Q. Now you only had five pars, only one on the front nine, how did you keep it together throughout the whole round to come out with the score that you did?
 IAN WOOSNAM: Well I think I was trying to change a few things in my swing and I, obviously, I hit some great shots and I hit some bad shots. And that's the way I'm playing at the moment. 
 I just got to accept that when I hit a good shot I hit it close and make the putts and when I made a bad shot I just couldn't get it up-and-down. Hopefully tomorrow I can hit a few good shots and if I miss the greens I got to chip better.
