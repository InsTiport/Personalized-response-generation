Q. Talk about your round a little, what, is that about as good as you can play out here?IAN WOOSNAM: I think 68 is about the worst I could have been today, because I missed it on number 3, I think I missed it from four feet. Then I missed it on 10 from four feet. 11, four feet. Then I pitched it up on 12 to about five feet and missed that.  So three in a row. Then on 16 I was just short of the green in two.  Duffed my chip and duffed my next -- well, missed my next one, and bogeyed it from sixty yards away. So, yeah, it could have been a lot better.  But I had a nice putt at the last to save it for 68.Q. Right now, three back going into the last round, that's, lord knows where you'll be at the end of the day, but giving yourself a chance.IAN WOOSNAM: I hope that one-shot penalty I had on the first day doesn't count, because that's something that's been on my mind for the last couple of days. But, yeah, if the wind starts blowing and the guys come back at sort of level par, I'm only three behind, that would be fantastic.  I imagine I'm going to be about five behind going into the last day.
