   IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah, step it up. One little putt there. That was a great start. Just what I wanted. Just fed it off at the end. I don't know if I just got a little bit tired or what. Just hit a couple of fat shots on the back nine and lost a bit of concentration.   
 And 1-under, it's not the end of the world either.   
  
  Q. Is that symptomatic of how the whole week is going to play out, that the back nine is going to be far more demanding?   
 IAN WOOSNAM: Yeah. What's upsetting for me, usually my driving is bad. And I got it down in the middle of the fairway and now my iron's letting me down.   
 It's funny, the greens are amazing how much faster they were today than what they were yesterday. I struggled a bit with the pace and I got a little bit scared on the greens as well at the end there. But the greens are putting fantastic. Just gotta get used to the speed of it. If it stays dry, they'll get really fast.  
  
  Q. Are you going to have a bit of time on the practice putting green?  
 IAN WOOSNAM: I think I'd rather go have a pint (laughter). I think that will do the trick.  
  
  Q. Practicing, is it fair to say, hasn't necessarily always as been your forte; you don't want to do too much, though, do you?  
 IAN WOOSNAM: It's all those -- I get on the practice round, what am I going to practice? I start on the practice ground, I absolutely rip it. So what am I doing? So sometimes just it's more beneficial just when it's putts and chips and that's the sort of place where you're going to save your shots really.  
  
  Q. We're asking everybody when they come up, the big golfing news of the day about Tiger Woods splitting from his caddie, Stevie Williams. Does that surprise you?  
 IAN WOOSNAM: The only thing I hope he doesn't ask me. I can't carry the bag around anymore, or I could go out training, couldn't I?   
 No, I can understand that. Stevie's -- he's been working for Adam for a few weeks. I don't see the problem with that. If he's injured, why not? There must be something more to it than what there is.  
  
  Q. Steve Williams says he feels he's wasted the last two years of his life. Do you have any sympathy with that?  
 IAN WOOSNAM: Well, I would say obviously I thought they were very close. Obviously I don't know. It's got nothing to do with me anyway.  
  
  Q. But you could imagine quite a few people out there wouldn't mind carrying Tiger Woods' bag, would you?  
 IAN WOOSNAM: Exactly. Everybody would love to carry Tiger Woods' bag. But there's a lot that goes with it as. It's a hard job, all the security guys and all that crap that goes along with it. Rubbish to me. Just get out there and play golf.
