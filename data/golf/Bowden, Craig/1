 Q. 4-under, 68. I believe the low round of the afternoon. Couple quick thoughts on the day. 
 CRAIG BOWDEN: I hit it great today. Best ball-striking run I've had maybe all year. Left quite a few out there even this afternoon. I didn't make that many putts on the back nine. The front nine, I got a lot of it. 
 Still left a couple on the front nine, but I played good. I hit the ball from tee to green really well and capitalized when I did hit it good on the front. The backside I didn't capitalize that much.
 Looking forward to tomorrow morning. Can't wait to get out here in softer conditions and being able to fire it right at the flag.

 Q. Speaking of the softer conditions in the morning, how did the golf course play this afternoon?
 CRAIG BOWDEN: Well, it got firm. It definitely got firm. A lot balls were hitting and scooting right through the green. You know, this golf course plays so different from the morning to the afternoon. I mean, completely different. 
 It's two different animals. I mean, in the morning you got to worry about how much spin you're putting on it, and in the afternoon you can't put enough spin on it and you're having to play away from some flags. 
 Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

 Q. Obviously sounds like you're excited about tomorrow morning. Take a lot confidence out of this round going into tomorrow?
 CRAIG BOWDEN: I've had very little confidence lately, and I finally put a round up that I thought my golf swing was good all day long. Every shot I hit today was really, really solid. I can't think of really any shots that I missed. 
 I missed one shot on No. 16. I missed a par-3 there. But, yeah, I was able to scramble and make a par, so...
