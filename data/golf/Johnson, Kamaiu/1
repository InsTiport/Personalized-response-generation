Q. A few comments about the experience.  I know you were hoping to be around for the weekend but just overall how did the experience go?
KAMAIU JOHNSON:   Oh, great experience, man.  I learned a lot.  It's never a loss.  It's always a learn.  I learned a lot this weekend, this week, and I'm looking forward to the next couple events that I got on the PGA TOUR.  I mean, I can only go up from here.  So, yeah, I just got to, really struggled on the greens this week.  Didn't hit it bad at all.  I mean, the scores I shot I shot it with, I didn't lose a ball.  No penalty shots.  So it's just around the green and on the green, that's where I lost all my strokes this week.  But all in all, I learned a lot, for sure.
Q. What are some of the -- I'm sure you gotten lots of support from the guys out here.

Like, numerous guys have come up to me, saying how inspiring my story is and how they're glad to have me out here and they're glad I made it this far.  That's very motivating for me.  It makes me want to get out here.  It makes me wants to go back home and grind and practice and get ready for the next couple events.
Q. Was it hard, was it everything you expected, anticipated, making your first start out here, any surprises?
KAMAIU JOHNSON:   No, no surprises, no surprises.  You're on the PGA TOUR, you're going to play tough tracks.  That's week-in and week-out.  I learned from that and just looking forward to golf down the road.
