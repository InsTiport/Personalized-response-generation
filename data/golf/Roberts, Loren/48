 Q.  How did you feel about the early tee time today? 
 LOREN ROBERTS:  It was pretty good.  We had nine holes that were pretty good and you could make some birdies.  The back nine got a little tough, obviously, coming to the house.  But I think they did a great job setting the course up, putting the tees in the right places.  And I thought it was pretty good. 

 Q.  Having won a major last year, Senior British, conditions somewhat like this, how much confidence does that give you? 
 LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, hopefully if I go out and just hit the ball solidly and make a few putts.  But the wind is going to blow for another day and we'll see what happens.  Tomorrow it will kind of separate the field a little bit more and we'll see what happens. 

 Q.  Do you really feel like you have to fight every single shot? 
 LOREN ROBERTS:  Well, you do.  Especially when you turn into the wind.  You have to really hit the ball solid.  Because there's a lot of trouble on this golf course.  Just look at the size of the fairways.  It's not like a true links golf course where they mow the fairways down.  You have to hit the ball really solid shots every time. 

 Q.  I know you would rather be in the red, but still to be even, gives yourself a chance for the rest of the week? 
 LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, it does.  I certainly didn't shoot myself in the foot today, so that's good.
