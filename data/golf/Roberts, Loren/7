 Q.   Talk about your round today overall.   How you think it went.   
LOREN ROBERTS:   Oh, a little off, but hung in there.   This was just a hang in round today.   You got the wind going, the wind's blowing a little different direction than it's blown the other days.   
So I missed some putts, but I made a couple.   It was just a tough struggle day.   Nobody really knows the golf course, so you try to hit it.   And you're unsure and the wind was blowing and the tees were up on some holes where we haven't played from.   
By and large I didn't shoot myself in the foot.   You can't win it the first day, but you can lose it.   
   
 Q.   What are some of the toughest shots to hit on this course?  
LOREN ROBERTS:   Well, if you got water, trouble down the right side, you get, when you got the wind blowing across the fairway towards the trouble, that's always a tough, tough shot.   You really have to be careful, because you know the ball's going to be going that direction.   
But I think the key thing is trying to get the ball pin high.   You have got to get the ball within a 10 foot circle to really have any kind of a legitimate birdie putt on any of these tough greens.   And that's tough to do in the wind.
