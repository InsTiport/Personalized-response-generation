STEVEN FRANKLIN: Welcome to Turnberry, a great course with a great history. What does it feel like to be here this week?
LOREN ROBERTS:  This feels great. The last time I was here in 1994 for the Open Championship and I was excited to see that when I turned 50 that I was going to get a chance to go right back again.

So I am looking forward to this week. It is a great golf course with a lot of great history to it.  And I really enjoyed it when I played the Open Championships here. I always had a special fondness for this golf course.  It's a straight up in front of you, good golf course.
Q.  How did you do in 1994 - do you remember?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I can't remember.  I think I was in the Top 10 at one point on the weekend and I didn't play too well on Sunday, but somewhere around 20th or 25th or something.
Q.  You have carved out a good niche for yourself on the US Champions Tour?

Yes. This will be my first repeat.  I guess I'm not officially a rookie anymore because The Senior British Open at Aberdeen last year was my first on the Champions Tour.
Q.  You started well in Aberdeen?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I started well.  Made a bad number on Sunday or else I would have been right there.
Q.  How do you think your game adapts to links golf. Are you comfortable playing these kinds of courses?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I have always loved links golf. It doesn't favour any one particular player, which is the biggest knock about golf in America sometimes is that all you have to do is hit it high and hit it far.  Here you've got to think your way around more.  There's always more than one option for every hole, and as long as you can keep it going forward, you have a chance.
Q.  And your expectations for this week?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Let me just say that my expectations are pretty high, and leave it at that.  (Laughing.)
