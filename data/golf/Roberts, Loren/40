   LOREN ROBERTS:  It was tough today, especially the front nine. It seemed like I played really well until the weather kind of let up a little bit and then I didn't finish the way I wanted to. But I played very solidly today.   
 That's what happens with the weather. You get into a rhythm and all of a sudden it changes on you and you need to recover and I didn't recover well. I made par at No. 17 and you really need to make a birdie there if you are going to make any kind of run at the leaders. I three-putted 18 and that was kind of costly.   
  
  Q.  It's far from over?   
 LOREN ROBERTS:  We'll just have to see what happens. Maybe if the wind picks up here again and blows the last couple of hours. You never know. They're not lighting up the leaderboard.   
 You get just enough rain and it changes the speed of the greens and you have to be aware of that.   
 It looked yesterday like I might not even be around for the weekend before I rallied on the back nine so that was nice. I thought if I could get it to 3 or 4-under today I could get right there but it didn't quite happen.
