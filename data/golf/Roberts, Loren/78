Q.
Are you happy with that or no?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Obviously you saw the last hole.  No, I'm not.  I played pretty solid most of the day and hit a lot of good shots, missed some shots on the backside, but I played pretty good so I'm happy with it.
Q.
You like this golf course, don't you?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I love this golf course.  It's a great old-style golf course, a lot of different options on every hole.  It's a great course.
Q.
You started off real strong.
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yes, I played really good.  I was right on the front edge of the green and chipped it in there for a birdie at the first hole, made an eagle and hit three really good shots at 5, made eagle there, and finished with another birdie on 9.  So it was a good nine, could have been a little better, but I played solid, so I'm happy.  I'm happy to get off to a good start.
Q.
Are you surprised at a lot of low scores today, like the 6-under?
LOREN ROBERTS:  No, I'm not really surprised.  There wasn't much wind and the golf course was a little softer with the little bit of rain we had.  I was surprised there weren't more lower scores in the 5, 6, 7-under range.
