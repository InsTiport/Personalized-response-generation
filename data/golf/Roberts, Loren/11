 Q. Long day?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Yeah, it was a very long day today. Shoot, I played as good as I played yesterday. But today, you know, one bad swing, I made a double at 15. It hit a tree and went down in the crap. Unplayable, really. Really just didn't make any putts today. I didn't putt well. I made a couple of good five-, six-footers, but those were after the first putts were really bad.

 Q. Talk about the conditions on the course today. 
 LOREN ROBERTS: The greens were slower today. For some reason they were slower than they were yesterday morning. And some were firm and some were soft. So there was a definite change to the setup of the golf course, I thought. But, still, the scores are not that low. It's just a tough golf course where the pin positions are. It's really hard to get a look at a birdie.

 Q. You seem to be always lurking here at the Senior Open?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, yeah, hopefully we'll still be lurking after tomorrow. I've got some work to do. I didn't like the way I drove the ball today. We'll see.
 I hit a couple out of play and that bothered me. I know, I'm still right there. I'm even par, so, you know, we'll just see. I've got to keep that score in mind for the next two days, it might be good.

 Q. There's a whole bunch of guys within three, four, five. 
 LOREN ROBERTS: Yeah, the golf course is so hard, it's pretty hard to get much distance. If you're playing really good it's just hard, I think -- hard to separate yourself from the field because the golf course so tough. 
 It doesn't matter really how good you hit it, it's just hard to get the ball close enough to get a look at birdie, even if you hit it really good.
