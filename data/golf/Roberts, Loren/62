Q.  How was today compared to yesterday?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I'm really not playing very well.  Just not    just kind of not hitting the ball good enough to really do anything right now.  And missed a few putts today, but made a couple.  But we're still in it.  So I think I'll be lucky if I'm only four or five back by the end of the day.  So we'll see what happens.
Q.  Any adjustments for the next two days?
LOREN ROBERTS:  I don't know, I've been working on my swing for two and a half months and I still ain't playing any good.  So we'll see what happens.
Q.  Were there any highlights in your round?
LOREN ROBERTS:  No, two birdies, two bogeys.  It was just kind of a blah round.  I'm not really hitting the ball good enough to really put a number up right now.  So we'll go and see if we can get it changed around for tomorrow.
