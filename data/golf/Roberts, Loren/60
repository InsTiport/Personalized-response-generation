Q.  Unbelievable.
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, he hit a great shot.  That was the shot of the tournament.  I think.
Q.  You were kind of on the fringe all day.  Just seemed like you needed one more something to drop to get back in it.
LOREN ROBERTS:  Myself personally, I really just haven't hit the ball good enough.

I couldn't drive it in the fairway, I was missing greens with 8 irons, I'm just not swinging very good right now.  And I didn't putt well either.
Q.  Perseverance was pretty much the key out here?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, I survived.  You need to have your A game going on.  Brad and Jay were the two best ball strikers this week and that's why they're in a playoff.
Q.  Is Brad kind of doing what you did about 10 years after, you turned your game around in the 40s and now he's
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, I seem to think that he    he's always, he was always a great ball striker.  I always thought that.  And now, I don't know if it's he's got some confidence going.  He seems to really be playing within himself and just playing and putting well.  I think he's kind of hit that level where he's playing with some confidence and he's just going with it.
