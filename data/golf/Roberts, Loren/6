 Q.   You had pretty solid round today with four birdies.   
LOREN ROBERTS:   Yeah.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Take us through that round.   
LOREN ROBERTS:   I got off to a decent start, just made some good pars.   Starting on 10 there.   
I had some birdie putts early and didn't make them.   
And then I hit it in there close at 14, which is a good hole today into the wind and made about a 6‑footer for birdie there.   
Then birdied the next hole, made about a 4‑footer for birdie there.   So a good start.   
And then turned around and made a good birdie, drove it good, made a good birdie at number 15.   Probably hit it in there about a foot from the hole and made birdie there.   
And probably the key to the round today was I made a good, about a good eight, 10‑footer for par at 4, obviously, which is a hard hole.   And made a good putt for par there and that really kept the round going.   
And then just had looks at birdies all the rest of the way around.   Really only made one coming in.   So I hit a lot of greens today, only missed two greens, and I had a lot of looks at birdies and was able to get some in today.   
But I had a couple of key putts, probably that putt for par there at number 4 was key and also made a good up‑and‑down at 18 from long left too, which was a good par on 18.   
   
 Q.   You got to be feeling strong going into the weekend.   Any thoughts about that?  
LOREN ROBERTS:   You know, I hit the ball better today than I have.   So it's encouraging.
