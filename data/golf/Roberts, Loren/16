 Q. Loren, what do you have against odd numbers? Birdies on 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. 
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, I'm just glad I made them. I played good -- I putted better today than yesterday. Obviously with the wind up, the golf course played a little bit tougher and I was able to put up a good score. 

 Q. Well, you are on a good streak now, last week and this week; so everything is in place right now?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Yeah, I feel like I'm playing good. I'm playing some smart shots and not putting myself in some undue situations with some pressure, and I made some putts today and that's my game. If I putt well, then I'm usually going to do pretty decent.

 Q. Maybe it's funny to say when a guy shoots 66, but you missed a few putts and they were so close. You could have shot maybe a 64 today?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, you know, you always think about the ones you missed, but I got off to such a good start today, with the wind going, really I'm not unhappy. Obviously would have nice to shoot 64 but I'm really pretty happy with the round.
