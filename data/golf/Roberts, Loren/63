Q.  How was your round today?  I know you had some trouble on one of the holes?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, I scored well today.  I hit the ball rather poorly.  I don't think I drove it in the rough all day.  I don't think I hit more than about three or four fairways off the tee and I was able to    I made some good putts, my putter saved me today, I made a couple of good up and downs, and I made some birdies when I got it on the green.  So I'm going to go try to pull another driver out of the trunk of my car and try it and see if it's any better.
Q.  Are you using the one that you used today?
LOREN ROBERTS:  No, I'm just trying to    my driver I played with for years broke about three months ago and I'm trying to find another one.  I haven't quite got there yet.
Q.  You're trying to find the perfect fit?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Yeah, right.
Q.  Are there    I know you're a favorite coming into this tournament.  Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for this week?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Well I want to go out there and shoot as low as I can.  I got off to a good start the first nine today and then played 1 over from there on in.  I could have shot a really low round today, if I would have just hit the ball a little better.  So hopefully a good rotation, I like playing late on first day and then I got early tomorrow.  So that should put me in good position.  But obviously I'm here to try to win the golf tournament, but obviously so is everybody else.
Q.  Do you think that the way your tee times are set up is going to be an advantage for you?
LOREN ROBERTS:  Well, yeah.  I like to go late/early.  I think if you look at the stats at least on the PGA TOUR you find I think that the leader over 70 percent of the time comes out, after two days, comes out of the late/early rotation.
