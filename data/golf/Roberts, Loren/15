 Q. You'll be in the top 5 Money List, you'll be in the top 5 in the Schwab Cup, I think MontrÃ©al was good for you. 
 LOREN ROBERTS: It was. I really enjoyed the crowds here. The golf course is a great golf course. It's fun. It's exciting, because you make a lot of birdies, and it's great for the fans and the fans turned out. It was awesome. 

 Q. Do you think the players really appreciate the type of course -- it's very permissive; the wide, wide fairways and you could attack and maybe the greens were a little bit maybe tricky, but I think it was fun for the players. 
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, it was and that's what the fans love to come out and see, they love to come out and see birdies and eagles. It couldn't have been a better first year, I have to tell you. 

 Q. Jay Haas was telling me on behalf of all of the players that you really enjoyed your week here, everything was great. Up to expectation, or were you kind of surprised? 
 LOREN ROBERTS: Two words: First class.
