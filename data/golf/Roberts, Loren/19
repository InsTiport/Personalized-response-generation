  Q. After shooting a 77 on day one, came out and had three great rounds of golf. What was the difference from the first round of the last three?  
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, I just didn't hit the ball really that good all week, but the first day I hit it in spots where I couldn't get it up-and-down. I was a little more careful the last three days.   
 I putted poorly the first day, I really did. For me, I putted poorly. That's the whole reason, if you miss it on a few short sides and you're not playing well, that's what's going to happen.   
 You don't finish -- I finished, I was even par through the first seven holes and I chip it off the green and make a double at 17 and 3-putt 18. So I don't usually do that kind of stuff. So, but that's all the difference.   
  
  Q. How did this course compare to other ones that you played before? What did you take away from Colorado Golf Club?  
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, it's different. Me personally, I've always struggled a little bit with computing the distances that the balls go here and I always kind of struggled with that. And this is a golf course where you really just, you can't play the yardage to the pin. You have got to play over here and to be able to go over there, you know. I mean, it's one of those courses where you got a lot of up-and-downs.   
 So I just, for me personally I just kind of struggled all week with getting the right clubs and getting the ball pin high, because that's a huge factor being able to get the ball pin high with the severity of the greens. And I think that's why the first day I just didn't have anything going.
