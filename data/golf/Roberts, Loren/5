 Q.   Can you talk a little bit about your round today and how it went?  
LOREN ROBERTS:   Oh, it was, I think I had about 23 or 24, 24 putts today, I think.   So I was all over the place, but got it up‑and‑down from every where.   So didn't hit it real good, but I really chipped and putted the ball good.   My short game was exemplary and that's what got me where I'm at right now.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of some of the pin positions out there today?  
LOREN ROBERTS:   I thought they were good.   I thought they were very fair.   On some holes you had to challenge it.   That's what this golf course is.   The greens are very, very challenging.   You have to hit a perfect iron shot or you're going to have to really work on lagging your putt up close.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel heading into the weekend?  
LOREN ROBERTS:   Well I got to start hitting the ball a little better if I'm going to have a chance.   I got it up‑and‑down probably seven times today from just really tough places.   And I made some, I made, probably made three or four putts from 10 or 12 feet for pars today.   So that ain't going to keep you going.   You got to hit the ball better than that.   So I'm going to go work on it a little bit right now.
