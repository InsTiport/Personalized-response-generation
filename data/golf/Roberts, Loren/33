 Q. Other than obviously the high scores, in general how is your experience here in Rochester?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Oh, it was great. You know, it's been some pretty good history here. I was here in '89 and '93, and 2003 and the '95 Ryder Cup and it's a great spot. It's just a great golf course. It was a tough as I had ever seen it though. The rough was I think much thicker probably this year than it's been. 
 I know in August for the PGA in 2003 it was tough, but it was later in the summer and it was a little dryer. You could play from it. It was a stern test this week. 

 Q. Do you like the site here?
 LOREN ROBERTS: It's a great site. It's great having two golf courses here. You have a lot of room to stage things. And you know, the members know about golf. So it's a great place to be. 

 Q. You mentioned that this was a really tough course. What do you take away from that?
 LOREN ROBERTS: Well, nothing. I was playing poorly coming in here and you can't do that on a golf course like this. You got to hit your shot, you got to hit every tee shot right where you're looking and you're even going to hit some good shots that are going to turn out bad. That's yes, I was the just the way the golf course is.
