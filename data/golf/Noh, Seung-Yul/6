Q. What was different out there today?SEUNG-YUL NOH: Just make a putt, one chip-in and a lot of birdies.
Q. So what do you think forward, going into tomorrow, now kind of in contention, what's your mind-set for tomorrow?SEUNG-YUL NOH: It's getting hot out there.  It's getting firm and fast.  A little tough today but very good scoring, and then I think just a few shots behind the lead, so maybe another good chance for tomorrow.
Q. What do you think about the course so far?SEUNG-YUL NOH: It is tough, tough conditions, getting firm and fast.
Q. It's windy now and getting windy as the day goes on.SEUNG-YUL NOH: Just same, last two days, but every day a little different direction, so a little tough today, 10,11, 13, 14th hole into the wind.  So a lot of good holes out there.
Q. Justin Rose was mentioning this is one of the longest courses he's played.  What do you think about the length of the course?SEUNG-YUL NOH: It is long but I like the long course because it's a good advantage for me.  Even you miss the fairway, but still a chance with short iron or mid-iron to the green.
Q. What do you think about the international makeup of the leaderboard right now, a Swede, a couple Aussies, yourself; what do you think about that?SEUNG-YUL NOH: Yeah, but it's third round, so maybe top of the leaderboard for tomorrow.
