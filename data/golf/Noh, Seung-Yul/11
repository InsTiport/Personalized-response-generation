 Q.   Good round of the golf.   You putted very well.  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Yeah.     
   
 Q.   Just 27 strokes on the green.  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   I didn't know that.   Then I did try new putter this week and then just changed my grip.   Just try and then I don't know why, but pretty good putting today.  
   
 Q.   Good start for you.   You got some momentum early with birdies on 2, 3 and 5.  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Yeah little bit of heavy air this morning and then -- but made good recovery.   I made birdie on there.   That's good start today.  
   
 Q.   Your right wrist, is there any problem?  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Tee shot at 14 and then I hit something like that.   Little bit of pain.  
   
 Q.   You think it will be okay, though?  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   What was your putter, what did you change to?  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Just grip.   The normal grip.   Little bit of thicker one.  
   
 Q.   What was the brand?  
SEUNG-YUL NOH:   Nike putter.
