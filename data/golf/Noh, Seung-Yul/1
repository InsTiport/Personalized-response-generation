 Q.  Tell me about your round.  No bogeys today.  Tough conditions.  
SEUNG-YUL NOH: It is tough conditions, especially the back nine and even starting early in the morning it was playing like really longer than normal.  And then especially a bogey-free round in these conditions, I'm really happy with that.   
 Q.  What was key parts of your game today?  
SEUNG-YUL NOH: Just pretty much all the drivers hit the fairway today and went pretty far and straight, so it was playing a little easier because I was playing in the fairway.  So it's easier to have distance and spin control.  So, yeah, I think that's -- the putting was a little off.  I missed a few birdie putts, but still it was a nice round.
