 Q. What a fantastic win?
 SEUNG-YUL NOH: Y.E. played good, but I played really good today, and just nine birdies in the morning, so good chance in the morning. 

 Q. Did you feel nervous to play Y.E.? 
 SEUNG-YUL NOH: No, I think just practice. I played every practice round, I play with Y.E., so just feeling like a practice round. 

 Q. And how do you feel about taking on Kaymer again? You were telling me you had a tough run against him at the Accenture?
 SEUNG-YUL NOH: Yeah, tough match, but I can't play tomorrow, so just play 36 holes in the afternoon. So just focusing, practice.
