 Q.   Great round, 7‑under.   Is that the start you wanted?   
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   It is, yeah, definitely because I had the last two weeks off, and then back to Korea and staying with parents and meeting a friend, then a little bit off golf.   So into the season, very cool, a good comeback and great start this week.  
   
 Q.   What worked well for you today?   
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   A few missed tee shots, but a lot of good second shots.   Then I think on 17 I hit the green today.   The game was pretty easier today, then made a lot of putts.
