 Q.   1‑under, 70 today.   Would you mind just chatting a little bit about your round today in general, how it came out?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Tough.   Played tough.   Because yesterday playing so easier, and then today kind of way less wind, but wind kind of swirled every time.   So more difficult to control and then trust, tough to trust.  
   
 Q.   Tough to trust your club selection?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah, because the wind swirled.  
   
 Q.   There was wind.   I didn't think it swirled that much?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   No.   
   
 Q.   Any particular holes where you really had a difficult club selection between?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   No.   Not at all, you know, but been kind of coming up a little bit, or let it die a little bit.   So just a few yards, few yards difference when I think.  
   
 Q.   Do you watch leaderboards?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Sometimes.   
   
 Q.   I mean you looked like you had a pretty comfortable lead all day.   Nobody was able to make a charge at you.   I wonder if you were aware of that and did it affect the way you played your game?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah, but you know, I saw the leaderboard about two, three times, but when I played first two days watching leaderboard and then when I play bad also watching leaderboard, so it doesn't matter.   Feels pretty same.   
   
 Q.   You said it was tough.   But it seemed comfortable because?   
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah.   Feeling great, and then you know, yesterday wind was hard, but really consistent, so more consistent.   Then more easier to control distance because wind consistent.   
And then today a little swirl and then wind kind of coming up and little die, so not consistent.   More tough the second shot.  
   
 Q.   You've won before.   Are you a good front runner?   Good playing with the lead?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   When I play win last time about 2010.   Three years, three years ago.   
   
 Q.   So?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   So hopefully good tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Do you still remember what it feels like, how to win?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   So do you go in tomorrow aggressively?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah.   Same plan.   Then you know, more I'm thinking more gather the second player and try about five, seven stroke lead, something.   So still same, playing the same.   
   
 Q.   Do you think at all about ‑‑ we asked the other guys this that are just behind you.   You've got like ‑‑ you can accomplish two things, you can win.   You can also finish well enough to clinch your TOUR card for next year.   Do you have to balance the two or do you just try to win and everything takes care of itself?  
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   You know, first time ‑‑ first time when I played before, maybe trying more thinking about make the TOUR card, something.   Three‑shot lead.   So hopefully win tomorrow.   
And then I think pretty good game for tomorrow because just one more day and then go home.   So I'm so happy, happy with that.   So maybe playing good.  
   
 Q.   If you win, I think you go to No. 1 on the list.     
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   I don't think so.   I'm playing good tomorrow.   Hopefully back to Korea.   So it doesn't matter first or second, doesn't matter.

SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Maybe.   Not sure.
