  THE MODERATOR:   We welcome our 2013 Nationwide Children's Hospital Championship winner, Seung‑Yul Noh.   Congratulations on a great win.
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Thank you very much.
THE MODERATOR:   Great week.   Maybe just talk a little bit today how the day went for you and how the round turned out for you.   Okay.   And then we'll have some questions. 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   I got started pretty solidly today and then I made bogey on third and then he made birdie on fourth.   So just one shot lead after four.   But I'm just thinking playing keep going and then same feel, same mental.   And then like feel like playing first round.   And then that's all.   Just playing good today. 
THE MODERATOR:   Did you watch the leaderboard.
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Sometimes.   Maybe two, three times. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Were you nervous today?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   No.   Not much.   Feel very comfortable. 

Q.   How nice is that ride home going to be?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Great.   My win last time about three years ago and then I win first time at the U. S. and then keep playing PGA TOUR next year.   And then yeah, it was happy.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Last tee shot and then he hit the fairway.   But you know, just one ‑‑ just 140 at the pin with just the pitching wedge.
But tough to control because of the rough but not too tough for the second shot.

Q.   (No microphone).   
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Good question.   I want to go home maybe as soon as I can.   Maybe tomorrow.   But I don't know.   I'll check the flight and then hopefully going back home and then rest couple weeks and then, yeah, coming back and then playing Frys.com. 

Q.   (No microphone).   Question about first birdie. 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah.   Birdie, yeah, good turning point on No. 5, par‑3. 

Q.   What did you hit there?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Hit that 5‑iron, yeah. 

Q.   How far?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Like four feet.   Yeah, and then next hole, make about 35, 40 feet.   And then 7 is like 40, 50 feet off today, so hit the driver and then a little past the green, chipped up and then made putt. 

Q.   What kind of distance was it?   (No microphone). 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   It is, yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone). 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah.   I think maybe middle of the season one time going back to Korea and then come back playing again.   But you know, very struggled this year.   I can't go home, playing every tournament, every week.   So and then played four events from here.   After Wyndham just one results, so I can't go back to Korea and then playing good first week at the Fort Wayne.   And then I'm thinking playing hopefully good, playing good last week and then going back to Korea after last week.   So I got a missed cut and then playing here and then playing good. 

Q.   (No microphone). 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   I'm not sure.   Like it's long flight and then ‑‑ I'm not sure.

Q.   How long?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Maybe 14 hours.   Yeah.   Long flight.   13 or 14, yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone). 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   My sister.   She's job.   Not my job.
