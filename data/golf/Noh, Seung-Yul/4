Q. Could you have started this tournament any better ripping off four birdies in those first four holes?SEUNG-YUL NOH: Yeah, it is a great start, a great round.  All the day good, but just 14 and 15 made a silly mistake.  But a lot of good shots and lot of good putts, yeah.Q. So your best round prior to today was a 68.  How do you better that by four shots as you play today?SEUNG-YUL NOH: Oh, I don't know.  Everything's better and then just make one bogey, that's why I was 4 shots better today, and made a lot of birdies.  Especially it feels pretty good because then playing good in Memphis, and playing last week, and then really got a lot of good confidence and lot of focus on the shots.  So made a lot of shots.Q. It looked like you thought you had that putt on the 18th, that you really made a great read on that one.SEUNG-YUL NOH: Yeah, just great putt and great read, but just not made it.  I think hopefully it will be better tomorrow.
