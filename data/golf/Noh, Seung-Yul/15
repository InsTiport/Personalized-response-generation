Q.   Go through your round, long putts, difficult situations?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Pretty good score but bogeys on the last two hole.   Still a good score.   I'm really happy with that. 

Q.   First time here?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yes, I played 2010 U.S. Open here but first time to Pebble Beach Pro‑Am. 
Tired; feel a little tired now because I come from Dubai last week.   I played Dubai so a little jet‑lag.   I like this place, love this place.

Q.   When did you arrive from Dubai? 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Came to Monday afternoon, Monday night.   I played Spyglass and then Monterey Peninsula, two courses.   Tired. 

Q.   Are you and Kim friends from before?   Did you know each other? 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Yeah, pretty sure, because we practicing together for about two, three years, five, six years ago, a long time ago.   And then he moved to another place. 

Q.   Tell me a little bit more about your round, what kind of birdies did you have early in the round and what were the conditions like for you? 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Start pretty early morning today, so greens pure.   Then fast greens, you can make a lot of putts.

Q.   Any difficult putts? 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Not too bad. 

Q.   You're still a very young player and there's players in the tournament that are more than twice your age; so even though you've played a little bit, is that intimidating or can you watch a veteran player and learn a little bit?   If that's the case, who do you watch? 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Learn, because Kim youngest player, but youngest last year and then Kim from 18, so he can play after 18.   Before July, I'm youngest in the field almost, so pretty good. 
You know, a lot of good players on the U.S. Tour, so you can watch every player making scoring, yeah, pretty good for me and experience pretty good.   Every time, every week learning for my game.

Q.   Any players that you like that you follow?   Maybe as a PGA TOUR player you're not supposed to be a fan, but are you a fan of particular players?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Tiger Woods because he got all those records for everything, history.   That's why I love Tiger. 

Q.   Are there famous Korean players from years ago that you know of, I can't remember names. 
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   K.J. Choi, Y.E. Yang. 

Q.   Are they still playing strong?
SEUNG‑YUL NOH:   Still good playing.
