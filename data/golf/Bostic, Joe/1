  Q. What were some highlights of your day?  
 JOE BOSTIC: Highlights were birdieing 3 with a 7-iron about 10 feet and made birdie.   
 I birdied 7 and 8. Both short putts.   
 And I birdied 15. The course played hard, the wind was blowing pretty hard as you know and the greens were very severe.   
  
  Q. This is your first Senior PGA Championship, how special was it to play?  
 JOE BOSTIC: It's very exciting. Standing on the tee you get a whole different feeling. I can't wait to do it tomorrow. It was great.   
  
  Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?  
 JOE BOSTIC: I would say that I feel a lot better tomorrow than I did today. I was a little nervous on the first hole, but I settled down nicely and I need to work on my putting a little bit. These greens are a little more severe than I expected speed-wise. But I'm pretty optimistic about tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How about the altitude, what kind of impact did that have?  
 JOE BOSTIC: I'm still looking for my 10 percent. I haven't found it yet. I think that the wind is negating the 10 percent. And I hit a 5-wood shot on the fifth hole from about 220 yards about as good as I can hit it and it went about 220 and that's about what I hit it in Florida.
