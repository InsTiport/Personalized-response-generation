JARMO SANDELIN: That would look very good, very good. But it's tough out there. And I
had a good start. I felt very comfortable from the beginning. And I had good shots, very
good shots.

JARMO SANDELIN: I played last week and before that I had two weeks off and that was
good, because I've been playing a lot. And last week I played solid. I didn't make too
much putts on the greens. And I was still playing good. Hopefully I do that three more
rounds.

JARMO SANDELIN: Oh, yeah, that was something really special. The atmosphere was
unbelievable. And I think it's only the Ryder Cup where you get that atmosphere. It was
very nice. 

JARMO SANDELIN: Of course.

Q. What experiences have you had at Valderrama in the past? Has it been a good course
for you?

JARMO SANDELIN: Thank you. I can't say -- I played here twice, '95 and '96 and I
wouldn't tell anyone what scores I had. I haven't been playing too well over here. But I'm
three years older and hopefully a better golfer.

Q. We have record books.

JARMO SANDELIN: Yes.

JARMO SANDELIN: Yes, you really have to think around this course. Even if you think,
many times you're in trouble. When you're in trouble you have to get out, so you don't
start to get doubles and triple bogeys.

Q. Jean Van de Velde came out and said he didn't feel he was very well-treated by Mark
James at the Ryder Cup in terms of being rested for two days, he didn't feel it was right
for him or the team, what was your perspective on that?

JARMO SANDELIN: You know, when I think about the team play, you have a captain, and the
captain has always very difficult choices, what to do, what he thinks is the best. And
when I came out there I told Jesse (Mark James) that whatever you do, I stand by you,
because if you have the feeling that you want to go with someone else, that's fine. And
that's the way it is in the team. I didn't expect to play more than one round. And I think
he did a very good job. We had good team spirit. Next time I hope that I'm good enough to
play more. It was a very close call. I think he did the right thing.

JARMO SANDELIN: On No. 4, driver, 3-wood, chip and one putt from 50 meters. 3-wood,
7-iron, 1 putt from one meter. 3-wood on the 8. I was behind a tree, so I hit the tree and
then I had 50 meters left and I had a 2-putt. 5-wood up to the right, and I was behind the
trees. And then I had a low wedge left and 2-putted it for about 6 meters. Driver, 3-wood
to the green. I had a 9 meter eagle putt and I 2-putted. 

JARMO SANDELIN: Yes.
