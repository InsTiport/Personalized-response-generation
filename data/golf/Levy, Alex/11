 Q.  What do you reckon to this week at the British Masters?  
ALEX LEVY: It was a very good week for me.  Really happy with today.  It was tough, tough with the wind.  I played a good game and I'm really happy with this Top-10 this week.  I think it's good for what I want for the next two months and the next few years.   
 Q.  Good to follow up your victory from a couple weeks ago and know your form is being maintained?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, exactly that.  I keep playing good and enjoy on the golf course and that's the key.  Gave myself a chance on the last four holes to be better but that's life and I just enjoy this day.   
 Q.  Final Series coming up, China and then move on to perhaps one or two others?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You play for that, a big event and the big events coming this.  Week was a big event, also.  That's nice.  I will try my best on the next few weeks.
