Q. Steady start for you yesterday but you've gone out today and shot a 66 with no dropped shots.  You must be very pleased.
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, a really good day for me.  I played some good golf.  Really pleased today.
Q. Might have been better on the last today, the last putt rolled around the hole, very frustrating end.
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, but still a good day.  I make two lipouts, 16 and 18 for birdie, but I'm in good position for the weekend.  The forecast is really windy and really difficult, so we need to be patient.
Q. You missed the cut in Portstewart last week in a similar kind of golf course.  What's been the difference in the game this week?
ALEX LEVY: I just play a little bit better.  I don't play great the first round last week, and the cut was 4-under.  So I was a little bit too far to make the cut.
This week was a little bit different.  I feel more confident and this day will help me for next week also for the British.
Q. I was just about to say with Birkdale coming up, similar kind of golf course next week, to have a good week here would be a massive confidence boost going there in the major.
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, what I say, I'm really pleased with the day, because I was struggling a bit, and to shoot 6-under helped me a lot for the rest of the season.  I'm really happy with the day.
