 Q.  Well played.  Opening round 67.  The highlight was the eagle on the long par-5?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, I'm really happy with the 67 today.  We play a really good golf course and shoot 4-under on this golf course is really nice.  I make a nice eagle on 15, I think, where I holed the 67 and it was good to take the -- it was a great day for me today.   
 Q.  It's a big event back on the European schedule.  How important for you would it be to have a good performance this week?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, I don't -- keeps my mind on the result.  I play really well on the range.  I have a very good sensation.  The last two weeks was tough to bring on the golf course.  This week and next week that will be the key.  I will try to bring the swing on the range to the golf course and today I really happy because I see some great shots I hit on the range on the golf course and that's -- they are a good feeling.   
 Q.  Defending your title in Portugal next week.  A good result here would send you there in very good form?  
ALEX LEVY: That's true.  I see some good shot on the range, and today I see some good shot on the golf course and that gives me some confidence.  And I will try to do that tomorrow and the weekend because it's important for the confidence.   
 Q.  Just finally, how was the atmosphere out there today?  A big crowd.  Great to see lots of people on a Thursday?  
ALEX LEVY: That's lovely.  This is one of the best tournaments.  It's nice to have the British Masters back on the schedule.  I play like four years on Tour and this is the first time.  It's a really nice event and we can say thank you for all the people that do something for that.
