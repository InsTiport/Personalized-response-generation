 Q.  Happy with that?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, I played really solid today.  I stayed patient because I was playing well.  I didn't make a lot of putts, so I'm really pleased with what I did today.  I'm swinging well.  Feeling good.  That's the best feeling you can have.   
 Q.  You got off to a good start.  You were 3-under.  You had to stay patient on the back nine after dropping a few shots.  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, it's what I mean.  I get a few bad luck, a few lip-outs, but I was playing well.  I just follow what I did the last 15 holes and I finished with three birdies, so that was really nice.   
 Q.  You're tied fourth, outside chance, if you play well tomorrow, in this weather, anything can happen?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, but I'm not here with thinking of any result.  I just play golf.  I change a few things last week so I just enjoy play golf and enjoy this nice golf course and we will see.  But I don't have any result in my mind.
