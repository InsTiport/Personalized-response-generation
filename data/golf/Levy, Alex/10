 Q.  Alex, back on home soil for the second Rolex Series Event of the year.  How do you feel?  
ALEX LEVY: I feel good.  A little bit wet, but it's nice.  I hope the weather is still okay for the week.  We can feel it's a different tournament, bigger player lounge and facilities are different.  I think it's nice to have a big tournament like that in France, especially on this golf course.   
 Q.  You've got a big six to eight weeks ahead of you, and so far this year, you've already had some great results and a victory.  How important is it for you the next six to eight weeks going forward with the Rolex Series?  
ALEX LEVY: I think we have like four big events this week, next week, the Scottish and British.  For sure I want to play well this week, but I have good tournaments coming and I just need to be patient.  If it's this week, it will be really nice, and I really enjoy to play well there.  But we need to be patient and don't take only this week as important; we have four big weeks.   
 Q.  A lot of players find it difficult to win in front of their home crowd with the added pressure and expectation.  How do you tackle it?  
ALEX LEVY: It's different, especially on this golf course.  You have too much stress on the tee on the second shot, and no, for sure it's different and it's tough to be in front of your crowd and in front of home.  It's tough, but I think you just need to enjoy and we'll see what happens, and don't start the tournament thinking to win.  Just start and just enjoy.   
 Q.  What's the first thing you think of when you think of France?  
ALEX LEVY: Good food.
