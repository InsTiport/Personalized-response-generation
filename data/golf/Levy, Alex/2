 Q.  Well played, final round of 65, you must be satisfied with that?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, the condition was good today and not a lot of wind.  So a lot birdie chances.  I played really good.  So I'm really pleased with what I did today.  I started a little bit too far, but it's a really good week.   
 Q.  The putt on 14, are you surprised it went?  
ALEX LEVY: It was a push, really lucky putt.  I was thinking it was a push and get in.  So that's a bonus.   
 Q.  And it was nice to hit a great shot on the last to finish with birdie?  
ALEX LEVY: It was a great bunker shot.  I was struggling a bit the last few weeks with my bunker shot.  Mike Lorenzo-Vera give me some tips on Wednesday, and that works, so nice bunker shot on 17 and 18.   
 Q.  Very strong field.  To finish in the top five, it's nice to get the season off in a positive way?  
ALEX LEVY: It's good.  A few weeks off now.  It's good.  I take some World Points, so that's good, and yeah, follow what I want.  Top-50, play the big tournaments, it's a good week.
