 Q.  How well did you play today?  
ALEX LEVY: I played really good.  I'm really happy.  I played terrible yesterday, but I managed to shoot 1-under in tough conditions, so that was good.  This morning the conditions was a little bit easier, and I hit some good drives, so that helped, and had some short irons.  With short irons you can go to the flags.  I played really good golf, so I'm very pleased with that.   
 Q.  It looks as though you might get the shot of the tournament.  Tell me about your second shot into 6.  What club did you hit?  
ALEX LEVY: I had 172 metres to the flag into the wind from the right.  I hit 6-iron, and I hit a really good shot, straight at it, and you can see from where I was, and the camera man said, it's in the hole, so it was a bonus.  But it's a shame because I don't see the ball go in.   
 Q.  Did that help you to finish your round quite highly, put you in a good position?  
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, it's good.  It's nice to get in this position, but yeah, I will keep what I'm doing today because it was really good.  And we'll see what happens.  It's nice to be back in business.   
 Q.  What do you think of the course?  The greens are quite grainy, aren't they.  
ALEX LEVY: I think the greens was pretty okay this morning.  It was good.  So it was easier to make some putts.  No, I think the course is good.  I think it's a nice course.  When the greens will be firmer and faster, I think it will be really good because shot selection will be more difficult.
