THE MODERATOR: Alex, this week is upon us again, the Open da France.  Certainly one you must be looking forward to a lot in your calendar.
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, for sure.  Especially for a French player, it's nice to be home.  The weather will be good this week, so the crowd will be there.  And especially at three months from the Ryder Cup, I think the people have more interest of golf, so it will be a really nice week.  And yeah, I play with one of two best player in the world, so it will be a nice week for me.
Q. Of course, a French Amateur Champion, when you look into your career and the things you want to achieve, I would imagine this tournament ranks pretty highly?
ALEX LEVY: Exactly.  I think without a major it's a tournament you want to win.  So yeah, why not this week?
Q. The course is looking like a living room postcard at the moment.  It's spectacular.  A few subtle changes.  How would you describe the course?
ALEX LEVY: I think it's in perfect condition.  Like I don't think that because I'm French, but I think it's the best venue of the year for this golf course is perfect and make you have pressure at every shot.  So I think it's a really nice golf course, and I'm really looking forward to play this tournament this week.
