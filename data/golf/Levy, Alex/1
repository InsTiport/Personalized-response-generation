Q. Defending champion this week.  Always nice to come back to a course where you have some happy memories?
ALEX LEVY: It's good.  I'm pleased to be here.  The course looks really good. I like this place.  It's a tough golf course, and for sure, I played with some good memories of last year, so I'm happy to be here.
Q. To win on a golf course that is as tough as this must give you a lot of confidence going into this week?
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, it's good.  I know I can play well on this golf course.  I always shoot a low score when I won tournaments, so last year was different.  Was 8-under winning.
Yeah, it's nice to be here and play that kind of golf course.  But I don't play for almost three months, so it's nice to be back in a place you like and you want to play.
Q. And a frustrating start to the season for you.  You finished really well in Saudi Arabia, and then you did have an injury.
ALEX LEVY: Yeah, exactly, so I don't play from -- I play one round in Oman and I hurt my back in Oman yeah, that's life.  I enjoy a little bit my life when I was time off, because I can do a lot of things.  I do some rehab and I see my coach in U.S. and I practice three weeks in U.S.
So no pain, nothing, so I'm good to be back and I will enjoy this week.
Q. And this golf course, what does it take to get around this course?
ALEX LEVY: Like I say, I think if you drive well the ball and putt well, I think that's the key on this golf course.  Also, it's a tough golf course because when it's windy, the wind switch a lot and it's not easy, but yeah, I think you just have to play target golf, and on some flags, you can be offensive.  Yeah, it's a golf course I like.
