AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Well, it didn't get any easier from the first match.  It was very tough mentally and physically, but, you know, I managed to make a really good put on 17, to go 1 up again.  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  4-iron.  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  25-footer, I think.   
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  
 
 
Q.  To the semifinals.  What were your expectations coming in here this week, especially after what happened last week? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I was quite disappointed last week, you know, not to play as well as I would have liked.  But, you know, coming in this week, I was playing a little better and hitting the ball quite well.  I just try to take it, you know, round at a time and just try to stay present.  
 
Q.  You guys were talking about what movies you wanted to see yesterday out on the course.  What were you talking about today? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Pretty much like what our brother is doing.  Wanted to know the results of the Cannon Cup.  
 
Q.  Are you going to ask for more money the more matches she wins? 
 
NAREE WONGLUEKIET:  She owes me quite a bit now (laughter).  
 
Q.  What is it like having your sister on your bag versus a regular caddie? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think she encourages me a lot more.  
 
NAREE WONGLUEKIET:  Be nice (laughter).  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  She's very encouraging.  Just tries to help me and keep my focus, keep doing when I've got to do to keep playing solidly.  
 
Q.  Do you get much conversation with the other caddies that you've had?  Do you talk a lot?  Do you talk more with your sister? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I talk more with my sister.  
 
Q.  Do you think it relaxes you more? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah, especially between shots, you know.  Not too focused on just golf, try to get away from it a little bit.  Matchplay can be very mentally tiring.  
 
Q.  Was there a point on the course today where you thought you might not make it through today? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think the 1st hole (laughter).  My legs didn't want to quite walk up the hill anymore.  
 
NAREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yours (laughter)?  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yours, too.  
 
Q.  Who was your caddie the first few rounds before she got eliminated? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  She's one of my friends.  We go to school together.  Jonathan Moore.  He lives here.  
 
Q.  He lives here? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yes.  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  In Florida, Bradenton Academy.  
 
Q.  He goes to that, as well?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yes.  
 
Q.  J-o-n? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think so.  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yes.  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I don't know.  
 
NAREE WONGLUEKIET:  Would you like to play tomorrow (laughter)?  
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah, especially when you play a lot of tournaments in a row.  I played last week and then this week.  Especially matchplay, like the National Championships, like six days if you get to the final.  It's quite tiring, yeah.  
 
Q.  At the academy, are you taught to deal with distractions? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Distractions?  
 
Q.  I'm wondering about the television cameras in a tournament like this.  That could be a distraction.  You just pay no attention to it? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think I'm quite used to it now since I've been contending quite a bit, you know, a lot of press and a lot of cameras.  I think I'm quite used to it now.
