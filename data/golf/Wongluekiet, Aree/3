Q.  How you doing?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Good. 
 
Q.  Quite an accomplishment this week, that's for sure. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about it, being the youngest?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think it's nice, just playing your first amateur, finish as a semifinalist.  I'm quite happy.  Top four is not bad.  
 
Q.  You have a little something to build on here, don't you?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Do you guys wear the same thing every time?  You don't do that normally?  I've noticed when she was caddying for you, it was always the same thing. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Trying to confuse people? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  We've always been doing that.  
 
Q.  You made a match out of that.  You were down three at the turn.  Looked like you were pushing your drives quite a bit today. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  What kind of got things turned around for you?  Got the match all square.  Made a run. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I was just trying to keep, you know, playing my own game, just keep trying to hit the fairways.  Driver didn't work too well today.  You know, I don't think it's pressure.  I think it's just, you know, I've been on the road for quite a while now.  My swing is not quite where I want it to be.  I hit it okay this week.  So I'm quite happy. 
 
Q.  Make any adjustments with your swing after nine holes at all?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Not really, no.  
 
Q.  How long has it been since you've been home to Florida?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I've been home two times this summer.  
 
NAREE WONGLUEKIET:  For like a day each.  Not too long.  
 
Q.  You've been home two or three days the entire summer? 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah.  Probably like five days. 
 
Q.  Are you guys going to Berlin for the world team?  Is Thailand going to put a team together?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  World amateur?  
 
Q.  Yeah. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  No, I don't think so.  
 
Q.  Do you get to go home now or do you head off somewhere else?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah, we're going home, taking a break for about a week.  
 
Q.  A whole week off?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah, a whole week.  
 
Q.  How long was that putt you made on 14 for birdie, the par 3, when you squared the match?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  20-footer probably, yeah.  
 
Q.  Then you bogeyed?  Did you 3-putt 15?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah, 15 and 17, I think.  
 
Q.  What did you do on 15?  Did you putt it past the hole or did it come up short?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Hit it like four feet past the hole, didn't make the putt coming back. 
 
Q.  She got up-and-down?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  What has it been like this week compared to the junior?  How do you rate the pressure, competition?  You've played several juniors now, won it once, made the semifinals of the amateur. 
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  I think it's probably about the same amount of pressure.  You know, I'm just playing in a golf tournament, you know, just trying to just focus on golf, not really think too much about, you know, what's ahead.  
 
Q.  When does school start for you guys?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  September 2nd.  Pretty soon. 
 
Q.  Do you guys have a team down there at school?  At the academy, is it an actual golf team or just practice and go to tournaments?
 
AREE WONGLUEKIET:  Probably just practice, just training, trying to improve your game.
