  Q. Four solid rounds. Just talk about your week as whole. Top 5 finish.   
 STEVE FLESCH: Yeah, I played very well. Best I've played in a couple years. But looking back, I needed to play the par-5s better this week. That's what I think was the key when I won in '07.   
 But, you know, I think the golf course plays more difficult with the nines switched, because I think 16, 17, 18 are harder coming down the stretch.  
 I think it was a good change. I'm just happy I've always played well here.  
  
  Q. You talked earlier in the week about feeling you were getting closer to playing the kind of golf you want to play, but that the results just weren't there. What does a week like this do for your confidence?  
 STEVE FLESCH: Well, obviously, you know, it makes me feel good about that I still can play. I mean, I kind of would get to the point where I didn't know if I could even compete anymore out here with some of these young guys.  
 I can still play on a golf course like this. A lot wedges and you got to think your way around. You know, I wish we played more golf courses like this. The real long bombers' golf courses are pretty difficult for me.  
  
  Q. Moving forward from here, excited for the rest of the year?   
 STEVE FLESCH: Well, I got one more week. I'm trying to get into that FedExCup, so this week may have done that for me.  
 But looking forward, I'm just, you know, I'm just glad I finally had a good week. It's been a long time.
