Q.  If you could talk about your round today, good way to start, 69?
STEVE FLESCH:  Good way to start.  Like everyone else, probably a little struggling on the greens because of the strength of the grain.  The greens roll great but it's just a wiry grass that we are not accustomed to much.

You know, sometimes you just misread them because you don't give the grain enough credit.  I played well, hit it well and obviously, you know, probably missed a couple that I could have made.
Q.  Talk about your expectations for 2005.  You had a great year last year, are you ready to make that climb to the next echelon?
STEVE FLESCH:  I am, and I'm working on a couple of things, not so much in my game but just how I am on the golf course that's going to help me.  Surrounded myself with a couple of people, I've got a new caddie and some other guys that I think are pointing me in the right direction and I'm just trying to have more fun out there.  Just simple things like that, because I've always hit it pretty well.  It's just I'm too hard on myself.  Hey, I've got no reason to be like that out there anymore.  All those things.  Got a good family, enough money, so now I've just got to play golf.
