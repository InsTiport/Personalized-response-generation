Q.
You were rolling the ball well today?
STEVE FLESCH:  Rolling the ball very well, actually have been the last couple of weeks.  I finally got some birdie chances out there today, some makeable ones at that.  That's pretty much all my game is.  If I drive it just okay, my iron game is good enough where I get some birdie chances.
Q.  Will you go through one or two holes that were turning points for you today?
STEVE FLESCH:  One of the key birdie holes for me today was 16.  I had just birdied 15, made a good 15-footer for birdie on a pretty tough par 3.

Then 16, finally got the ball in the fairway, hit a good 6-iron in there about 25 feet, made that one to keep some momentum going.

The biggest part of the day was probably my 20-foot bogey save on 18.  You never want to finish with a double bogey, but after driving it in the hazard, just coming out with bogey on a really long, tough hole, it's going to make tonight a lot easier.
Q.  We're kind of winding down here, you've got six or seven more events.  Do you have any specific goals for the end of the year?
STEVE FLESCH:  I want to finish top 10 on the Money List.  I think I'm 16th, something like that.  I want to finish top 10.  That will be my best finish ever for the year.  Believe it or not, as well as I've been playing, I want to win one more time before the end of the year.  So that's what I'm trying to focus on.  I know I've had a great year, but I think if I don't play the rest of the year with a goal, it's going to be easy just to glide through it.
