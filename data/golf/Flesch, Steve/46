Q.  Talk about your match. 
STEVE FLESCH:   It was a pretty consistent match.  Neither one of us really did anything outstanding.  There were not a lot of holes won until late in the match.  And Kirk made a few bogeys and gave me a couple of holes on the back nine, and I got 3-up and just kind of held on at 16 and made pars.  We both played our normal games, pretty conservative, a lot of greens, a lot of pars, and just a few birdies in there.

Q.  Was there a turning point? 
STEVE FLESCH:   Well, he made a double-bogey on 10; I won 10 with a par.  And then on 11, I hit a poor tee shot on the par  3, right of the green; and I made about a 15-footer to halve the hole for par.  And then I won the next two holes.  So that was probably the turning point, my par save on 11, the par  3.
I made a bunch of pars and he made a couple of bogeys.  It was not like I was winning the holes with birdies.  I wish I was.  It's kind of hard playing Kirk, because we played a few practice rounds together and just kind of  -- we're friends out there, and you never really root against him.  But, unfortunately, in match-play somebody has got to win, but today he was nice enough to make a few bogeys.
