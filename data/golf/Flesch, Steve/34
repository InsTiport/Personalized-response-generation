Q.
I guess the greens were kind today, as well?
STEVE FLESCH:  Yeah, I putted well.  I didn't have as many chances as yesterday, but I think we experienced three of the four seasons of the year out there today.  It was perfect at times and then it was raining and then it was cold, so that's what you're going to get over here.  It was a good day.
Q.
You guys are always talking before a tournament after a couple days just putting yourself in contention.  Just talk about getting yourself in a spot where you have a chance on Saturday and Sunday now.
STEVE FLESCH:  Yeah, it's kind of been a while since I really felt like I played good, but I'm just kind of relaxing this week.  I've got a buddy of mine caddying for me and we're having a good time.  It's kind of a bonus week.  Everybody is going to get paid well, but I'm just glad to be back in contention because it's been a while for me.
