 Q.  Steve, 69 today.  I know it's not the way you wanted to finish with a couple of bogeys in closing holes, but it's in good position. 
 STEVE FLESCH:  It is.  I've never really been comfortable on this golf course.  I liked English Turn pretty much, across town.  But I haven't played very well here, so to get off to a better start -- you know, today, I'm happy about it. 

 Q.  The wind was tricky out there with the clubbing because it was fresh really from when you started this morning? 
 STEVE FLESCH:  Yeah, and plenty of long holes out here.  Unfortunately they didn't move the tees up very much on some of the longer holes, which I thought they might, because there's really not a whole lot of room to hit it on some of them. 
 Tough golf course, and the wind plays a big factor.  Like I said, I'm just happy to get this first round away. 

 Q.  Typical Pete Dye construction where you've got all sorts of difficult little shots around the greens, and the greens throw a lot of the golf balls off; they don't receive well, do they? 
 STEVE FLESCH:  No, but that's okay.  I typically like all Pete Dye courses.  It rewards good ball-striking and good iron play.  Greens have a lot of undulation in them, but that's okay.  It adds to the elements.  But I like that it's demanding out here.
