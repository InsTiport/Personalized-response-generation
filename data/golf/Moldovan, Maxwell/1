Q. What a nice two and one.  On to the round of 16.  How you feeling right now?
MAXWELL MOLDOVAN: Feel good.  Hit it well again today.  A lot of good tee shots and good second shots; didn't putt very well.  Spend some time working on it before the next round and hopefully get that one done, too.
Q. So the Top 5 seeds are off this morning already.  Does that give you a little bit more edge, do you think, heading into the afternoon?
MAXWELL MOLDOVAN: Not really.  In match play it doesn't really matter what seed you are.  You're playing one guy.  The stroke play results don't matter that much once you get to match play.
I mean, obviously it's a good thing some of the best players in the field are not in it anymore.  Makes it a little easier, but it's still going to be a battle.
Q. What was on for your game this morning and what maybe was something you got to work on going into the afternoon?
MAXWELL MOLDOVAN: Like I said, hit it well.  A lot of the good tee shots.  Definitely got work on the putter.
