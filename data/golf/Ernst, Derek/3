Q. Derek, what a great way to close during the 1st Round with those birdies late in the round on 7-under for the first day. 
Got to be thrilled about that.
DEREK ERNST: Yeah. Putted really well today. That was the key. So, get off to a start like this is great.

Q. Tell us about that stretch, 14, 15 and 16 when you go birdie, birdie, birdie there.
DEREK ERNST: Hit a good drive on 14 and had an 8-iron in I think and I thought I could just be aggressive, had a perfect number in. Made like a 12-footer there.
Then the eagle putt on 15, came up just short and then the putt on 16 broke four, five feet and had to get the right speed.

Q. Is it too early right now to think about what you need to do to maybe advance this year?
DEREK ERNST: I already know what I need to do. I got to do it. You know, play good. Everybody plays good. When they have to do it, they do it.

Q. 7-under is a great start. Keep it up.
