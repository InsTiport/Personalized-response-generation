 Q.  5-under 67 on a day that was starting, stopping, a long stop, but still, you pulled a 5-under 67 out of it.  Just a few comments on the round.  
DEREK ERNST: Yeah, I played well.  I've been working hard on my game like always.  Yeah, just feels good to shoot 5-under.   
 Q.  How did you kill the time during the delay?  
DEREK ERNST: Laid on the ground, ate three meals.  There was nothing to do.  I mean, there was people in the locker room watching ridiculousness.  I mean, it was about a five-hour delay, so you want to leave, but they're like, every hour we've got an update, so you don't know, should I go back to the hotel or not.   
 Q.  What have you been most pleased with as far as your game goes coming into the week?  Anything in particular?  
DEREK ERNST: No, nothing in particular.  I mean, I'm just working on every aspect of my game.   
 Q.  I know you and your wife are expecting your first child coming up.  How much perspective, for lack of a better word, do you think you've gained just since you got the news of a baby on the way?  
DEREK ERNST: Yeah, I mean, I'm going to be a father for the first time, so it's really cool.  I look at a lot of guys that have done that, Blayne Barber, Billy Horschel, all those guys, having their kid, and you change as a person.  You put on more responsibilities, and it changes your life perspective on things.  Yeah.
