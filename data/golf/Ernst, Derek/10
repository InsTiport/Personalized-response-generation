 Q.   Well, Derek, great finish out there.   You knew you had to birdie that last hole to have a chance.   Take us through the 18th and really the whole day battling these elements?  
DEREK ERNST:   18, I didn't even think about birdieing the hole.   I just thought hit the drive down the middle of the fairway, and then nice shot.   Then another start and you have to hit it close.   It's like my new coach Susie Meyers says, you have to start from point A and try to plot yourself around.   If you think ahead, you get in your own way.   
So I think that was key for me today is I just played within myself.   I didn't get ahead of myself.   I didn't think about bad shots or anything.   I just stayed within myself.  
   
 Q.   We know the weather was terrible, but you had to have fun out there being in the thick of this tournament?   
DEREK ERNST:   Oh, yeah.   I had a blast.   It's my first time being in this position, so I enjoyed every moment of it for sure.  
   
 Q.   We were talking at commercial break, and you said your key to this week is basically getting out of your own way.   I know our viewers at home would like to know what the heck does that mean because they're getting in their way too?  
DEREK ERNST:   I think getting out of your own way is just sticking to the process and not thinking about the results.   Point A for me is every shot is a new shot, it's a new opportunity.   Yeah, this has just been an awesome opportunity, and hopefully there is some more golf left for me.  
   
 Q.   If there is more golf, which we anticipate there will be a playoff, how will you approach that, any differently?   
DEREK ERNST:   No, now it's just sudden death.   Whoever hits the best shots coming in in three shots basically.   It's anyone's game.
