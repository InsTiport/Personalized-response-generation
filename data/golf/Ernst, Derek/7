 Q.   Four birdies and an eagle, a few comments about the day, obviously in good position, 4‑under 66?  
DEREK ERNST:   Yeah, you know, I actually played golf today.   I freed it up.   Didn't have one thing on my mind, no mechanical thought, and I don't know, just plodded along.   Just played smart shots.   That's about it.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through the second shot there at 18, adds a little luck to everything?  
DEREK ERNST:   Well, no matter what, that was a backstop, so no matter what, I'm going to be on this side having to get up‑and‑down and if anything, guy left, and I did.   I was going to get it up‑and‑down no matter what, anyway.   It's that kind of day it felt like.  
   
 Q.   How have you been feeling about your game heading into the week?   What's going right?  
DEREK ERNST:   I just didn't work on my game, was what I did.   I think my problem is I'll put in ten hours a day, like I'll just‑‑ I just practice way too much.   You know, I didn't play last week obviously, and just kind of relaxed, hung out, worked out, just all short game and that was it.   
   
 Q.   Was there any frustration that led to that or you just thought, this is the way I need to be doing it moving forward?  
DEREK ERNST:   I thought I should change something up because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, so I thought I should maybe try something different.   We will see how it ends up on Sunday.
