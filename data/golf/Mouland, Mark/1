Q.   Good to see you playing here in Wales in a major championship. 
MARK MOULAND:   Yeah, excited, obviously, first one we've had here, isn't it.   Yeah, looking forward to it.   Weather is going to be good.   Course is in great nick and everything is good for the week. 

Q.   How important is it for Wales this week to be hosting such a prestigious tournament?
MARK MOULAND:   Yeah, obviously this is as good as it gets.   The course is definitely good enough.   I think the field chose it out of the respect it has, as well, the Senior Open.   It's just fantastic for Wales.   We have got a good few courses, this being one of them, and I know everybody is looking forward to it.
Everybody's here.   Langer's killing it; Monty is killing it at moment.   JimÃ©nez is here and he's probably favoured on paper but it's a tough week for sure.   The guys play fantastic golf; you look at the scores they shoot over in America, and I'm sure they will do the same again this week.
Woosie is playing good.   He's obviously been our best player for many years, and he still plays great and he's really keen still and he's really keen to win this, I know he is. 
As for myself, I'm playing good and I know the course from years gone by obviously.   I've had a few practice rounds and the course is playing benign, I think is the word.   No wind, the rough's low and I expect the scoring to be pretty low to be fair. 
The course is in great condition.   The greens are putting good.   It's a little fiery on the fairways as you would expect in the middle of the summer. 

Q.   How good is this course really? 
MARK MOULAND:   It's very underrated.   I think this is one of the best links courses in the country, as in the U.K.   We need a little bit of wind, to be fair, but today a very calm Pro‑Am today. 
But if the wind blows like we know it normally does here, it will be interesting.   If the wind stays low, I'm sure the scores will be pretty favorable and low.   As I say with the rough being low and you can actually hit it a little bit off line and you can get a line.

Q.   That is the greatest defence, Mother Nature. 
MARK MOULAND:   Mother Nature obviously.   I think the forecast is okay for the week.   But saying that, you've still got to play.   It is fiery.   You are going to get some bounces that you don't expect and that will test everybody's patience as it normally does on a links course.

Q.   Tell me how you would normally plot your way around this course. 
MARK MOULAND:   I don't think anything has changed from years gone by.   It's the first few holes that you have to get off to a steady start with the OB just left.   After the par3, if you can get through level, the course is there for the taking.   But all the par 5s are reachable at the moment with it running so far.   And yeah, as I say, it's right in front of you. 

Q.   I know everyone wants to win this week but if you were to win, what would that mean to you?
MARK MOULAND:   Oh, icing on the cake obviously.   Everybody wants to win their open, whether it's the main open or the Senior Open.   You only have to look at Monty winning in the States there the other week‑‑ well, he's won two of them now.   He's spent all his life trying to win one and rattles off two in a row.   He counts them as majors and we all do, as well.

Q.   And he's had a bit of history here in Wales.   Do you think he could be the man to do it this week?
MARK MOULAND:   Yeah, there's a good half dozen guys who I think you've got to watch out for this week, Monty obviously being one.   Langer, because he's so tough to beat, certainly in the majors, and JimÃ©nez, as well.   And then Freddie, he's still as good as it gets, Freddie. 

Q.   How is the course playing? 
MARK MOULAND:   Easiest I've ever seen it, ever.   I mean yesterday and today, I hit 6‑iron into 18, the old 17th/18th now.   The same into the fifth, the first par 5 up the hill.   Never done that.   Irons into the other one.   Never done that.

Q.   How many times have you played it, do you think? 
MARK MOULAND:   I have no idea‑‑

Q.   Thirty? 
MARK MOULAND:   Must be at least, yeah.   But I haven't played it for a long time, since I moved away at 19.   I haven't been back. 

Q.   What about your performances this year so far? 
MARK MOULAND:   I played two in Europe, third and ninth, which is nice.   And in the States, I think I played three or four, a bit indifferently in the States.   What can I say?   Nothing to say really apart from it's a lot harder in America, that's all I can say. 

Q.   You've had some good time in the States ?
MARK MOULAND:   A good four years.   I've had two or three Top 10s in that time, which is great, against those guys.   I got injured last year when I had my full card.   I got injured, which was a shame, because I started off really good and then I had about eight weeks of injury.   By the time I was back to fitness again, ran out of tournaments. 
So, hence, I lost my card.   But then went back to Q‑School and finished ninth so I got a provisional card again.   So I've played four and I'll probably play another three or four.
