PHILLIP PRICE:  Started great.  I think we sort of combined our putts well for the front nine and we were alternating with 6-under, so it was just really great to get going again.  Fortunately we did the same on the back nine. 

MARK MOULAND:   Yeah, today we could have shot anything, really.  Tomorrow is different.  Foursomes is very, very difficult, so we're just going to play as we did today, hole the putts at the right time.  Anything sort of under 70 is going to be very good in foursomes, anyway. 

Q.  On the 14th, you had one putt that horseshoed out, how many out there got away from you as well? 

MARK MOULAND:   A few, yesterday.  I think that was the only one today, but a few yesterday and the first day.  Yeah, it sort of went back up the hill and back towards me.  Strange. 

Q.  I think you are only win behind, but how close do you think you need to be to have a really good chance tomorrow? 

MARK MOULAND:   Within five, I would say.  If we can stay within five, we've got half a chance.  But as I said, foursomes is very, very difficult.  The key is just keeping bogeys off the card in foursomes.  For myself, we are pretty steady players and really not going to be in too much trouble, so that suits us, really.
