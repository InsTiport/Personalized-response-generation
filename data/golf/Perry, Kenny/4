KENNY PERRY: Just very difficult conditions out there.  I thought the golf course played very hard.  We played in high winds.  I didn't hit it nearly as good as I did the first day.  If I used that putter  the first day, I would have had a killer score.  Put a new putter in it, saved me.  I shot worse today but I actually putted nice.  It was just hard.  It was a very difficult golf course.  And I wasn't driving it very well.  And I pulled a muscle in my back on the 7th hole.  And I was struggling all the way in just even trying to get in.  I was happy to get it done.
Q. Going into the weekend, what do you think is the biggest thing?
KENNY PERRY: Well, I'm probably too far -- unless I can somehow shoot 65 tomorrow, get back to even par, then maybe I'll have a shot.
Q. You said the conditions were a little tougher this afternoon than they were yesterday?
KENNY PERRY: I thought so.  I don't know how the afternoon scores are going.  I don't think too many guys are shooting too well out there.  I think a couple of those pins, 16 and 18, were a little dicy, I thought.  I don't know, it was all right.  It's all good.
