 Q.   Talk about how the round went for you.   
KENNY PERRY:   You know, I struggled all day.   I didn't play bad; I didn't play good.   I 3‑putted a couple times from places that kill me, but then I got up‑and‑down out of some jail places.   So I guess all in all, it evened out for 1‑over 72.   
It's a lot bigger golf course for me.   Henrik Stenson is coming in straight out of the clouds and I'm coming in so much flatter.   I can't really hold the greens like I used to.   I don't spin the ball like I used to.   So I've got to rely on my chipping, which that's not my strength.   My strength is driving, and now I'm way back.   
It's just a big man's golf course.   That's all it is.   
   
 Q.   Feel good about the tournament and where you are?   
KENNY PERRY:   Oh, yeah.   I'm excited to be here, opportunity to play, represent the old guys, represent Kentucky.   It's a good way to say good‑bye.
