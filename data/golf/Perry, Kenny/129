 Q. Disappointing bogey at 9 to finish but 8-under par after two rounds, and you're right in there again. 
 KENNY PERRY: I don't know, Bo is at 14-under, and I'm six behind and I'm playing well. The ninth hole is tough and it's a tight driving hole and hit it in the trees and chipped out and made bogey. 
 I had a string of three nice birdies in a row on some tough holes out there, so just being patient and if I keep hitting fairways -- it will take a low round tomorrow to get back in this tournament. 

 Q. I see Corey Chandler following you around; any training in your future?
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, I like him. He's a good boy, and at my age, I need a little extra help. 

 Q. Not the way you wanted to end the round with it going so well for you. 
 KENNY PERRY: It was a good day. I shot 5-under. I played great and the ninth hole is just one of the toughest holes out here. You have to find that fairway somehow, and I've been going with the big stick and it got a little left on me in the trees. It got me for it. 
 All in all, it's a good day and I think I made two bogeys and seven birdies, so if I keep doing that, keep making lots of birdies, maybe I can run Bo down. 
 If my 3-wood goes in the rough, maybe I can hit a shorter iron out and maybe have a chance to get it on the greens. Just how I'm approaching it this week. Every time I've hit it in the rough, I can't do anything with it, so I would just assume get it as far down as I can and be aggressive. 

 Q. Talk about the position you're in? 
 KENNY PERRY: Well, I'm six behind, and tomorrow, you know what, I'm just going to try to go deep and get aggressive. 

 Q. Do you have a go-to club, your favorite in the bag?
 KENNY PERRY: I love my driver. I've always been very comfortable hitting my driver anywhere. 

 Q. What happens when it goes awry? 
 KENNY PERRY: Just keep trying to do the same routine.
