Q. Tell me your thoughts on the week.KENNY PERRY: Golf course was fantastic.  Great shape.  Tough.  You just had to -- if you were a little off and you didn't hit the fairway, you struggled. So I enjoyed it.  I mean, I didn't have a good day today, but I had a nice day yesterday, had a chance to win the golf tournament.  But you know what, Jeff went out, shot a crazy round today.  So the scores are out there, and I didn't do it.  I shot 1 over, played pretty poorly.  That's golf.Q. Given your position at the beginning of the day, what was your strategy going through this final round?KENNY PERRY: You can't have a strategy.  You've got tight fairways.  You've just got to get it from A to B.  You've got to get it in the fairway, get it on the green, and hopefully some stuff will happen for you. I birdied the 1st hole right out of the gate, but that's about it.  That's about all I did.  I struggled the rest.  I never could get going.  Never had any momentum, nothing.  But it was a good week.  Enjoyed it.
