 Q.  With a round of 3-under, 9-under at this point, still in the hunt? 
 KENNY PERRY:  Yeah, good shape.  Pretty disappointing.  I had a lot of opportunities to make birdies.  I made all my putts yesterday, I guess.  I didn't read them very well today for whatever reason.  It was just a good, steady 3-under.  I made three birdies and no bogeys and the rest pars.  I had a lot of opportunities, hit lot of fairways, so hopefully this weekend I can capitalize on those chances. 
 Like I had 3-iron in my hand on 17 and I missed the green to make a par.  So there was a lot of opportunities out there for me.  So I'm really looking forward to the weekend. 

 Q.  Talk about the weekend and the mentality.  With you being only two shots back at this point, what's the mentality going into the weekend? 
 KENNY PERRY:  Well, I like it.  I like being in that position where I can go out and post a number and try to get them to catch me.  I'm not having to deal with the lead.  People sometimes think differently when they have the lead and stuff. 
 I've been out here 21 years, so it don't really matter.  I'd like to be in the lead, I've won all my tournaments from the lead.  I need to somehow shoot a good round tomorrow to get up there within one, stay within one of the leader so I have a shot on Sunday.
