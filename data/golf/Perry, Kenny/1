 Q.  How did you shoot 67 with that elbow hurting as much as it does?  
KENNY PERRY: Well, it didn't start until the first hole.  I had it last week -- I don't know what's going on.  I've got something seriously wrong with it right here.  It doesn't hurt at impact.  It only hurts taking the club back.  So it's -- it was pretty dicey, to tell you the truth.  But I just fought through it, just took a lot of Aleve, and hopefully I can figure out a way to get some relief for tomorrow.   
 Q.  KT Tape.  
KENNY PERRY: Does that stuff work?   
 Q.  I don't know, I see it all over the place.  Talk about your round, though.  
KENNY PERRY: It was good.  I birdied two of the first four, got off to a good start, and then in the middle of the round just kind of was riding along and just -- it was okay, nothing great, hitting fairways, hitting greens, and then I was able to birdie the last two holes.  Kind of saved the round.   
I hit a couple poor wedges coming in on 15 and 16, and -- yeah, 14, 15, 16, all three of them, and then to be able to make birdie on 17 and 18 kind of saved the round.  So it was good.   
 Q.  I'm guessing you're not going to practice a lot, though.  
KENNY PERRY: I'm not going to hit a ball.  I'm going to go find some KT Tape.
