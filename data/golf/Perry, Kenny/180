KENNY PERRY:  You know, to me it was a win-win situation, I was ecstatic to have him on the bag and just to be able to spend time out there because he's getting ready to go to college next year, and I won't get to spend that much time with him.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  I think I paid him enough.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  No, this will probably -- he may caddy some this summer, when he gets out of high school.  He's getting ready to graduate in May.  So after May we'll see.  But, yeah, I'd like to keep him out here a little bit.

He's got a busy tournament schedule himself.  He plays a lot.  He's on a scholarship.  He's going to David Lipscomb next year on a golf scholarship.  He's going to play a lot of tournament golf this summer.  It depends on if he'll give me a week or two, I don't know.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  He was great.  Scotty, David Toms' caddy, helped him out.  He's a veteran out here.  He kind of showed him the ropes of where to kind of get.  Say if the other player hit a bunker shot, he'd go over and clean his ball, just how to get the flag and a few little tidbits here.

He's a good player.  He knows how to stay out of your way, but just a few things that caddies do to kind of keep him in line.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  It was good.  I shot 32 on the back nine to start.  I thought, man, I'm going to shoot really good today.  And then I drove it very poorly on the front nine, which was my back nine, and I just kind of managed it around, ended up shooting 69.  But it was a great start.  It's probably one of the better starts I've had in this tournament, so I'm excited.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  Exactly.  If you cannot put it in that fairway, you don't have a chance.  That rough is five, six inches deep.  And you're kind of hacking it out, and hopefully you can manage your wedge around the hole somewhere.
