 Q. I would think you must be proud of weathering that tough round. 
 KENNY PERRY: Well, that's kind of foursomes. The alternate-shot, there's a lot of ebb and flow out there, and it was nice we got off to a nice quick start on them. 
 You know, I got aggressive on that par-5 and hit it in the water, and next thing you know they get a little momentum. We just scraped them in; we made great pars on 10 and 11. He made two tough putts on 11 and on the par-3 to put it 3-up to really kind of end the match.
