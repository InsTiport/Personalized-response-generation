 Q. Briefly, just comment on the day. You're feeling under the weather? 
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, I'm really sick. I've got a real bad sore throat. I'm really weak-feeling. I hit two big slices off of the last two holes, which for me is unbelievable. I mean, I don't hit a slice with the driver. 
 I'm just like pond water now. I'm really weak. 
 I hung in there. It was a good, solid day. I felt okay the first nine, but the longer we got, I just got weak. 

 Q. Mind frame going into tomorrow? 
 KENNY PERRY: Oh, he's 20-under. He's going to have a seven-stroke lead. It's definitely his tournament, so we all are going to be fighting for second it looks like.
