 Q. What is the secret to making sure contact the ball in this kind of mess?
 KENNY PERRY: Found spots I could recover from basically. I was hitting knuckleballs off the driver. And I hit -- I mean it looked like, you know, a pitcher who throws a knuckleball. I never seen balls do that. But I was able to recover. 
 I chipped nice, and I putted nice, and I made it on the birdie holes where, you know, it slacked off enough to where I could feel like I could get aggressive. I hit some good shots and made some nice saves coming in here the last couple holes. The last few holes were brutal.

 Q. I promise, one more question then you can get to a hot shower. Putting on the greens, does the speed change from green to green because the rain gets harder and lets up and gets harder again?
 KENNY PERRY: Actually, no. They're in a drought here. Those greens are still hard as rock and very fast. So they didn't change any all day. You know, they squeegeed them on the 10th hole on us. But, all in all, I thought the speed stayed up and they played beautifully.

 Q. Excellent. Thanks for your time.
