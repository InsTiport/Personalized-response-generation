KENNY PERRY:  Got off to a good start, won the first four holes.  He was having trouble bending over his ball and it was kind of cool this morning, and he hit a couple drives in the rough and made a couple bogeys and I made a couple birdies and a couple pars, and the next thing I know I'm 4 up.  I was able to just kind of maintain that all the rest of the match. 

I got to 5 up a couple times and he won a couple holes, so I was pretty much trying to match him out there.  Then I holed it on 10, a 4-iron on the 14th hole to win 6-4.


Q.  Overall, it sounded like you played fairly well. 

KENNY PERRY:  I did.  I only missed one fairway and I hit a lot of greens and I putted well.  I made a lot of birdies.


Q.  Talk about your game so far this year. 

KENNY PERRY:  I had three weeks off, a much needed rest.  My neck wasn't bothering me like it hurt me really bad on Sunday at the Hogan in Phoenix, so I feel okay again.  I was happy with the way I hit it.  I hit it hard, hit it solid, hit it long.  All this rain moving in here, I don't know how it's going to affect everybody, but I was really pleased with how I played today.
