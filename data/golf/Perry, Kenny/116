 Q. Right where you want to be in the tournament?
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, very solid. Great start. I birdied the first hole right out of the gate, and ended up shooing 31 on the front nine. That got me in a good position to go relax and play the back nine and try to shoot a score. Wasn't able to do it, but was happy to shoot 4-under, and right there in the mix. 

 Q. Not a lot of guys made up ground this afternoon. Seemed like conditions were pretty tough this afternoon, but you got hot out there; talk about being in good position now heading into the weekend. 
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, any time you can get within a few of the lead -- I've won coming from three back, so I just need to kind of hang around tomorrow and shoot a good round tomorrow, and hopefully come the back nine Sunday, that's kind of where it all happens. But I'm ecstatic. I'm in a good position and hopefully I can go out there and open up and make a few birdies early and kind of put it on cruise control.

 Q. Being the guy with everything against you, you're the front run irin the FedExCup; talk about the mind-set of the Playoffs. 
 KENNY PERRY: Really nobody's a favorite. It's just the guy who gets hot; that's who they are favoring it to, the guy who gets hot. I hope it turns out the way it did this summer. That's kind of the way I'm going to have to play these three weeks like I did those six weeks in the summer. 

 Q. Everything feeling okay? 
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, everything's good.
