 Q. Kenny Perry on his eagle on 14.  2-iron, 20 yards out of the bunker.  Can you give us a few words on that?KENNY PERRY: Full iron hybrid, just kind of hit it over the cross bunker up there and just landed over it and ran it on the green and it just kept rolling.  I was expecting to watch it roll over the back.  Then I saw everybody jump up in the air, I knew it went in the hole.  It was pretty special.
