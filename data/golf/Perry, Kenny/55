Q.   You shaved a couple strokes off each round. 
KENNY PERRY:   Getting a little better, yeah.   I haven't played in two weeks, I had the flu and I couldn't practice and prepare.   And I'm starting to get my strength back, getting to feeling better.   So it was nice.   I actually hit it fairly well today.

Q.   Has the course played completely differently the last few days?
KENNY PERRY:   Yeah, we went from a southerly wind the first day, to a north, northeast the second day, and then we had it northern.   And then it swapped and went to a southern.   So we had a flipâ€‘flop in the round today.   So it's been pretty tricky out there.   But a lot of guys seem to be managing pretty well.

Q.   And the greens?
KENNY PERRY:   That rain came and really softened them up.   So you were able to hit some good shots there.
