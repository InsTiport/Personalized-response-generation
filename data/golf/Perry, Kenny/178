KENNY PERRY:  To me, I thought it was over the top.  The greens were firm.  They were kind of brown and dead out there.  I never saw so many putts go by the hole.

It was a good round of golf.  I was happy to shoot 1-under.  Is seemed like when I thought I'd made a birdie, I make a bogey.

It was a great day.  It was great having my son out there.  He got to hear the cheers with Phil Mickelson.  He said he had goosebumps, so that was neat.  It was a special week for me.
Q.  Any idea when you're going to get him back on the bag?
KENNY PERRY:   Hopefully this summer.  So we'll see.  I don't know.  He's a very calm kid.  He kept me calm.  And we just had a great week.
