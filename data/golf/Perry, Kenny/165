KENNY PERRY:  I'm tickled, I shot a pair of 68s and it ought to be in good shape.  I probably won't be in the lead but I should be in good shape for the weekend.
Q.  The question we're asking a lot of the guys, after last week, what's the effect this week; do you feel refreshed?
KENNY PERRY:  I think it kind of prepared me for this week more than anything.  I think they set the pins up brutal for the first two rounds.  I've never seen them set up this tough, or either the greens are a lot faster than I normally remember.  They seem to be more on the edges the last two rounds.

You've got to really be patient out there.  I was 2 over early in my round and was able    I bogeyed I think 12 and 16, and I was able to birdie 17 and 18 and play the front nine at 3 under to get back in the tournament a little bit.

It's a tough old girl.  You have to really watch what you're doing out there.
Q.  I don't know where you would fall in this, but guys who have never won a major, do you think you should be included in that debate?
KENNY PERRY:  I don't know.  I don't care.  It don't mean nothing to me.  I'm just out doing my job and taking care of my wife and my kids.  If they want to tag me with that, that's fine.  I don't think it's true.  I think there's a lot of players with more talent and abilities that should be in that category.  It don't bother me.  If they want to stick me with that, that's fine.
Q.  Did you feel a round like this coming after the way you played yesterday?
KENNY PERRY:  Yeah, I've driven it beautifully.  I've hit my irons well.  I'm putting beautifully.  So, you know what when you're putting well, it sure makes the game a lot easier.
