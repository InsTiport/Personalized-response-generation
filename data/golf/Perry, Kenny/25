 Q.  Just didn't quite have it altogether today, couple bogies out there.  What do you think?  KENNY PERRY: Couple?  Made a lot.   Q.  What do you think of the course?  KENNY PERRY: The course is outstanding.  Very hard.  I only played two rounds, Tuesday and Wednesday, wasn't much wind.  Now we have 30 mile an hour wind, 25 out there all day today. I had no clue what I was doing out there.  I was shell shocked.  And, you know, I was 4-over after 5.  Then I was about to bogey another one.  I made an incredible up and down, being 5-over after 6. Made an eagle the hole on the par 5 or whatever which got me back to 2-over.  Kind of calmed me down a little bit.  I was making bogies left and right. I never could pull the right club.  Never felt comfortable.  Every hole felt like a cross wind to me.  Just a great golf course.  I mean it is hard and enjoyed playing it, I really did. I don't have enough experience here on this tract.  That's my 3rd round ever so I guess I should have prepared a little better, got in here a little earlier than late Tuesday.  I didn't realize it was that difficult.  That's okay.  I had fun.   Q.  Tomorrow morning, what do you have to do to go low?  KENNY PERRY: Hopefully the wind to lay down a little bit.  If I can shoot it 1 or 2-under, get it back to a couple over -- I don't think the leaders are going to get too far away -- and then maybe make a run Saturday and Sunday.  I don't know. This course is rough for me, for my game, you know.  I struggled on it so -- but, you know, that's golf.  Some weeks there's horses for courses and it's okay.  I mean I'll figure it out and who knows, I may get hot tomorrow and shoot a good round but I may not.  I may shoot worse
