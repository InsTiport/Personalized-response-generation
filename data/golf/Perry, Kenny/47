 Q.   Talk about the day.   
KENNY PERRY:   Well, it was going good for the first 13 holes or whatever.   
And I had 190 yards on that par‑3, 14.   And I hit a 6‑iron and flew ‑‑ the pin was 190, we had 10 more, I had 200 to the back and I hit a 6‑iron and it flew the whole green.   Ended up making double bogey.   And that kind of shell shocked me a little bit.   I couldn't believe it went that far, for one thing.   And then I was in jail the whole time.   So to make double on a hole that you think you can make birdie on, or at least par, so that hurt.   
Then I hit a beautiful 7‑iron on the next hole or two holes later and it carried the green and went‑‑ I guess, maybe I had a little adrenaline, a little juiced up a little bit.   I had 16 yards and I flew it over the pin into the back bunker with a 7‑iron.   Which is stuff I don't normally do.   
So then when I looked up and I saw I was two behind, that kind of, I was like, I got figure out a way to ‑‑ and I hit it in the junk on 17, which pretty much ended my day.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the putt on 18.   I know at that point you're probably ‑‑  
KENNY PERRY:   That didn't mean anything.   No.   I mean I was just trying to get out of the way, get done and move on.
