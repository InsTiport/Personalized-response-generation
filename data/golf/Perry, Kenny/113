  Q. That was a tough match.   
 JIM FURYK: Yeah, it was. We battled hard. Both teams had some crucial putts in the middle of the round that didn't go in that could have changed it, but we had opportunities. I hit a very good iron at 16 and 17 and we ended up missing opportunities at both of them to finish out. But we're happy with the way we played. We ground out a half a point.   
  
  Q. Did you have little jitters on the first tee this morning?   
 KENNY PERRY: I told Jimmy, I said, "You're going to have to play the first couple holes and let me settle down a little bit." I was nervous out there. I never felt that way in my whole life, even in team competitions or anything. I had all the crowd chanting my name. It was phenomenal. I'm guessing the Euros are kind of getting tired of hearing it. But it was great.   
 What an experience, to be able to be here in Louisville in front of my home folks. My dad is out here, I was giving him high fives, my best friends are out here, my kids are out here.   
  
  Q. 3-1 lead going into the afternoon, how do you guys feel about that?  
 JIM FURYK: Obviously I'm proud of it. A lot of matches were down and guys battled back and got us some points. So we're going to go out there and keep the pedal down and get home.
