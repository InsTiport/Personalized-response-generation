KENNY PERRY:  I tell you what, those last three holes, my arms were really tired.  I just didn't have it.  I didn't have much feeling.  I was just hanging on.  I knew Jerry was fresh and I was going to lean on his young legs, baby.  Thanks goodness.  He played great today.  I kept it in the fairway, he hit good shots and he putted beautifully. 


Q.  Knowing how fired up you are about being here and playing in this Presidents Cup, how hard was it for you to sit this morning? 

JERRY KELLY:  Wow, that was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  I told the guys, I'm here for the team.  I'm not just here for myself.  Mr.  Nicklaus, apparently he knows what's going on.  He had me fresh and it worked out in the end.  It was fantastic.
