  Q. Usually a guy shoots a 67 on a tough course and he's jubilant. You look exhausted. What was it like playing this afternoon?  
 KENNY PERRY: It's tough out there. It's U.S. Open conditions. The greens are hard, and that rough is brutal. You can't get out of the rough if you hit it in the rough.  
 There's no breather holes out there. There's no hole like you can take a breath and feel like you're okay on this hole. If you drive it in trouble or in the rough, you're scrambling, you're out of position, and next thing you know, you're making a bogey on a hole you think you ought to be making birdie.   
 I only hit like 11 greens, and I chipped good, but I made a lot of six- and 10-footers for par today.   
  
  Q. A couple of the shots coming in, 16 and 18. Let's start with 16 and 18 here.   
 KENNY PERRY: Just an 8-iron from about 175 yards, straight downwind to a front pin, and it was just right in my wheel house. You can see it landed in the rough there and killed it, and actually stopped ten, 12 feet from the hole and was able to get it in.  
 18, I had 165, 6-iron uphill into the wind.   
  
  Q. In the rough?  
 KENNY PERRY: I was in the shortcut, not the heavy cut. Came out beautifully. Probably the sweetest iron shot I hit all day and was able to get it close and hit it in for birdie.  
  
  Q. As good as you're playing, after the win at Phoenix, how good could you be?  
 KENNY PERRY: This is as good as it gets really. I'm getting everything I can out of the round. I missed one par putt on 17 that it was going right in.   
 I'm just hanging in there. I was trying to make my birdies, draw a little interest. I was trying not to lose them out there because it's so hard to make birdies on this golf course. It just went my way today.
