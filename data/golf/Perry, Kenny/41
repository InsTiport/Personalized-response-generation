Q.   After a stellar 64, Kenny, you woke up and rolled out of bed, and you were 10 shots out of the lead.   Did that factor into your strategy? 
KENNY PERRY:   My goal last night thinking was I got to get to four or five strokes for Sunday's round.   If I shoot that miracle round on Sunday, I got a chance to catch up. 
I played unbelievable today.   I hit every fairway, greens.   I had my opportunities.   It was an easy 6 under.   It was just stress-free and a lot of fun. 
So it looks like I'm not going to catch Michael.   At least I set my goal.   I got to where I can get a good shot tomorrow if I can play another great round of golf.   I know I got a shot at this thing.

Q. Congratulations on a great round.   Play well tomorrow.
