 Q. You have to love the three birdies. 
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, I made that snake on the third hole from about 50 feet for birdie, and then I hit a poor drive on 4 underneath the tree and that kind of brought me back to reality a little bit. 
 But it was a good day. I made seven birdies again today and I made eight birdies yesterday. I just have to find a way to limit the mistakes I'm making. I'm making two or three bogeys in the round, and it's the kind of golf course that if you hit it in the fairway, you have a good shot at birdies. 

 Q. Talk about where you've put yourself for tomorrow. 
 KENNY PERRY: Still a ways back. It's frustrating to keep shooting pretty good scores yet not make up any ground. I'm going to have to pull some rabbits out of the hat. I'll probably need to shoot 64 or 8-under to catch the leaders.
 You have to look at weather, too, that may totally change the dynamics of this golf tournament, I don't know. But if it stays just the way it is, it's a birdie-fest out there. 

 Q. So if you can just drive it in the fairway --
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, if I can just drive it in the fairway and not miss a fairway tomorrow, I have a good shot. 

 Q. Talk about at 47, playing some of the best golf of your life. 
 KENNY PERRY: Just trying to make that Ryder Cup Team, that's it. I've got one goal, and I'm not letting up and keeping that gas pedal to the floor here, and I'm just trying to do the best I can each and every week, and hopefully I'll make it. 

 Q. Does staying in contention get to be a grind?
 KENNY PERRY: I was tired today, and it will wear on you. But keep making birdies and keep shooting good rounds, that will keep you pumped up.
