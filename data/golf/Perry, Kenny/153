 Q.  Talk about your round. 
 KENNY PERRY:  It was okay.  It was a steady round, very similar to yesterday.  Didn't make a lot of birdies, not very flashy but very consistent.  I made one bogey and four birdies.  I let a couple get away out there, at the 14th hole and the 17th hole.  I had a 5-iron into the green for my second shot on 17 to come away with a par.  That was kind of disappointing.  But I made it up by making birdie out of the bunker on 18.  They all kind of cycle out out here. 

 Q.  But it's nice to see nobody is really running away, either. 
 KENNY PERRY:  Well, that 15 mile-an-hour wind is just enough to aggravate you out there.  It's pretty tough choosing clubs and trying to feel confident over a yardage when you have that type of wind, and it's just enough to keep a guy from really tearing it up. 

 Q.  You're going to have to go low tomorrow do you think? 
 KENNY PERRY:  Definitely.  I'm going to have to somehow get it to 18-under.  Nathan is already way up there.  He's 16 under.  He finishes strong, makes a couple coming in, it's definitely his tournament to win or lose.  Someone is going to have to go out there and post a real low round just to make him think about it anyway.
