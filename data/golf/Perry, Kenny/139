 Q. What are your general thoughts on your round and the way things finished coming into this, and the playoffs?
 KENNY PERRY: I made good shots just didn't go all the way. Played good coming in. I made some good birdies coming in to get the lead. 
 Somebody always plays better. It's a tough to win out here.

 Q. How did you feel standing over your putt on the 72nd hole? Did you have a good look at it?
 KENNY PERRY: You know, it's a 30-footer, 25-footer. I misread it. I thought it would break a little left, and it broke to the right, and then I thought my putt -- I was dead opposite on the other way and it broke the opposite way also. Had that little putt right on the crown. It was a good putt. I mean I was happy with it, had good speed on it so.

 Q. Can we talk about your sequence in the play-off. How did you feel going in? Did you like your position even though you were in a playoff?
 KENNY PERRY: You're leading the golf tournament, you got to like how you're doing. 
 I mean a hit a beautiful 3-wood, hit a beautiful 5-wood. I had it hooking in there from right to left and it hit the -- I never dreamed it -- I must have been pumped up cause it hit the tree trunk over there and shot it across the green into the water. So what are you going to do?

 Q. Then on your par putt?
 KENNY PERRY: Well I just told you, I had the same putt from the same line opposite sides so I figured it was going to do what it did coming from the other way and it didn't. It broke the other way. Fooled me twice.
