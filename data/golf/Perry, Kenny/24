Q. Plus-1 today.KENNY PERRY: Yeah.Q. What went right?KENNY PERRY: What went right?Q. What went right on 1-under?KENNY PERRY: Nothing went right.  I played okay.  This is just a hard golf course.  You know, I played poorly at the Woodlands, I play poorly on bermuda-type golf courses like this that have rough and stuff and, you know, this golf course pinches in. I hit a lot of 5-woods.  Took the driver right out of my hands.  So, you know, I'm just not managing it very well.  The greens -- the green complexes are hard and I'm putting poorly.  Consequently, shooting pretty poor scores.Q. How about conditions today?KENNY PERRY: Same.  Wind is coming out southwest.  So the golf course played pretty similar today as it did yesterday
