 Q. Talk about your round today.KENNY PERRY: What a way to end it.  Played nicely.  Shot, made some birdies, bogeys, shoot 70, even par, probably my last U.S. Open, so I was pretty ecstatic.
Q. Feel good about your round on the weekend?KENNY PERRY: Yeah.  I had a tough day yesterday, but I played beautifully on Friday and Sunday.  So all in all, it was a great week.  I'm Top-30, I guess, somewhere around in there, so I can't complain.
Q. Next stop for you back on the Champions Tour?KENNY PERRY: Correct.  Chicago next week.
