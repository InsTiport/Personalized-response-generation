KENNY PERRY:  It's 80 degrees today, so I've got to credit a little of the warm weather to that.  It was beautiful out there.  What a nice day for golf.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  The first two rounds I hit the ball poorly and putted outstanding, and today I hit the ball really good.  I told Justin that's probably one of the finest rounds of golf I've played in a long time.  I just kept pounding it down the the fairway and I kept hitting greens.  I kept giving myself opportunities.  We never really struggled.

The only bogey I made was on 18.  I really got robbed there a little bit.  I hit a beautiful 8-iron up on the high shelf.  I don't know how it ended up down on the low tier because it was right of the flag.  I don't know how it ended up left.  It must have kicked off the bank or something, I don't know.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  Oh, it didn't land on the green?  I couldn't tell from the fairway.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  Oh, well, I understand that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  Well, you know, there's no wind.  It was probably five to seven miles an hour.  The greens are very firm, very hard and very fast.  You better hit the fairways to have a chance to score.  And thank goodness I hit a lot of fairways.  I had a lot of opportunities.  I hit the ball better than I hit it in a long time.  So I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  I've got a good shot of winning.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  No, he's letting me do all the work.  No, he's just a calming influence for me.  He's just really calm out there.  He's just kind of laid back and just kind of going with the flow.  He's not really got too excited, too up or too down.  I would think an 18-year-old watching his dad make birdies, I would have probably been screaming and hollering and running around a little bit.  But he just grabs the bag and off he goes.  It's been great for me.
Q.  How much fun would that be to win with him on your bag?
KENNY PERRY:  It would be the ultimate.  I couldn't put that into words.  That would be priceless.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  No, we've just got spring break this week.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  I did.  I thought somebody would get it to 11 or 12.  I'm kind of shocked that 9 is leading right now.  So they may make a few coming in.

But I'm within striking distance.  If I can go out there somehow and shoot a low round tomorrow, I have a good chance of winning.
Q.  (Inaudible).
KENNY PERRY:  I don't know, we haven't discussed that.  We have not discussed that.
Q.  Did he have any homework this week?
KENNY PERRY:  No, he doesn't do homework (laughter).  I don't think I've ever seen him bring a book home (laughter).
