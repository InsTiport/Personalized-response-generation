  Q. 5-under par, that's a pretty good run. You and Ernie played today together and shoot the same score, but you got there different ways.   
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, I was trying to hang onto his shirttails for a while. He's the big easy. He made the front nine look awfully easy. It's nice. When he's playing well, sometimes the partner will tag along. Shoot, I was fighting and struggling and scrapping, and we both made eagle on that par 5, the fifth hole, and that really turned my round around.   
 I 3-putted from nowhere and then I birdied 6, drove it on the green.   
 Yeah, I hit it nice. I was really in control of my game and hit a lot of nice 3-woods off the tee. I felt a little funky with the putter today. With all of the wind and the grain, I just felt unbalanced out there. But I made a couple nice ones. On 14, I made a good putt, and on 16, I made a 20-footer for par, which really saved my round. I made a nice little one on the last hole to shoot 5-under, which might be my lowest round out here, I don't know.   
  
  Q. You know the one good thing, you were hitting the ball well off the tee and it looked like the driver was going pretty good for you.   
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, shoot, I'm keeping up with all of these young guys. I'm ten years older than Ernie.   
  
  Q. You have a new son-in-law, right?  
 KENNY PERRY: Yeah, he was out walking around with me. I have the newly weds out here, brought them out here for a wedding gift. My little girl is the only one missing; it would be a perfect weekend.
