  KENNY PERRY:   Just kept making putts early in the round.   Everyone was right on my tail, and I said, I've got to get out there, get in the comfort zone, and it all came together.   I can't explain why.   All these years, here I am, almost 53 years old, and it just all comes together for me.   
I just thank God, thank Larry Moody.   Today he sent me Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 and got me through the day.   It's just neat stuff.   It's just neat how it all turns out, how everything is.   It's just been a blessing.  
   
 Q.   You said it's been years.   You've been trying to win a USGA title for years.   How would you put this in its proper perspective?   
KENNY PERRY:   This is by far the biggest tournament I ever won.   I won 14 times on the PGA Tour.   I lost the playoff at the Master's and the PGA playoff.   I didn't get the job done.   
Now to have a USGA title, it's an Open, it's our Open, it's what the players play for.   It's what we want.   You want an Open title by your name.   
To finally get it, even though it's a Senior Open, I still regard it as a very high honor.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations, Kenny.   
KENNY PERRY:   Thanks.
