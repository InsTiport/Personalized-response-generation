Q.   Talk about Hale Irwin. 
KENNY PERRY:   You talk about Bubba Watson or all these crazy‑‑ Hale Irwin, I said this two weeks ago, he's the most incredible golfer out there.   How can you be 67 years old and shoot 6‑under?   He beat his age today, didn't he?   So that puts him at 65?   Pretty amazing. 
I was kind of saying to Jeff Sluman, I said if I'm 67 and still playing out here, just shoot me.   I ain't going to make it a couple more years and that guy's 67 and he's still kicking my butt. 

Q.   How does he physically do it?
KENNY PERRY:   He looks like he could play‑‑ he looks like he's still in college.   He's in great shape, he doesn't have the belly on him like some of us.   I don't know what he does.   I need to ask him.   Does he actually really work out?   He must, he has to, at that age, he must really work on his stretching and flexibility.   He must be very dedicated. 

Q.   When you're in the shoes of Roger Chapman and having a guy with that resume chasing you, what's going through your head?
KENNY PERRY:   Oh, well, I don't know Roger, but obviously he's leading, I think, and this is the kind of a golf course that can, one hole can kill you.   You can make a big number on any hole out here. 
So if Roger can keep his nerves together and keep doing what he's doing, but what you got Hale and some of these other guys right on your heels, it's tough.
