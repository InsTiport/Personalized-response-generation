 Q. You roll out of bed, tee off at 7:32, and by 7:35 you're 2-under par in the round with an eagle at the first hole. 
 KENNY PERRY: You know, I had not holed a shot in a long time, and that was quite a way to open your eyes a little bit and put a big smile on your face. When that pitching wedge went in from 133 and everybody started roaring, you could not see the bottom of the flagstick up that hill. 
 You know, it was a good way to jump-start my round. Didn't play great today, and I could tell I've had a week off. And I'm making lots of birdies, and I made eight birdies yesterday. 
 My short game is a little off. My chipping and my putting, my feel is not quite with me. 
 But I'm ecstatic. I'm 7-under and right there in the golf tournament, so hopefully I'm going to go work a lot in afternoon and see what we've got.

 Q. Funny you say your touch is off, because I thought that putt on 17 was all touch, right down the fall line, and you just nursed it in.
 KENNY PERRY: Well, those are easy, just get those running, get those rolling, those are going to get to the hole and that was pretty neat.
 The ones that are up a ridge and back down, those are the ones I've been struggling with this week. 

 Q. You wore out that 5-wood when you won at Memorial; is that seeing any action this week? 
 KENNY PERRY: I did. I hit a beautiful one yesterday on 13 to about ten feet from the hole for eagle. I didn't make the eagle putt, but hit a pretty shot there. 
 No, there is a driver's golf course. I hit a lot of drivers here.
