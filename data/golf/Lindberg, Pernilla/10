Q. A wonderful 68 today, five birdies, one bogey.  Bounced back from a 71 yesterday.  What did you do better today?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I drove the ball a little bit better off the tee and I holed a few more putts.  That was really it.  I never put myself in any trouble and rolled a couple of nice long putts in today.  So yeah, it felt pretty simple today.
Q. And we saw you playing in the Ladies Scottish last week, but just for two days, a disappointing missed cut at Gullane.  What did you learn from those couple of rounds?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: You know, I've been playing over in the U. S. almost a whole year, and the golf is just different.  I know it's not a big adjustment because we have had pretty kind conditions so far here, but still, it's just the turf is a little bit different.  And I was just a little out of sync with my swing.  But it was good, I got a couple of extra practice days and I got ready for this week instead.
Q. And of course, all that golf in the U. S. resulted in a major championship, the first one of the year, which you won in unbelievable fashion, of course, your first win on the LPGA Tour as well.  What's it like now playing in a major championship as a major champion?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Oh, it's different, but in a good way.  I'm just walking out there with more confidence.  I've shown everyone and I've proved to myself that I can do it before, so now I just walk out there with a lot more confidence I would say.
Q. So with that extra confidence now entering the weekend five shots back, what's your game plan for the next two days?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: My game plan is just to take care of what I'm in control of.  I'll go out there and just do my best each and every day and just see where it takes me.  I don't tend to look too much at the leaderboards or anything, so whatever this course and the weather gives me I'll just deal with it and we'll see where it gets me.
Q. Perfect attitude.  Keep going.
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Thank you.
