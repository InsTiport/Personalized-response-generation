Q.   3‑under today, another steady round?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   It was.   I unfortunately started off with a 3‑putt on my first hole and yesterday my putting was so steady, so I didn't let that get to me too much. 
I kind of stayed patient for a while there and finally I had two birdies drop on 17 and 18, my eighth and ninth hole, and it was a lot more steady from there on. 

Q.   I had a word with your caddie and he said your approach was the key today. 
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, I saw it.   He keeps the stats for me so I saw that I hit 17 greens today compared to I only hit 11 greens yesterday.   That was a big improvement. 
Yeah, it was just steady.   If you don't miss the greens, you're not going to putt yourself into too much trouble. 

Q.   You said low expectations coming into it yesterday, but the way you are on the leaderboard after two days, changing those thoughts now?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   I still like going out there, trying to just feel the same low expectations, not putting more pressure on myself.   But also it's something that I've been working on with my mental coach this year to actually be able to step out on the course and handle expectations and pressure.   It's just going to be fun to be out there for the next two days.

Q.   Just going to be a question of just finishing one of these tournaments off, isn't it? 
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, often I see you here in front of the camera‑‑ I'm just putting myself in a good position more often, and you never know when it's going to be D‑Day for me.
