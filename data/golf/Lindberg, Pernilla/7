 Q.  It looked like you birdied four of your last five holes?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I did.   
 Q.  What was that like for you?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I was just never giving up.  I haven't brought my "A" game this week.  I haven't been playing that well.  But I just dug deep and managed to find something the last few holes.  I gave myself great chances actually on 11, 12, 13.  I missed pretty short birdie putts, and 17, too.  Really my best golf I played this week was on the back nine today, so that was nice.   
 Q.  When you saw Jodi miss from the fairway there, you realize you hit it on and maybe have a chance?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, match play, in my head, it's like, okay, she's going to hole this chip, she's going to hole this.  You just never can count anything out.  I still had to hit a good wedge shot in there, and that pin is a little tucked there.  I was for sure happy to hit it in as close as I did.  It freed me up a little bit just walking up to the green.   
 Q.  So you guys, you had a lot of ground to gain to get up to the top in this competition, so do you know just how crucial those two points were?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I mean, I looked at as many leaderboards as I could today just to kind of see where we're standing.  Pretty much all day we were down in all four matches, so the last thing I saw was that Caroline was 1-down going into 17.  I know what a fighter she is, and I was hoping she could get the half point at least, and I just believed in myself that I could turn mine around, so now I'm going to go out and root for the next two.
