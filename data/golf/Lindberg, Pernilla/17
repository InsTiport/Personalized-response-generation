 Q.  I'm sure it's been kind of a crazy nine days for you.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: It has, but once I got out on the course it just feels I'm back to what I'm doing most weeks.  It's been different preparation absolutely.  Probably been my least productive practice days leading up to a tournament ever.   
Everyone wants to come up and say hi and congratulate me.  I say, How often does this happen.  Of course I want to do it.  I want to enjoy it and embrace it.   
I was on the putting green for probably two hours yesterday and actually got 30 minutes of work in.  You know, I know I've been playing well, so I just kind of try to keep doing what I've been doing obviously during ANA and leading up to that.   
So, yeah, basically it's been hectic, but once you're out there the golf ball doesn't know if you're a major champion or not.   
 Q.  Has it sunk in yet that you get to hear Pernilla Lindberg, major champion, on the first tee.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yes and no.  They didn't announce it that way this morning and I was kind of waiting for it.  I mean, I was a little nervous because of it, but nervous in a good way.   
But, no, it's still sinking in.  Probably will take a while.  But, no, I'm loving it.   
 Q.  I'm just curious, did your schedule change at all after the win on Monday preparing for this, or did you kind of keep things how you kind of had it planned?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: You know, my plan coming out here just stayed the same.  I had a couple tournaments throughout the summer where I just said to myself, If I'm playing really good, having a good year, I'll probably take those events off.   
So now after the win, I will take those off and just kind of space my events out a little bit more.  I'm a player that tends to play a lot of events, and I'm going to keep doing that.  I'm not going to have any of those silly stretches with maybe six events in a row or anything like that.   
 Q.  How did you feel?  The wind is blowing out here today.  It's not easy.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: No, it wasn't easy at all out there today.  The course has really firm up, too.  I don't know if it was just in the afternoon or it was all day.  It's playing a lot firmer than I think we've ever seen it here any year we've been here.  It just made it really tricky.   
We know it's always blowing here, but today I would consider it a windy day for here even.   
 Q.  So how did you just kind of feel with your score and the way you played?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Couple under is a good start.  That's kind of -- I thought going out today a couple under was not going to hurt me; that was kind of my target.   
I was 2-under through 3, so then I kind of changed my target.  Oh, okay.  I can go a little bit lower today.  I ended up shooting 2-under, but I'm happy with it.   
 Q.  They didn't announce you as a major champion?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: No.  I think they just announced everyone this tournament, you know, From Sweden, Pernilla Lindberg, or from the U.S. blah, blah, blah.  Some tournaments do and some tournaments kind of say more stuff.   
I actually tend to like when they just say from Sweden, Pernilla Lindberg, because they get to the point.  Today I was like, Is it coming or not coming?   
 Q.  When did you get it Hawaii?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Sunday night, yeah.   
 Q.  You stayed out in California, right?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I had to go to Arizona.  Close enough.  So the last few years I've gone back to Florida to then come here, and it's just a lot of back and forth.  We had decided this whole time we were going to stay out west this year.   
It obviously worked out really well, because it would've been extremely busy going back and forth.   
 Q.  Parents still with you?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yes.  They're going home after L.A., so out there for a good month.  They actually spent last week in Maui, so I think they needed some time to recover after all the nerves I put them through.
