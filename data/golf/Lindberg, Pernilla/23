Q. Talk about your round?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Kind of stumbled a little bit a couple of holes, but hung in there and just kept going at the end because I wanted to get to my number.
Q. It's going to be about numbers again for you, because you didn't want to see the leaderboard before this interview, but I'm going to tell you it's going to be within one or two shots at the top.  Do you think you'll have to shoot something similar realistically to have a good chance tomorrow?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I really think so.  There's so many good players up there.  Someone is going to go out and play a good round.  I'm going to stick to my plan from today and I'm going to go home and think about what number I'm going to try to reach tomorrow, and that will be my goal.
