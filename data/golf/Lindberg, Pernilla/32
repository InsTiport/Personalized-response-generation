Q. What was the highlight of the round for you?  At what point did you feel at your best?PERNILLA LINDBERG: Obviously my front nine today I shot 3-under and made three birdies on the front nine.  I hit a wedge in really close on the 4th hole, so it was just a tap-in birdie and that kind of settled me down for the day and I felt more and more comfortable out there from that point on.Q. With three rounds at 70 in a row, you went out and you got under par today.  Do you look back on chances maybe?PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, I'm so happy with my long game this week, it's been really consistent from tee to green.  And the funny thing is putting is usually my strong part of my game and I feel like I haven't really got into even normal putting standard for me.  So obviously with a hot putter, you never know what it could have been.Q. Did you see any difference in the greens between yesterday and today?PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, I felt like today the putts rolled out a lot better.  I've been leaving quite a few putts short the first couple of days.  I've been trying to get more aggressive. But the greens rolled up better today so that helped me.  But at the same time, they firmed up a little bit, too, so you got more release on your shots into the green.Q. Anything that clicked today that got you under the 70s you were stuck in?PERNILLA LINDBERG: I think it was the putting, I just had a few more putts that dropped.  And a couple of times when I maybe put myself in a little bit of trouble, I managed to save some good par putts.  And that was really the difference.  But, yeah, the long game has been pretty consistent for four days.Q. What do you feel about the reception of the crowds?PERNILLA LINDBERG: Oh, it's been awesome. Yesterday I was playing with Michelle Wie, so obviously I got to experience some really big crowds.  And it's fun.  I mean, Michelle Wie and I were saying, kind of joking yesterday that if we took together all the LPGA events we've played so far this year, it probably adds up to the same crowds we're having this one week here.  It's just fun to see that we're getting so much attention in women's golf and how appreciated we are in this area of the country
