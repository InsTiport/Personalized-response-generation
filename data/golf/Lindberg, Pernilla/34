Q.   Fantastic round.   Low round of the day.   Congratulations.   Just talk us through that round.
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, thank you.   Yeah, I had two kind of really good stretches in there.   I started off with four straight birdies.   Holed 3, 4, 5, 56. 
And then kind of did the similar thing towards the end with four straight birdies on 15, 16, 17, 18.
So just felt like I've been playing really solid golf this week.   I haven't really been enough on the greens earlier in the week, and today I decided I that was really going to try to make sure I got all my putts there. 
I gave myself good chances and I was rolling it good and they all dropped in.
Q.   Fantastic.   And you are leader in the clubhouse.   What were you going to do for the next half hour, 40 minutes or so before the others come in? 
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Right now I just need to go inside and cool down a little bit.   It's really humid out there today.   Yeah, just keep drinking water and keep checking what the girls are doing.   Yeah, try to stay cool. 

Q.   You've enjoyed yourself in Malaysia?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, even for a Swede that's not used to this humidity, it's one of our best tournaments all year.   We're so well looked after.   It's always fun to be here. 

Q.   How did you deal with the heat?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   I think I've learned to deal with it a little bit more living in Florida now.   Just keep drinking a lot and I have towels out there that I kind of wipe myself.
