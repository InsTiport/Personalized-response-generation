 Q.   So congratulations on your week.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Not exactly the end you would have wanted, of course, but overall, thoughts?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Right now I'm just really upset.   I mean looking back at the week in a little bit I'll probably be happy, but I just left so many shots out there and had a really, really bad threeâ€‘putt on 17 that cost me a lot, so yeah, right now I'm not happy, but I'll probably feel better in a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Just talk me through 17.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   I hit a wedge to maybe 10 feet, then really thought I holed the next putt, but I guess I was a little too aggressive, so hit it three feet past and lipped out on that putt, so that's really in the back of my head right now.  
   
 Q.   When you're halfway through your round and you can see something going away like that, is it tricky to sort of pick yourself up and really think you can still win this?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   No.   Golf is always golf.   You never know what's going to happen until the day is over.  
Yeah, when we made the turn she wasn't that many ahead, so still felt pretty comfortable.
