Q.   How do you summarize your round today?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Not a very good front nine and a very good Back 9.   I was one over at the turn.   I just missed a few too many greens and didn't get up‑and‑downs.   But then after rolling in a birdie on 10, that kind of got me going for the Back 9.

Q.   And who's your caddie?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Daniel, he's my boyfriend.

Q.   What's his last name?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Taylor.

Q.   Is he a professional as well?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Uh‑huh.   Yeah, he's been caddying for three years now, and we have decided so far to ‑‑ he's been doing his thing.   He's been working for a couple other LPGA girls, but then this year he's been caddying for me almost every LET tournament I've played in.   I have another caddie over in the U. S, so it seems to work.   We've had a lot of Top 10s together.

Q.   Does he play on a golf tour?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   No.   No, no.   Just a caddie.   Yeah, he played college golf.

Q.   Oh, okay.   So he's not a professional?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   No, I thought you meant like professional caddie.   No, he's still an amateur. 
He played for the England team growing up.

Q.   That's what I thought.   He's a good player.   So you're feeling good about tomorrow?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah.   It's always nice to finish good.   With five birdies on the Back 9 today, just try to keep that going.

Q.   And the experience of playing with Yani Tseng in China last week, did that help you?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Absolutely.   I feel like every time I've been playing with some of the top stars I've gotten better and better at handling it, and as good as I felt and as comfortable as I felt with Yani there in China was a big improvement from before, so yeah, it helped a lot.

Q.   It wouldn't phase you playing with any of the players in this week's field?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   No.   It's fun.   That's really what I'm here for and every time you do it, it's a great experience. 

Q.   Thank you. 
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   I had a lot of good looks for birdie on the Back 9.   It was a little rough to start off with.   I missed some greens and missed some up‑and‑downs, but yeah, I got better as the day went on.

Q.   Did it help having a third Swede next to you in your group to keep you going?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, it was fun.   I mean we were three Swedes in my group today, so we talked a lot and had a lot of fun out there, and especially we had a lot of Swedish supporters out there.   So it was fun.

Q.   Heading into the tournament, did you really expect to be or hope to be where you are heading into the final day?   I think you're currently joint second, one off the lead?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, of course.   I mean I'm here to compete.   I'm ready to be out there in the top, and I'm coming in with I think it's four straight Top 10s on the LET going into this week.   So of course, I know I got the game in me, so it's fun to be up there.

Q.   And tomorrow, what's the game plan?
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Just go out and do the same thing again.

Q.   Just stay relaxed, keep focused and hope for a Swede. 
PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah.   I know, that seemed to work today.
