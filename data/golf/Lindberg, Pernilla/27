 Q.  Take us through the hole-in-one on 17?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, it had kind of been a frustrating day, really a frustrating weekend, and the previous par 3, 15, I kind of chunked it in the water and made a double.  So I guess this was a good recovery to kind of save the day and save the score.   
But yeah, we were discussing the yardage a little bit and I took some yardage off a 7-iron, and when the ball was in the air, I kept holding my finish and said, "Be good!  Be good!" -- because it looked good the whole way.  It landed about a step, maybe four or five feet short of the pin, and just trickled in.   
 Q.  What was the number you and your caddie had for it?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: We played downhill.  It was 147 and a little light breeze into.   
 Q.  How many hole-in-ones is this in your career and in competition?  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: This is my sixth hole-in-one.  I was telling the girls that I was playing with, it's kind of funny.  You know how they say that hole-in-ones kind of come in streaks?  My latest one was in Beijing, so I started and ended my Asia trip with hole-in-ones.  Before that, I had one in Arkansas and in 2011 in an LPGA event.  So it's my third in LPGA events, and then six overall.  I made one in a an LET event, a Sun Coast event and in a practice round.   
 Q.  We were talking a little bit earlier, you were pretty excited, got it on camera here, your parents are going to be able to see it.  
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Exactly.  My mom texted me yesterday, and even though I didn't play very good, she said, I got to see you roll in a birdie put on 10.  So they showed that on TV yesterday and hopefully they get to see this one today.
