  Q. You've won this event before and nice finish this year, the 50th anniversary.  Take us through the week and how pleased you are to have climbed the leaderboard into the top 15.
 PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, I really felt my game has been coming along nicely leading up to this, but I haven't really gotten it to clinic for four days.  To be honest, this week I was striking the ball so well.  Golf is funny.  I hit the ball probably better from tee to green this week than when I won here but my putter wasn't as hot this week.
 But it was just nice to see on the weekend that I did manage to get some putts to drop, and I didn't feel like I gave too many shots away.  First couple days I missed a few short putts and that's always kind of bothers me, but it was nice to finish with a good weekend.
 Q. You had a 4-under 68 today including four -- five birdies.  Any one of those birdies particularly stand out for you today?
 PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Obviously I finished with a birdie on 18, so that was a nice way, it's always the best way to finish a tournament.
 But otherwise I kind of felt like I got the run going well with three birdies on the front nine and just kind of, you know, calmed me down very nicely and just kind of kept going from there.
 Gave me a little bit of a confidence boost with my putter in the hands seeing those go in on the front nine.
 Q. As a past champion of this event, when you won and you see someone like Patty who has led wire to wire this week looking for her first major at this event as well, and you've got a charging Lydia Ko, 8-under through 10, only three shots back, take us through your win and what it was like, maybe some things that you remember that a back nine, really you kind of focused in on even heading into the playoff?
 PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, for me, I really just -- it's easy to say, but I really just stuck to myself and I didn't look at any leaderboards.  That's what worked best for me.
 You know, I just knew I had been doing good things that whole week, and if I just kept doing what I had been doing I thought I was going to be in a spot.  That's what's worked for me.  If that's the same for other players that is not necessarily always true, but Patty has been very impressive obviously so far though week, so it's going to be fun to watch the rest of the day.
 Q. What are the plans for the off week, then just preparing for the rest of the west coast swing?
 PERNILLA LINDBERG:   Yeah, so some people might think it's a little crazy but I'm going back home to Florida before going to Hawaii.  You know, as much time as we spend on the road, any night you can get at home in your own bed is valuable.  I'm going to catch a red eye home tonight and be home first thing Monday morning.
 Q. Nice.  Masters favorite this week?
 PERNILLA LINDBERG:   I haven't really put any bets out there yet, but I will for sure be watching.  I love watching every year.  I was watching the drive, chip, putt this morning.  Swedes haven't really been playing that good on the men's side this year so I might have to go with a different European.  First one that comes to my mind is I would love to see Lee Westwood.  He's been playing so well.  I been rooting for him these last couple months.
