Q. I heard you had six bogeys and seven birdies?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, I think it was maybe six birdies and five bogeys, yeah.  You'll know better when you look at the scorecard.
Q. How was it?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: It was obviously lots of birdies which I had to hit lots of good shots and especially I was rolling the putts really good to make that many birdies.  But then a few too many bogeys than I would have liked.  That was really a stretch in the middle of the round where I dropped a few shots, so I was happy to get back from that again and start making birdies again.
Q. So 1-under today is quite a good score isn't it?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, of course with so many birdies I would have liked even a little lower score, but it's for sure a good start on a Thursday.  I'll take it.
