  Q. Five birdies, four bogeys, not quite as consistent as yesterday, but still pretty pleased with what you were able to do out there today?   
 PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, absolutely. I mean still making five birdies that shows that I have some good game in me, and I was still making a lot of good putts.   
 Like I said before, too, I missed a few more fairways today so that was really where the bogeys came from. Yeah, aside from that, it still feels good.  
  
  Q. Was the course playing similar today? I know you weren't playing preferred lies, so were there some differences?   
 PERNILLA LINDBERG: I thought it played is similar. 9 and 18 they moved up the tee boxes a little bit more yesterday so they played a little bit longer, not much today though. Otherwise, I thought it played pretty similar.  
  
  Q. To be able to put two rounds together like yesterday and today and find yourself near the top of the leaderboard, how nice is that knowing you want to play well towards the end of the year?   
 PERNILLA LINDBERG: It feels really good. I've been struggling lately, really, been just trying to make cuts. These two days I haven't been thinking about the cut line because I've been up there just trying to make more and more birdies instead. So, of course, it's nice.  
  
  Q. Does your game feel like it's coming together at this point too? Was there something that you figured out recently that's helped?   
 PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, I feel all year that my short game and putting has been pretty good, but my long game has been failing a little bit. My game has always been the opposite, so I've been a little bit confused this year. But lately it feels like all the parts have been coming together, and I guess this week I finally got everything together.
