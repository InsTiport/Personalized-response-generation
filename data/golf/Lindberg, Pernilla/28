Q. Let's talk about the round today.
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yes.
Q. How do you attack this type of course?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: I feel like I'm being pretty aggressive off the tee.  There are for sure some holes where you don't really hit driver, but I'm still trying to push it up there pretty far.
For me, yesterday and today I've just really been trying to get around.  I have a really bad cold at the moment, so just felt a little low.  You know, quite often they say beware of the sick cougher.
Q. So true.
PERNILLA LINDBERG: So haven't really been striking my irons as good as I would have liked, but I've really been taking advantage of the chances I have given myself and putting good.
Q. A lot of people say this is the type of course with these greens it's easier to play in the morning than in the afternoon.  Did you find that today compared to yesterday?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah, for sure the greens were a little bit softer playing in the morning, and then the wind picked up quite a bit towards the end yesterday for us.  So that for sure made it a little bit tougher yesterday, too.
But I think the greens are rolling so good here.  When you play in the morning they're just absolutely perfect.
Q. Then this tournament specifically offers a lot of nice things, like the food truck.  You've taken advantage of it, haven't you?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yes, exactly.  Actually, this is my seventh week in a row playing right now.
Q. I didn't realize that.
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Yeah.  I was going to take this week off but I changed my mind last minute because I just like Portland too much to skip it.  Especially this time of the year.  The weather is just so nice here.
Me being based in Florida it's kind of hot to be back home practicing.  Much rather you be out here.
Q. You're the type of person that loves good food especially.  You're not a fried-food-type person.  Is that one of the reasons you love coming to Portland?
PERNILLA LINDBERG: Absolutely.  All the good food.  Especially all the healthy food options.  Then it's just such an outdoorsy place, too.  Since I haven't been feeling well I haven't done much, but the nature here and everything is just beautiful.
