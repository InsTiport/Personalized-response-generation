 Q. Do you have any comments on your experience here this week?
 GEORGE FORSTER: I always enjoy playing in this tournament. I've been fortunate enough to play in this the last few years. So I came into this week with no game and this is not the place to try to find your game. So I struggled. 
 I still enjoyed it. I had a great time. My son caddied for me and my wife was out here. So it's great to be out here and be with this caliber of players, I just wish I could have performed better.

 Q. What was it like having your son out on the course with you?
 GEORGE FORSTER: It's really cool. He's my youngest son, he's caddied for me two years. George, my older son, who is also a golf professional, he's an assistant pro at Merion, he caddied me for a couple years out here. So it's great. 

 Q. What did you think of the course?
 GEORGE FORSTER: Very fair golf course. You got to know how to play the wind and you got to really know how to judge your distance into the greens, which I had a lot of trouble with. The elevation and things.
