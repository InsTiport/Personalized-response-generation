 Q.   How was your round today?  
GEORGE FORSTER:   The conditions were very difficult, the wind is probably a three club wind and I scrambled well at the end, but I hit a lot of good shots, made three birdies, and hung in there as well as possible.  
   
 Q.   So compared to the practice round, the windy conditions a little different?  
GEORGE FORSTER:   Totally different direction.   Of course a little warmer too.   But, yeah for instance, 7 was downwind and 7's a very difficult hole, probably the toughest hole on the course and it's not much easier downwind.
