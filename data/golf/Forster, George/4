 Q. Tell me what the conditions were like out there? I know the weather was pretty bad this morning when you teed off. Did it get any better for you?
 GEORGE FORSTER: Actually the weather was really cold when we teed off. A little bit of rain. It was probably in the low 40s, it really affected the flight of the ball tremendously. But then it got a lot better.

 Q. How was your round overall today? How would you assess your game?
 GEORGE FORSTER: I was doing okay early. And then I started missing short putts and then I got a little jittery on the greens and that's really what killed me today. I didn't hit the ball great, but I didn't hit it badly. I hit, I think every fairway, but two. Mishit a couple iron shots. That's what you got to do out here. 
 If you loose your confidence on the putting greens, forget it. 

 Q. Were the greens pretty quick?
 GEORGE FORSTER: They were very quick. Much faster than the practice rounds.
