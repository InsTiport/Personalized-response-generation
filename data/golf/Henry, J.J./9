Q.   That was solid.   I followed you guys.   You were having a blast and you got in no trouble today.   Were you in control?
J.J. HENRY:   Yeah, it's tough to beat Pebble Beach on a day like today.   Chris Berman, Boomer, we had a great time.   We've played together for years and it's best I've ever seen him play. 
So believe I played pretty well myself, but I'm really happy for Boomer to be able to get out there and play as well as he did.   It was a great day and I think the weather bodes well for the next couple of days.

Q.   I thought you drove the ball really well and that set you up today. 
J.J. HENRY:   I think so.   Yeah, I got off to a great start.   I think I was 4â€‘under through four so it kind of set the tone early.   And if you get off to a good start, 1 through 7 and you hang on before you make the turn for home.   So with the weather being so good the greens pretty soft, it's, we knew the scores were going to be low but it's nice to get one yourself and get off to a good start.

Q.   You're one off the lead but as a team you guys are the leaders, you're setting the pace now?
J.J. HENRY:   I don't know what to say.   You need to talk to my partner.   It was awesome.   It was a great day.   I tell you, I was really impressed with the way he played and putted.   It's always fun to play like that.   We played together a long time but to be out here with a good friend and a lot of good memories.   I joked that he's telling me, quiet, quiet.   I said, pards they can't take it away from you.   Regardless of how you play the next couple days, at least you played great today. 
So I got my wife out here and a couple of friend from home so we're having a good time and obviously playing with somebody I enjoy playing with.   So it's all, it's kind of what it's all about this week.
