Q.
J. B. had a steady front nine.  What was it like to kind of watch that?  You knew a lot of people had to go low.
J.J. HENRY:  Well, it was anybody's ballgame there after about nine holes.  Unfortunately, myself, I just couldn't get it going today.  I hit it pretty well, had chances at 1, 2 and 3, just make a birdie, get under par and kind of feed off that.  I just wasn't able to    made my first birdie on 17.

I played pretty solid, just made a couple mistakes, just didn't make enough birdies.  All the credit to J. B.  He played great, especially on the back nine.  To hit that shot on 15 to really seal the deal was great.
Q.  You've got to take a lot of positives out of this.
J.J. HENRY:  Without question.  Personally, too, I seem to never really play well early in the year on the West Coast, so to have a strong finish like this hopefully kind of gets me going.  I'm looking forward to awfully big things for 2006.
Q.  Is there pressure in the way you think out there that he hits it 350?
J.J. HENRY:  Without a doubt.  Ryan and I really are not short, by any means.  It's just obviously kind of amazing to watch.  He's one of those couple guys that for some reason it really doesn't look like he's swinging hard at it but it goes forever.  Obviously on a golf course like this, it's a huge asset.  He played great this week, and he definitely deserved to win.
