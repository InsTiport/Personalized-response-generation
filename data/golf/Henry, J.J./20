Q.   Nice round out there.   Just get some comments. 
J.J. HENRY:   Yeah, actually for two days I'm really striking the ball well.   Very demanding, difficult golf course.   You kind of know what you've got in front of you.   There are some holes where you've got to kind of be careful, and I was able to do that and made a couple putts. 
Yesterday I hit like 17, 18 greens, and maybe four three‑putts.   Other than that, I think I only made one bogey.   So pretty tough golf course.   I'm in a good spot, and I've got to continue hitting the fairway, hitting greens and making a couple putts, and I look forward to the weekend.

Q.   Pretty good conditions out there today.   Maybe a little windier and little more rain on the weekend.   Your thoughts?
J.J. HENRY:   Yeah, it is what it is.   Obviously, this is a great tournament.   Obviously, Mr.Palmer has always been somebody I've always looked up to.   To be here and play good for two rounds, granted, it's only two rounds, but it's nice to be in the hunt for the weekend.

Q.   Any birdies stand out today? 
J.J. HENRY:   I guess I made seven birdies.

Q.   Yeah, a lot of them. 
J.J. HENRY:   So I'm doing something right.   I made a couple good putts and hit it in there close a couple times, took advantage of the par‑5s.   You know, I was patient on the holes where you know you're just trying to make par standing on the tee, and I was able to do that.   So hopefully I can continue to have fun and see what happens.
