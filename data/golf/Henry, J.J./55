  Q.  Regarding his first Masters.   
 J.J. HENRY:  It was a great day.  I got off to a good start.  Whatever happens the rest of the way at least I can say I was on the leaderboard at the Masters.   
 I hung in there and hit a lot of fairways and greens.   
 Being my first Masters, I've played the Ryder Cup and won on TOUR, so it doesn't feel like my first good round.   
 It was nice to be able to just kind of relax a bit now.  I was glad to get off to a good start.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the birdie on 18.   
 J.J. HENRY:  To sneak one in on the last hole and to shoot under par in my first Masters makes it more enjoyable.  I like the fact that I was able to finish under par.  I didn't shoot myself in the foot.  You can't win it on the first day, but you can lose it.   
 My game is suited for a lot of pars.  There is a lot of local knowledge needed here, but I was able to put it in the right position.
