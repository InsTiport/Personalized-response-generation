  Q. Your comments on the round?  
 J.J. HENRY: I hit the ball great starting out. I didn't make any early but then to make six birdies in a row there from I guess starting 15 through 2, then unfortunately Mother Nature kind of had other plans and could never quite get it going after the delay. I hit a couple of shots in the rough and obviously the rough is very wet. It's a great golf course. I grew up about an hour and a half from here so I enjoy playing these type of golf courses. It's a fun place to play, and unfortunately the weather -- hopefully cross our fingers and see what happens the rest of the week.  
 Again to make six birdies on a golf course that you've got to hit some good shots, and unfortunately the three-hour break probably wasn't quite good for me. But again I'm happy. Obviously in a great spot, 4-under par. Can't win it on the first day but you can definitely lose it. Good place to be in and I'll go rest.
