  Q.  Talking about his round.   

 J.J. HENRY:  It's unbelievable how hard it is out there.  The greens got very fast.  Sometimes bogey's a good score.  Scores are bunched up.  Got to hang in there.  Stay patient.  You can have a sand wedge in your hand and can't get it within 30 feet of the hole.   

 Only 2-under par's winning.  Anybody who makes the cut has a chance to win.  That's the way I look at it.   

 It's kind of anybody's ball game.
