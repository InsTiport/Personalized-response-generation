   J.J. HENRY: I drive the ball well. That's what you have to do out here, especially in this wind. If you can drive the ball well, the greens are a little bit receptive. You can get it to start moving. I played really well yesterday.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 J.J. HENRY: I made a great save at 6. Man, what a great place. I mean it's one of the best courses I've ever seen, and I've been fortunate to be a lot of places.   
 The weather is great. It's warm. We've been playing in a lot of cold weather. It's windy. You have to expect that here, being so close to the water, but at least it's warm.   
  
  Q. In the last couple years what kept you from coming?  
 J.J. HENRY: I played Tiger two years ago. Gave a pretty good run there for a while and it was kind of tough, but you know, just kind of -- you can look at it both ways.  You can kind of be moped that you're here because you're not there or you can take advantage of the fact that it's a great event and make the best of it. You could have lost your match yesterday and kind of put back for the week.   
  
  Q. Were you in Arizona?  
 J.J. HENRY: No. Last year I took a couple weeks off. This year I'm actually playing pretty good. I've had a couple good events, I thought.   
 My wife and I were out here Tuesday morning. And played the Pro Am yesterday.   
  
  Q. Didn't do any troubleshooting?  
 J.J. HENRY: No. I'm in pretty good shape. I actually played on Sunday. I played great, kind of a working golf course. I played well yesterday. Playing with some confidence. Hopefully I can keep it going.
