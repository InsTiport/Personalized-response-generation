 Q.   You double bogeyed 7?  
J.J. HENRY:   Yeah.   I hit a bad shot.   It happens, you know.   I thought I was caught in between clubs and I just bailed way right and kind of in the hay, and it was one of those deals.  
   
 Q.   What do you take out of the week, though?   You said you hit a lot of good fairways, a lot of greens.   
J.J. HENRY:   Yeah.   I mean it's obviously positive, you know, to kind of sneak in there and play great yesterday and at least give myself a chance to kind of move up the leaderboard.   Unfortunately it didn't really happen today.  
You know, all in all, obviously this is kind of my fifth major and to be here at home in front of all the people in Connecticut and to, you know, at least to get to play four days and kind of work on some stuff.   
I think I'm close to really popping, so hopefully one of these next three, four weeks I'll kind of poke my head in there and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Are you locked into the next four weeks straight?  
J.J. HENRY:   I'm going to play the next three for sure, yeah.   Kind of depending what happens after that.   
So just kind of continue to go and work on a couple of things and obviously kind of fine tune some of my wedge game and try to work on some of the things with the putting, but other than that, feel pretty good about it.   Can't complain.
