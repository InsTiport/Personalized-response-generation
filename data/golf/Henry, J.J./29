   J.J. HENRY: I birdied the last hole which was a great way to finish what has been an unbelievable day here in Carnoustie. It is a treat to play these courses at any time but with the current weather conditions it is beyond belief. I played in the 2007 Open here so I know the course quite well and also practised here on Wednesday. It's a great old golf course, but you just don't expect to play it like it was today with no wind and such warm sunshine. I've got two suitcases full of wet weather gear, thermal underwear and all sort of stuff but that's all still in the case! In fact, out there on the course today, we were all shedding a layer or two to try to keep cool. I think this tournament is a lot of fun and I enjoy links golf anyway. I've got my wife, Lee, here with me this week too and my amateur partner is also from the States - he's from New York - and we've hit it off this week so it's been good socially as well. It's a great field here this week and a high profile event. I'm looking forward to playing at St Andrews tomorrow and it really will be a great weekend if I can make the cut to play the Old Course again on Sunday.
