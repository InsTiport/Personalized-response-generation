 Q. Couple of quick comments, 13 points today. Great start to the tournament.   
J.J. HENRY: Obviously a great start. Have a lot of neat memories here, winning it back in '12. And I've had a handful of other good finishes. I feel like I've figured out how to play this golf course. It's so cool to be up here in the mountains. Probably the prettiest golf course we play all year. A lot of good vibes.  
This format, it's important to kind of get off to a good start, build that momentum, and take some of the pressure off knowing you have to go out and make birdies. I made seven of them today and one little hiccup, a little 3â€‘putt.   
So I feel pretty good, hit a couple of balls, first off tomorrow morning. Hopefully with a real good greens and less wind, whoever knows what the weather is, maybe expecting more weather, but I'm in a good spot after the first round.  
   
 Q. Other than the bogey coming in, you really turned it on on your back nine today.   
J.J. HENRY: I did. It was a beautiful day to play. A little wind. Kind of overcast skies. It's almost like playing in a dome for a while.   
But this golf course is tricky if the wind blows, you're trying to figure out altitude, kind of tricky poa annua greens; and if the wind blows, it can be tough. I think there's a lot of local knowledge here. I think that's why I played well.
