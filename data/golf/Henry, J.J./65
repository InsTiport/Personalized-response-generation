J.J. HENRY:  I'm really excited.  Stewart and I are good friends, and on top of it I think we're both playing really well.  Obviously Stewart's last couple of events he's really been on form as well as I and we've both had a couple of really good practise days.  Our games are very similar, we're good ball strikers, we hit a lot of greens, and if we make some putts, hopefully we'll be tough to beat.

I'm just really looking forward to playing.  We've been out here, we've had a great week so far, now it's time to go have some fun and play golf.
Q.  Are you familiar at all with who you're playing, Casey and Karlsson?
J.J. HENRY:  Actually I played with Robert last week in Boston, first time I played with him.  Really just a pleasure to be around.  Obviously playing really well himself, and of course Paul is playing really well.  Last week he won the World Match Play.  It will just be a lot of fun.  Again, it's all about the competition and it should be a great challenge.
