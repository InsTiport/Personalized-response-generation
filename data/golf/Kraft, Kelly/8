Q. Entering this week, you had missed four of five of your last cuts and now you're just three off the lead.  What has been the big change for you this week?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, I started off the week getting a lot more balls up-and-down and I've been putting really well this week.  I've been working hard on basically my short game.
I've been hitting it pretty well from the start of the year.  I kind of just wasn't getting anything out of my rounds and wasn't scoring well.  I was putting in the work and my coach just keeps telling me, it's going to pay off of the just hold on.  When it happens, it's going to happen big and so far this week, it's been going pretty good.
Q. They say the process is always part of it but now as you're trying to get that first PGA TOUR win tomorrow, what's going to be the biggest key?  What part of your game has to be firing?
KELLY KRAFT: This is just a golf course where you can't get that aggressive, so you don't want to get too far behind the 8-ball.  I just want to get off to a good start.  You know, just get around, and if you can only hit it to 20 feet, just do that.  Don't short-side yourself an here because it's tough to get balls up-and-down, but when I have missed greens, I've been getting them up-and-down and I'm just going to keep doing the same things.
