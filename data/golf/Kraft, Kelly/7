 Q.  Today 4-under headed into the weekend.  
 What's been the key for you this week?   
KELLY KRAFT: I came in here, came off a good week at Honda.  The game felt good.  I had an off week last week.  I went home and practiced and just kind of doing the same things I've been working on with my coach, doing a bunch of things.  My golf swing, that has really been kind of paying off throughout the whole West Coast but we weren't getting balls up and down when we needed to.   
The last couple weeks I've been able to get the simple ones up and down when you do miss greens.  It's just taking a little stress off my long game.  The putter feels good this week.  The greens are great out here.  Just been kind of rolling it good and kind of going around here.  Don't have to go around and make a bunch of birdies around here.  I like these hard courses where pars are good.   
 Q.  Looks like conditions were a little easier today than they were on Thursday.  What was the difference in your game between yesterday and today?  
KELLY KRAFT: It's funny.  Just golf.  Yesterday my swing felt really well.  I drove it pretty good in the wind.  I had a lot of looks for birdie.  Today I was a little loose out there.  I know what I need to go work on.  I probably need an half hour on the range to figure it out for tomorrow.   
The putter felt better today than it did yesterday and, unfortunately, I had a couple -- I left a couple out there, I thought up and downs, that were some longer pitches but I felt like I could have gotten them up and down.  That's the difference.  I just got to work on my long game and hit a few balls on the range and straighten it up for tomorrow.
