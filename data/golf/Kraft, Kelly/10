Q. Kelly, just get some comments on your round.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, I kind of picked up where I left off yesterday with my ball-striking.  I hit a lot of really good shots.  Hit a lot fairways.  I think I missed two today.
Probably just missed a couple greens.  Had a lot of really good looks from 15, 12, 15 feet.  Just couldn't quite get those in there.  Just go work on that and hopefully just continue it this weekend with a couple more putts.
Q. How were the conditions out there this morning?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, they were nice.  The greens were receptive.  Warming up it was kind of misting and a little gusty.  I'm going, Man, I hope we didn't get the bad draw here.
But once we got out to No. 10 it calmed down and was probably only blowing five.  There was a little dew on the greens this morning so you had to play for a little skid, but other than that it was nice.
Q. Playing with Pat and also with Xander, they were also making good shots.  Was that at all motivation to play at a high level?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah.  We've all hit it pretty well the last couple days, so we were just able to feed off each other.  I mean, Xander made everything yesterday; he made a lot of putts.
The group just kind of gets in a good form and just it's easier to hit good shots like that.
Q. Kelly, you're in good shape - 56 in the FedExCup -- but I know you want to keep rising.  Just comment a little bit about your goals heading down the stretch.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, I had a couple good weeks earlier in the year and kind of helped free me up a little bit.  I've been able to work on my game a little more and try to make a couple changes for the better.
Now I feel like they're really coming together this week for kind of the first time since I guess ZÃ¼rich.  So it's nice to see definitely.  Just going to continue.
