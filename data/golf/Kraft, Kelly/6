Q. Kelly, 64 on the day.  But the 8th and the 9th, that saving par putt on the 8th, and then you put it in there really close on 9 too?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, that was nice.  Just that putt I had on No. 8 was the fastest putt I had all day by five feet.  My caddie told me it was fast, and I still hit it seven feet by or however far it was.  It's always nice to have a little tap-in, stress-free on the last hole, so it was nice.
Q. Your second appearance at this championship.  You were here last year as well and tied for fifth.  What is it about this layout that just fits your game pretty much?
KELLY KRAFT: I don't know.  You know, I just feel like coming into the greens I have a lot of clubs that are just kind of good for my game.  Kind of a lot of shorter irons and wedges, and I've been working on those.  I remember coming in here last year and hit a lot of good ones, a lot of really close shots and having a lot of work.  So it's just something about it.
I love the way it looks off the tee too.  It's just one of those courses that everybody's got a few of them throughout the year, and this just happens to be one of mine.
Q. Tell our listeners about the experience of being at The Greenbrier.  Not only the championship event, but everything that comes with it?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, it's awesome.  It's kind of like a throwback in time.  You've got all the crazy colors and the restaurants and you've got the casino downstairs.  The place is huge.  It's kind of a little bit of a throwback, and it's nice to -- it's just really classy.  You don't get that at a lot of resorts anymore, old-school classy.  It's a fun one for sure.
Q. You didn't have to gamble today with that 64.  Well done, Kelly.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, thanks a lot.
