Q. What a strong finish.  I thought you were going to birdie all three of the last three holes.  Birdie at 16 and 17 and including a kick-in there at 16.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, it was kind of a battle all day long.  I didn't make anything all day.  I hit the ball really well, I had a lot of chances and just the putter went ice cold today.
Q. You in fact led the tournament strokes gained tee to green.  Certainly something for you to build on as you go forward with the rest of the summer.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, absolutely.  My game feels great, I'm going to play next week at John Deere.  Looks like I'm going to come up one short of getting in the British Open, but my game feels good and fifth place this week is a good job.
