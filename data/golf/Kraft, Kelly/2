 Q.  Obviously six birdies and a bogey.  If you take that bogey away obviously a really good round.  Still a good round.  Tell us about your first round here.  
KELLY KRAFT: No, it was good.  Made kind of one mistake.  Hit pretty much every fairway, I think.   
I just didn't hit my wedges that good.  Had a lot of looks, but need to get those wedges a little bit closer.   
Made a bogey on 17, the par-5.  Hit a perfect cut shot in there, what I thought was perfect, and it kicked out of the bunker.  It was still a good shot.  I just hit a terrible shot over the green and I bogeyed there.   
Other than that, it was pretty good.  Made some good putts, and hopefully tomorrow can hit the wedges a little closer and maybe get a couple more.   
 Q.  Satisfied with the number at least?  
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, definitely.  I felt like I played better than 5-under today.  Felt like I could've -- I didn't really capitalize on, like I said, couple of those wedge shots.   
It was definitely a -- I mean, I'm not complaining; 5-under is a good score, so...   
 Q.  Things to build on for tomorrow?  
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, definitely.  The putter feels great still coming from last week; it felt pretty good.   
The greens are kind of rolling kind of like they were in the first couple rounds last week, so pretty comfortable with those.  I made a lot of putts on those and made some good putts today on the front nine, which was the back nine.   
No, it was good.  Looking forward to tomorrow.
