 Q.  Overall, one shot off the lead heading into the weekend, just talk about your round today and how you're feeling heading into the weekend?  
KELLY KRAFT: I played a lot better than 1-under today.  I played pretty solid.  I didn't make many putts.  Felt like I gave four shots away there at the end with a double on 14 and then a bogey on 18 there.   
But it was a good day, and I just take the momentum into tomorrow.  I'm playing really well.  Greens got a little crusty there at the end, and it was tough to make putts.  But happy with the day.   
 Q.  How tough is it to just keep that focus, especially with the heat bearing down and the wind blowing and swirling?  
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, pars are good, really.  You've got to play for a lot of bounce out here with how dry it is, and I've been making aggressive swings with some conservative lines.   Can't go at every pin.  Sometimes you've got to aim away from it with a wedge, and I've been doing a pretty good job of leaving the ball in the right spot so far.   
 Q.  Was any part of you expecting this kind of weather in Canada?  
KELLY KRAFT: No.  I mean, I had no idea it was going to be this windy.  It's like the windiest tournament we've had all year so far.   
It's fun to play a firm and fast course and I think that these types of courses are the ones I play the best on, so looking forward to the weekend.
