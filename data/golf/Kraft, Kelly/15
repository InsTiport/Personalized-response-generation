Q. Great round of golf, I thought those scramble saves were brilliant at the end?
KELLY KRAFT: It was getting windy towards the end.  It's tough when you miss greens because it's so firm.  The ground that you have to play, you have to play a different shot than just coming out of the softer rough.
Q. Talk about the difference from the valley, the back side, and when you come up here; is that when the wind hit you?
KELLY KRAFT: Down in the valley it swirls a lot, but the wind definitely picked up once we made the turn.  Get a couple of those par 5s downwind down in there the valley and I was able to take advantage of that.
But you get up here and it seems like a lot of crosswinds and some weird numbers with wind swirling.  It's just a little different.
Q. Good to have four birdies on the card, and an eagle?
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, I kind of strung something together on the back nine coming down the stretch there.  But it was good.  I was glad to only make one bogey on the front side and one bogey for the day is pretty good.
Q. Take me through the eagle, if you can.
KELLY KRAFT: Yeah, so it was a perfect wind for me because it was down and from the right.  I hit driver.  Hit it great and it just kind of rode the wind down there.  I had a -- I was going to hit a 9-iron in there but the wind kind of switched and it died.  I think I had 178 hole and I ended up hitting an 8, which was a perfect number, and I hit it just left of the hole there.  It was kind of a delicate one down the hill and I felt the speed on it and made it.
