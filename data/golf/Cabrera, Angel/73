   ANGEL CABRERA:  To start with a 2 at Wentworth was fantastic.  I hit a 3-wood and an 8-iron from 173 yards and it went straight into the hole.  That was a great way to start.   
 I think 2 was my favourite number today, because I also birdied the 5th and the 10th.  I hit a 7-iron to three feet at the fifth, and then 8-iron to 25 feet at the 10th.  These all helped the scorecard.   
 It was a very good round today, and I managed to keep the ball in play, which is very much the key around this course.  I would have to say first of all, that Wentworth was very similar to a lot of the courses we play in Argentina where driving is the key.  Actually, I didn't use the driver that much today.  It was a 3-wood or an iron.  I think I only hit driver at No. 3, 9, 12 and 17.  You have to really keep the ball in position on this course.  That is the main thing to make a good score.   
 I was very lucky to win here two years ago.  It meant an awful lot to me, but it's in the past now, and I'm enjoying the chance of being in perfect position for the weekend after that 66.  It feels very good.  To make 6-under is very good on a very tough course.   
 I played here last year with lots of changes to the course, and I played well, but I couldn't finish my final round so good.   
 Wentworth is great.  I always loved coming here.  It seems to bring out the best in me.
