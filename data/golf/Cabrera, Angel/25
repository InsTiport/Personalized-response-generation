 Q. It was a difficult day how satisfying was it to get that?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, first of all I wasn't really happy about it, about my round, but when I saw when I came inside and I saw I was making the cut then I was happy about it. 

 Q. Did you know how important that putt was on 18?
 ANGEL CABRERA: No, I thought that if I made that putt I was going to be out. 

 Q. The 13th hole and the 17th hole in particular had been difficult this week, what's happened on those holes?
 ANGEL CABRERA: On the 13th hole I just hit a bad tee shot on both days. 
 On the 17th hole I made 3-putts.

 Q. You were 3-under at one point through 12 holes on Thursday. I know that making the cut isn't very satisfying, but do you feel like maybe you have a second chance on the weekend?
 ANGEL CABRERA: I'm just going to, I'm very far off the lead, but I'm just going to try to make the most of this and try to make a good tournament during the weekend.
