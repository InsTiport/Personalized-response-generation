   ANGEL CABRERA: This is the first time in my life I've placed 39 holes. I'm happy because I fought until the end.  
 Golf is like that, and in a playoff, there can only be a winner, and I had to lose.  
 I feel well, but a little bit tired, and tomorrow I will play again. I think 15 has been the decisive hole today. Ross had a very difficult putt and he holed it, and I missed it.  
 On 16, I had a chance to win, but I didn't.
