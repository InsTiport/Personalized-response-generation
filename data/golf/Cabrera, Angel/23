 Q. How was it out there today? Are you pleased with your round?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, it was a very good round, I was hitting the ball very well today and I'm very happy now with the outcome. 

 Q. Any big key to your round today that went well for you?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I was very good off the tee here today and it is very important. On this course that's very important. 

 Q. The conditions out there? The conditions of the course?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Absolutely perfect. There was a little wind, but the greens are soft, so it was perfect conditions. 

 Q. Do you think that this setup -- how can you explain so many guys going under par today?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, yeah, it's the first day and the course is playing fair, relatively easy, but there's still many days to go and I'm sure the course is going to get more complicated. 

 Q. Is it fun seeing everybody make a lot of birdies out there today?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, of course it's a lot of fun to be able to make a lot of birdies. Because this is a course that can penalize you a lot if it's setup difficult. So it's a lot of fun to be able to make birdies.
