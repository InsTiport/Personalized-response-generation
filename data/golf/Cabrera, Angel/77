Q.  It looks like Tiger Woods and Ernie Els and maybe Jim Furyk are all gone out of the tournament, makes it a strange day in the championship?
ANGEL CABRERA:  No, I don't think it's strange because everybody plays here and everyone has a chance to win here.
Q.  And what of your chances now?
ANGEL CABRERA:  I think that the way I'm playing, I can go further on in this tournament.
Q.  And that would be something obviously you would want to do over the weekend, is 36 holes each day, is 36 holes a strain for you?
ANGEL CABRERA:  It's a bit tiring.  Playing 36 holes, yeah, is definitely a bit tired.

But I feel okay and I do this for a living, so I manage.
Q.  You like the golf course?
ANGEL CABRERA:  Yes, and I won here last year.
