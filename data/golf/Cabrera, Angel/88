ANGEL CABRERA:  Obviously I'm pleased to be ahead at lunchtime because I knew when I saw the draw, that I would face one of the toughest matches today KJ is a great player and came back at me this morning, but I was pleased with my own play and hopefully I can carry on the same this afternoon. It will be a long day, but will be worth it if I come through a winner.
