 Q.   Good round today.   
ANGEL CABRERA:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   What clicked in on the back side?   Something clicked in, didn't it?  
ANGEL CABRERA:   Well, I did very well off the tee on my first shots and I was able to leave my second shots closer to the pin, so I was able to make some birdies.   
   
 Q.   Yesterday the conditions were such that a lot of people thought they were easier.   Today they were much, much harder, you shot so much better, can you explain why?  
ANGEL CABRERA:   For me Augusta is never easy.   Never, ever easy.   The big difference was that the back nine I was hitting very well off the tee, leaving my second shots close, and I was able to make some birdies.   
   
 Q.   Many people thought that the wind was a big factor today.   How much did you think that it was?  
ANGEL CABRERA:   Certainly, I mean, when the wind is tough, it gets tougher on this course.   But I played with wind very much, I'm used to playing with the wind in Europe when I played in Europe.   So I'm not going to say that this is an advantage necessarily for me, but I like playing with wind.   
   
 Q.   Do you like to see these conditions for the next two days, because being a former champion, you're much more familiar with how this golf course plays.   
ANGEL CABRERA:   If it is like this, with sunny and windy, it will be perfect.   But whatever comes, I mean everybody's going to play the same.   
   
 Q.   What about the pin placements?   How were they today?  
ANGEL CABRERA:   There were some pins that were very, very tough.   But the rain helped a little bit to go for those pins.
