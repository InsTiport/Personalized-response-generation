 Q.  3-under par today, first time here in Maui.  How do you like it? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I was very, very comfortable with the course.  I hit the ball very well the whole round, and I'm happy. 

 Q.  How was it with the weather out there?  A little bit different than I'm sure you expected here in Hawaii? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yes, for me it's not a problem because it's the first time I've played the course and it's wet, so the problem will be for the other guys that are used to playing it running. 

 Q.  So I guess not knowing was good for you? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, perfect.  I played the course like it is and it's so new for me, so it's working well. 

 Q.  As the U.S. Open champ what did you do in the off-season?  And what has it been like for you now being Angel Cabrera, U.S. Open champion? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  My life has changed a little bit only in the professional thing.  I'm still the same guy I was before.  I haven't had much of a break yet.  I'm going to have a little break after here, and I cannot tell you about my off-season because I haven't got it yet.
