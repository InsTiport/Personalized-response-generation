 Q. None of the guys that started the day at the top of the leaderboard have managed to pull away. How encouraged are you by that? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: No, no, I'm not surprised. This is the Masters. This is Augusta, so this is a tough day, third day, and you've got to play at a major like this. 

 Q. What was the difference today compared to your first two rounds? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: I took advantage of what I had. I hit the ball very well, but also I took advantage. Maybe the other two days I hit it good and didn't take advantage as I did today.

 Q. A lot of young guys on the leaderboard. How do you think your experience helps you tomorrow? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: Obviously I'm playing my 12th Masters, I've won here before, it's very special, but at the end of the day it's very important what I can do tomorrow starting my game. 

 Q. Do you take another mindset into tomorrow? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: You've got to see how it evolves, how everybody is playing, how the weather is, and depending on that, then you start making decisions on what kind of strategy you're going to use.
