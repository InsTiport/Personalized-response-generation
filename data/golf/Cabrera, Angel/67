 Q.  Can you say anything in English about how you feel winning this tournament? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: I feel great. It's a great moment for me. I can't believe it. 

 Q.  Held off one of the best players in the world, too. 
  ANGEL CABRERA: No, no, no. I beat everybody, not only him. 

 Q.  What was it like sitting there waiting? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: I was definitely feeling nervous, but I assumed that this is the same sensation everybody was having in my place. 

 Q.  What are they doing in Argentina right now? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: I don't know, but I hope they're enjoying it and this is for them. 

 Q.  What was your mental state during that round?  We saw you joking, taking a few puffs.  You seemed to be relaxed out there. 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I have a lot of bad moments on the golf course in my life, and now I have decided to take this more easily. 

 Q.  Where will the trophy go? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: With me, in my bed. It's going to sleep with me. 

 Q.  The final holes coming up, did you think Tiger would make birdie on one of those holes? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, Tiger can birdie any hole. He's the No. 1. 

 Q.  Did you ever dream of a moment like this when you were caddying back in Argentina? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: No, no, I never thought that this was possible. 

 Q.  Given that Tiger can always make birdie, did you start thinking about a playoff? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: No, no. I was going to finish the day and start thinking about the playoff tomorrow. 

 Q.  How difficult was this course compared to the others you've played? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Last year was also 5-over par at Winged Foot. 



 So all U.S. Open courses are difficult.  This one is, also. 

 Q.  Did you watch the U.S. Open growing up in Argentina? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I watched all the majors on TV when I was a kid, and I never thought I would be here at this moment. 
  It is very difficult to describe this moment. Probably tomorrow when I wake up with this trophy beside me in my bed, I will realize that I have won the U.S. Open. 

 Q.  What were you and Tiger and Jim joking about there on the green during the ceremony? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: I was telling Tiger that he's going to be a local at the Torrey Pines next year, so he should win there. 

 Q.  How will you celebrate tonight? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Don't know yet but we're going to celebrate someplace, I don't know. I have some friends here. 

 Q.  Who did you admire growing up? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Ballesteros. 

 Q.  What was the hardest shot, the most difficult shot you hit today? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Teeing off on 18, I think that was the most difficult moment and tee shot of the day. 

 Q.  Why? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Because there was a lot of pressure at that time and I had to put that ball in the fairway and make 4 and sit and wait. 

 Q.  How does it feel, winning your first major? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I've been looking forward to winning a major. I lost the British Open very close once, and I was close also in Augusta. So definitely enjoying this moment. 

 Q.  When you were close in Augusta; what year was that, 2001?  And what did that do for your confidence? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Well, it was definitely good for my confidence that I know I can do it.
