  Q. If they would have told you at the beginning of the week that that was the number that you were going to post, would you have been happy with that number?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, at the beginning of the week it would have been, yes, a very good number. But then after the week I had and hitting the ball the way I did, then it's probably a high number.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about -- it's been crazy. Have you ever seen anything like this at the Masters?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, yes, it has been like that. Even the year that I won it was crazy, Mickelson and Tiger playing that well and, yeah, it was, it seemed like this.   
  
  Q. When you got to 10, what are your thoughts when you're 10-under?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, I was all the time thinking that 12-under was going to be the number. I was talking to my son and I was telling him that 12-under is the number.   
  
  Q. Did the heat bother you at all?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: No, no, it didn't, it never really bothered me. This is for everybody the same and it didn't really bother me.   
  
  Q. Did you feel sorry for Rory out there? Is it hard to see a competitor go through that?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, it's not that I feel sorry for him, because it has happened to many players and it can happen to anyone, it can happen to me, and it's just tough.   
 It's a pity what happened to him and I told him when we finished that he's very young and he can win this tournament many times.
