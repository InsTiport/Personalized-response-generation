   GORDON SIMPSON:  Okay, everybody, well, Angel, congratulations.  Your first HSBC Match Play Final, and we all know what Michael Campbell did when we won the U.S. Open two years ago.  Are you ready to win now? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, thank you very much.  I'm very happy to be playing tomorrow in the finals, and if I keep on my form, let's try to take the trophy home. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  It looks like you're playing Ernie; is that the game that you look forward to? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  It doesn't matter who I play with.  They are both world-class players, both Ernie and Henrik, so whoever comes, I have to play my best to beat them tomorrow.  

 Q.  After 2005 and watching you win the BMW, Ernie did a lot of redesign of this course, but you've proved that way the course is, you can play it; yes? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, I just managed to play well the way the course is, not because I'm striking the ball well.  If you're not driving the ball straight, the course is very difficult. 

 Q.  Were you playing well coming into this week, or have you found some form here? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I've been hitting the ball very well, especially two weeks ago in the Presidents Cup and it was match play there, and I played well.  So I had very high confidence coming into this week. 

 Q.  Have you played with Hunter Mahan before, and were you impressed with the way he came back this afternoon? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, I just played with him over at Augusta when he was an amateur, and it didn't surprise me at all, his performance today, because he's a great player and he's having a great year. 

 Q.  What would you do with a million pounds? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I don't know.  Put it in the bank.  (Shaking head, laughing). 

 Q.  Celebrate with some red wine? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, sure. 

 Q.  Have you played in the same group as Ernie before?  I'm sure you have, but what is your relationship with Ernie? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I have a really good relationship with Ernie.  We played together as partners in the Presidents Cup and I have played many times with him.  He's a great gentleman and a great player, and a good friend. 

 Q.  How concerned were you as Hunter was coming back at you today? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, I just tried to stay focused.  I was hitting the ball well, and he came back, because he just started making putts and making birdies.  I knew that I couldn't win and I just managed to stay calm, and I did it. 

 Q.  Going back to the BMW here, do you think you are a more disciplined golfer now than you were then? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Absolutely, every year that goes by, we get more experience and more maturity. 
 GORDON SIMPSON:  We look forward to seeing you in the final tomorrow.
