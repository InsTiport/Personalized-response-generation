ANGEL CABRERA:  It has been a good spell since winning at Wentworth, even although I haven't played quite as well as I did during the BMW Championship. I am still hitting the ball solidly my long iron play was very good today.

I played well today and I really like the course although I can't understand why I haven't done better here. I don't think I've ever been in the top ten before. It seems that my friend, Romero, is the Argentine player who knows how to play this course! He won her a few years ago and I would love to be able to win also. It's a great way to prepare for the Open in a very nice place where you can relax, even although it's not on a links golf course.

I enjoyed the US Open, but it's a difficult course to score well on and last week at The K Club I was not happy to shoot 69 on Saturday then 79 on Sunday. That put me a long way back, but there were a lot of players who struggled as well on Sunday.

Today I was very pleased with my iron play, especially the five iron shot at the 17th hole. I only had a putt of a metre, which was my best today.
