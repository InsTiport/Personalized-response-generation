Every player likes to come back where he has won.THE MODERATOR: Questions.Q. I can't quite remember the shot you holed out last year, what hole it was, but you'll probably be in a position like that again.  Is it possible to duplicate that kind of shot and just, you know, try remember what you did last time?ANGEL CABRERA: You can always repeat something in this sport.Q. (In English. )  Angel, What do you think about the big hotel up there?  Almost looks like the White House.  You ever see a joint like that?ANGEL CABRERA: No.  Not yet.Q. (In English.)  What do you expect this time around?  Usually takes a lot of birdies here, a basketful, to win this thing.  You see the same type of deal?ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, yes, and I've been working very hard to get to this point and I'm prepared.  I'm ready to go.  I worked very hard.Q. (In English.)  How much pressure do you feel as a defending champion as opposed to last year coming into the tournament?ANGEL CABRERA: I've never had pressure.  Wouldn't have had pressure if I hadn't won it.  I'm under no pressure.
