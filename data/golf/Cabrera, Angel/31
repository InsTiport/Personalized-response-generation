  Q. How do you feel to take out Rory McIlroy, one of the best young players in the world?   
 ANGEL CABRERA: Well, they are all great players. I was good enough today to be playing better than Rory, but that was just it. All of them are great players here.  
  
  Q. What particularly pleased you about your play today?   
 ANGEL CABRERA: On the back nine I played very well off the tee and made a few putts which were important.   
  
  Q. You've come close to winning this championship before do you feel like it could be your year?  
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, that would be very nice. I feel very comfortable and confident, and I've been looking for a victory on a tournament like this for a long time.
