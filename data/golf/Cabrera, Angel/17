Q.   Angel, first of all, we would like to have your thoughts on today's round. 
ANGEL CABRERA:   Well, it was a really good round for me.   Although I started with a birdie at the ten which was my first, the following few holes were a little tough for me. 
But I played really well on the last nine and I'm happy about the way I struck the ball.

Q.   What did you do best today?
ANGEL CABRERA:   I hit it really well off the tee, and then I sunk a few critical putts and that was key for a round like this.

Q.   Regarding your game, how do you feel for the rest of the week?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Well, I feel really well.   I have been striking the ball really well over the last few weeks and I am really comfortable with my swing.

Q.   How about today's pairing with Andres Romero and Camilo Villegas, did it help?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Yeah.   I had a really good time with them.   They are really good friends, so we enjoyed a lot and had lots of fun out there on the course.
