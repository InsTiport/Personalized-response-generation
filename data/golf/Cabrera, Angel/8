  THE MODERATOR:   Great round by Angel, highlighted by 20 putts.   How would you rate that first round?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   I had a really good first round.   I played very well on the greens, and I saved myself on the holes that I didn't play so well.   
   
 Q.   It's a big golf course, Angel, and it's going to hold a Major Championship in a few years.   Is this a course that you feel fits your game?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   I cannot actually say that but it was a very first good round, and we have a lot to go.   
   
 Q.   Well played, 6â€‘under par, nice stretch of holes, 4 birdies in a row.   
ANGEL CABRERA:   It was a really good first round.   I played really good the greens, and I felt good, a little bit.   
   
 Q.   How do you like the changes to the golf course?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   I think that the changes are really good and on the 16th hole, it's a really good change.   
   
 Q.   Good hole today, in your putting?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   I put everything on the hole and felt really good about it.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the golf course and how it was this morning.   
ANGEL CABRERA:   This morning it was really, really well, and not so much wind, so I play good golf.   
   
 Q.   How do you like how the course is playing with the new grass on the greens?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   Last year it wasn't so much grass.   This year I think the greens are really good.   
   
 Q.   Angel, on 13 and 14 you had to make some really big par saves, very good putts.   Was that as much a key as that birdie stretch before?   
ANGEL CABRERA:   On 13 and 14th I saved myself so that helped me with the score.   
   
 Q.   Looked like on 18 you had to work magic on the second shot.   
ANGEL CABRERA:   I was lucky.   I saw the hole and put it on the green.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
