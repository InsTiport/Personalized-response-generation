Q.   65, nice playing.   Do you want to just talk about your round? 
ANGEL CABRERA:   Well, it was a great round.   I really hit very good iron shots and also made some good putts. 

Q.   Any highlights? 
ANGEL CABRERA:   No, not really, just played as well as I played yesterday and very solid and not‑‑ just taking advantage of the opportunities I had. 

Q.   Early in the day, did that help you out, the conditions? 
ANGEL CABRERA:   The greens are better in the morning, so that helps.

Q.   Did you have any wind out there? 
ANGEL CABRERA:   No, not really, it was perfect conditions this morning.
