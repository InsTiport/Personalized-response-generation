  Q. Overall thoughts on the round, as it's the first for a few weeks.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I am really happy to be back on The European Tour. I was looking forward to getting back to Europe and this was my first round since the US Open.   
  
  Q. But overall were you happy with the way you played given the time away?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  No not happy. I hit some poor shots today and I am not pleased with one over.   
  
  Q. Was it purely down to rustiness from not hitting many balls?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Not really. I just happened to hit the ball badly today.   
  
  Q. A great run of four birdies from the seventh. Can you talk about that?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I hit some better shots on those holes and made some putts. I only hit four fairways all day and they were the holes I birdied.   
  
  Q. Can you talk a bit about the reaction of the crowd today. I heard you get a great round of applause as you walked from the 18th?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I am a human being and when people cheer for me I feel great. It was pleasing.
