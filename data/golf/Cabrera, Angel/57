   GORDON SIMPSON:  Okay, everyone, well we have Angel here, the winner today, and Eddie, you're going to translate for us I'm sure.  But Angel, 10-under par today, great golf.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Thank you very much.  Yes, I had a great day.  I hit the ball very, very well and I just made crucial putts at crucial moments, very, very good.   
 GORDON SIMPSON:  You said yesterday, bring on anyone, play anyone; you feel so good.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, I feel comfortable, but if I were to win the tournament, you've got to beat everybody.   
  
  Q.  You made a good start today defeating the defending champion, Paul Casey.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, well, Paul is a great, great player and I stayed focused all day.  I broke through and I'm the lucky one.   
  
  Q.  Is this the perfect stage for you being a fast player and being able to play at your own pace?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Not really.  Match play, you have to play a little bit your opponent's rhythm, as well.  But Paul is a fast player, as well, and we got in a good rhythm.   
  
  Q.  Both of you seem to be really enjoying, certainly this morning, a lot of laughs between each other and playing great golf; does that help when you're playing to feel so relaxed?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, in the morning, it's more like to stay on the match, you can't win the match in the morning.  It helped that we relax and played well, but the main thing is the afternoon.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel that you need another big win in a tournament like this to consolidate what you achieved at the U.S. Open?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, we always need to win big tournaments and this is a course that I love.  I like this tournament.  I feel very comfortable around this course and I will try to keep going like this.   
  
  Q.  At the 10th hole this afternoon after Paul made par 3, you chipped in; is that like a killer blow?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, that was a big turnaround point.  I thought I had the whole lost, and all of a sudden I got a halve and it felt like a win.   
  
  Q.  With Ernie Els going well on the other side of the draw; can you talk about the possibility of that prospect?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I've got to win tomorrow and Ernie has to win tomorrow.  We'll talk about that tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Are you a rugby fan, and had you been watching the match?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  No.   
  
  Q.  You don't play rugby, a big man like you?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  No.  I play golf.   
  
  Q.  Maybe you played rugby, too, when you were a boy.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  No.   
  
  Q.  Padraig Harrington was worried about how winning a major might affect him in the months afterwards.  Is that sort of in your mind, as well?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, you know, I feel the same way.  It's very complicated to hang on after a win especially after meeting with all of the media and a lot of things and all of the questions that have been asked; yeah, I think so.   
  
  Q.  Is there a course you prefer to Wentworth?  Is it a better course for you?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, there's good courses on The European Tour.  This is definitely one of my favourites, but there are a lot of good golf courses.   
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Maybe Oakmont.   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  That's not in Europe.  (Laughter)   
 GORDON SIMPSON:  Thank you very much.
