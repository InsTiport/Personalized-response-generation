  Q.  Great playing today; six birdies on the front?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, I played very, very well, especially the front nine, and I think that's what made the difference.  And then I just started on the back nine.   
  
  Q.  You made six birdies right there pretty quick.  Were there any turning points?  Was there anything out there that might have moved you one direction or another?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  No, not really.  It was just the way it went for the front nine.  No crucial points on the front nine.   
  
  Q.  How about the match play format; is this something that's fun for you?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, it's a different style of play.  I don't play this type of match play a lot, just twice a year, once a year, but I enjoy it.   
  
  Q.  How about the golf course?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  The course is perfect.  The greens are very, very good and very fast.  It's just perfect conditions to play well.
