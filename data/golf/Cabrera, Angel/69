 Q.  Feeling good about your position?

 Q.  How much harder do you think the course can get compared to the past two days? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, definitely, if it's not going to rain it's going to be much harder, and the whole thing is it's going to be hard for everybody.

 I don't want to make comparisons, but definitely a very, very tough course.

  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I know him. I know Bubba. Definitely looking forward to playing with him tomorrow, and he's the one that I have to play anyway, so, but trying to have a good time tomorrow.
