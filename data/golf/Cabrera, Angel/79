RODDY WILLIAMS:  Angel, well played again, a year on and you're back at the top of the leaderboard once again.  Talk us through your day today.
ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, it was a good day.  I was hitting the ball pretty solid during the whole round, and I was also able to make 30 putts which is very good for me right now.  That was important.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  The course has changed quite a lot since last time, since a year ago when you won, has that made much difference to you?
ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, it didn't feel very much different because I was hitting the ball well today.  So I couldn't really feel the difference.  I was able to be out of trouble all the time so that was good.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Could I get the details of your birdies?
ANGEL CABRERA:  Birdie 4, driver, to the right rough, laid up with a 9 iron, and lob wedge and a putt from 15 to 20 feet.

Then I birdied 10.  7 iron and a putt of 12 feet.

11, driver, 9 iron and a putt for 25 to 30 feet.

12, driver, 3 wood, and a chip and the putt from nine feet.

18, driver, 3 iron, and two putts from 20, 25 feet.

3, bogey, driver, pitching wedge over the green, chipped and I made the putt from seven, eight feet.
Q.  Do you find it much more difficult this year with the changes?
ANGEL CABRERA:  If you don't hit the ball very well, you will feel the difference, but today I was able to hit the ball very well so I couldn't really feel the difference.  But it's much more difficult right now the golf course that's for sure.
