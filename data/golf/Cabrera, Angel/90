MARIA ACACIA:  Very good playing, 68.
ANGEL CABRERA:   Yes, it was a very good round, this third round.  I think I've got a very good chance for tomorrow.

I feel very comfortable on this golf course.  I have always said that, and I like it very much.
Q.  Why the difference from last week?
ANGEL CABRERA:   This is not an excuse, don't take it like that, but I wasn't feeling well.  I was feeling quite ill last week, and on Friday, I went out in the afternoon matches and that got me really bad and I wasn't feeling well to play the following day.
Q.  What was the problem?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Bit of a flu.
Q.  You have pledged yourself to the European Tour, and what would it mean winning the flagship event on the European Tour?
ANGEL CABRERA:   It will mean to go a very, very high step forward in my golfing career.  To win the PGA would mean a lot to me.  It's such a big event and to us it is the most important event after the British Open.

MARIA ACACIA:  Let's go over the details.
ANGEL CABRERA:  Missed the green on the second.  Hit in the bunker, two meter, two putts for bogey.

Birdie 4th, driver, 5-iron, ten meters, two putts.

7, bogey with 3-wood.  Missed green, 9-iron approach, three meters, two putts.

8, birdie, 3-iron, pitching wedge and eight-meter putt.

10, birdie, 8-iron, 3 1/2 meters putt.

11, birdie, driver, lob-wedge to two meters.

The eagle on the 12th, driver, 7-iron, five meters.
Q.  17 and 18, no chances?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Yeah, but I missed from two on the 17th and seven, eight meters on the 18th.
Q.  You weren't on the green on the 18th then?
ANGEL CABRERA:   No.
Q.  But your drive was in the rough?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Fairway bunker.
Q.  Which player do you most fear tomorrow?
ANGEL CABRERA:   Cabrera.  (Laughter.)
