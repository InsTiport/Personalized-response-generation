 Q.  Well played.  Good win.  Just your thoughts on the win.  It was a tough game and you came through it. 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Well, thank you.  I just hit the ball very, very well all day.  I played very, very well.  I won.  I'm happy about that.  I played really well. 

 Q.  Anything particularly good today that you're pleased with? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  Yeah, I think off the tee.  I played very, very well off the tee.  That helps a lot on this course if you hit it well off the tee, it's a lot easier. 

 Q.  How do you feel, do you play the course regardless or do you watch the man or do you do a bit of both? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I try to play my game on my ball.  I don't look at the opponent or the course.  If I play well then most likely I win. 

 Q.  Any key holes, any that you thought maybe this is going to be your day? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  I just play well and I made a few putts when I needed to.  It was just the way it went. 

 Q.  Do you look ahead, do you look through your bracket to see who you're playing next and on and on or do you just look at the next match? 
 ANGEL CABRERA:  You've got to beat every one if you are to win the tournament.  So I'm not speculating on who I'm going to play next; whoever it is I try to win.
