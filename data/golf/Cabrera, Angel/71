 Q.  Happy with your round? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, a very good round, always tough to par in the U.S. Open, it's very good. 

 Q.  How is the golf course playing today? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, the golf course is playing much easier because of the rain yesterday. The greens are softer and that's why there are some scores below par. 

 Q.  Would you consider this a difficult course? 
  ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, definitely a very difficult course, and you have to play, you know, taking care every single time and you don't have to get so confident here.

 ANGEL CABRERA:  Very, very happy.
