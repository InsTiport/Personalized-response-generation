ANGEL CABRERA:   I started the round well, although nothing happened in the first holes.  Then I eagled the 4TH with an 8 iron to five meters, but had a bogey on the following one, because I missed the green.

Two more birdies in a row on 6 and 7 from 12 feet.  I was 3 under for the day after nine holes.

I was playing well, feeling very comfortable, but Drummond was playing very, very well.  I eagled the 12th with a 6 iron to 15 feet.  A bogey came on the 14th where again, I missed the green.

Another birdie at the 17th but by then, the tournament was in Drummond's hands.  I have been feeling very comfortable all week, playing very well, and really willing to do well to perform well.  I am happy with my 67, very happy, but somebody made me a 64 to win.

It's the second time that I have been runner up in this event.  To me, one of the biggest events that we play.
