  Q.  Can you just talk about your day?   
 ANGEL CABRERA:  After we bogeyed hole No. 8, we couldn't score any more birdies.  It was tough.  We had a tough time with the putter, both of us.  But, well, things will be different tomorrow and we'll try to do our best to win the Cup.   
 ANDRES ROMERO:  Yes, the bogey on hole No. 8 was a turning point and then we had a lot of chances after that, but we couldn't get it going.   
 We are close.  One stroke, it's not very much, we are sure of that.  We are going to fight for the Cup.
