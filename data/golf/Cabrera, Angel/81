ANGEL CABRERA:  I was on the 14th tee doing a practice swing and suddenly I felt pain in my wrist.  I called the physio and I could not play that hole. I left Ricardo on his own to do it.  The physio gave me some gel on my arm and gave me an Advil.  After that 15, I kept on playing, but being very careful and not forcing it at all.

It doesn't hurt right now, but I am going to the physio again after lunch to get some more help.

We had a very poor round today.  We did not play that bad, but we only managed to make one birdie on the first nine.  Honestly, I think it should have been three shots less.
