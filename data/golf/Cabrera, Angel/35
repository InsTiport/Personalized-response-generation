 ANGEL CABRERA: I'm very happy with where I am. I'm real happy with my swing, and I'm real happy with my game right now.   
  
  Q. Talk about the 18th hole.   
 ANGEL CABRERA: I hit a bad tee shot and really didn't have a chance to go for the green with where the ball ended up. I hit a pitching wedge, sand wedge, and then had a good look at the putt, and then the putt just went straight. I thought it was going to break a little, and it just went straight, the putt.

  Q. As far as The Presidents Cup, the captain's picks come out tomorrow. There's a good chance he may pick Ryo Ishikawa, he may pick Jeev Milkha Singh. How aware are you guys or how proud are you of the International Team with so many different countries now making such a contribution?   
 ANGEL CABRERA: We've got a great team, we're going to go fight, and the captain, whoever he picks will be the right one.
