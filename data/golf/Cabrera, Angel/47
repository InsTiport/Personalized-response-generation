   SCOTT CROCKETT: Angel, thank you for coming in to join us. A bit disappointing to drop a shot at the last but overall your thoughts on the day and your thoughts going into the weekend. 
 ANGEL CABRERA: The end was a bit of a shame but it was a good round and I feel I'm in a good position going ahead to tomorrow. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: What was pleasing for you today; any part of your game that was working well? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: I'm very comfortable with the greens. 

 Q. The fact that Eduardo Romero has won this tournament before further incentive for you? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: Definitely yes, it would be a great thing for me and a great thing for my country. 

 Q. Have you spoken much to Eduardo recently? Are you in touch with him regularly? 
 ANGEL CABRERA: Unfortunately, I don't get to see him very often since he's on the Seniors Tour. 

 Q. Would it be fair to say, one or two people have said that you did too many things, you said yes to too many people after you won the U.S. Open; do you think that's true?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, I probably said yes to many people. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: Angel, thank you very much.
