 Q. With scores this low, the course is set up nice to scoring this week or maybe the weather?
 ANGEL CABRERA: When you're playing on a course like this, the way it's set up with pretty good weather it definitely helps our game. 

 Q. Do you hope it stays like this for the weekend or would you like to see it get harder?
 ANGEL CABRERA: I've got to play it however it ends up being set up. I'll take it however it's set up.

 Q. Did you get a little motion sickness from the first seven holes yesterday?
 ANGEL CABRERA: No, I'm a professional. I've been playing for 20 years, I just take how it is and just react to that.

 Q. There was some big numbers yesterday. The fact that you were making a lot of birdies and eagles must have told you you had eliminated mistakes?
 ANGEL CABRERA: Yes, it was just a weird round. I hit some really good shots. I hit some bad shots, too.
 I was able to get the most out of the round that I could.
