Q.   With Angel Cabrera, and congratulations.   You played brilliantly down the stretch.   Tell us about that last putt that almost went in. 
ANGEL CABRERA:   You know, that's how golf is.   I had some issues during the course, but that's how golf is.   I had that chip on 18 that I could have won it, but Adam is a truthful good winner.

Q.   I could tell that you were happy for him because you know, you've experienced this kind of moment, you know what a lifeâ€‘changer this is. 
ANGEL CABRERA:   Yeah, obviously I would have been happy if I would have won.   He's a great person, a great player.   I get along with him.   We've been together in Presidents Cups, and I'm happy for him.
