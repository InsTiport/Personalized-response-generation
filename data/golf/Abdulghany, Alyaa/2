Q. Talk us through that last putt.
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   Yeah, you know, my putting through this afternoon has been kind of slow compared to the morning, so I really needed to make sure that my ball got there.  I honestly thought I smashed the ball like six feet by and just dribbled in.  This just shows how the speed changes in the afternoon.
Q. You talked about how this course is a lot longer, especially for you, and you were hitting a lot of long irons and hybrids into greens.  Has your approach changed?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   No, kind of sticking to the same approach, just a minute getting more comfortable with the longer yardages and things like that.  They have moved the pins around, but overall sticking to my game and making sure I'm staying patient with what I'm doing.
Q. How did you stay focussed?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   It was a really tough match.  Ellie played extremely well.  Just being in the zone, not straying away from my game, not trying to force any of her games, so just playing our own game, but she played extremely well, and to win a hole, we had to make birdies, it was great.
It gives you a lot of confidence to know that you have the skills and grit to do that, but also, just kind of opens your eyes a little bit for the quarterfinals to make sure your A Game is there and got to improve in some things for tomorrow.
