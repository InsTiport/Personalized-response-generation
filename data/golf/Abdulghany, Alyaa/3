Q. Great playing; talk us through the match a little bit.
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   The match was pretty tight.  You know, we both hit some really good shots in and had some birdie opportunities there, but overall just kind of staying with my putting speed and making sure I was reading it well, so overall it was pretty good.
Q. You've played this course a few times now.  What have you learned?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   I've learned that I've got to be patient with this course.  This course is a little long for me, but if I keep making good shots and stick with my routine, I'll do great.
Q. It's a really long week; how do you stay focused?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   Trying not to think about the end, just taking it one day, one match at a time, so we'll pace ourselves as much as we can.
Q. Match play is a lot different than stroke play; what do you like about it?  What changed for you today?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   You can be a little bit more aggressive than usual.  You're just taking it one hole at a time but not changing too much because really thinking overall how we can manage the course as best we can, so it's been good.
Q. What are you going to do the rest of the day?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   I'm going to practice and get ready for tomorrow.
