Q. A lot to be proud of this week.  Your thoughts on the whole thing?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   It's great to be part of something like the USGA and these kind of events.  I'm just super glad to be able to put my best foot out there and go out and play some good golf.
Q. Is you ran into a buzzsaw.  Rosa was making everything on the front nine.  How do you stay in it and not lose kind of confidence?
ALYAA ABDULGHANY:   I was just telling myself to stay patient through the whole week.  It's kind of inevitable to make mistakes on this course, and I was kind of waiting for my opportunity and she was making a lot of shots and it got to a certain point on the back nine and I was like, hey, I've got to start doing something but stay patient with my game.  Paid off for a little bit but didn't go through all the way.
