Q. John, you shot a 69 today. What was working for you?
JOHN SMOLTZ: Pretty much everything. I controlled my golf ball all day and was under control, putted it actually really great, and I just didn't make anything. In these conditions, I'm really thrilled with the score that I have.
Q. You mentioned last year that your putter stole a lot of the headlines. How confident are you in that club going into the weekend?
JOHN SMOLTZ: I'm very confident. I've just got to see more putts go into the hole. They're touching the hole. Every one of them is close, but if I keep putting like this, it's going to be really good.
Q. It's windy today. Did the wind play any part in your game plan going in?
JOHN SMOLTZ: First of all, the wind wouldn't let my putter stand up because it was too windy, and you can't miss a golf shot in this kind of conditions. So you really have to grind and hit them absolutely perfect.
Q. Going into tomorrow and the weekend, what are you going to lean from from last year going into the weekend to try to get the victory again?
JOHN SMOLTZ: Just myself in a position to make pars. The format that we have is very par driven, and if you run into some birdies, that's great. But if you have a lead, it's harder for someone to catch you if you make pars.
Q. Who are you most worried about going into the weekend?
JOHN SMOLTZ: Mark Mulder, Mardy Fish, those two are monsters, and they can light up a scorecard.
