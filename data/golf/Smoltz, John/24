 Q.  John, your name didn't come up when others in the interview room were talking about contenders yesterday. Did you take that to heart?  
JOHN SMOLTZ: No, I'm usually in the same boat. It's all about if I putt good. I've finished in the top seven pretty much every year. It comes down to putting.   
 Q.  There has been talk that the greens are as true as they've ever been. Was that a factor today?  
JOHN SMOLTZ: Yeah, I've finally learned how to putt them. You can't lip them in here. You've got to hit it center cut.   
 Q.  Generally though, you must be pretty happy with your round.  
JOHN SMOLTZ: Yeah, except for the par-5s. I didn't take advantage of them and that's usually my strength.   
 Q.  You feel good about your chances on Sunday?  
JOHN SMOLTZ: Yeah, I do. It all comes down to putting for me.
