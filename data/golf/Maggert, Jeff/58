JEFF MAGGERT:  On a day like today, you're hoping to make a few more birdies, but I played decent.

The greens were so bad, you had to hit it a foot away to make a birdie.  The way the greens are bouncing around, it's hard to make a lot of birdies.  I didn't hit the ball close to the hole, either.
Q.  You had a chip‑in?
JEFF MAGGERT:  I had a chip‑in on the front nine.  And I just played pretty steady.  With my iron plays, I had a couple of poor shots.

We both played pretty steady all day.  He didn't make too many mistakes, other than the three‑putt on 17, that opened the door a little bit.
