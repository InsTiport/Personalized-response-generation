Q. Can you tell us a little bit about your play today?
JEFF MAGGERT: It was pretty steady most of the day.  You know, a few bogeys here and there.  I three-putted the last hole, which wasn't good, but I played pretty steady.  I didn't drive the ball as well as I expected to, kind of left myself in a couple awkward spots.
I had one miscue.  I hit my tee shot in the water on 17, but I made a nice bogey there.
All in all, pretty good start.  Like I said, I left a few birdies out there, but hopefully I can make up the next three days.
Q. What did you think of the course in general?
JEFF MAGGERT: The course is playing great, very difficult.  Just every hole is demanding.  You got to keep the ball on the fairway and pay attention to what you're doing around the greens, make sure you're giving yourself some opportunities to putt for birdies.
Missing the greens here can really hurt you pretty bad too.  It's a ball striker's course, and I'm hitting the ball well.  So hopefully, the putter will cooperate over the next three days, and I can finish it off with a good tournament.
Q. Comparing this year to last year, what's your general feel and thoughts going into this championship?
JEFF MAGGERT: Well, kind of a similar start to last year, I would say.  I didn't feel like I played that great in the first round last year and kind of the same feeling this year.  I'm playing well and feeling good about my game, but just didn't quite get off to as good a start as I had hoped to.
Anyway, it is a three-day tournament, so there's a lot of golf to be played.  You know, just be patient and try to make my birdies when I can get them.
