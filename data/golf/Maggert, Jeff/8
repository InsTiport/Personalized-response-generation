 Q.  So conditions much different today than the last couple days.  You said on Saturday that the conditions, you liked what the conditions were.  Can you talk about today a little bit?  
JEFF MAGGERT: Well, I just -- I didn't play well.  I didn't hit any good shots on the front nine.  Hit bad drives, bad iron shots, and didn't get the ball up and down.  So I knew I was going to probably have to shoot probably, 6, 7, 8 under today to have a chance.  You shoot 4 over on the front nine, there's not much you can do.   
Anyway, the course played pretty easy.  I thought there was an opportunity to make seven or eight birdies out there, but it didn't happen.
