JEFF MAGGERT: I'm in it, but it's a real long shot now.   
 Q.  With the soft conditions, what are the scores going to be like?  
JEFF MAGGERT: I would think that I need something very low to have a chance.  Miguel is a great player, and Gene has been playing well so I don't expect them to back up when we are going to play a golf course as soft as this is going to be. I'm figuring I have to shoot 6, 7 under to have any chance at all.   
It's possible, and I've got the mindset to just be as aggressive as I can and see what kind of number I can post.
