 Q.   7‑under par 64, oldest guy in the field.   How did you do it?  
JEFF MAGGERT:   Well, Vijay must have pulled out, because he's usually a little older than me.   But yeah, you know, at my age I don't get a lot of chances out here, so I've got to make them when I can get them.   Actually I've hit the ball really well this year the first few weeks, and today just kind of good ball‑striking, making putts to go with it.   
   
 Q.   You made a couple of birdies out there in your first two holes, also made an eagle on your back nine, the front.   
JEFF MAGGERT:   Good start, yeah, definitely, and just played solid all day.   You know, the third hole was playing long with the wet fairways and everything, and just laid it up to a good yardage and had 70 yards to the hole and hit a nice little shot in there and spun it back out to the hole.  
   
 Q.   Being a Texas guy you're used to the wind.   There wasn't any wind out there today.   Is that an advantage for you?   
JEFF MAGGERT:   Yes and no.   Normally we play this golf course in pretty calm conditions.   The practice round Tuesday was actually very windy, so the golf course played pretty tough.   It would be nice to see a little wind.   I think the scores are probably a little lower than what they normally are here today.   But with the soft conditions and the greens are holding really well, guys are just ripping it up.  
   
 Q.   People normally think of this course as a big hitters' course.   Mark Wilson has won out here.   Do you like your chances the rest of the week?  
JEFF MAGGERT:   I don't think you've got to hit it long here.   There's only three par‑5s here, and even the short guys can take advantage of those, so you've just got to come out and play well and try to make a lot of putts.
