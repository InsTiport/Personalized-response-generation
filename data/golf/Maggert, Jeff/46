 Q. Talk about the day. 
 JEFF MAGGERT: Good day, started out a little slow, just been having a tough time with the putts this whole week and just haven't been making any and just been trying to stay patient. I was able to birdie a couple of the par-5s and just kind of hung in there. I feel like I could have shot a few shots lower these last few days, but I'm playing well and just trying to be patient and shoot a good score tomorrow.

 Q. 16th hole, how did it go out there for you?
 JEFF MAGGERT: It was good for me. I made 2 there, so that's a good hole. You know, they had the tee up and the pin up. I hit a sand wedge there today, so it was playing short and you just had to just kind of focus in there and hit a good shot. It was a good hole to make birdie on today.

 Q. What's it like for you to play 16? 
 JEFF MAGGERT: Well, after 20 years on TOUR, it's just kind of part of the program. You know, it can be distracting if you let it, but to be honest with you, this whole course is a little bit distracting. There's a lot of noise, a lot of carts driving around, a lot of people kind of partying a little bit. You get kind of used to it all day long, and when you get around to 16, you just expect a little bit more of it. 

 Q. How have you seen that hole evolve from when you first started playing here to now?
 JEFF MAGGERT: They've just seemed to keep adding on year after year. The first year I played here there was not much of a grandstand, just a lot of people hanging out, and it just kind of grew from there.
