 Q.   I understand you finished birdie, birdie, birdie.   
JEFF MAGGERT:   Nice finish.   Yeah, I didn't make much happen all day.   I was hitting the ball pretty well and just not making any putts.  
   
 Q.   Was that on 7, 8 and 9?  
JEFF MAGGERT:   Yeah.   Just tried to fight it out and hit some good shots at the end.   Made a long putt, had a couple tap in birdies and just kind of held it together.   
   
 Q.   That KEPT you right in the hunt.   
JEFF MAGGERT:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   It's a long four day tournament, so a long ways to go.  
   
 Q.   Any birdies that were unusual?  
JEFF MAGGERT:   Not really.   I made a nice putt on 7.   That was probably about a 20‑footer, but the others were just short little tap‑ins.   So it was kind of a stress free good back nine.   I shot 4‑under on my last nine.   So that was kind of an easy 4‑under.   I didn't have to work at it.  
   
 Q.   How would you consider the condition of the course?  
JEFF MAGGERT:   Late in the day the greens got pretty firm and a little more difficult, but I think it held up well all day.   It's in great shape tee to green.   So it's just kind of a ball‑striker's course, you got to hit the balls close to the pins to get some good birdie putts at it.   So that will be the game plan tomorrow morning.
