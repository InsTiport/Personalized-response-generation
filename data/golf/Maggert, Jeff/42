 Q. 9 under par, leaders at 11. So obviously you put a good round together. Probably have a good opportunity to win? Some comments about that? 
 JEFF MAGGERT: Yeah, I was getting a little discouraged in my round. Just not making any birdies. You know, I saw Frank had a good round, got to 11 under. I felt like I was letting it slip away. And all of a sudden I had a good finish. Four birdies in a row. So I'm right back in it.

 Q. Maybe a few comments about that. You said at 5 you probably would have been the dark horse. Then all of a sudden, four holes later your mood probably changed and generally the pace a little bit?
 JEFF MAGGERT: This course is a little strange. You finish with two pretty easy par 5s, and then a couple of sharp par 4s in between. 
 So if you can just hang around, you know, even par 1 or 2 under, you have a chance to make three or four birdies at the end on this golf course. That's kind of what I was trying to do today, and it just worked out for me. 

 Q. You've had some success here. Maybe some comments about how it's picked up for you? 
 JEFF MAGGERT: Yeah, you know, I didn't ever play here until about three years ago. And when I got here I was like, wow, this golf course is good for my game. You can take advantage of hitting your driver a lot here. And I've been able to do that. 
 I think a lot of guys - some of the longer hitters - are struggling with 3-woods or drivers off the tee. And they're not certain what to hit. I just feel like there is a lot of driver holes out there for me. And I just take advantage of that. Try to hit the ball straight and make some birdies.
