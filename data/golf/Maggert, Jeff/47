  Q. Aside from a few hiccups on the front, that was an impressive front 9. Talk about that.  
 JEFF MAGGERT: I just made a couple long putts. You make two, three, 40-footers, that's something I haven't done very often lately. It was an up and down day, really. The three long putts just kind of kept me in it.  
 You know, 40-foot eagle putt on the 5th hole there certainly was big and then I made a couple of other pretty long putts for birdie. The others were kind of up and down on the back.  
  
  Q. The course really suit your game, you feel?  
 JEFF MAGGERT: Yeah. I mean it's an old style course. It's kind of -- it's a little bit of a short hitter's course I'd say because there's -- even for me, I'm hitting a lot of 3-woods off the par-4s. The big hitters, it kind of take the advantage away, which is nice sometimes. Hopefully, I can keeping it going.  
  
  Q. Your putting, you noticed it's better?  
 JEFF MAGGERT: I haven't putted very well all year. It's just when you make a few it kind of snowballs, gets your confidence up. You know, I had one 3-putt today, but other than that I putted pretty well today so I'm happy with it.  
  
  Q. You like it here in this area.  
 JEFF MAGGERT: Grandma cooked us dinner last night. Very good. Our kids' birthday. We're having fun.
