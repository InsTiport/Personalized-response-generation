Q. So just kind of walk me through your play today.
JEFF MAGGERT: It was a good start.  I struggled on and off during my round.  Ball striking was not that sharp most of the day, other than the first four or five holes.
The back nine, starting on the back nine gives you a little break.  The first four or five holes there are pretty easy, and I took advantage of the short par 5 and hit another couple shots close to the pin.
Other than that, I just hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, but never really had much of a chance to make a lot of birdies.
Good up and down on the last hole.  I hit kind of a poor shot, and it was a good little pitch shot and a putt.  So that was a good finish to get in at 3 under.
Q. So are there any holes that stick out to you that were really key for you or holes that you potentially need to look out for tomorrow?
JEFF MAGGERT: You know, it's all about keeping the ball below the hole.  If you're missing greens above the hole and having to chip down the hills, it's going to be tough all day.
So you've got to kind of pick and choose the pins that you go for.  If you've got a short iron in your hand, you can be a little bit more aggressive.  But, certainly, with 4, 5 irons in your hand, you've got to just play the center of the green and see if you can make a long putt.
