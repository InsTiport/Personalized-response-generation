Q.   First off, talk about your experience this week, being a last minute addition and getting to play in the group that you did?
BUD LINTELMAN:   Yeah, I mean, you know, what a dream come true.   Obviously I've played poorly, but I'm still, I was so happy to be here and these guys, Tom and Peter, were outstanding to play golf with. 
I didn't ‑‑ they treated me like one of the TOUR veterans, basically, and it was quite a pleasure.   They're great golfers and great people. 

Q.   What was the course like this week?
BUD LINTELMAN:   Well, it was very difficult.   It's a hard golf course, if you don't drive it in the fairway particularly, then it's going to be, then it's very difficult.   And it's long.   So you got to hit it solid and in the fairway. 
So, for me, I knew going into the practice rounds that it was going to be a tough task, and I, honestly, I was kind of realistically hoping to be able to shoot around par or actually even under 75 I thought was a good score for myself. 
But anyway, I didn't quite do that well, but it was certainly a great experience.
