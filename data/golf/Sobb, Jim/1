  Q. Talk really briefly, this was your first time in this event, what it meant to you and what the experience was like.   
 JIM SOBB: Well, it's very fun to play in a Major Championship and represent my club and my section. It's an honor.   
  
  Q. I think you're 9-over now.   
 JIM SOBB: Yeah.   
  
  Q. What's the mindset now? Not knowing what the cut's going to be.   
 JIM SOBB: You figure it's going to be six or seven. That's the figure, you know. Basically that's the score. The conditions were pretty benign today, so it will be six or seven.   
  
  Q. Do you felt like you maybe played a little better today, just didn't score the ball or what?  
 JIM SOBB: I got off to a bad start, bogeyed the first three holes and played the last 15 holes 1-over.   
 So I played okay there. But just didn't get enough looks at birdies. The pins are hard to get at and I missed a few fairways and that will cost you a bogey or two, so.
