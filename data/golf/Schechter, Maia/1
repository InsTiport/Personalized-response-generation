Q. What's the plan between now and round 5? What do you do the next few days to rest and get prepared?
MAIA SCHECHTER: Day after tomorrow I think it's going to rain, so might go walk nine holes and putt and then get to know a new golf course. So new greens, new golf course.
I'm going to try and treat it as another tournament. Everybody starts back at scratch. Try and get another top 10 basically is my plan.
