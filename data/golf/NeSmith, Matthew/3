Q. Just get some comments about your week overall. How was it?
MATTHEW NeSMITH: It was great. Played one bad nine holes, but other than that, I played really solidly. It was definitely a step up from last week. I struggled pretty much most of last week and finally got to play some good golf. So I'm excited.
Q. A lot of guys went low yesterday. How is the course playing out there today?
MATTHEW NeSMITH: It's in great shape. There's just not a whole lot of wind. If you hit it good, you can really go at a couple flags and make a bunch of birdies. I think the scores will be pretty low again today.
Q. Can you talk about how special this course is to you?
MATTHEW NeSMITH: It's awesome. I've had a lot of good memories out here -- playing some good golf, getting engaged, kind of starting my own family. It's been a wonderful place where I've kind of had a second home. So it's been great.
Q. And your mindset heading into your next event?
MATTHEW NeSMITH: I'm excited. I played some really, really good golf this week. Just had kind of one bad nine. Just need to string a couple more holes together, and we'll be right there in the thick of it.
