  Q. Just a couple quick ones right here.  First of all, talk about your round.
 MATTHEW NESMITH:   I played great.  I played nice and solid.  Hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, made some good putts.  Really just got under par and was able to keep the momentum rolling.
 It was very solid on all accounts.
 Q. I have to ask, just comment on Matthew's play today.
 MATTHEW NESMITH:   It was incredible.  I mean, he got off to a little bit of a slow start.  Chipped in on 3.  Hit an unbelievable chip on 3 three, but couldn't seem to get really anything going through eight holes.
 Then he birdied 9, birdied 10, made it on 11, and it was off like gangbusters.  He just played really, really phenomenal.
 Q. Even though you played a really good round of golf, do you just feel a little bit like you got lapped when that happens, or you don't really focus on that?
 MATTHEW NESMITH:   No, no.  I mean, I played well.  I definitely feel like I got to beat for sure.  But I played a really good round of golf, and that doesn't come around very often.
 I've just got to keep doing what I am doing and play solid golf.  There is still another day left, so get as close as you can and keep going.
