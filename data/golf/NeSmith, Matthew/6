 Q.  Just take us through the shot today.  
MATTHEW NeSMITH: It was 185 or 190 yards, I don't really exactly remember the number. Probably 190, and it was like 181 front, and the wind was really hard off the left, I just kind of punched a 5-iron and cut it up into the wind a little bit, and it landed a foot or so on the front of the green and had the perfect amount of little left spin and went right in the middle. Just disappeared.   
 Q.  It was your first one on this TOUR, right?  
MATTHEW NeSMITH: Yeah, first one on this TOUR. I made one at the TOUR Championship in Indiana on the Korn Ferry.   
 Q.  Nice little celebration out there?  
MATTHEW NeSMITH: Yeah, it was great. It was awesome. They both said it's the first one they had ever seen in a group, so I thought it was pretty cool. Yeah, it was awesome. And I striped it. That was the best part.   
 Q.  And then just comment on the 1-over today, tough conditions out there. If we can get some comments on the day.  
MATTHEW NeSMITH: It's tough. I didn't quite have my best stuff out there. I kind of putted okay and kind of saved some pars and I got caught by the wind on 15, but I played really solid. It's just kind of tough to get a ton of looks. I mean, it's really hard to hit it inside 20 feet or 30 feet and have some nice solid kind of looks that you can really get after, and then the wind is pumping on the greens, too. I feel pretty happy with it. It's just live and survive, basically.
