Q.   How does it feel after day one to follow it up good in fashion? 
LASSE JENSEN:   It feels really nice.   I didn't play my best today.   I feel I struggled a bit off the tee.   So to shoot 69, with that long game, I'm really happy for that and obviously something else is working.

Q.   That's why you call it the dorm patrol, getting up that early, to play in a 7.30 tee time and a birdie at the first, that must have helped?
LASSE JENSEN:   Yes, I woke up after the first hole.   It was 5.00am alarm.   It was really early.   But once you're out there, it was nice that you got the course for yourself, no wind.   The greens are pure here, so it was nice.

Q.   I take it you couldn't ask for better conditions.   The course was just resplendent at the time of day, wasn't it?
LASSE JENSEN:   It is.   You can just hear the birds singing up there. 

Q.   I suppose there were a couple of down moments in the day but ought to be proud of the way you bounced back from them, as well?
LASSE JENSEN:   Absolutely.   Like I said, I had a few tee shots where I struggled a bit and that cost me a little bit.   But like you said, all the bounceback, that was really nice and that kept me going today.

Q.   I appreciate this is only the halfway stage for you, but do you still look back on South Africa and the Rolex Trophy last year and the way you held things together day after day? 
LASSE JENSEN:   Yeah, I think you get used to having this feeling when you are out there.   You get more experience about playing in the last group, and obviously that helps me.   Some boys are there every week, so they feel like they should be there every week. 
But for a guy like me, it's very important that I have a slow progress each week and in the end of the day, that will give me some confidence.   So I'm just going to have a nice weekend here in MÃ¼nchen.
