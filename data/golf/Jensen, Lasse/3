 Q.  Fantastic day out there.  Talk us through it.  
LASSE JENSEN: Well, didn't do a lot wrong, really.  Played very, very solid and had a strong finish here on the back nine.   
 Q.  You look to be playing a bit of strategy out there.  It wasn't all-out attack.  A good mix of attack and defence; is that right?  
LASSE JENSEN: Yeah, I was trying to play my cards right, and then attack when you can.  This golf course, if you underestimate it a little bit, then it can suddenly grab you.  So you need to play a bit smart but still also make some birdies, yeah.   
 Q.  Give me an idea of the atmosphere as you were coming in.  
LASSE JENSEN: It was lovely.  There were a few Danes up there.  There must be a lot of expats down here.  It was nice with some support, definitely.   
 Q.  What's been the difference this week?  
LASSE JENSEN: In Abu Dhabi, I had a fever, and then last week I was trying to recover.  And then everything just clicked this week, so it was maybe a bit surprising that I actually played that well this week because I feel like my game was getting where I want it to be but I thought maybe it would take a bit more time to get out of winter and get the rust out of the system.   
 Q.  Nice to get big results early on; this is a pretty big one.  
LASSE JENSEN: Absolutely.  This is huge, and obviously it gives me a lot of boost and confidence for the next couple of weeks.
