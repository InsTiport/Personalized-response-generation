 Q.  3-under, good way to start the week. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, I played good out there.  A couple bogeys coming in there, but you know what, 17 is a tough hole.  It was a tough golf course, period, but I managed to save some good pars, roll some good birdies, hit some good shots and have fun out there.  So we'll be back tomorrow. 

 Q.  You guys have had a pretty brutal stretch of golf courses as far as -- I know you guys like this golf course, but it's hard, Augusta is hard, the whole Florida Swing seemed pretty hard, then you've got another tough one next week.  Do you like this style of play? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  What's new?  That seems to be the trend out here.  You know what, same thing for everybody.  Tough means a little bit more stressful, and I've got no problem with that.  I like it. 

 Q.  This is kind of the second time around you're seeing some of these golf courses.  Does that make a difference? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Big-time.  Practice rounds last year were -- those were stressful, try to get all the information, all the numbers.  This year I can flow a little bit more and focus a little bit more on my game and what I saw the year before.
