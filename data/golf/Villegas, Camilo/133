  Q.  Perfect position headed into the final round.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, definitely a better round today than yesterday.  It felt a lot better, hit some good shots and felt comfortable out there.  The greens are getting really, really firm.  They really look like they're dying out there.  It's not playing easy, and I'm really looking forward to the challenge tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Driving the ball a little better, that makes you a very dangerous person on Sunday.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Let me tell you, yesterday was, like I said, the ugliest 5-under I've ever shot.  I went to the range, and actually I didn't spend too much time there, I just felt my rhythm and it got a little better quick, and I just got out there and did a little workout and got ready for today.   
 I did a little work on the range last night and felt a lot better.  I drove the ball pretty good.  I felt comfortable over the ball on the tee, and even though it was one worse than yesterday, I'm a lot happier with the 4-under today than with the 5-under yesterday.   
  
  Q.  So you're in the hunt heading to Sunday.  You've been there before.  What do you do to close the deal?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Just go play golf.  I was looking at the leaderboard and it's pretty bunched up.  Just play the golf course.  Hopefully I keep hitting the ball well off the tee and grinding it out.  That's what it's all about.  Play with heart out there, and you never know.   
  
  Q.  You're in Florida and you're going up against these guys from Georgia and Georgia Tech.  Obviously the Gator has got to be hungry.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I have to say it definitely doesn't feel like playing in Georgia.  The fans out there are unbelievable.  It felt like a mixture of Florida and Colombia.  I'm thrilled those guys came out here to watch me.  It's pretty special.
