 Q. If you're going to end on a good one, end on a par-4 that you hit from two feet, eight inches. Pretty much from the third hole you were in control of this match?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: You know, Goosen made some mistakes starting the match and I just kind of kept it in play. And yes, to finish with that shot is nice. To pick it up and have the win, go rest a little bit, and get ready for the afternoon.

 Q. And now with the weather so much different this afternoon than we've seen all week, does it really change anything for you, other than maybe some of the clothes you have to wear today?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, the ball is not going to be going as far. We'll see how the rain softens a little bit the greens or maybe make them skip, who knows, we'll find out. 

 Q. Good round, ball-striking is really good and your drive is phenomenal, especially the last. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, that was a great finish. I did hit the ball good this morning. I was a little shaky with some of the iron shots, but that's fine, got a good rhythm for the afternoon.
