 Q.   67, take us through that round.   What did you think of it?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   You know what?   I played great today.   Started bogeyâ€‘bogey with a sand wedge into the first hole, and then finished off to be good and ends up, I don't know, six yards short.   I didn't get up and down.   Then on 2, I stretched the sand wedge and bounced it on the green, touched the green and rolls back, and I don't get up and down.   
So, yeah, from there on I just played solid.   I hit a lot of great shots and unbelievable putts.   I kept touching the lip.   I touched the lip on number 3.   I touched the lip on number 4.   Then I made birdie on 6, and touched the lip on 7, good par on 8 and almost holed it.   I had a chance to number 9 and 10.   Then I kept hitting great putts.   I kept touching the lip, but I was very patient.   Didn't make a good par on number 16 after a bad drive, and birdie on the last two and go have lunch, I guess.  
   
 Q.   What's it mean to have birdies at the end here?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   You know what?   You go home with a smile, and it's always good.   It's always great to finish a round good.   It's a totally different feeling to play a round good and finish a round bad.   It's funny how us golfers tend to focus on what happened last when you can have a great day and then two bad holes and then your feeling at the end of the round is a bad one.   You have a round like I had today with two holes starting and played good from there on, and trust me, only because I'm talking to you, but those holes, I will not remember the rest of the day.  
   
 Q.   Tied for fourth right now with 5 shots back.   How do you feel?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I didn't really look to the leaderboard.   When you get to a bogey, bogey start and you know you're playing on the PGA TOUR and it's jam packed, trust me, you make two bogeys, you lose 25 spots.   From there on, I just tried to start gaining ground back, and I did that.   Like you said, I'm tied for fourth.   I didn't know that.   I'll get back tomorrow and post some good numbers.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little about last year and you're putting some good rounds up, but maybe not a whole tournament together?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, I have, but it's been good.   I've been working hard.   The game of golf is a beautiful thing.   We love it.   We hate it.   Even when we really hate it, we keep coming back, so it is what it is.   We all want to play better, doesn't matter who we are.   Doesn't matter how many tournaments we're winning or where we're finishing, it's the same thing with me.   So when you don't do that, it's a little frustrating at times.   But I'm 32.   I've been out here for a long time, and it's fun.   You kind of learn to accept it and move on.
