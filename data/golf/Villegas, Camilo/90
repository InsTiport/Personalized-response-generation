 Q. Another pretty convincing victory, you seemed to have good form out here this week?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I played good. I got off to a great start. And I got up probably, what was it? 4-up through five holes and then kind of struggled there toward the middle of the round and came back strong with birdies on I believe it was 13 and 14. 
 So again, a win is a win. 

 Q. A good golf course for you, obviously, or are you just playing well?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, it's the same for everybody. I believe it does benefit you to hit it a little far off the tee and carry those fairway bunkers. And the greens are crazy, so we'll just try to manage it around.

 Q. Are you going to get to the 16th hole any this week?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Let me tell you something, I just try to focus on each shot and hopefully we can keep winning.

 Q. Are you looking forward, obviously you're up in the standings, are you looking forward to the Presidents Cup, with this being a match play event, are you excited?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I got some work to do here, but I do love playing match play and I would love to be on Greg's team and I'll work hard to be a part of it.
