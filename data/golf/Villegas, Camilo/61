  Q. Well, just talk about your round real quick. You've been a world traveler here for a couple of days?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: A little tired. My back was bothering me a little bit on the first couple of holes, a little cold and a lot of flying. Made bogey on the first. Then I stayed patient and got it going. And you know what, I hit it pretty decent. Greens are a lot softer this year than previous years which makes them a little bumpy especially into the grain and you've just got to take it one at a time.   
  
  Q. You played really good the last couple of weeks, and this is a continuation. Can you just tell us about the early part of this week going down to Colombia?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, that was awesome. I had so much fun. Hopefully it's a big step in South America and Latin America in golf. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed watching all of the American players there enjoy my country. It's a beautiful place. It's a dream come true.  
  
  Q. The fatigue, when you're playing well, is it easier to keep it going?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, obviously you have a good attitude when you're playing well and you enjoy it. It was a good day.   
  
  Q. I was going to ask about the second shot into 18?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, the second shot was awesome. I had 264 to the front, and I knew I had to just rip my 3-wood, and that's exactly what I did. It ended up good and 2-putted for birdie and I'll always take a birdie on the last hole.
