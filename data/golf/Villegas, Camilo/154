Q.  Coming off 18, the crowd was excited, did that seem like a tournament final?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I'm pretty sure it was for Michelle, not for me, but no, I had fun.  It was great.  The crowd was awesome, a lot of people out there, definitely.

But I'm proud of myself, too.  I played well.  I was patient, I kept my composure and I just had one little goal which was having fun out there and I'm sure I did.
Q.  Looked like Michelle had more fun today, too.  Was she more relaxed?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Oh, yeah, she seemed a lot more relaxed since the first tee.  I just wish she would have done that yesterday.  It's a lot of pressure.  She's a great girl, great player, but there's a lot of people following here her.  And she was definitely more calm today from the first tee, just making jokes and laughing and having fun and she played awesome.  I mean, wow, she hit some great shots.

It inspired me a little bit, actually to play good, and I did.
Q.  It inspired you?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, she was hitting it in tight and everything, I was like, hey, look at this, we can get it going, let's build up some shots and have fun.
Q.  Did you have a bet with her at all or anything?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  No.  We were just chatting and having fun about different stuff.
Q.  For example?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  When everything got more calmed down and everything, you start looking around, it's like, this is pretty exciting, a lot of cameras out here, a lot of people a lot of fans.  It's a great experience.  And like I've been see saying, she's a great girl and she's a great player and she's got a long way to go.  She's going to be extremely, extremely good.
Q.  Talk about this weekend.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  This weekend, I'm really looking forwards to it.  Hopefully my thumb is better tomorrow morning, hopefully I don't have to shoot it again.  If I do, I will.  But I'm just looking forward.  I mean, take one shot at a time.  Last year was a long year, tough year, hard year, but it paid off, we're here and now it's time to keep learning and have fun.
Q.  What impressed you the most about Michelle's game?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I think her attitude was pretty good.  Obviously she hits it a long way, she's awesome, just all the technical part, her swing, everything.

But it must be really hard being in her shoes and be followed by so many fans, so many newspapers, so many media and just to have a round like she did yesterday and handle herself like she did he mean, that's pretty impressive.
Q.  What was the biggest difference from yesterday and today in her game?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I think she was very relaxed on the first tee today.  She was having fun out there today.  I told her yesterday on the 18th hole, I go, "Michelle, we'll have a good one tomorrow, we'll have fun."  And she did.  She got relaxed and it's a little bit easier to play like that.
Q.  That short putt she missed on the third hole yesterday    inaudible    do you remember?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's hard to get in her head.  It was longer than what most people were saying this morning.  I heard people saying she missed a 1 footer; no it was probably a 3, 3 1/2 footer.  And you're going to miss those.  It's going to happen.  You just have to keep going.  She made a double after that, and I'm sure the double bothered her more than that putt.
