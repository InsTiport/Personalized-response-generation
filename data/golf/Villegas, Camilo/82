 Q. This is one of your better rounds here. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Is it? 

 Q. Yeah, 68, right?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: 67, yeah. 

 Q. Sorry. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, good round. I'm excited about the way I hit the ball, kept it in play, rolled some great putts in on my front nine, which was the back nine. Great save on 16 after chipping it in the water, and a little 4 there on 9 to finish the round. I'm excited about the way the day went, and I'll be back tomorrow giving it my best.

 Q. Can you talk again about 16 in a little bit more detail?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: 16, yeah. I hit driver, clipped the trees on the left, came straight down. Tried to play an aggressive shot, just a 6-iron really low, rolled it up there, and it wasn't a bad shot. I had not the best lie there in the rough, and my chip shot just jumped a little bit. I bounced it about five paces farther than I wanted. I wanted to bounce it behind the fringe and it caught the little downslope getting to the green. I didn't think it was going in the water, but obviously it bounced hard, trickled and went in it. Then I had a chance to drop it on the green, which was nice, and rolled a great putt. 

 Q. A lot has been made this week that it's a fast and firm golf course. One, do you favor those conditions? And two, does it bring in more people in the field that could possibly win the tournament?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: You know, it's funny how people talk, oh, this golf course is perfect for this guy or for that guy, and trust me, players don't think that way. I mean, we just go there and get a target and swing at it, and same thing when we get to the greens. You just read the putt and try to make it. I don't know. I mean, you can look at it in every different angle. I'll just be out there focusing on every target, every swing, every shot, and hopefully keep it going.

 Q. Talk about your drive on 7 when you got over there and saw that ball. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was a bad lie, yeah. Listen, it looks like every year I hit it there once, and hopefully that's the only time I hit there it this year. 
 I had a bad lie, and I hit a great second shot. I left myself an easy chip there, which I just hit a little heavy, didn't quite get it where I wanted and just missed the putt. Still, it was a bogey, so every time you make a bogey it's not going to kill you, you've just got to keep going. 

 Q. Are you going to have a chat with Tebow about playing golf with that PAC-10 guy yesterday? How's Tim's game progressing?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I haven't seen him forever. I've only seen him hit balls once, and trust me, the first one I saw was pretty impressive. Then he got a little crooked, but he's a strong boy and he can stand out there.
