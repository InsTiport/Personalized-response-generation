 Q. That is a disappointing finish. Can you tell us your emotions right now?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I played pretty good today. You know what, tough day out there to make how many birdies, a ton, maybe -- six, I wish, but maybe five on the back nine, and I made four bogeys that killed me and obviously put myself in bad position, then recovered. An easy putt, I just pushed it a little bit. You know what, it was a fun day. It's a challenge out there. I truly believe it's going to cost me, that putt, but it is what it is. 
 You know what, it's been a pretty crappy year and the last couple weeks we've turned it around a little bit to the positive side, looking forward to finishing strong and keep it going.
