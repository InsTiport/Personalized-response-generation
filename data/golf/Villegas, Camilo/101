 Q. You're two back going into tomorrow. How do you feel about your chances?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: How many am I back, a couple back? 

 Q. Two back. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Only two back. I mean, you've got great guys playing in the field and everybody is going to be working hard to accomplish their goal, but feeling a little bit better every day, and hopefully tomorrow I feel a little bit better than today.

 Q. What adjustments did you make after your 74 on the first day?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, I hit the ball a lot better the second and third rounds. Just a little rusty. I feel, again, like my rhythm is coming along day after day, and we'll work on it so tomorrow is a little better than today.
