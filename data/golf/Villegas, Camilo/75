   CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was good. It wasn't pretty out there. Jeev didn't play very good. I didn't play very good. But that's the way it goes. Maybe I'm saving the best for the afternoon. Hopefully I am.  
  
  Q. What was your attitude going out having lost and knowing the situation that you really had to pull through?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I was calm. I knew exactly what I needed to do this morning, which I did, and I guess I know exactly what I have to do in the afternoon. So I'd better step it up and play a good match.  
  
  Q. Is this course examining every aspect of the game?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: The greens are rolling good, so if you see a putt in the right spot, you strike it the right way, it's going to go in the hole. So you have got some chance out there. It's definitely very up-and-down, 36 holes Friday, Saturday, Sunday is going to be tough. But for the guys that get to the finals, so, I don't know, anyway, like I said, I know what I need to do and I'd better play a good match in the afternoon.  
  
  Q. You're renowned for your physical fitness, all of that work in the gym can payoff here, can't it?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I hope so. I still have to win this afternoon and keep it going.  
  
  Q. How do you approach that match, it may come down to holes-up, because the whole of your group now have one win under their belts and they have all got two points so you have to win by a margin?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I know, it's interesting. That's what is written in the books for the rules so we have to stick to it. So we'd better play good this afternoon.
