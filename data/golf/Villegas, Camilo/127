  Q.  This is such a difficult golf course.  It rewards good shots, but if you get a little loose, it'll punish them just the same?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, it's a great golf course.  I've always loved it.  The wind was blowing hard today and the greens got soft, so it was a little bit different than yesterday.  But right in the middle of the mix and looking forward for the weekend.   
  
  Q.  You get it to 11-under, then stumble a little bit at the 4th with a double, a bogey at the 8th, but like you say, you're still right in the mix?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It is what it is.  I'm at 8-under and I've got to play good on the weekend.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the greens because I think they were probably difficult with all the rain.  They seemed like they were quick and yet at the same time soft, difficult conditions?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  No, they're actually very slow and soft, especially compared with last week.  Last week they were so quick.  But it's the same for everybody.  You've got to adjust and try to hit good putts.   
  
  Q.  You gave us the Hombre Ara√±a a couple times out there today?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, whenever I feel like it's going to help me read the putt, I'll be down there.
