   CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It was an interesting round out there.  Just struggled with the speed on my putts basically, and then hit the water two tee shots off.  But hanging in there, and going to get myself out of this thing and I'll be ready to go tomorrow morning.   
  
  Q.  Playing with Tiger, what was that like with him being so dialed in today?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  We had fun out there.  I mean, Tiger is a great guy, and it's a lot of fun to play with him.  It was my first time.   
 I was really looking forward to playing with him during the weekend.  He played awesome.  I mean, he hit the ball great off the tee, he rolled some great putts, had great speed, and I think his score reflects the way he played.  But it is what it is.  He's the No. 1 player in the world, and that's why you look forward to those moments, to play with him, play with him on the weekends and learn from that.  I definitely learned a lot from him today, and hopefully I can use it in the future and just get better every day.   
  
  Q.  Did you feel added energy from the bigger crowd?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It was awesome.  I love the crowds.  You've got to be focused, you've got to have your head in place, but I love the crowds, and they were awesome out there.  I wish I could play in front of those crowds every day.
