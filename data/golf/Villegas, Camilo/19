  DOUG MILNE:   Camilo Villegas, thanks for joining us for a few minutes prior to the start of the 2014 Barclays.   
Coming off a great week last week, open and closed with 63 in North Carolina for your victory at the Wyndham Championship, making your seventh start here at The Barclays this week, and with that being said, I guess you're probably still kind of running away with the momentum of last week.  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, obviously the last few days have been pretty exciting.   Just like I said last week, it's been a while.   Winning on the PGA TOUR keeps getting harder and harder every year and the TOUR keeps getting more and more competitive, a lot of guys coming in and playing strong.  
Yeah, ups and downs on the game, but it was very special to win last week, lift that trophy again and feel that rush coming in of being in contention and getting it done.   And here we are, a few days later, back to reality, back to normal life and tomorrow we'll all start from zero again.  
DOUG MILNE:   One of the things I've always heard you talk about over the years is sticking to your plan; you stick to your plan whether it's in the fitness center or on the range.   How important is that to you at this stage in your career as you're more of a veteran in the game?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, I think you learn to know yourself and kind of what works for you, and what you enjoy, too.   I've always been a hard worker.   I've always enjoyed the fitness and I've always enjoyed the practicing.   Traveling gets a little bit old, but I love competition, and that's why we keep showing up every week, every day and competing on the PGA TOUR and try to win tournaments and trying to get better.   It's a great challenge.  
   
 Q.   What have the last couple days been like?   Have you heard from people that have been coming out of the woodwork sending you texts?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, the phone was going crazy.   It's nice.   I had over 300 text messages and e‑mails and WhatsApp messages, and it's good to know how many people are there watching and supporting me.   It's nice to see they get excited when I play good.   They are always following.   They are always, like I said, paying attention and rooting for me.   
There's a lot of people behind Camilo, and that includes fans and close people that send me messages, all my sponsors, family, all of my kind of coaching team and caddie and my fiancÃ©e and everybody.   It's just a lot of people behind this business and last week was a special one for all of us.   
   
 Q.   What have you seen from the course so far since you've been out there and how has it changed from the previous times?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   The course is in unbelievable shape.   I had the chance to walk nine holes yesterday and hit a few chips and putts.   The greens are in unbelievable conditions.   The fairways are, too.   The rough is probably going to be the thickest and healthiest rough we are going to play all year.   
I was here in 2008 when Vijay won.   I was here in 2010 when Kuch won in a playoff.   I don't remember it being in such good shape, so I'm excited.   It's going to be a great challenge.   It's a tough golf course.   
There's a few little changes, a bunker here and there, but nothing crazy in terms of the structure of the golf course.   It's just in great shape this year.   
   
 Q.   Do you like playing those kind of tough‑‑  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Love it, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You've been at the top, you're back at the top; that drop in between, what is it you feel has really helped you turn this around and get back where you belong?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Well, they asked me last week, what was different, and my answer was nothing.   I've been doing the same thing year and after year.   I'm a hard worker.   I stick to my plan.   I go through my routine.  
And, yes, drive it good last week?   Yes.   Did I make a putt here or there?   Yes.   Did I hit my irons good?   Yes.   So everything just kind of happened to be put together.   And was it a little bit more confidence?   Maybe.   I mean, you start hitting good shot after good shot and your confidence goes up.   
But structurally, nothing, I'm the same guy.   And I said it, too, I said, I wouldn't be reading too much about what's going to be written about me, because guess what, come Monday I'm going to be the same guy after I hold the trophy or if I would have missed the cut.  
This is a crazy game, the one we chose as a job, as our profession.   Guess what, Camilo Villegas is the same guy.   He just happened to win last week, and he's pretty excited about what's coming up.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little about momentum and have you been the kind of player that can ride that into the Playoffs?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, momentum, confidence go hand by hand.   They are key in this game.   I mean, everybody out here they can hit the ball; they can chip; they can putt.   We are all good.   Nobody is here for no reason.   
But the guys that are closing tournaments, the guys that are winning golf tournaments, they are pretty strong mentally and that momentum and confidence are a part of that mental side of the game.   
Yeah, I do believe in momentum.   I do believe in‑‑ I've seen it with many players and I've seen it with myself.   I'm excited of what's coming up.   I'm looking forward to playing the Playoffs, and, yeah, hopefully we can keep riding that momentum.   
   
 Q.   You've had some terrific success in the Playoffs in the past.   Is there anything about it in particular that gets you going?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Well, I won last week, and that 500 points‑‑ I mean, whoever wins this week, it's 2,500 points.   Last time I checked, there's a big chunk of money being given out after THE TOUR Championship (laughter).   So five times the points, FedExCup, I mean, if you don't get motivated, then, I don't know, there's something wrong with you.   So I am excited.   
The Playoffs always got me excited, and it's always toward the end of the year, you always want to close the year good.   It's no difference than making birdie on the 18th hole.   Lunch always tastes better.   So when you play good in the playoffs and you start passing people, it kind of gives you a good feeling till the end of the year.   
DOUG MILNE:   Camilo, we appreciate your time and best of luck this week.
