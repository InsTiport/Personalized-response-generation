 Q. Are you happy with the first round, being defending champion?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I am. I mean, 3-under. I think 5-under is leading. I hit a couple really bad shots, but I hit a bunch of good ones. I'm getting a little more confident with the putter, and I'm getting a little more comfortable with myself, just kind of trying to be more chill. I think it was a good day.

 Q. Do you find yourself watching, like obviously you probably know where you need to be to get into Atlanta. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Kind of.

 Q. Are you kind of watching that?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Kind of, but it's first round. There's no need to watch. Just put myself in position. I've got four rounds to take care of, and hopefully we can do it.

 Q. And the course, quick comments on the course?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, the golf course is long. I think it was set up good, though. Once it gets a little firmer, it's going to get a little tricky with some of the pockets on the greens because every pocket seems to slope away. It's not like we're hitting 9-irons or 8-irons or pitching wedges to those pockets. I mean, we're hitting 6-irons and 5-irons. So those could be tricky. 
 But we'll see. If you've got a 5-iron, maybe you just fire at the middle of the green and take your medicine, and if you happen to have a 9-iron somewhere, you just be a little bit more aggressive.
