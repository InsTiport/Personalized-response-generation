 Q. Camilo, a grind today, tough. Rewarding at the end. I know you shot a great round while grinding.
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah. I shot even par yesterday hitting 17 greens and hitting the fairways. It was completely the opposite today. At the end of the day the game of golf is about scoring. 
 Yesterday I played pretty well and scored as bad as I could and today I drove it pretty bad and scored as good as I could. So, you know what? I guess it kind of levels out and all square for tomorrow.

 Q. If you drive it better the next two days, do you think you have a good chance of making a good run this weekend?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: We're always trying. Definitely. A lot easier from the fairway than it is from the rough.
