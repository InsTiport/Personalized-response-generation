  Q. Obviously a great, especially coming in, you're in a good position, you obviously know what's at stake.  You're feeling good, it seems like.
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:   You know what, I love this place, I love this golf course and yeah, I just, I played nice today.  I didn't get off to a good start but I got it rolling on the back nine and that's awesome.  So do some work and obviously I didn't get the best start this year but, hey, it's golf, we keep plugging.
 Q. What are you most pleased with as far as your game this week?  What's coming through best for you?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Just staying patient, to be honest, because it's a frustrating game and nobody's immune.  We all have ups and downs and the past couple years we have had some interesting up and downs, to be honest, in all different types.  So, again, I'm just happy to be swinging a golf club and I enjoy the process, I enjoy working, but that doesn't mean you don't get frustrated when the results are not there.  So we'll be back tomorrow and try to have the same attitude.
 Q. Mia's Serenity Space.  I just read about that, learned about that, how much does that mean to you and Maria to know that's at the Nicklaus Hospital?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Hey, listen, Jack and Barbara and the Nicklaus Children's Hospital has been unbelievable during this process, we can't say thanks enough.  And my wife has been very busy with Mia's Miracles and the Mia's Serenity Room room was something very special.  We integrated it last week, it was my first time at the hospital since we left there and it was pretty tough for me, it was very emotional seeing all the nurses and the staff and everybody was really hard.  I lost it there for awhile.  But I just got to say congrats to my wife, she's been working hard and all those nurses and the staff at Nicklaus that worked every day and gave it their all to make our daughter feel good, and other kids there, we feel like they needed a little place to decompress and recharge and get back to being, let's call it second moms, because that's kind of what they are when they're working there.
