 Q.  Good round, could have been great. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yes, I've been hitting the ball so beautiful all week.  I'm so proud of my ball-striking.  Unfortunately, I putted awful the second and third round.  Yes, had I won't say a little hiccup, but a big hiccup on the 8th hole; I just pushed it in the hazard and ended up making triple. 
 But you know what, it's a good week.  I'm proud of the way I hit the ball, like I said, and especially the way I came back and shot 30 on the back after making triple.  It's the last day of the tournament, you make a triple and all of a sudden you jump from being maybe in 20th place to 50th place, and you just -- your energy, emotions all good so far down to the floor that sometimes it's hard to step it up and come back in.  I did that this week, and I've got to be proud of that. 

 Q.  A lot of scrutiny about the course coming in, now that you've finished the your found, where you do you see this of golf course shaping up as National Open? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's good. The fairways are a little forgiving even though the rough is very consistent.  The greens were not as firm as I was expecting them, but you're probably going to see, they are probably not going to win with less than 15-under par.  So any time it's around that 10, 15 number, that means it's a good challenge for us. 

 Q.  And what's up for you now, big stretch the next couple of months? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Next week, it's off, believe it or not.  I've played four in a row and I can't wait to get home.
