 Q. You recovered, I think you made a double early and came back and charged to the lead. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it wasn't pretty there, but came back and made birdie-birdie. Four-putts always feel a little shaky. They rattle your day, rattle your head. Fortunately it rattled mine in a good way and I came back birdie-birdie.

 Q. Is that kind of a sign that you're growing as a player, maturing as a player, that instead of going the opposite way you came back with birdies? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's fun when you're playing good, that you can come back and make some birdies, and those bad shots don't bother you as much. 

 Q. Plan for the afternoon?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Plan? Keep going, man, keep playing good.
