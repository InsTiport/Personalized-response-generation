  Q. It's got to be good putting yourself in position going into the last day.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was. It was a positive week. I keep learning, keep doing it. The greens get so firm and so quick and I get a little tentative with my putter, and that's exactly what happened today. Obviously I didn't hit the ball great and that's reflected in my score. But I felt great out there. That was my No. 1 goal coming into today, just to control my emotions, which I did.   
  
  Q. What everybody has been saying that about this course today was that the greens got so much firmer than on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it was a joke. It's amazing how the golf course changed from Friday to Monday. It is what it is. It just seems like the PGA TOUR every week tries to get those greens toasted on Sunday, and that's becoming the trend, which is okay, but you've just got to grind, grind and get used to it.  
  
  Q. You looked like you kept your nerves like you said you were trying to do this weekend. That's the biggest step you can take going into the rest of the FedExCup?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I know, and I keep learning. It'll come.   
  
  Q. You've been in this position before. What did you learn today? It's all about being in that position and learning something from it.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, I know one guy came out there and kicked our butts, that's for sure, and congrats to Vijay. He played unbelievable today.   
 But it was good. I keep learning. The greens got toasted and I got tentative with my putter, but my No. 1 goal coming into today was to control my emotions, be as calm as I felt yesterday when I shot 8-under, and I think I did a great job of it. I hit some putts that didn't go in, some little shaky putts, but again, I keep learning, keep battling, keep getting better, and I'll win, I know I will.
