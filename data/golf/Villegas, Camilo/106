   CAMILO VILLEGAS: Tough out there, but nothing new, though. It's a great golf course, a tough one, and it makes you think. I didn't drive the ball as good as I did yesterday, so it was a little bit harder to give myself birdie putts.   
 I still rolled some beautiful putts. Didn't happen to go in like they did yesterday, but any time you put a good stroke you go away happy.  
  
  Q. You'll be a little bit back at the start of the day. What's the thought tomorrow? Is it be as aggressive as you can because of the FedExCup, or what's --  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, you take it as it comes. Step on the first tee and play smart. It's a golf course where you cannot be too aggressive, but still, you want to give it a shot. So it'll be interesting.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts real quick on Sergio kind of running away from the pack right now, a little bit up.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I don't know where he is. Finished at 8? Well, that's five back. Tough golf course. Anything can happen, but I've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.
