 Q.  You've probably seen the best and worst of times at Riviera.  What was the difference for you?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: I wouldn't say worst of times.  Obviously I didn't play as good as yesterday.  I didn't get to a good start.  Silly double on the second hole and I was playing a little catch up.  Had a few chances there on the back, made a nice birdie on 11, 12, and lip-out on 13.   
But yeah, it's not as sharp as yesterday, even though -- it was fine.  I can go to my hotel and just kind of complain about it or I can just have a good attitude and come here tomorrow and then have a good weekend.   
 Q.  Bright side, 5-under, you're just three out of the lead, so still very much alive here?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, let's see what happens.  The greens were definitely rolling better this morning than they were rolling yesterday, and we'll see what happens with the guys out there.  It doesn't really matter, I'll just be back tomorrow with a good attitude, play some good golf, have a good weekend and put myself in position.   
 Q.  How do you make your you stay on the positive side, optimistic side, when you know you're just three back, but you've had some different experiences.  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's tough to see rounds like I played yesterday and it's very easy to see rounds 1-, 2-, 3-over.  I just happened to have one of those days today.   
 Q.  Next week is the start of the LatinoamÃ©rica Tour on your home course.  How much attention will you pay to that?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: I won't be there, but I'll be watching it all.  My brother won't be playing because he just had surgery.  My dad is involved big time with the golf course and will be there.  I'll be checking it closely.
