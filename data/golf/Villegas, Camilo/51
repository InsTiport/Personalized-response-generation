 Q. Talk about your round a little bit. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: A couple bogeys, a couple birdies. I hung in there. I was pretty patient, felt like I was playing pretty good for two thirds of the round and just didn't get anything going. I made birdie on 7 and 8, and unfortunately I made bogey on 9, just a bad drive. 
 But overall it's not an easy golf course. The wind started blowing for about the last nine holes, and it'll be interesting to see what happens in the afternoon.

 Q. You're still in decent position going into the weekend. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I think I'm 5-under. I'd say a little bit better than decent. I don't know, halfway there, just got to keep doing what I'm doing. 

 Q. Could you talk about your round today? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, a couple bogeys, a couple birdies, I hung in there. I was very patient. I had a couple birdies on 7 and 8, finished on 9 and bogeyed the last. But overall it's not playing easy out there. The wind was picking up a little bit in the afternoon, and we'll see what happens later.

 Q. Could you comment a little deeper on just how the golf course played today compared to your round yesterday?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, the greens definitely rolled smoother. We were out there at 7:30 in the morning. It played a little longer obviously with it being chilly this morning. I was wearing a sweater on the front nine. And then it got pretty good. Conditions are good.
