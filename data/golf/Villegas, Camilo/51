  Q. For a guy who plays such exciting golf, 17 pars and a birdie, very solid. Not wild but solid.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I tried to go without mistakes all day. Obviously if you don't have bogeys on your card, you haven't made too many and you probably had one or two good saves there, which was the case for me.  
  
  Q. How did you feel on 18 when the ball started spinning back?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: What an unbelievable shot I hit. Let me tell you, this points system, it changes so quick. It's messed up. It's just weird. But anyway, it's the same for everybody.   
 I love the way I played today. I love it because I knew I've had the pressure since the first hole, and it felt like things -- we'll see what happens at the end. I didn't make any bogeys.   
  
  Q. You're going to East Lake, a place you love. You've won there.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I hope you don't jinx me there, but if that's the case, hopefully I'm in, and 1-under par on this golf course today is a good score. I did my part, and hopefully that's good enough.
