  Q.  You had a great round yesterday.  Come out here today, played 12 holes, come back tomorrow?  You're stroking it, though.  You'll come back and break up the day a bit.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, I knew exactly how the day was going to look like after I saw the delay.  I knew I wasn't going to finish, so I just prepared for that mentally.  It's a fun game.  It's a great game.  I came out here, I bogeyed two out of the first three holes and all of a sudden I come from 2nd to 32nd, I think.  That just shows you how competitive it is.  It was nice to challenge myself to get back in it.  I did, I made some quick birdies, and then I got on a roll and birdied 15, 17, 18, 1, and then I just birdied 3 to go to 9-under.   
 Anyway, it's fun to be here, and I'll be back tomorrow nice and early.   
  
  Q.  That's a heck of a way to end it the way you started.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's a great game.  To be, I think, 2nd after I finished yesterday and to come out here and bogey two out of the first three holes, look at the leaderboard and all of a sudden I'm in 32nd or something, it shows you how competitive it is out here.  But I just gave myself a little kick in the butt, and I said, come on, let's get back in contention, let's challenge ourselves to make some birdies, and I did.  I played nicely from there on.  I knew I wasn't going to finish the round today and I was mentally prepared for that, and to be back out here tomorrow morning early and to keep it going.   
  
  Q.  How upset are you that you had to stop with all that momentum?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I knew I wasn't going to finish, so it was just part of the plan, part of the strategy for the day.  I'm just going to be back here tomorrow like everybody and keep playing some good golf.
