Q. Pars on the last two holes and you finish at 4-under.  Thoughts on your day?
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, you know what, I scored well today.  I've been playing some good rounds where I don't score very good, and today actually wasn't too pretty out there.  I missed a bunch of fairways and happened to get it around the green, and then made some good pars.  But.
I also made some great putts for birdie.  Tough golf course, long golf course.  Greens are getting fast.  So going to be an interesting week and just happy to get off to a good start.
Q. 135 worth of feet of putts made, so the flat stick was good?
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, for sure.  I rolled a lot of those in, some of those for birdies and some of those for pars.  The greens are not easy and they are getting fast and I was fortunate to find the bottom of the hole today.
Q. A 2 on a par 4 is pretty good, too.
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, you know what, it's funny.  I hit a beautiful shot into 17 and ended up 3-putting that one and then I hit a great shot into 18.  The ball is in the air and I looked up and said, be good, and they raised their hands; two, go to the next one.
Q. Long golf course.  Do you like this golf course for you?
CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's in very good shape.  It's maybe a little too long for my liking but it treat me good today.  Hopefully we'll keep it going the other few days and see what happens.
