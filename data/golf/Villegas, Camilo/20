Q.   Camilo, you were grinding out there today.   1-under making the turn.   I thought you made those birdies at 15 and 16 but then couple of bogies down the stretch.   Your thought on how it went today.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Obviously I didn't play as good as I played yesterday.   Started good, hit it good.   During the middle of the round I got some great up and downs and I had a little birdie there on 15, 16 and yeah, gave a couple back on the last ones.   I got no problem with that.   17 was a bad shot, but that's it.

Q.   7-under yesterday.   What do you take from today, the good or the bad, that you can build on on the weekend?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   It's funny, you shoot 7-under yesterday and I shoot 1-under today and they ask me what good or bad I take out of it with the emphasis on the bad.   I'm fine. 
The golf course is not easy.   7-under out here was pretty good yesterday, 1-under out here today wasn't bad.   I'll take that and keep going.

Q.   The putting, I thought you had like three good looks on the front-9, 12-footers you didn't make but then a great save at 10.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   10 was unbelievable.   I did it last year.   I can't go long left.   I did it again and, to be honest, when I'm on the fairway, let's take a 5 to my caddy.   I happened to sneak a little 4 out of there.   At the beginning I hit great putts, just kept touching the edge.   I felt great with the putter today.

Q.   Good start, you're 8-under, just 2 back right now and look forward to seeing you on the weekend. 
Not the strongest finish that you wanted for this round but, overall, how do you feel going into the weekend?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Good.   I didn't play as good as yesterday, really good.   I started great.   Hit great putts, just touching a couple lips.   The middle of the round I got loose and had some great up and downs.   I gave a couple way.   18 is a tough hole.   17 was not good.   It is what it is.

Q.   Momentum going into the weekend, I mean do you feel good about your position as far as being able to come away with --
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I'm probably going to be 2, 3, 4 back going into the weekend.   There's nothing wrong with that.   Momentum, I played great yesterday, I played okay today and got to keep it going.

Q.   Is there any difference at all with the way the wind played today compared to yesterday?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Little dew in the morning.   No wind.   Maybe a little bit softer because of the dew but, overall, very similar.
