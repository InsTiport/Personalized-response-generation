   CAMILO VILLEGAS: Overall, I'm pleased and tomorrow hope to get off to a better start and keep it going.   
  
  Q. Do you change out equipment week-to-week, like from here to Bay Hill to Augusta?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Not much.   
  
  Q. Do you travel with more clubs, extra drivers or putters?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: You have to have a backup driver, because you never know if something happens. But does it change? Not much.   
  
  Q. You came on to a big stage here, right?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I have great memories from 2006. It was a great week and I played great golf, and I finished second to Tiger my rookie year, it was special.   
  
  Q. Did you get it all frustrated on the golf course? What was the thing that frustrated you the most, putting, driving?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, you've got to do them all in order to play good golf. So do I get frustrated, we all do. I handle that frustration better today than I did a year ago or two years ago. I'm feeling good, and it's important to just keep moving forward.   
  
  Q. Have you enjoyed the number of Spanish-speaking fans?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I always get good support. It seems like every week, any place where I go, I see a lot, and it's very special. I have great love for my country and it means a lot having people out there supporting me and valuing what I do, the hard work that I do every day.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like the game is having an impact in South America?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I believe the game of golf has grown significantly in my country. People are learning, and the media and the fans out there support me in a great way. It motivates you to work hard.
