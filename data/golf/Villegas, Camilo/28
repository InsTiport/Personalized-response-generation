Q.   A long day, but how do you feel? 
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, three breakfasts, three warmups, two lunches, and a bunch of birdies which is good. 
It was a good day.   I was able to stay patient.   I knew it was going to be just a grind in terms of just all this stuff that was going on, and was happy to play well, happy to finish the round.   We'll be back tomorrow; what time, who knows.

Q.   You had a good stretch, 9 through 13. 
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, I hit a lot of them close, and especially on tough holes like 9 and 10.   9, 10 ‑‑ 11, I hit a great 5‑iron there, too, about seven feet.   Those are tough holes.   I was happy to take advantage of them, a couple good wedges.   On No. 3, I hit it really close and then on number‑‑ what's the first part‑‑ No. 8, I hit it really close. 
So I hit the ball good.   I hit the ball good.   I gave a couple back there on the back nine but I hit great putts on 17 and 18.   I thought I made those.   Overall, a very positive day.

Q.   You had a number of really good opening rounds so far this year, how disappointing is it and what can you do to change that? 
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Well, it's a new day.   A bad round is a bad round.   Doesn't matter if it's second round, third round, fourth round.   Obviously the fourth round hurts a little bit more because you have a chance to maybe win a golf tournament. 
My game is coming back.   I'm gaining confidence and I'm feeling better.   I'm excited and it's a matter of taking it one at a time and the game of golf, it's a crazy game.   It's great when we have the confidence.   It's not so good when you lack confidence. 
But I'm heading the right direction.   I'm pretty relaxed and I'm in a pretty happy state, and just we'll be back tomorrow and see what happens.

Q.   Do you realize that if you win this week, you're tied for the all‑time lead in points in the FedExCup Playoffs? 
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   That would be nice.   It's very early, but we'll just keep it going and see what happens. 

Q.   What is it about the Playoffs that you play so well? 
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I don't know.   I don't know if it's this crazy points system or what it is.   Obviously I was pretty hot in 2008 coming into the Playoffs, finishing fourth in the PGA and then going and finishing‑‑ missing the cut in The Barclays and then finishing third win, win. 
So what is it?   I don't know.   It's a points system that I still think we can get better.   We can get better.   I don't really think it's the most fair points system.   Is it exciting?   Yes.   You get big jumps. 
But even though I've played great in the Playoffs and the Playoffs have been good to me, I do believe that the points system is very exciting for the fans, very exciting for the sponsors.   It's cool for us because you can come‑from‑behind.   But I do believe we can get a little bit more fair.
