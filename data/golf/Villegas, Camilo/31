 Q.   Nice round today?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, birdied on the last, so as always it makes lunch taste a little better.   I played well.   I scored well.   I hit some bad shots out there, but I managed to save par.   When I hit the good ones, I managed to make birdies.   
   
 Q.   What kind of day was it?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, the wind switched a little bit, but the greens were receptive and the golf course is in great shape.   To be honest, I didn't look at a leaderboard all day, but it looked like there were some good scores out there.   
   
 Q.   Do you look at leaderboards?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Sometimes I do; sometimes I don't.   Depends on what kind of mood I'm in.   Today I just got back from Colombia and I'm in a pretty chill mode, and I just wanted to enjoy the round.   
   
 Q.   What do you like about this place?   
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I've played well here in the past.   I didn't play well on Sunday last year, but I like it here.   I like the golf course.   I like the way it looks off the tees, and I'm looking forward to the next few days.
