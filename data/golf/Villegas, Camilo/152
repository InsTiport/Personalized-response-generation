Q.
Talk about your round today and how it felt to move up the leaderboard.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It was fun.  I mean, to look at the crowds, just trying to enjoy and have fun out there.  I hit the ball awesome, just didn't putt very well, but it was still a good round and hopefully I'll finish strong tomorrow.
Q.  You talked about definitely making the cut on Saturday.  And the girls I saw you throw your ball to, the one girl on 16, how has the crowd been to you?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's awesome.  You've got to love it.  I don't know if we could take this every week, but you've just got to love it.  It's fun, they're awesome.  It's my first time out here, got a sponsor exemption, so I've got to say thanks for that.  Like I said, just trying to enjoy it, play good golf and it's awesome.
Q.  The leaderboard is so tight.  It's pretty much anybody's game tomorrow.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  You know, I haven't even checked on it.  J. J. Played awesome the second round.  There's some low scores out there, so it's a matter of coming out here, being positive and hitting one shot at a time, and we'll see what the outcome is.
Q.  What are you going to focus on going into tomorrow?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I'm probably going to go hit some putts.  I didn't putt so well today or yesterday.  Actually all week I haven't putted well.  Hopefully I can find that part of my game, keep hitting it well, and come out strong tomorrow.
Q.  You're sporting the yellow pants today.  What kind of outfit can we expect tomorrow?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I don't know.  We'll see.  We'll get creative tomorrow.
Q.  How were the crowds to you overall?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Awesome.  I didn't get booed.  That's good.  No, it was cool.  It was fun.  Like I said, it's unbelievable how many people are out there, and they're having fun, we're trying to have fun, and it's awesome.
