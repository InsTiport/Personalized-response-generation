   CAMILO VILLEGAS

 Q. You have to make up a few shots but you're still in the thick of things. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it was a good day, wish I had made a few more putts. Speed was nice, touch a couple of lips and I'll come back tomorrow and get it going. 

 Q. Who is having a bigger week, Camilo or Manuel Villegas? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I can tell you, I was following his round all morning. Now, I understand how my parents and all of those guys that follow us on internet feel, because you have no control of it. When you're on the golf course, at least you can control what you are doing. When you are watching or in front of the computer screen, it's a little tough. 
 But he had a good day and shot 3-under, was proud of the way he drove the ball and his emotions, and hopefully he'll be back tomorrow with a good one.

 Q. What do you teach him?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's tough. When I watch him on the range, he hits it so good, chips it so good, putts it so good, and it's just a little bit on his head. He's got to be a little bit more positive and forget about the negative things that are out there. He's working really hard and doing a better and better job every day. I'm excited for him. 

 Q. Getting back to tomorrow, you're going to be a decent amount of strokes behind; what is your game plan for Sunday?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: The same. It's a golf course where you can make a lot of birdies. The greens are rolling very good and then you've got a very tough finishing hole where everything can happen. 
 I'll do the same thing I did today where I didn't watch the leaderboard too much and was just focusing on my game and just stay in the present. 

 Q. Is there a number out there that you're looking to shoot? Do you think it's going to take a 62 or 63?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Not really. One at a time.
