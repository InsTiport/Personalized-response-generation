  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: The putter has been good. The best club has been the attitude. I've had a great attitude and that's important.   
  
  Q. You didn't change any, you didn't tweak any shafts or anything this year?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Nothing. Same thing. I like it that way.  
  
  Q. Driving's been good this year?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah.  
  
  Q. What do you like about that driver?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I've been using this one for awhile.   
 But it seems that I have a little better rhythm this year and when I put a good rhythm on the driver it goes good.  
  
  Q. How about today, pretty solid round today?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I made some birdies on the par-3s which are some tough holes; and I made some bogeys on the par-5s. Which are usually pretty easy. That's pretty frustrating.
