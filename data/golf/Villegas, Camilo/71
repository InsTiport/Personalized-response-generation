   CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was a grind. It's tough out there.   
 A little disappointed, I 3-putted last hole and I made a bogey, only bogey of the day. But I'm happy with what I did. I mean, I missed several fairways and I missed several greens, but everybody is going to do that on a day like today and I just managed to get them up-and-down.  
  
  Q. You do you reflect that 2-under par in conditions like this is a good score, given the awkwardness and the way other players are playing, as well?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, that's what the leaderboard is showing so far. We'll see what it looks like by the end of the day.  
  
  Q. How treacherous was it out there with the severity of the wind and the rough?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was playable but it was tough. I just hope the wind continues for the boys this afternoon, but doesn't get too strong to the point where maybe it becomes unplayable.  
  
  Q. Were you having to just accommodate from what you expected, the balance of playing in the Pro-Am?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, I had a chance to play yesterday in the Pro-Am and that was miserable. It was tough.   
 Honestly I wasn't paying too much attention yesterday, but we were talking about it, you know what, it probably helped a little bit.
