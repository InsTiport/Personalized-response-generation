Q.
We thank Camilo Villegas for stopping in at the 2006 Verizon Heritage.  Camilo, your first time here, although you had a chance a couple of years ago after winning the Amateur Tournament here?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, I do.  I won the Players Amateur, what was it, three years ago?  And the following year I had SCC during that week.  So first things first.  I was representing them and that's what we needed to do, play the SCC.  Last year I was hoping to get in, but unfortunately    unfortunately there was not a spot for me last year, and now we're here this year.
Q.  Let's talk about that incredible start you've gotten off to on the Tour; T 2s at the FBR Open and the Ford Championship at Doral, and a T 3 at The PLAYERS Championship.  You're compiling some great statistics as a rookie out here?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's been a fun year.  It's been very fun.  I've been working hard.  And I had a better start than I expected.  But you've just got to practice hard, learn, have fun and take whatever comes.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I just had two weeks off, so I've heard great things about this place, good    the golf course.  I played two holes today.  We've only played two holes, and I already like this place.  The golf course is very different than all the golf courses I've played on Tour, and it's going to make you think a lot and it's going to be a great challenge.  I'm playing this week, playing next week, and unfortunately I cannot be in New Orleans, I've got to do some stuff.  So I'll take a break and get it going again.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  One, two.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I've only played two holes, but    I played 18 today.  But after two holes, I'm liking this place.  A lot of overhanging trees.  And it's not a bomber's course.  You've just got to work your way around and be smart and hit good quality shots and it's going to be a great challenge, like I said.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Talking about Bubba?
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Let me tell you, I know I'm up there in the driving statistics, distance.  Everybody pays a lot of attention to that.  I don't, really, to be honest.  If I'm thinking there's a golf course because it's too short and I can't play it because it's too short, now we're getting into problems.  So you go to every golf course, you look at the positive things.  You try to enjoy it.  And it's the same for everybody.  So you just go play golf and do the best you can.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's been awesome.  It's fun to know that there's people out there supporting you.  And obviously when you play good your schedule and your time reduces a lot.  You've got to be more organized and make sure you're sticking to your plans, taking care of business and then making other people happy.  So it's just a matter of being organized, playing golf, come here, talk to you guys, go sign some autographs.  But bottom line you've got to stick to your routine, and the main goal is to play good golf.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I like to know what my things are, let's put it that way.
Q.  (Inaudible?)
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Right here, and I actually didn't lose my phone yesterday.  I had a little trouble and I was driving up, phone perfect, on the phone all the time, put it on the side, picked it up ten minutes later, gone, dead, blank.  Go there, my phones are not in the same current   they were in the phone.  There's no way to get the phone.  I got a new phone with no numbers.  I know my brother's number, and that's about it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I was struggling last year with my putting, hitting the ball good, and figured I had to do something about it.  And maybe reading the greens was going    reading the greens better was going to help me.  So middle of the round I went straight down there, tried to get real close to the ground.  I Liked it, felt good, and kept doing it ever since.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, TPC was a great example.  I go down there, second to last hole I'm playing pretty good and all of a sudden I'm over the ball and everybody is like    it's pretty loud, loving and I don't know, making fun or enjoying what I was doing down there close to the ground.  But I go, okay, just ignore them and hit it.  And I hit it and made it.

But, yeah, you get reaction from people.  And I don't know, some people like it.  I don't really know what other players or what other people think about it.  But, you know what, if it works, I'll keep doing it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Masters is past, by the way.  No, it was great to have a chance to get in it.  I worked my butt off and we came really close.  But again, I had two great weeks off, watched the Tournament on TV and time to work again.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  No, no, no.  I mean it's just that.  And you know what?  I swing at it hard.  But those guys hit it far, a long way.  Bubba and J.B. hit it a long way.  It doesn't bother me where people, the media put me.  I just go out there, try to take care of business and try to control the things I can control.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  A lot of courses in Colombia, I can't like this, not very long, and not the one I grew up.  I played a lot of junior golf in Colombia, and a lot of tree lined golf courses like this one.  I like it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, it's my first year out here, and let me tell you, not knowing the golf courses is tough.  A great example, I played with Jesper, Jesper has been here many times, and he's hitting shots and hitting shots, and I'm making sure I'm visualizing things and taking notes.  It makes your weeks long.  But in terms of golf courses where young players have to    I don't know many golf courses, so I couldn't answer that question.  I think this is just a great golf course.  If there's somebody that's not going to come here because of it, it's their own decision, but I like it.
