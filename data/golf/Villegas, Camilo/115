   CAMILO VILLEGAS: Today it was definitely more playable and, yeah, it was easier to find the fairway. So I hit a lot of fairways today, obviously a lot of greens and gave myself a lot of good looks at birdie. 

 Q. Now, did the course set up, did you find a little more conditions for scoring today?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it was definitely a little softer than yesterday. It was borderline unplayable yesterday afternoon and it was definitely more playable today.
