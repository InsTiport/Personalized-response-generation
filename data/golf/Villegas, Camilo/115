  Q. Can you just talk about how nicely you came back this weekend?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I did. You know what, I didn't hit the ball very good the first to days, but man, I battled hard. I was very proud of myself there. And then I hit the ball awesome yesterday and just gave a couple away.  
 But today, again, a couple par putts that I kind of missed but I'm proud of myself. I battled and I hung tight.   
  
  Q. Always nice to shoot 68 in the final round.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It is.   
  
  Q. How happy are you to be 2-under par on a tough golf course?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Man, I thought it was tough weather, and, oh, it hurt to miss those par putts that I missed, but I'm just proud of myself the way I hung tight.   
 It's a tough golf course, a tough tournament and it's a major, and I gave myself a chance. Even though I didn't get off to a good start today, I'm proud of myself today.
