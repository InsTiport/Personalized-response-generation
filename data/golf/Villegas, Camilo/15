Q.   Two aces?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   How about that? 

Q.   Have you ever come close to doing anything like that in practise, playing, anything? 
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   I made a few hole‑in‑ones, but it's pretty special to make them here.   Kind of nice to make them playing with Keegan. 

Q.   When the first one goes in, that has to be just a huge thrill and what was it like when you see it go in on 8, as well?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   It kept trickling back and it was good and it goes in the hole.   Funny, the second one, we were a little more emotional there.   We just kind of jumped.   Enjoying it, man.

Q.   Now you've got to do it in the playoffs, don't you?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   I guess, I don't know.   A couple of guys that are 4‑under. 

Q.   What did you hit on 4 and on 8?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   On 4, I hit pitching wedge, and then on 8, I hit a 54 degree.

Q.   How many have you had in your life?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   Do I count those or not? 

Q.   Before today?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   14.

Q.   14 before today? 
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   Yeah.

Q.   So it's nothing new for you. 
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   You know what, I actually made one last week.   Made one on Saturday. 

Q.   During competition?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   No, no, no.   Just at home.

Q.   Back home? 
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   Yeah.   5‑iron, little longer than this one.

Q.   A little tougher.   That has to be a huge thrill?
CAMILOVILLEGAS:   Always.   You're aiming at the hole, it goes in, nice shot.
