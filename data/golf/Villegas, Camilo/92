   MARK WILLIAMS: Camilo, great round today. Welcome to the media center. Just talk about, I know you were in Australia last week and traveling back and then playing in Australia. Talk about your experience last week and being here in your match today.  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I really worked on my tan last week. I got there Friday, the golf course was closed, Saturday, Sunday, so I just went to the beach. Then I missed the cut and I couldn't change my flight, so I went to the beach again, I guess.   
 But, no, I came back. I had a great night of sleeping, couple days ago, yesterday was a good night of sleep, so I'm excited to be here and be playing and excited that I got through the first one.   
 MARK WILLIAMS: When you saw your draw against Pampling, he had some good form late last year and this year, were your expectations high?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, my expectations are always high, but, trust me, there's 64 players here, they all have great accomplishments, they all can play golf and it's only 18 holes of golf out there, so you better get it going and you better stick to your plan and play some good golf.   
 MARK WILLIAMS: Tell us your thoughts on the golf course.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I thought the golf course played better today than it did yesterday. Apparently they put a little water on the greens and it was a little more controllable, manageable to hit it close to the green or to the pins.   
 I hit the ball good today and that's why I won.   
  
  Q. In the match, what would you say was the key for your win today and what did you do better in order to pull it out?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I didn't really make many mistakes. I kept the ball in play. I had some good birdies; don't even ask me where, because I can't remember.   
 But also Pampling gave me a couple gifts out there. A couple times he hit bad chips and it gave me a couple opportunities to get ahead in the match.   
  
  Q. There's some players who like match play, others that don't; they feel that there's too many things out there that can happen that are just kind of luck. What's your feeling about match play? Do you like it, prefer it, or would you rather not play it?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, I'm here, and there's one reason why I'm here; I like this place. I like the format. I mean, we don't do it enough.   
 Yes, anybody can beat you, and maybe not the best player's going to win every time, but that's golf. That's just how the guys do it in tennis every week. Why can't we do it at least for one or two weeks a year.   
  
  Q. You mentioned the greens. Just curious if you've ever seen greens anything like this anywhere in the world. No?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: No.   
  
  Q. Prior to this where would you say is equally difficult to get approach shots close?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I don't know, I probably don't want to compare it with another golf course. I got to say it's unique, it's different, the greens are very severe, so severe that we can only play them at about 10 on the Stimpmeter and I guess it's the same for everybody.   
 MARK WILLIAMS: Well, thanks for coming in. We appreciate your time.  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Perfect.
