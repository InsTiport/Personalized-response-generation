  Q. You started off rough with the double-bogey, but came back nicely?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it was crazy, my gosh, what a bad tee shot, second shot, third shot, everything on that first hole. Looked like I was going to make 8 on that first hole.   
 But I came back nice. Came back nice. I parred 2, 3, good par on 4. And from there on, I looked at my caddie, and go, Come on, man, we've done this before. We came back at the end of last year and let's get back into this thing.   
 Geoff is playing great, and it's tough to compete against him when you're making mistakes like I did on the first hole today. Tomorrow is another day and a lot to play for. You never know. I mean, it's a golf course where you can be very aggressive and you can also make big numbers. I'll be giving it my best.  
  
  Q. Being aggressive, is that the key?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Any time you're 6 or 7 back, you have to be aggressive.  
  
  Q. Some people say it takes a bogey to get your round kick started, but you had a double-bogey, and then after 5, you just got it going.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I did. Awful hole that first one. I don't think I hit a good shot, and still had a 6; should have been about an 8.   
 But anyway, came back and started with a birdie on 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 11, I hit a good putt and thought it was going to go in, and 12 I hit it to five feet and missed it.   
 Birdied 14 and 15, and on 16, I hit it to seven feet for birdie again. Missed that one and the one on 18.   
 But I'm proud of myself and I'm proud of the way I came back. It's hard to make a double-bogey on the first hole and feel like you're out of the tournament. But guess what, you've got your heart and you can keep battling and get back in it.   
  
  Q. You learned that from your two wins late in the year. How does it feel to be playing this good this early?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's good. Practice rounds, I hit the ball so bad around here and with this wind, I thought I was going to shoot 80s. The first day, I go in and hit 17 greens. I was putting great, and all of a sudden, I had 37 putts that first round. Like I said, it's a crazy game and looking forward to tomorrow.
