   JOAN V.T. ALEXANDER: Thank you, Camilo, for joining us here in the media center at the BMW Championship, another great start to your week like last week, and you're slowly inching your way up that FedExCup play off list.  You're in 34th, so feeling pretty good.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, it was a really good day out there today, very consistent, hit some good shots the first 12 holes.  The first four birdies were from very close, maybe five, six feet at the most.   
 Then I got to the 15th hole and hit two beautiful shots and rolled in a nice putt for eagle.  That's always motivating.   
 Came back with a bogey on 16, but guess what, a nice birdie on 17, and 6-under for the day.  It's a long week, three days to go, but just got to keep going.   
  
  Q.  The conditions out there, I mean, I know you were playing lift, clean and place, but I gather from previous interviews here that maybe -- the course wasn't all that wet where it had to be done?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Let's put it this way:  I totally forgot the first four holes.  The ball was sitting perfect on the fairway.  It's something we've got to do.  If we expect really bad weather like we did today, a lot of rain, and say the guys in the morning get away without rain and then the guys in the afternoon get damp, it's just unfair.  I mean, you want to have the conditions as level as possible.  We've been lucky so far today we haven't had the rain, and it's the same thing for everybody.   
 JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Let's go through your round.  Birdie on 1.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I hit a great 3-wood off the tee, and then I hit it to about two and a half feet.  Tap-in birdie.   
 Then on 5, I hit a good drive and I hit a beautiful 7-iron to about three and a half feet, birdie.   
 7th hole, I hit -- that 7th hole wasn't playing easy off the tee.  I hit it in the right bunker and then I hit a great 8-iron to about three feet.   
 Then on the 10th hole, I hit driver on the 10th hole, and I got about three yards from the green.  There's a little strip there, you guys probably remember where Tiger drove it through those two bunkers.  Guess what, I drove it through those two bunkers and it was about two yards from the green.  Nice little chip to about five, six feet, and made the putt for birdie.   
 Like I said earlier, 15, I hit a great drive.  I hit a great 3-wood.  It was blowing hard into the wind, and left myself about a 20-footer down the hill.  Tricky putt but I happened to read it the right way and made eagle there.   
 16th hole, I hit an awful tee shot.  I pulled it and it hit a tree, and I was not in the hazard but I had to chip it out.  I chipped it out and I hit a great third shot about 12 feet short of the hole, but just didn't hit it, bogey.   
 And then, like I said, I came back with a nice birdie on 17, hit ray good drive down the middle, then I hit a pitching wedge and made about a 15-footer up the hill.   
  
  Q.  Is top 30, making it to Atlanta, your goal this season?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I think it's everybody's goals at the beginning of the year to play the TOUR Championship, a 30-man field.  Yes, it is, but I can't be thinking about that.  I'm working hard.  I'm trying hard out there, and I know exactly what I need to do, I've just got to keep doing the same things I've been doing the last three weeks.   
  
  Q.  Do you think the low scoring is going to continue through the tournament?  How does that affect your approach going into the round?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It all depends on the weather, but it can only get softer apparently from what I've seen in the forecast.  If it's soft and the greens are rolling the way they are, which are rolling very good, I think we're going to keep seeing low scores.   
  
  Q.  I was thinking, have you talked to Angel Cabrera about the way he won the U.S. Open, the way he was received back home, the way he was --   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I mean, I did call him after he won and congratulate him.  I had a chance to speak with him, obviously very excited.  I mean, it's a major.  It's a great thing for golf in Latin America.  He's always been a very good player and will continue to be that way.   
  
  Q.  Are people in Colombia getting excited about golf?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Golf is very small in Colombia.  It's all about soccer.  Golf is growing there.  And that's one of my goals.  The fans and the media have learned a lot.  They've been very supportive, and that's nice.   
  
  Q.  You said a second ago you've identified what you need to work on, what you need to focus on to improve.  Can you elaborate on that?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I meant what I've got to keep doing this week to be playing the TOUR Championship.  Obviously we're out here to win golf tournaments, but I believe if I finish top 8 I will be in for next week.  I would love to finish top 8.  Obviously I'm trying to win the golf tournament, trying to hit one shot at a time, and it's not going to change the way I play out there.  Same thing.   
  
  Q.  How often do you get back to Colombia?  How many golf courses are there in the country?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I don't get there enough, let's put it that way.  But we've got about 40 golf courses.  Like I said, it's a very small sport, but it's growing, and hopefully it will continue to grow.  But I don't get there enough.  I love my country and I miss it.   
 JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Camilo.
