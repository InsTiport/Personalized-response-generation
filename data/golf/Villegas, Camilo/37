 Q.   How did you play today?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I played okay.   I wish I would have scored two or three less, but it is what it is.   
I also made some par saves.   I hit a couple iron shots to the right and I made some great up‑and‑downs, so I didn't make any bogeys.   So it is okay.   I just got to keep it going.  
   
 Q.   You shot real low yesterday, do you feel like you're in a good position to contend for the weekend?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Oh, you got to shoot low here.   History shows that I think that these courses, the scores are low today just like yesterday.   I know weather might get us tomorrow, it might be very interesting, so looking forward to that.   
And again, it all depends on what the weather gives us tomorrow.   If it's good, you got to keep going low.   If it's tricky, then it might be a little different than what the guys are used to over here.   
   
 Q.   Did you like Nicklaus more than Palmer today?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Well I liked my score better, I can tell you that.   But the three golf courses are good golf courses.   They're in great shape.   And what a good place, good weather, this time of year.  
   
 Q.   You had a chance to make up two strokes on the last hole were you a little disappointed to end with a par?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Yeah, you're always trying to get on the green and maybe have a chance to eagle.   But I just didn't hit a very good second shot, I went with the five and, yeah, it was short, but it is what it is.
