  Q. Nice job. Birdie there to cap off a good opening round.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It was. It was getting a little dark on 9, and obviously I wanted to finish the round, and to do it that way is nice. Makes it better. It's going to be a quick turnaround to be out here this morning.   
 I hit the ball nicely today. Rolled some nice putts, a couple nice par saves, and that's what it takes around what is almost the best golf course we play on Tour. I love this place, I keep coming, and hopefully we don't move it because the tournament director and everyone around here does a great job to support the game of golf, and it would be nice to see a sponsor step up and keep this great event going.  
  
  Q. What's the key during an over two-hour delay and come out and play good golf?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I heard the horn, I went straight to the house, and I jumped in the shower, took my clothes off, throw it in the laundry and I told my caddie to let me know if they're going to come back out. If it be that way, I tried to get an outfit as close as I had before, and finished par, par, par, birdie, which is nice.
