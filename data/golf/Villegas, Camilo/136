   JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thanks, Camilo, for joining us for a few minutes.  This is your second event of the year, but you had some good success here last year, and this should be helpful going into the week. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, it was a fun week last year here.  A little different than most tournaments we play, but it's fun.  Fans go a little bit off the board, but like I said, not many events like this one out there.  I had lots of fun last year. 

 Q.  Is there a part of your game that you're currently working on right now, something you're focusing on you? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Everything.  Always working on everything. 

 Q.  Nothing specific right now that comes to mind? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, you've got to drive it good, you've got to hit your irons good, you've got to putt it good, and it's pretty competitive out here, so you've got to stay on top of everything. 

 Q.  Looking forward to the U.S. Masters pretty soon, have you been to Augusta National before? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Never.  Actually I haven't played it.  I've been there, I just haven't played the golf course. 

 Q.  You've been there? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Uh-huh. 

 Q.  When was that? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I was there twice, in 2000 I think it was, and '02, I think, somewhere around there. 

 Q.  You must be really looking forward to that. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah.  It was fun to get back from a good break back home and see the invitation in the mail.  It'll be a special week, and I'm really looking forward for it. 

 Q.  You played well here last year.  Does this course suit your game? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yes, I played well, and I'm looking forward for this week, but it's a different week.  I mean, last year is last year.  We're in '07 now, and the fact that I played good last year doesn't mean I'm going to play good this year. 
 So I've just got to do all the right things and have a good attitude toward this week. 

 Q.  Do you like this course? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yes, it's good.  It's in good shape. 

 Q.  What's the best golf tip you've ever gotten? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Best golf tip?  Don't think, just hit it. 

 Q.  Who gave it to you? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It was a long time ago, just a good friend of mine. 

 Q.  Again about the Masters looming up, how nervous do you think you'll be on that 1st tee getting ready to tee it up? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I have no clue.  I've played for a year out here, and I feel more and more comfortable every time.  Obviously that will be a special week.  It's a major.  But I've had a chance to play some other majors.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  I'm really looking forward to standing on that 1st tee and having a good week. 

 Q.  What will you be going there to do, to achieve? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  What was that? 

 Q.  What will you be going to Augusta to do, to achieve? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  What do you mean? 

 Q.  Realistically, to make the cut, survive the cut? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Just wake up every morning with a great attitude and go play golf, and we'll see what happens.
