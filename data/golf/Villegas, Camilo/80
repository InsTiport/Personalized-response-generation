 Q. Any round without a bogey is a good one; how good was that one?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, it was solid. I hit a lot better shots today than yesterday. Obviously yesterday was two bogeys on par 5s, so those don't bring a smile to your face, and playing 18 holes, no bogeys, no major mistakes and just rolled some great putts that didn't go in. But still a good round, 4-under, hanging in there and we'll be back tomorrow. 

 Q. How are you enjoying Loch Lomond? 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It's beautiful. Look at this weather, I heard it's not usually like this, but what a beautiful place and what a great golf course, and I'm excited to be here.

 Q. How are you feeling good your game coming into this week?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS; it's good. I got a golf lesson last week, just tweak it up a little bit and it's feeling good. It's feeling better and better every day, and looking forward for the weekend and next week. 

 Q. Have you been over to Turnberry and have a practice round?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I haven't. I heard great things about it. I heard it's going to be tough. It going to be a challenge for all of us and I'm looking forward for it.

 Q. How do you feel about your position in this championship now?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: There are a lot of guys still to play in the afternoon and who is going to be leading after today. I'm just happy to post a good round today, and like you said, no bogeys and just keep improving, keep improving and see what happens.
