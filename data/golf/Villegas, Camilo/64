 Q. You told us all week that you were working on your attitude. How important was that going forward to winning this match after the disappointment you suffered this morning?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: You know, it was a tough morning. I knew I had a good chance of winning this championship, but it slipped away from me. But I wanted to win that match in the afternoon. I was playing so good and with such a great friend. Sometimes it's hard to play a great friend. Are we not going to talk? Are we going to keep it very serious? 
 I had one thing in mind this week, and I just walked ahead of my opponent and focused on my game and not too much chatting. And that's what I did. I focused on my game. I played good golf. I birdied 7, 8, 9. 9 was an unbelievable shot. And then I parred 10 and birdied 11. So I played good there and ended up winning the match.

 Q. What kind of springboard does it give you for the rest of the season? You're playing so well and your attitude is good?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, it tells me two things: One, that I'm heading in the right direction, and two, that I have to continue to go in that direction because there's no time for blinking out here. So I have to keep getting better and keep having fun.
