   CAMILO VILLEGAS: Got a little quick with it. Unbelievable second shot, but I gave myself a chance, because I know that second shot wasn't easy. But you still had to make a six and a half footer for par to halve the hole. I'm fine with it. But, you know, it's golf.   
 I've been working on my attitude this week. It's been unbelievable. If I can continue to do what I've been doing this week the rest of the year, it's going to be a great rest of the year.  
  
  Q. Talk about playing Sergio later today?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It will be fun. Good friends and just -- good friends. I'm sure we're going to have fun out there. But still he wants to beat me, I want to beat him. That's what we do for a living. We play golf and try to win tournaments. It will be interesting.  
  
  Q. How tough was it today?  
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: It wasn't as tough as I thought.   
 Last night, it was a couple of mixed feelings, I would say. You say, you know what, I missed that putt on 14, but look at the shot I hit on 13. I mean that's -- to me, that bunker shot can be one of the best -- it's probably the best shot I have ever hit. And I put it under one of the best shots in golf, under the circumstances. That's fine.   
 Again, I was 1-down going to 18. I won the hole, gave myself a chance. Like I said, there was mixed feelings last night. But I took it very good. I took the loss very good, we played 24 holes, and anyone could have won. If I keep this attitude the rest of the year, I think it's going to be a good year and a fun year, because I'm having fun.
