 Q. Good start to the week for you?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I mean you're either going to win or lose. I just tried to do my best. Dustin, a good player who's been obviously pretty hot this year, winning last week. And maybe that got him a little more relaxed and I took a little advantage of that. I kept it in play and he missed a couple of fairways, which kind of killed him. 

 Q. Talk about the start. He got off to a pretty good start, straight away. 
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: I know. He pretty much conceded the first four holes. I kept it in play, I hit a great shot on 1, I hit a great shot on 2, hit a great shot on 3, and hit a great shot on 4, and he was in trouble. So I had a lot of birdie looks there, and he was looking always at par -- missing his pars and conceding. It's nice to get to a good start, but you have to stay on top of it.

 Q. Did it surprise you that he started that slowly?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: No, it's match play, there's guys that start slow, come back fast, and guys that start fast and kind of slow down a little bit. And you never know what you're going to have that day. It can go on your side or it can go on his side. And again I just took advantage of the first four holes and kind of kept it in play.

 Q. What about your chances overall this week, how are you feeling about the shape of your game?
 CAMILO VILLEGAS: There's 64 great players here, and we're always trying. There's 18-hole matches and anything can happen. No. 1 seed can lose to a 64 seed or it can happen the other way around. So we just keep staying in the present and hitting one shot at a time and just having fun out here.
