   JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  You started off good, hit a great tee ball, must have felt you were in pretty good position there.   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  It's a tough hole.  I was still a little in-between clubs there between a five and a four and decided to hit the five just because of the wind, trying to play it from the middle of the green toward the flag and just hit a bad shot.  I had a really bad lie there but I had to play like I hit a good shot.  I hit a great third shot, and just missed the putt.  I was feeling good over it.  I was talking to my caddie right now and I wasn't shaking as much as I thought.  You know what, it's a learning process and we're one step further.   
  
  Q.  As far as talking about your club selection, did any of that stuff change, Wilson hit a good second shot in there; did that change your mind-set or not?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  He hit a great shot.  Not really.  Not really I kind of always had more the five and the four, because the flag is on the left.  If I'm going to hit a four, I'm going to have to cut it a little bit with the wind going right-to-left.   
 If I'm going to hit a five, I can aim to the far right even to the right in between and just turn it in there with the wind and obviously the wind is going to -- once it starts drawing, it's going to help it a little bit to go all the way back there.  I just hit a bad shot.  I hit a great third shot and didn't make the putt.   
  
  Q.  Heading from one tough golf course to another one at Innisbrook, looking forward to getting back out there?   
 CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, that is a great track there.  It's a good tournament and I'm looking forward for this coming week and playing well.
