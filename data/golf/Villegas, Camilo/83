   On the eagle... 
 CAMILLO VILLEGAS: It's a funny game. I didn't hit my best second shot. I didn't have a good lie. But I remembered Tiger making that one from up there and that went through my head. Funny enough, the putt started trickling down there and just went in the hole. I'll take that one.
 Holes 16, 17 and 18 are tough finishing holes. You just have to go for good swings and hit your targets and post a score. I was fortunate enough I played great on my back nine. I got on a little roll there, and hey, 5 under is good. I had a good birdie on 5 and 6 and then a great birdie on #7. I was a little disappointed I didn't birdie #8.
 The greens were a little softer today, but still the course is not easy. It's still tough to roll the putts. It's a great test. I love it.
