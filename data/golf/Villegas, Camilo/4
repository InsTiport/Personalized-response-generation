 Q.  You found a lot of birdies out there in that opening round; eight birdies, offset by a couple bogeys.  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, I played nicely.  I kept the ball in play, obviously made some putts to make the birdies, and it was a nice chill day out there.  The greens are rolling pure, and I had a nice group.  We were pretty relaxed, chatting.  I haven't played with Heath or Troy in a while, and just going back, telling stories, and keeping it loose.   
 Q.  Ball-striking was pretty good; you hit 14 greens.  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Did I?  That's good.  Any time you shoot 6-under par, you probably did something right.  I think I did a mix of everything today.  I hit the ball good off the tee, hit some nice wedges in there, and I rolled some putts, so obviously happy with the score, and looking forward to the next few weeks.   
 Q.  Tell me a little bit about the rough because you see it and it doesn't look very thick, and yet I go up and it's like an inch and a half, two inches, and the ball is sinking down to the bottom.  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, for sure, it's Bermuda rough.  It's healthy.  It's healthy but thin enough to where it goes down, and it's tough, man.  It's tough.  Any time you have Bermuda -- I think Bermuda rough is tougher than the long rye rough.  I managed to stay away from it most of the day, and it worked out.   
 Q.  First time here in Mississippi since 2004.  Mississippi seems to be treating you well with a 66.  What went well for you to allow you to score so well today?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Yeah, well, any time you shoot 6-under par, you've played nicely and you've done something right.  I managed to read the greens good and rolled some putts.  Greens are rolling spectacular, one of the best greens we play all year.  First time for me around this place, and it's --   
 Q.  Everyone says that; why so good?  
CAMILO VILLEGAS: Well, just go look at them.  They're so smooth and fast, and that grass is very healthy.  It's just rolling beautiful.   
So yes, it was a great day.  We managed to keep it pretty chill out there.  I had a nice group.  I haven't played with Heath or Troy in a while, telling stories and just keeping it loose, and it worked out.
