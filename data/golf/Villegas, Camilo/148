Q.  Can you just talk about your week overall, the crowd obviously in your favor, how much fun was it for you?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Oh, it was just unbelievable.  It's hard to describe in words.  I knew there were there Colombian people in Miami, but I didn't know there were that many.  It was really fun and they motivated me.

I think I've learned to like big crowds.  I played with Michelle Wie in Hawaii and that felt great, and FBR, biggest crowds of the year, that felt awesome.  This week, very exciting crowd and I felt good again and played well.  So, I like it, I enjoy it.
Q.  How much does this do for you for the rest of the year in terms of confidence?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  You know what, FBR showed me a little something and this week showed me a little more.  Playing golf, just keep having fun, keep learning.  We'll see what happens.
Q.  On 1, you had a pretty good shot, did you allow yourself to think that you had a chance to win at that point with that eagle?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Well, I had 17 holes after that.  I didn't look at a leaderboard until 17, I just wanted to see where I was and what I had to do on 18.  I mean, I can't control what Tiger or David or the other guys are doing out there.  I can just control my game, and I was just trying to keep it flowing and keep having fun.
Q.  What did you hit on 1?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I hit a 7 iron.
Q.  When you saw the leaderboard on 17, what were your emotions; disappointed, happy or sad?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  You know what, I just, when I saw it, I go like one more hole to go.  Anything can happen on 18.  I just focus on that drive.

To be really honest, it didn't mean much.  Tiger played awesome and I played well, I had fun and it was just one more hole to go.
Q.  I'm sure you're not surprised, are you impressed with
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  We are talking here about the best player in the world.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  You know what, I never thought about it, I never thought about that I have Tiger up there.  Once again, I can't control what they do, so I was just trying to focus on myself.  And I'm proud of the way I handled myself this week.
Q.  If you ever get back here for a World Golf Championships, do you think the fourth hole might owe you a couple?  You had some tough breaks on 4 all week?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I did.  But it's fine, they are two tough, long, par 3s.
Q.  What do you think you need to work on to take the next step?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I don't know.  I just think I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.  I've been working hard in the weight room and there are some little things I need to work on.  I've been working hard on my swing.  I've been working hard on my mental game.

Out here, you've just got to keep working and working.  You cannot take a nap or everybody will rush and go by you.
Q.  Talk about your shoes.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Gator orange.
Q.  What's the material?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  No, it's just a regular material.  I heard a lot of Gators out there yesterday and I think they liked it.
