  CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I managed to finish a good round and get myself a little bit back in it.

Q.   You've also been coming on this course over past years playing here.   Obviously you don't know what's going to happen the rest of the day.   Do you feel happy where you are?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Pin placements are good today.   It's not blowing as hard as yesterday, but I think this golf course always tricky.   It's never very easy to see the 6 and 7-unders.   Those guys are good.   Never know what's going to happen.   I hope by the end of the day, I'm somewhat in there and give myself a chance and come back tomorrow and play a good round and see what happens.

Q.   You talked about this being a tricky course.   The results you've had in the Top-10s, the top 25s, what is it about the course where you score well?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   I say tricky because it's hard, but it's hard in a good way.   It's a great golf course.   Obviously I like it.   Obviously I'm a little biased.   I've been coming here a long time and playing good golf.   You got to hit shots.   You know what, the greens, these might be the best rolling greens we've had all year.   It's unbelievable.   We talked with a few players.   You get it going, you're going the make some putts.   The golf course is in great shape.   It hasn't rained the last five, six, seven days.   The fairways are nice and firm.   It's playing the way it's supposed to be played, and today was a good round.

Q.   Talk about the one you rolled in I guess on 15?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   15.   You know, I hit 5-wood off the tee because I hit 3-wood yesterday and got blocked with it with the tree.   I was a little far back.   I tried to play safe.   I played to the middle of the green.   I had a long putt and trying to lag it up there, and the ball kept going, going, going.   And you know what, it's one of those you don't expect but you take it and run out of there.

Q.   That gave you some momentum on that stretch.
CAMILO VILLEGAS:   Then I went and hit a great drive on the next hole, 16th hole.   That's a tough, tricky little pin placement on 16 over the left bunker.   You're not sure you should play it to the front part of the green, hard to stop it in the back.   Sort of played in one of those bunkers and get up and down.   I made a good 4 there and then yes, a little hiccup on 17.   I pushed it and kind of had a bad lie there right next to the tree.   I had not much to do.   Believe it or not, I 3-putted No. 17 after a great day date of putting.   You can't make them all.
