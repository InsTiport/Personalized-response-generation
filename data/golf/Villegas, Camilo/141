Q.  Is that the name of your game, playing better and better and the better?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I thought I played pretty consistent.  We all made a bogey, everybody makes bogey.  Just have to get up and down.  I played solid.  I was very proud of myself, hit some great shots, made some great putts and put myself in good position for the weekend.
Q.  Great position going into the weekend.  What's your plan?  Do you have the same type of game or what?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  We're just happy to be there.  All you want to do is make the cut.  Second, you want to put yourself in position to play for Sunday, and we're doing okay.  I don't know what the wind is going to do tomorrow.  I don't know how the greens are going to firm up tomorrow, but got to keep hitting shots, keep making putts and keep having fun.
Q.  What does it mean to be representing Columbia?  Did you see the people out there?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Yeah, I did.  It's been happening in most of the weeks, which is awesome, support from Columbia and the people and the Columbians in the States have been very, very good, and I want to keep working hard and keep plugging to get better and better.
Q.  Do we have a misconception of what Columbia is all about?

A    Oh, definitely.
Q.  How so?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Sit down and tell you a story book.  It's just not the way it is.  We just have the reputation for the less than one percent of the population, and it's very sad because every individual from the rest of the world has had a chance who goes to Columbia, they really enjoy it.  So, I'm just here trying to play good golf and have good news for my country and good news to the rest of the world.
Q.  Do you feel like you're an ambassador, what you're doing now?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Sure.  Golf is a very small sport in Columbia, and, like I said, the support has been very, very, very good, and I'm just trying to keep doing what I'm doing, keep having fun, and keep playing good golf and hopefully bring some smiles to my country and just presented a good image, just like I said.  Also grow the game of golf.

Golf is very, very small in Columbia.  At the end of the journey, I can look back and golf has grown, and hopefully it will be spread, and I'm going to be very happy about that.
Q.  When did you first think you would be out here?  Growing up in Columbia, you don't look at golfers and think "I can do that"?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  Why not?
Q.  Who did you look to?
CAMILO VILLEGAS:  I played out here, and it's just    doesn't matter.  You have to look at the best pros in the world, and you hear the stories, and not a lot of them have had a great opportunity to play the game when they were young, and they do great things out here.  The fact that I'm from Columbia doesn't    it's not that big of a deal.  It's just working hard and being persistent and committed to what you want to do.
