   ANTHONY KANG: I'm not thinking about winning. I'm just thinking about playing each shot as well as I can. The Order of Merit, it's going to come down to basically Singapore and the Hong Kong Open, and that's, what, six months away, seven months away. So no, I'm not really thinking about the Order of Merit at the moment.

 Q. Know you lived in Korea for the first ten years of your life, and then coming back here; is that going to be like a family reunion for you?
 ANTHONY KANG: Well, not here. All of my relatives are back in the main land over here in Seoul and didn't have a -- so over here, it feels like it is Korea, but it's not really Korea, you know what I mean, and they are not making their way over here. 
 So it feels like I'm still elsewhere. Although I'm close, I'm in Korea, I'm close to where they are, but it doesn't feel like a reunion.

 Q. Playing in strong winds this week, is it going to affect your game plan?
 ANTHONY KANG: You know, everyone is going to have to play in the wind and obviously a lot of guys have had experience playing in high winds and going to have a big advantage, but just got to learn how to club right coming into the greens. 
 A lot of the times we are playing into the wind about three- or four-club wind, so normally you would hit 8-iron, and let's say maybe you would have to hit 4-iron. Just have to adjust to that and just solid putting.
