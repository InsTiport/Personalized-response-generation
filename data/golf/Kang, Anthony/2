  Fourth Round 65. Total 260 (-20)

 Q. Anthony, you must be really happy. 
 ANTHONY KANG: Yeah, it was very nice. I played nicely today. I hit the ball better than yesterday. Hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and holed a lot of good putts, too. 
 You know, it was exciting being in there again. I was really actually far away from Ian Poulter because he was always four or five shots ahead. I was doing my best to make as many birdies and climb up the leaderboard.

 Q. You are still within striking distance until the 13th, 14th hole?
 ANTHONY KANG: Yeah, I think 13th hole, I had a pretty poor lie in the rough and didn't make good contact and didn't get up-and-down from the bunker and that's okay. On the 14th hole, I missed the green left and made bogey and that pretty much derailed all momentum there.

 Q. You were making so many birdies on the front nine, but you weren't closing the gap on the leader. How did that feel?
 ANTHONY KANG: You know, this course, that's just the way it's going to be. The leaders, Graeme McDowell, Ian Poulter and Simon and those guys, they are all world-class players and they are not going to come back to the field in any tournament. If you want to win tournament, you have to go out and make birdies and catch them.

 Q. It's been a long time, hasn't it?
 ANTHONY KANG: It has been a really long time, my first Top-10 in forever, but this feels good. Nice to have the game come back a little bit. So things are looking up for next year and really looking forward to opening up with a bang next year.

 Q. What's the next few weeks coming up for you?
 ANTHONY KANG: I'm going to do the Asian Tour events, the next one in Thailand and then India after that, and then I'll make a judgment on Cambodia and Thailand tournament after that, too, but India for sure.
