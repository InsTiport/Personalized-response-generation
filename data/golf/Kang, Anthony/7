   ANTHONY KANG: I was really happy to finish with a 67 today. I started poorly, bogeyed the first hole and misread a few putts here and there. I though that it would be one of those days and that I'd used up all my putts last week. Hit a nice stretch on the back side and made a good score there.  
I was still buzzed from last week. But after the bogey on the first hole, it woke me straight up. It was shortlived. I've had an interesting few days and I was excited to tee it up today.   
 Everybody I talked to, I never realised how big the European Tour viewership is around the world. My family has been getting calls from everybody from around the world. I'm out here and it's just been a lot of emails for me. I feel bad for my parents and everyone back home as they are answering the phone calls.   
For me, it's just the emails and I think I've had arthritis from sitting in front of the computer for a long time. It's been an exciting few days and I'm looking forward at the opportunities that I've been given.  
 It's been eight years since my last win, which was at a smaller event. But in terms of media coverage goes, it wasn't as big as last week.   
 I was tired today. I started to hit the wall at the 11th. For two holes, I must have drank like six Powerades to get the energy levels up a bit and that helped out. Definitely looking forward to sleeping well the next few days for sure.
