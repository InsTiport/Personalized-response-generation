LISA HACKNEY:  I don't think we can win all 12 singles.  We'll see what happens. 
 

Q.  How are you playing right now?
 
LISA HACKNEY:  Yeah, I'm playing all right. Playing well enough to win the match today.  So that's all that matters.  Tomorrow, we'll see. 
 

Q.  Who do you want to play tomorrow?
 
LISA HACKNEY:  I don't mind.  As long as it's an American. 
 

Q.  Oh, it will be.
 
LISA HACKNEY:  All right.  That's okay, then. 
 

Q.  Good luck.
 
LISA HACKNEY:  Thanks.
