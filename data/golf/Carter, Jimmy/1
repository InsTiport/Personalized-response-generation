Q. To start off, how did the course seem to play today for you?
JIMMY CARTER: I thought it was great.  It was very tough but very -- I mean, it's very fair.  Just a little breezy, which kind of makes it a little tougher to hit the fairways.  If you don't hit the fairways, you're out of luck.
Q. Things seemed to be going pretty good.  You got a birdie there right before the turn.  Then I think 10 you birdied as well.
JIMMY CARTER: I was doing good.  I just missed a few fairways and kind of put me in a bad position.  Just hard to recover.
Q. I saw you saved the last one there for par.
JIMMY CARTER: Yeah, that was a nice one.  A little chip-in for a par.  It was good.  It's a great course.  It's going to determine really good champions.
Q. Thank you.  I appreciate it.
JIMMY CARTER: Thank you.
