Q. Can you talk about the experience this week?
MATT PARZIALE: Yeah, it was great to compete. I felt good out there both days, that's why it was a little frustrating yesterday. But today I hit some good shots and had some chance for birdies coming down the stretch. 

Q. What will you take from this experience as you go forward at other high level amateur events this year, and also the U.S. Open this summer, as well?
MATT PARZIALE: I've always tried to learn from bad rounds. But it was great playing, competing with these guys. I wish I could have been hanging around. But it was a great week all in all.

Q. If you had to look at one thing that happened, one thing that you got to experience this week that you'll take forever, what would that be?
MATT PARZIALE: Playing in the Masters, just the whole thing. There's not one thing. This place is incredible. The second you walk in. It's tough to pick out one thing, because there's so many special things. That's probably the overall thing, being able to play here.
