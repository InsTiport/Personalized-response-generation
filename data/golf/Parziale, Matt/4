MATT PARZIALE: I had a good start.  I did some good up-and-downs on 1, 2 and 3.  Could have got away from me then.  Made some good par saves, and then I played pretty steady.  Just really disappointed with that finish.
Q. You are here for Sunday, which is the key element overall.  How do you regroup?  How do you approach tomorrow?
MATT PARZIALE: I've played a lot of bad rounds in my life.  I know I'll be ready to go tomorrow.  Just after lunch, it will be old news.  Right now it just stinks.
Q. How does the Open compare to the Masters?
MATT PARZIALE: Played better here.  Both great events.  I had a blast at both of them, being able to compete.  I'm happy that I played well this week, being able to be here for the weekend.
