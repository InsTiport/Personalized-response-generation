 Q. Talk about the round.   
SAMMY SCHMITZ: It went very well. I didn't get in a lot of trouble. The wind was really blowing mostly one direction on the front nine, which I felt pretty comfortable with the direction it was blowing.   
And then on hole 10, the tee shot was dead into us and it was blowing a little right. So I hit a 4‑iron and I just hit it past the hole and took a double bogey and that got it going in a weird direction.   
11, we basically played as a par‑5.  
And then it was difficult from there, the wind was just really confusing the heck out of me. I also hit some ‑‑ with the confusion of the wind ‑‑ I executed some shots pretty well. But that's kind of how it went. It doesn't take much to get off track out here. Got a little bit off track, but really I didnt putt poorly, but didn't putt great on the back nine.   
There was one 3‑putt that I had on hole 13 that I was really disappointed with. Other than that, I thought I putted pretty well.   
   
 Q. Is it hard just to commit to shots when you got all that indecision with the wind?  
SAMMY SCHMITZ: It is a little bit. When you start ‑‑ I mean, yeah, it's harder in the wind because you get over the ball and it blows and it swirls a different way from what, from the shot that you decided you were going to hit. Well, then you have to kind of recalculate and you have to be careful not to just fire at things, you got to recalculate, but you also got to keep your head about you.   
So it was swirling and it was confusing me and it was my first time here in a real wind, too. So I'm proud of myself for doing my best and I'll take the score and be happy with that.
