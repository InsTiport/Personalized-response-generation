Q. He got off to an early lead and then you kind of won four holes in a row.
MATT SUGHRUE: I don't even know at this point, Lindsay.  I just sort of kept my head down all day long and just played, you know, smart golf and solid golf.
Kind of ran down my deficit, and just played better and better as the day went on.
Q. So stretch 8 to 11 ended with a 2-up lead.  What was the key to that?
MATT SUGHRUE: I think a couple things.  I think, one, my strategy was always to make as few bogeys as possible and hope that I got a few chances, he gave me a couple chances, and he did.
Then if I could scare in a couple birdies on top of that, then I would a really good chance.  I think I only made one bogey today.  That's probably right.  That was the 2nd hole.  That was really good.  On this difficult golf course, that's really good.
Q. Then finished up with birdies on 14 and 15 to kind of close out the match.
MATT SUGHRUE: Yeah.
Q. How important is it on a day when you have possibly two matches to get it done and finish it up?
MATT SUGHRUE: Well, I am 59 years old and this is my seventh round of golf, including the practice rounds.  Getting off my feet probably is going to help me a little bit.  The adrenaline is flowing.
I'm going to be up for this afternoon's match and give it my best.  I'm playing a great player and I'll just give it my best.
