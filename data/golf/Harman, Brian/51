 Q.  In the first 1567 par 3s that you played, did you have an ace before?  
BRIAN HARMAN: I actually had a SportsCenter top 10 in Louisiana.  It was an 8-iron that hit dead center on No. 9.  I don't know how it missed.   
 Q.  Have you had any other hole-in-ones?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, at home messing around.  I think six or seven total now.   
 Q.  Any prizes for them?  
BRIAN HARMAN: No, no prizes.  How isn't one of those not a car?  Half a million at Phoenix this year on 16.   
 Q.  Take us through both of the hole-in-ones.  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, 3 was 184, I think.  7-iron.  Charles hit first on both par 3s.  He did help me out with the clubs.  So 7-iron on No. 3, landed short, broke right in.   
14 was a 4-iron that hit right into the hill, killed it, rolled right in.   
 Q.  How far on 14?  
BRIAN HARMAN: 14 I think was 220.   
 Q.  4-iron hybrid?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you keep the two balls?  
BRIAN HARMAN: They're in the bag somewhere.  I might have given them away.  I don't know.   
 Q.  Are you surprised it's been done before?  
BRIAN HARMAN: I'm not surprised it's been done before.  I'm surprised it was only six years ago.  It would have been right before I got out here.  I don't remember who it was or when it happened.   
 Q.  Did you have any idea about the hole out on 17?  
BRIAN HARMAN: I knew it was going to be good off the face.  Obviously we can't see up that hill.  I heard the way they were reacting.   
It's like, Damn, man, I'm going to have three of these things today.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
BRIAN HARMAN: It's going to hurt.  It's going to hurt real bad (laughter).
