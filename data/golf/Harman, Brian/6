Q. Number 2, obviously, kind of an up and down hole -- double bogey, birdie, eagle. Just talk to me about that hole.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, if you put the ball in the fairway, it's a really gettable hole. I tried to do something silly the first day and hit it out of bounds. Played it okay the last two days. So it was nice to make an eagle today.
Q. You talked yesterday about how your iron game is really coming around. I think today you have your best day of greens in regulation.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it's just been feast or famine. I ironed it great all day today, made six birdies, and then dunk it in the hazard short left on 18 with a perfect 7 iron. So it's just the consistency is not quite there yet. The shot making is there. It just needs a little bit more consistency.
Q. And then finally, just Harbour Town overall, how well does this course set up for your game?
BRIAN HARMAN: For a lefty that draws, it's not great. I've done well here because of experience, and I like shaping it around, but for a lefty that draws it, there's a lot of trees in my face.
