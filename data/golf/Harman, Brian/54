 Q.  Great round today.  Had 8 birdies, only one bogey on the card.  What was working well for you out there?  BRIAN HARMAN: I drove it well today.  Fairways were firm so I was getting it pretty close to the greens.  Drove it great.  I hit a bunch of greens and made a few putts, so it was just an overall good day.   Q.  How good are scoring conditions today?  BRIAN HARMAN: Greens got pretty crusty this afternoon.  I look forward to the morning time, but it suited me great this afternoon.  But you know the wind blows around this place.  It can be tricky.   Q.  You've played some great golf lately.  How comfortable are you feeling when you get on to the golf course?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it's starting to kind of roll a little bit which is nice.  But I've been really keeping my head to the ground and trying to do the best I can and working really hard.  It's good to see it pay off at least today.   Q.  Let's talk about today.  12 of 14 fairways, 15 of 18 greens.  It was all working today, wasn't it?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, ball striking was good.  I've been hitting it great lately.  I've been checking the stats, and, gosh, if I could just get a couple more putts to go in today.  That happened.  I made a few putts and played the par-5s pretty well.   Q.  How much fun is it when the par-5s are playing downwind, it's firm and fast and you're getting roll out?  That's got to add spice to it.  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I really like the set-up this week.  It's firm, but it's really fair.  The greens are firm and the fairways are firm.  I think that helps out with the game.  It makes it more fun.  Balls going forward, you don't have to work quite so much.   Q.  This may seem like a silly question, but is it a tough transition coming from the Open back over to Canada, because it didn't affect you today?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, there's always a little bit of jet lag, but we timed it up pretty good to where we left Monday night from Edinburgh and got here Tuesday morning.  So it wasn't that bad.  I got my rest, and I think I'm back on schedule now.   Q.  Excited about the rest of the week?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it should be a great opportunity.  I'm really looking forward to it.   Q.  Great start to the week.  One shot off the lead.  How does it feel to be in this position?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I played here a couple years ago and really liked the course.  I didn't play very well, but I've been looking forward to coming back.  When I saw it was coming back to Glen Abbey this year, I kind of circled it on the calendar.  So it's good to get off to a good start and looking forward to the rest of the week.   Q.  What were you doing so well out there?  BRIAN HARMAN: A little bit of everything, drove it well, putted it well.  I just had the one three-putt bogey, but other than that it was pretty clean.   Q.  Was the course getting firmer and faster kind of as the afternoon went on?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, any time you have sunshine and it's dry and the wind is blowing a little bit, it's going to continue to firm up.  They'll probably put a little water on it tonight.  You'll see similar conditions tomorrow I would assume.   Q.  Expect it to be tougher when it stays dry like that?  I know you got the morning round tomorrow?  BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I think it's the week goes on it will play tougher and tougher.  I think the wind is supposed to switch and come from a different direction over the weekend, so that will be a new challenge.  The golf course is gettable, but it's playing very fair.  It's firm.  When the greens are putting as well as they are, the scores are going to be pretty low.
