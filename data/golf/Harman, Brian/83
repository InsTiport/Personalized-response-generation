 Q.   James, just talk a little bit about your round today.   
JAMES DRISCOLL:   It's a little frustrating after yesterday, seeing so many putts go in.   
I just caught a lot of lips today, probably had like four or five lip‑outs on putts today.   Yesterday probably would have dropped.   But the ball‑striking wasn't that much different.   So hopefully kind of keep that up and maybe get a few putts to drop on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Perfect conditions today.   But you did mention that the greens were a little bit faster.   
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah, they slowed them down just a hair yesterday, because they were a little scared the winds might come up and get the balls rolling on the greens.   But today no wind; and, yeah, they were rolling pretty fast.   
So that made a difference for sure.  
   
 Q.   Perfect position here heading into the weekend.   Just your approach; just keep staying aggressive?  
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yes, just kind of keep, trying to keep doing what I'm doing.   I'm hitting the ball pretty well, giving myself chances, and hopefully get some of those putts that lipped out today to drop.
