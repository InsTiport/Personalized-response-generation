Q. Fantastic 63 today.  You had a 30 on the back nine.  Talk through some of the -- some of your birdies and just what was working out there for you today.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, drove the ball a little bit better today and made a lot of putts.
And, yeah, no, I think one of the only couple greens I missed, I chipped in.
So, just one of those days where I got a few going in and just fortunate to have a good round today.
Q. Does the heat make the day more difficult for you?  Does it change your routine at all?
BRIAN HARMAN: I think it makes the day a little more difficult for everyone.  The heat is a major, major factor out here.  But, it's just one of those things.  Everybody has to deal with it.  So, you take your precautions, you do the best you can, and you just try to manage it the best you can.
Q. You're in a good position, obviously, through a couple of rounds.  It's a golf course where people can go low.  We have had a couple 63s today.  Is it the mentality of that you feel like you have to go low?
BRIAN HARMAN: No, not necessarily.  I think the last few years, it's been around short of 20-under.  I'm -- I never played here, so I'm not sure if it's better scoring conditions or what's going on.  But it's fun to make some birdies.
They had a couple tees moved up today.  So, it might slow down a little bit, but people might keep going nuts out there.  I don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen.
