Q. 7-under.  Got to be pretty happy with you are, your position.BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, going to go work on my putting a little bit.  I hit it really nice today and couldn't get any putts to drop. Look forward to the weekend.  Should be fun.Q. You're 7-under; Jordan is 7-under.  Got about a dozen reporters over there and nobody except me wants to talk to the defending champion.BRIAN HARMAN: I'll go home and sleep like a baby.  Don't bother me none.Q. To some extent it's got to be kind of nice.  Defending champion and you're a little bit off the radar.BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah.  I mean, yeah, if you want to spin it that way, that's fine.Q. No, but you got to be very comfortable the way you played this course last year and like your position?BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it's nice place.  I like it here.Q. 17 and 18 greens hit.  Talk about your approach shots today.BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I struck it really well.  On the one green I missed I almost holed my chip.  One bogey was just a three-putt.  Had a lot of putts that were really close to going in and just didn't. I am close to playing really well.  Just going to try to keep doing what I'm doing.Q. Really calm out there.  That kind of help you guys score well?BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, the wind typically doesn't blow here a ton during this tournament, but it would be nice a little bit to keep the gnats off. It was a fun day.Q. You like having a big crowd following you?BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, Jordan is a nice guy.  Played with him quiet a few times.Q. Probably pretty good chance you'll play with him tomorrow, too.BRIAN HARMAN: Pretty good chance.  Finished the round at the same time with the same score. It was a fun group.  Danny and Jordan were hitting the ball great; I was hitting it good.  We finally started getting some putts to drop, so that's what you expect out of good players.Q. Sitting pretty good for the weekend, too.BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I'm excited.  Should be fun, looking forward to it.
