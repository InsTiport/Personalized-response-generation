 Q.  Looks like your ball striking was really good today. Only missed one green; 12 of 14 fairways, and got off to a great start this year. What's been the key to that?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, the ball striking is finally starting to come around. You know, always been able to putt it pretty good. I can remember being younger and being able to hit it a little bit better.   
So I been trying to get back to some of that stuff, sure a little bit more natural, and seems to be working pretty well.   
 Q.  There is a little bit of breeze out there, but not too much. Golf course kind of right out in front of you today?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, the greens in the afternoon get firm and they get really tricky, so that's the hardest part of the afternoon. You get the advantage of the ball going much further. Tomorrow morning be a challenge. Ball won't go quite as far, so that will be an adjustment. We'll get it figured out and do the best we can.   
 Q.  Tied for 3rd at Greenbrier, tied for 4th at Sanderson Farms; really got off to a great start so far this year. As you look forward, is that something that you really wanted to try to do this year?  
BRIAN HARMAN: You know, I felt like I had a really tough year last year. Got off to a bad start and was just kind of chasing it. At the end of the year I finally started playing some good golf. I'm just trying to stay out in front of those stretches where you're not playing well. Trying to stay on it and not let it get away from me like I do sometimes.
