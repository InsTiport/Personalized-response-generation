Q.   Brian Harman, fun week out there especially on Sunday.   Four birdies, no bogies.   I was with you the whole day.   That putt on 6 goes completely around the cup and falls in, do you think maybe this might be a special day for me?
BRIAN HARMAN:   You know, I had some good stuff happen and I had some tough breaks, too.   I played well.   I left it all out there.   I think if I could have got that one to go in on 8 to sustain that momentum I would have really had something going and made a nice one at 12 and couldn't get it close enough to the hole on last few holes.

Q.   How impressive to go around this layout especially all the moisture course has taken on.   The scores a little bit better today.   You didn't have a bogey all day.   That's awesome playing.
BRIAN HARMAN:   I played well.   I had to make one 6-footer for par and had to get up and down on 9.   Yeah, just couldn't quite get it to some of those pins.   It's frustrating.   Obviously if you would have told me at the beginning of the week I would have shot this, I would have said thanks and goodbye.   I had some opportunities today.   I wish I could have capitalized on them once more.

Q.   How about playing in front of the Greensboro and Triad fans?
BRIAN HARMAN:   It's a special place for me.   I've played a lot of golf here.
