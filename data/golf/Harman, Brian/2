Q. Solid round for you again today, 5-under, 67.  This golf course lends itself to birdie runs and you started with four in a row starting at the 2nd.  Take us through that stretch.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, just got some good looks.  I finally started making some putts this week, I've been striking it pretty well, just got to clean up a couple tee shots and we'll be off and running.
Q. And you also rallied, you had that double bogey at 9, but come back with birdies at 10 and 11.  That's basically the mindset you have to have out here, don't you, because this course can come up and bite you?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, it's one of those things you can make a bunch of birdies here, but if you get just a little off on a tee shot or a little off on a second shot you can get yourself in a really precarious spot.  That's what I did off the tee there and it sucks to make a 6, but I was happy coming back and making a 3 and a 4 on 10 and 11.
Q. Thoughts on tomorrow?  Obviously you'll be at the top of the leaderboard, in the mix to win a golf tournament?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, it's where I feel the most comfortable.  It's been awhile, I've been, haven't been struggling I just haven't been having any good finishes, so hopefully I can make a few putts early and get it going tomorrow.
