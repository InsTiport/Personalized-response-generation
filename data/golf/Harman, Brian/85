Q.   Nice round, what was working for you out there?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Got back to my game plan out there.   The greens really surprised me yesterday.   They were super firm.   I just wasn't ready for it.   Got off to a bad start and I knew they were going to be firm today and just played accordingly.   Had some things go my way, got off to a good start and got some momentum.   Played really well and putted okay. 

Q.   This is your first time in the Playoffs, and you're playing great; you have to be pleased with what's going on right now. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I'm trying to keep all that stuff out of my mind as much as possible.   I didn't even look at any leaderboards today.   I knew that‑‑ I know that if I play this course the way that I can, that I'm going to be fine.   And as long as I just worry about the things that I can control, that's all I can worry about.

Q.   How hard is that to do out here?
BRIAN HARMAN:   It's nearly impossible.   It has to creep in, but you let those thoughts come and just let them pass.   You know the best way to assure a spot next week is focus on hitting the 4‑iron, 6‑iron, whatever it is. 

Q.   Coming into this week, you obviously knew you were three shots into the Deutsche Bank?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Good play solves everything.   Been working hard on my putting this week and just hard work pays off. 

Q.   Had your putting been a concern?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Probably my weakest stat out here, and just trying to shore it up a little bit.

Q.   What do you think of the Playoffs? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I think it's awesome.   Especially what a great venue.   This golf course is unbelievable.   It's going to be really interesting this afternoon if that wind gets picked up.   I might actually go to the hotel room and watch it and try to get an idea of what it might be like tomorrow afternoon.   It's an awesome venue and the fans are great and it's been a great experience so far. 

Q.   What's the FedExCup Playoffs experience been like for you? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   If you had told me at the beginning of the year that I was going to be playing in the Playoffs, I would have said thank you very much.   I feel like I'm playing with house money right now.   And with so many good players out here, I'm just trying to do my best and see what happens.
