  BRIAN HARMAN:   I was fortunate today.   Hit some bad drives ask got a way with it but hit some good ones, too. 

Q.   You started a little bit before noon but as you got through the round, did the golf course change at all?
BRIAN HARMAN:   It does.   I think it's pretty well known that the afternoon, the poa annua grows but everybody has to putt them.   Only my second year here but the golf course is in great shape.

Q.   You started the year, two Top 10s and you struggled a little bit since January, what turned around this week for you?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I don't feel like I've been struggling.   I just haven't scored very well.   I've been hitting the ball as well as I ever have, just have not had anything go my way.   It's been tough to stay patient.   The last two weeks were really wanting to play well, probably too bad.   So it's good to get off to a good start. 

Q.   Going off early tomorrow, take advantage of golf course in some pretty good conditions? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Real early.   There will be some dew out tomorrow but we'll be fine.
