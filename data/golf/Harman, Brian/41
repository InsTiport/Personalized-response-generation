Q. 10 birdies, one blemish, a double.  Talk about your round.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I just worked hard to get myself a bunch of chances, and I made a few putts today.  It was nice.  I played really well yesterday, and I only got 1-under out of it.  I was a little disappointed yesterday.  I felt like I could have shot a few lower.  You know, I probably shot lower than I figured I would have today, so it's nice to come back after yesterday.
Q. Was there anything you were working on after yesterday?
BRIAN HARMAN: No, it's just patience.  It's so easy when you play well and don't shoot the score you want to just come out and fire on all cylinders.  But this course, you can make birdies in you're in position, but if you get out of position, you can really make some high scores.
Q. Looking back at No. 12, talk a little bit about that.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I made a great par save on 11, got out of position, made a good par on 11.  Then was right in the middle of the fairway and was just trying to take a little bit off a 9-iron and just pulled it right in the water.  You know, it's just undisciplined, really, just a mental error.
Q. And then moving forward --
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, as bad as that was, that was probably the way I bounced back and kept going.
