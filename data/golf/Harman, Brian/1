Q. What was the key to your 5-under round today?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, I hadn't been here in a while, it was nice to get back out on Pebble Beach.  I enjoy the golf course a lot.
Had a nice morning.  Matt Jones is one of my favorite guys to play with, so I was real comfortable.  I got a few putts to drop and hit some good shots.
Q. I think it's been since 2014 you haven't played here.  What went into the decision to add it to your schedule and what was the reason maybe that you hadn't been back in so long?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well I just have been skipping it and playing San Diego instead.  San Diego kind of made some changes to where I didn't feel like I was, the course was suited.  I remembered having some good rounds here, so I just thought I would give it a try, because I would like to add one on this West Coast.
Q. Looking forward to Spyglass tomorrow, were you able to play a practice round over there this week and what can we expect from you over there tomorrow?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I played the front nine over there a couple days ago.  It's in great shape.  I enjoy the course, so I look forward to try to shoot a low one tomorrow.
