 Q.  68 for Brian Harman today.  How would you compare today's round to yesterday?  
BRIAN HARMAN: I had to stay a little more patient today.  I birdied the first hole but I was not playing well to start the day.  I made a really nice putt on 9 and that sort of kick started the back nine, which was good.   
Flubbed a chip over there on 14 and then knocked the next one in.  That was fun.   
 Q.  What has been standing out for you as far as your game goes over the last two days?  
BRIAN HARMAN: I think just consistency off the tee.  I've always been a pretty good ball-striker off the tee but just been a couple like foul balls, I guess it would be, just kind of killed my momentum.  I feel like now I'm able to attack the course a little bit more.   
 Q.  As you head into the weekend, we're only the halfway point, still you're at the top of the leaderboard.  Any mental adjustment at all or is it business as usual?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Well, tomorrow we're going to go a little bit early, so it will be a new challenge to see what the course is like in the morning.  I played a couple practice rounds early so it should be all right.  It should be a fun weekend, the weather looks nice and I look forward to playing with Mark again.  We had a good time.   
 Q.  Pretty good encore, good start yesterday, good follow-up today.  
BRIAN HARMAN: I had a nice back nine today.  Struggled a little bit on the front nine, it was tough, wind was blowing me around a little bit.  Other than a couple 3-putts a pretty clean round.   
 Q.  You rolled in a long one at the first.  I thought your putter got you out of some trouble out there today.  You made some good ones in these windy conditions.  I know the guys have really been struggling with the speed of the greens but you managed it pretty well the first two days?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, a couple 3-putts there were my only blemishes on the card, I wish I could have those back but overall putted pretty well.   
 Q.  Anything to do -- it's a tight turn around tomorrow morning, but anything you want to work on tonight to get ready for tomorrow?  
BRIAN HARMAN: No, just get a good night's sleep and get back out here tomorrow.
