 Q.   Brian, 6‑under 66 today after a great start.   Capped off with a birdie there at the last.   Just a few comments on the round.  
BRIAN HARMAN:   You know, actually I hadn't been hitting all that great.   I knew today I was going to have to rely on my short game, and I putted great.   I kept it in play and didn't do anything really dumb.   
I just made a lot of putts, knocked it in from the bunker on 11, so I had a lot of stuff go my way.  
   
 Q.   But the looked like the conditions certainly were a little more benign this afternoon as far as the wind went.  
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, the wind was down.   The greens were really good.   It was definitely out there, and actually playing with my good buddy, Harris.   We had a great time today.   I had some great partners.   
   
 Q.   Well, you're obviously enjoying a good year.   85th in money, over a million dollars so far.   Is a round like this kind of a fitting ‑‑ certainly you've got three more rounds, but a fitting way to describe the season for you?  
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah.   It's been obviously the most fun year of my life so far.   I've had an awesome time out here.   The guys out here have just been awesome, and I can't wait for the next three days.  
   
 Q.   Great.   Keep it up.
