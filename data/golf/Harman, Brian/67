Q.   Thursday, a 63 on a course where you need to make a lot of birdies.   How pleased are you with the end result? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   If you go out and birdie half of the golf course, you feel like you've done fairly well.   I had a great day.   It was a lot of fun.   I hadn't played well the last two weeks, so it was nice to get off to a good start.

Q.   What did you find today coming off those back‑to‑back missed cuts? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I missed the cut at Greenbrier, and my fiancee Kelly and I drove home Friday night.   Took us like eight and a half, nine hours to get back to St. Simons.   I did some work this weekend and kind of reset.   It was nice to be home for a couple days and I just feel a little more refreshed.

Q.   Two years ago here at the John Deere you opened up with back‑to‑back 65s.   What is it about this place that seemingly brings out good stuff in your game? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   It suits me.   It's really a tee shot golf course I feel like.   Whenever I can get going with the driver, I can push the golf course a little bit and get a lot of good looks and birdies.   So hopefully we'll continue that and see what happens.

Q.   Brian, you birdied half the golf course.   Nine birdies in this opening round. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I finally got the putter going.   I hadn't been putting very well, and I made a couple adjustments and made a couple adjustments off the tee box.   Sometimes it doesn't take much.

Q.   Talk about your tee balls, because I think you need to place yourself in the fairway with the rough being a little long here.   Once you give yourself short irons into these greens, you can be aggressive. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yes, you can.   If you're in the fairway, it's tough to protect these greens, especially when they have some firmness to them.   It almost makes it more accessible because the ball's not spinning back very much.   When the golf course is this nice, I mean, it is manicured just perfectly, so all the putts are rolling really well.   It's a very fun golf course.

Q.   You've had some success here in the past.   It must fit your eye off the tee? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I like it.   I had a chance to win here my rookie year a couple years ago.   Played with Zach and got to watch him win.   So I feel like I've been around this place a time or two.

Q.   How has your patience been?   You've seen some of your college teammates, the Georgia mafia win tournaments out here.   You're still looking for that first win, and you certainly have the game to win out here. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I'm planning on having about a 20‑year career out here, so to get caught up into those types of things isn't very beneficial.   I'm happy for those guys, Harris and Russell and Brendon and Chris, they're dear friends of mine, and we all pull for each other, so I'm very happy to see them win.

Q.   Talk about the round.   Obviously an interesting one for you today. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, my caddie Scott Tway got sick.   He was up all night feeling really bad, so I had a local stand in.   My man, Jay, came out and did a really good job.   He was like a true pro out there, so it was a lot of fun.

Q.   Did you know Jay ahead of time or how did that come out? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I met him on the 7th tee box.

Q.   So you didn't know him ahead of time? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   No, Scott wasn't looking good.   He's tough as nails, but I looked in his eyes one time and he really didn't look okay.   So I called a medic over and Scottie said he was going to have to sit out for at least a couple holes, and Jay was standing there and said I'll do it.   I'll keep up.

Q.   Is he a local coach around here? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, he's a teacher at a Catholic high school right up the road.   I guess he coaches women's golf, and he's got two girls.   We talked a lot.   He said he always wanted an opportunity to see inside the ropes, so we had a lot of fun. 

Q.   Talk about your game; it was obviously clicking?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I hadn't been playing well the last couple weeks.   Went home last weekend, made some adjustments and came out here and got it going and got confident, and it was fun.   It was just made a couple putts, hit a couple in there close, and they add up quick sometimes.

Q.   Did it help you had a little knowledge of this course?   You've been here before, does that help? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, it did, but I had forgotten.   I haven't gotten one of my own yardages in about eight months since Scott and I started working together.   So he gave me the yardage book, and I was having to walk distances off.   I hadn't done that in a while, so it was nice.

Q.   Pleased with everything that happened and pleased with where you're at? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah.   Anytime you're in contention, it's always good.   So we'll see how the next three days go.
