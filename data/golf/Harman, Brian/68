Q.   How did it play out there in Round 2?
    BRIAN HARMAN:   It was a little damp this morning.   The ball wasn't really rolling but it's surprising this place -- I won't say surprising but it's impressive the way this place drains with water.   The fact we were even able to play at 8:00 this morning is a true testament to how they designed this place.

Q.   The other side of the draw seems to have gotten better weather.   How do you like it?   You had the softer conditions this morning. 
    Did that help you out?
    BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah.   I mean, yeah, sometimes you get the bear, sometimes the bear gets you.   That's just part of it.   You got to do your best for what they gave you.   It seemed like there were some lower scores on the other side but, we got two more days and we'll all be playing at the same time.

Q.   Did you feel you were able to pick up some ground today?
    BRIAN HARMAN:   It was nice this morning.   Obviously the morning is damp, plays long so, you know, couple different clubs off of tees and not able to be as aggressive coming into the greens because you're a little further back but, all in all, the golf course is playing fabulous.
