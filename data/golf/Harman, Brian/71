Q.   You gave it a run today, pretty good week for you?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, after the last two weeks, it was a great week.   Obviously, yeah, I kind of let a few slip through my fingers there.   Try to learn from it for sure.   Right now, I feel disappointed.

Q.   What was the key to this whole week for you to get to this position?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, I putted great all week.   Just didn't quite have the command with my irons towards the end of the day.   I had a couple chances to put some pressure on Bubba and make him feel a little bit of heat but I'm trying to get up‑and‑down and he's playing for birdie.

Q.   What do you take from a week like this to build on for the future?
BRIAN HARMAN:   It's another week I learned about being in contention and the more times you put yourself there, the better chance you have.
