Q. Great round today.  To get in before the rain hit us, you got to be pleased.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, my Columbia jacket was my MVP today.  We got kind of lucky on the weather.  Really didn't hit us until the last couple.  But had the putter going and played well.
Q. You brought your caddie in a couple of times for some reads out there, but then you just got on a heater out there with your putter.  That hole had to look about six inches wide out there for awhile.
BRIAN HARMAN: I've been rolling it really well and seeing the lines really well and just called Country in there a couple times, just to make sure that I'm seeing what I'm seeing.  But he's great for that, he's always right there when I need him.
Q. Obviously, we know how much emotion you play with.  I know you got a little hot after the bad tee shot at 7.  What have you learned to get settled down, because you turned it around really fast.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I do, I play with a lot of emotion.  But, for me, I got to get it out.  I got to get it out and get it over with.  I wish I wouldn't show so much, but, for me, if I hold it in, it just kind of accumulates.  So, as long as I get it out and it's like, all right, what do we got to do now?  So just kind of reset and get back doing to what I'm trying to do.
Q. To get the 65 on the Stadium today, La Quinta tomorrow, where do you feel like you are setup into the rotation?
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, just going to go out and try to do the best I can tomorrow at La Quinta, it's a great course, I enjoy playing it, I think the wind's going to blow tomorrow, so there's no telling.
Q. Anything fun last night for your birthday?
BRIAN HARMAN: No, we had a bunch of friends over Wednesday night, my wife got me sushi and a cheesecake, so I couldn't ask for anything more.
Q. One of the better rounds we have seen this week on the Stadium Course.  You get in at 7-under.  How did you put it together?
BRIAN HARMAN: Just drove it extremely well, putted well and gave myself a bunch of chances.  No mystery to that place, you got to hit it in the fairway, hit some greens, and make some putts.
Q. What were the change in conditions like from the beginning of the round to the last few holes.
BRIAN HARMAN: It changed drastically.  As you can tell.  I'm glad I had all my Columbia stuff.  It's just going to get nasty this afternoon, it really is.  So I was glad to get it in when we did.
Q. Happy belated 30th.  What was the little celebration like?
BRIAN HARMAN: I had a bunch of friends, a bunch of us live on the island down there all came over and it was great to see everybody.
