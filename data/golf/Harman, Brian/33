 Q.  Thoughts on 70 today?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it was tough.  Course, it was set up hard.  The wind was blowing.  It was hard to get the ball close to the hole.  Hard to stay patient, especially when a guy is kind of out in front and you're kind of trying to run him down a little bit.   
 Q.  Only one bogey today.  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I made some good pars today.  I had kind of a rough stretch on the back nine.  I think was it 12, 13, 14, I had to get up-and-down out of the bunkers.   
Yeah, I managed my game pretty well, so going to need a low one tomorrow.   
 Q.  Obviously Dustin has a massive lead at the moment.  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  
BRIAN HARMAN: You know, I'm just going to try to stick to what I'm doing.  I think I've got a low one in me if I do everything I'm supposed to, and you need some help.  We'll just see what happens.
