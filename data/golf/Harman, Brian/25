Q. Another solid day.  As you look back on your round what were the biggest keys for you out there today?
BRIAN HARMAN: I think making bogey on 12.  I hit a bad tee shot, had to take an unplayable, and knocked it on the green, ended up making a good bogey there.
Then made a really nice par on 13.
Then birdied 14, 15, 18 coming in.
So the round was kind of teetering there, I played really well on the front nine, a little shaky on the back nine.  Sometimes bogeys are better than others, that was one that was better than others.
Q. Heading into the final round in the final group tomorrow, chasing the leader, and he's No. 1 in the world, a powerful player.  What mentality or attitude do you need to bring to the golf course tomorrow?
BRIAN HARMAN: I'm just going to keep doing the same thing I've been doing and I'm going to try to put as much pressure on the golf course as I can.  I'm going to try to do the best I can on every shot.  I can't control what Dustin does, he's a fabulous player, he's going to be really hard to beat tomorrow, but trying to do something I'm not capable of is not the way to do it.
Q. You say you're going to attack the golf course, but at the same time are you in some way looking forward to how your game measures up against the best players in the world?
BRIAN HARMAN: I am, yeah.  It's got more to do with how my game has evolved since the last time I've been here.  The last time I was here I struggled on this golf course and didn't do very well and I'm proud of the progress I've made over the last few years and I'm excited for tomorrow.
