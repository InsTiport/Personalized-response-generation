  DAVE SENKO:   Brian, thanks for joining us.   9‑under 61 which is a new Honda Classic tournament record, as well as breaking the course record by three shots. 
Maybe just share your thoughts on your day, and then we'll get some questions.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, I've been working really hard on my game and just one of those crazy days where everything comes together.   Got off to a really hot start and just kept the pedal down all day.   It was awesome.   To be able to do it‑‑ I thought that was a bug creeping in my ear right there. 
To be able to do it on such a great golf course, such a great tournament‑‑ I was pretty down about my round yesterday, so to be able to come out and get back into the golf tournament feels pretty good. 
DAVE SENKO:   Birdies 1, 2, eagle on 3; shot sequence on those first three holes? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   1, I played a little more aggressive than probably most guys do on 1.   I hit 3‑wood and had sand wedge in and hit it to ten feet.
2, I hit it in the right bunker and hit a great shot out of the bunker to about eight feet. 
3, I hit driver down the middle and hit 3‑wood to about 25 feet and made it.
Just kind of off and running from there.
DAVE SENKO:   And you ran off three straight on 14 through 16. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   14, I hit a 7‑iron to about six feet right behind the hole. 
15, I hit a 7‑iron to about a foot. 
Then 16, I hit 8‑iron behind the hole about 15 feet. 
DAVE SENKO:   How about just talking a little about 18.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, like I was saying earlier, it was‑‑ I had about 250 hole and it's usually a 3‑wood, so just a hot 3‑wood, hit it on the back of the green and try to 2‑putt. 
But today with a chance to do something really special, I tried to hit hybrid and got up in the wind a little bit and came up just a little bit short.   I hit a pretty good shot.   Obviously I was trying to do the magic number (smiling). 

Q.   Switch to that belly putter fairly recently?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I switched to it at AT&T, Pebble.   They built it for me out there, and it just‑‑ I felt really comfortable with it.   I putted with a belly before in college and done pretty well.   It's hot when it's hot; when it goes cold, it goes ice cold.   So that's why I switched away from it in college. 

Q.   When did you start thinking about cracking 60?   When did it actually creep into your head, par 70, and obviously everything is kind of right there in front of you. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I walked off 16 and I was like, man, if I birdie these last two holes, I'm going to shoot 59.   But then I looked at the pin on 17, and I'm like, I don't know about jacking a 5‑iron at this thing.   I had a good shot there.   And I hit a great drive on 18 and had a chance ‑‑ I mean, I had a chance. 
This is probably one of the hardest golf courses we play all year, and just to have a chance to do something special like that is really humbling and it's really cool.

Q.   Did you walk off 18 happy or disappointed? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I mean, I was a little hot that I missed a 5‑footer.   But at the same time, I was really aggressive with that bunker shot.   Thinking back, I probably shouldn't have been, but whatever.   (Smiling).
Like I said, I saw where Davis had shot 64 yesterday, and just thought that was‑‑ I'm out there yesterday and I'm like, "How did he shoot 64 out here, this place is so hard." 
Just got it rolling today.   It's just one of those days where everything went my way, everything bounced towards the hole and I made a lot of putts. 

Q.   Give us your real height and weight.   (Laughter) People are always amazed at how far you can hit it. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I'd like to say that I'm 5‑7.   (Laughter).

Q.   So would I.   (Laughter)
BRIAN HARMAN:   You don't have to worry about me dunking any basketballs any time soon.   Probably 5‑7, 150‑ish.   I ain't too big a fella. 

Q.   How far do you hit it and what do you attribute that to?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I work hard in the gym.   I've always wanted distance to not be an issue.   I never‑‑ I think it's unrealistic to think that I would be a Top‑5 or Top‑10 driving distance guy on the PGA TOUR.   But I always felt that if I hit it far enough, then I could compete. 
So I don't get too wrapped up in it.   I hit it far enough.   I can hit one a little further when I want to.   Some guys are always going to be able to hit it past me. 

Q.   Can you talk about what it took to get into the field, and what was your plan if not?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I was first alternate on Tuesday.   I don't think I got‑‑ well, I was first alternate Monday.   Didn't get in all day Monday.   I was talking to some folks, like, "What are my chances of getting in?"
They said, "Well, 50/50 or so."   Ended up getting in by three or four. 
Last week in MÃ©xico, I birdied the last hole.   I had a really bad day on Sunday.   Didn't play well and hung in there and birdied the last hole, which probably ended up getting me into this golf tournament. 
So it's just one of those things, funny how things work out, and I'm going to try to keep going. 

Q.   What didn't work for you yesterday? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Man‑‑ I switched drivers today.   I tried to hit a new one yesterday and it‑‑ that rough is no good.   No good. 
Those afternoon rounds are real tough.   You're out there, it's a little slower.   The wind was up yesterday afternoon.   And I just‑‑ I have a bad habit of getting really impatient out there and wanting it to go faster and faster. 
I really tried to slow myself down.   Exchanged some text messages with Lucas Glover last night.   He's been a really good friend to me, and every time that I've needed any help, he's always given me some advice.   I asked him, I said, "Man, how do you get out there and take your time?" 
He goes, "Well, try to walk a little slower."   I did that today.   So I haven't gotten to my phone yet, but I'll be sure to send him a thank‑you text. 

Q.   Need any advice on paddle boarding? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, don't fall. 

Q.   Have you ever shot lower casually, any 60s, 59s anywhere? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Nothing in college.   No 59s.   I think I shot 61 once or twice.   I don't really know.   I can't really remember to be honest. 

Q.   So this would clearly be the best then? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, this would probably be best round that I played in at least as far as I can remember. 

Q.   How long is this record going to hold up? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Hopefully forever.   (Laughter).
I don't know, there's so many good players out there.   There's no telling.   There's absolutely no telling.   Might not last the day. 

Q.   You were shooting at every pin today trying to make the cut.   What changes tomorrow now that you've put yourself in the tournament?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, I did all right today, so I might just keep doing that.   
No, actually the golf course is getting harder.   It's getting firmer, and won't be able to go at those pins tomorrow I don't think.   I think we are going to get lucky.   I think the wind is going to blow tonight and really firm up the course.   This is a great golf course, it really is.   It's set up awesome.   I maybe didn't like it so much yesterday but I sure am a big fan of it today. 

Q.   Starting at 3 over, were you concerned about the cut in was that something you were thinking going?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, heck, I was, what, 150th place or something when I teed it up.   The scores have been great today, and I thought‑‑ I don't even know where it stands, what's the cut now?   1‑over?   Even?   I figured it was going to be like 1‑ or 2‑over.   I knew if I played well today, that would be fine.   But obviously I did not play well yesterday, so I needed a good one today. 

Q.   Did that kind of just free you up a little bit, knowing that; I've got to make up ground to make the cut and I have to go at every pin? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   A little bit.   I was watching the Golf Channel last night, the Heritage deal with Sergio GarcÃ­a and Sergio has always been one of my favorite players.   The guy, he just goes out there, and just fearless.   I was watching that and watching him hit some shots.   Even though he's come so close in these majors, he's never been afraid of anything. 
I'm just like, man, I'm going to go try that tomorrow.   That looks like a pretty good idea.   So I drew a lot of inspiration from that.   I knew if I didn't have a good day today, then I was going to go to Puerto Rico and be fine, so just let it go. 
DAVE SENKO:   Thanks, Brian.
