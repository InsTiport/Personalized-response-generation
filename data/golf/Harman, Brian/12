Q. Brian, 5-under par 65. Just get some comments on your final round.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, obviously got the year off to a good start. A little disappointed with how I finished. Thought I could have got a couple more.
Feel good to be back in contention.
Q. Looks like you were in there for a little bit and kind of dropped off. What do you think happened right there?
BRIAN HARMAN: I just hit -- you know, I was trying to be aggressive on 15. I just didn't hit a great one. I was trying to throw it in there close a couple times, and the margin for error is just nothing here. Missed short putt on 17, so...
I had any chances. I just didn't take advantage of it.
Q. The putt on 17, what was the...
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I hit a great -- I tried to kill one off the tee and missed it left and got it to a good number and hit a great wedge shot. Man, I just really thought that putt was going to go to the left. Went straight and just missed it.
Q. Eight straight years finishing in the top 100; really consistent. This get you off to another great start for another good season.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, hopefully. I'm looking forward it. It's nice the way the fall is set up there year, and excited about the next few weeks.
Q. What do you think about the area?
BRIAN HARMAN: It's beautiful, man. Great up here. So pretty. It's nice be here this time of year. Colors are starting to change and hotel is not so crowded. It was really nice.
