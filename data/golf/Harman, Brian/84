  BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I got off to a rough start, bogeyed more and just didn't have anything going.   I made birdie on 9 and took a deep breath and had the urge, once I got it to a couple under, I'm thinking a couple under, seven or eight points, to really try to hang on.   
And today I decided we're just going to let it go and see what happens.   So I was fortunate enough to get some good shots, make good putts and birdied the last three.  
   
 Q.   That's what's great about this format, get it going, rack up a lot of points really quick.   
BRIAN HARMAN:   For sure.   This course is in such great condition.   These guys have done such an awesome job.   It's dry and firm.   It's going to be really firm this weekend.   It's going to be a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   What's been working best for you?  
BRIAN HARMAN:   I putted really well today and just really got into a good confidence, especially on that back nine, hit some good tee shots, had some good numbers coming to the flags.  
   
 Q.   Any putts that really stand out?  
BRIAN HARMAN:   I hit it close on 9.   Made it about five‑footer there.   Then made about a 20‑footer on 10, and that really sort of let me know that I was seeing the line really well.  
So it was really easy from there to be aggressive and just keep rolling.  
   
 Q.   Important stretch for you here over these next few weeks.   
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah for sure.   I've had kind of a tough year and was kind of on the board a lot.   To be in contention with all that sort of pressure, anyone says there's not pressure, especially with it being a short year and trying to making the playoffs and all.   So I've been feeling a lot of that lately, especially with the game not being in great shape.   But I've been working hard, doing the right things.   It's nice to see it finally coming together a little bit.
