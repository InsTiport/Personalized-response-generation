Q.   You started 97th in the FedExCup standings and you're going to move to somewhere around 41st, really well played. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   It was awesome.   Really fun day today.   I would have never thought‑‑ the greens were a little softer than they were yesterday.   I never would have thought it would have moved me up a little bit.   What a golf course; awesome week.   Fans were good.   I had just a great time.

Q.   And you're styling at the end with a birdie at the 72nd?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I got it in in style.   Hit a good shot in there.   I was disappointed, I was sniffing at the lead just a little bit there.   I said, if I can birdie three out of the last four, I might have a really good chance, and I got a little too aggressive on No. 16 and so it was good to get that one back on 18.
