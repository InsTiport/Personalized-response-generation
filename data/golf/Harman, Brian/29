 Q.  Kind of a slow start to the day.  How would you assess it out there?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, disappointing day.  I don't know if I had enough in the tank to catch Dustin or not, but just didn't have my best stuff today.  I was proud of the way I hung in on the back nine and did my best and just didn't have it today.   
 Q.  As far as your first week of the year goes, I think you have to be pretty pleased though?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Well, this is my fourth week of the year.  We started long ago for this year.  I'm pleased with the way the year's going.  I've been working hard and I look forward to next year.   
 Q.  Quick question about Dustin.  When he's playing like he was this week, is it hard to keep up, because you guys all world class players, but --  
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, on this course it's tough, the way the wind was blowing today.  He knocks it to a foot on 12 for eagle, and I'm having to lay up to 130 yards.  I mean it just, he's very talented off the tee and he used that to his advantage today.
