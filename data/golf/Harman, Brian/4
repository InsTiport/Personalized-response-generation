Q. Consistent round of golf.  What a consistent 36 holes for you.  14-under and bogey-free.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I had to make a couple nice saves over the last couple days, but I'm playing really well.
Yeah, I like this place.  I've done okay around here and it's nice to get it going.
Q. Yeah, and what a race the finish line for you.  Certainly ran through the tape with birdies on three of your last four holes.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, finished strong the last two days, which is a good way.  Been kind of the lull in the middle but finishing strong, so it was good.
Q. Stats say you're putting really well.  119 feet in putts the opening round; more than 90 feet here in the second round.
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I'm giving myself a lot of opportunities though.  That's kind of the key around here.  You got to get it pin high and get a lot of chances, and I'm holing a few.
Q. What are your thoughts going into the weekend then?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yea, just going to stick to what I'm doing and see what happens.  My game has been great.  I been kind of disappointed with how I started the year.  Finished last year off really well and was really excited to play in the Open; did okay.
You know, played really around Jackson and just couldn't get it going last week.  It was nice to see the things that have been going on in practice sort of out on the course.
Q. You're making all the correct decisions.  Give me some a little advice here.  I'm headed down to the Sportsbook (indiscernible) this weekend.
BRIAN HARMAN:   I don't know.  I was very surprised at how well Georgia did.  Now I hope I'm not overestimating how good they're going to be tomorrow.  I wish them the best of.  I hope they beat them up.  Who knows?
