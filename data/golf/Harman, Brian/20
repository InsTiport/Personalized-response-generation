Q. Big point for you.  That gives you one and a half here.  Talk about that match.
BRIAN HARMAN: Peter got off to a rough start and I got off to a hot start.  He played some really good golf there towards the middle.  It was all I could do to hang on here to make the nice putt on 15 to save par.  I had a good look at birdie here.  It was a good match.  I played well.  Tightened it up a little bit from yesterday.  I'll be looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. You are going to play Rory.  This is your first time in this event.  Do you like the format?  Do you like the way this plays out?
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it's been a while for match play for me.  Obviously Rory is an incredible player.  What he did last week was really impressive.  I have to play really well to keep up with him.
