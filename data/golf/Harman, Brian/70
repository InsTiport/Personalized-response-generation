Q. You were acting very comfortable out there.   You made the turn with a little bit of a struggle but you pulled it back up. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I just tried to get out there and feel like I feel at home when I'm playing a round of golf.   It was fun.   Made some putts.   It was tough out there.   Hopefully the wind will keep blowing.   Looks like it's kind of laying down right now, but I think it's supposed to blow in the afternoon.
It was tough.   But they had the golf course set up nice.

Q.   Very satisfied?   Sitting in the top five right now?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, if the wind goes down, then it won't hold up very long.   It's the first day.   It's a good start.   I played about as good as I could.   I got the most out of it.   Real proud of the way I played the par‑3s on the back nine.

Q.   A course like this, how important is it to get the first round in, especially when you're in the morning on that first day?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, it's important to do it anywhere.   But you're never out of it, no matter how far back you are.   You've just got to hang in there and see what happens.

Q.   You get to play tomorrow afternoon, looks like rain might be moving in.   What does that mean for you? 
BRIAN HARMAN:   I play 30‑some odd golf tournaments a year and sometimes it rains.   Sometimes it's windy.   Sometimes it's nice.   Just go out and do your best and see what happens.

Q.   Any one shot, one hole that was a big key?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, No. 14.   The par‑3 has always given me nightmares.   I hit a little bullet 5‑iron up there to about 20 feet and made it.   That was big today.   I was glad to sort of get that one, to finally play that hole the way it was supposed to be played. 

Q.   And then finally birdie on 17 and a nice par is always nice on 18?
BRIAN HARMAN:   18 is tough.   I hit a good drive.   It was hard.   The wind is helping a lot on some holes that you don't really need it, and hurting a lot on holes that you don't need it. 

Q.   Talk about the birdies, and I'll ask you about that great save when you ran into that moat. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, the birdies. 

Q.   No.7?
BRIAN HARMAN:   7, birdied the last three par‑3s.   And then I birdied‑‑

Q.   10, 14 and 17, I think?
BRIAN HARMAN:   10 was a nice birdie, made about a 25‑footer.   Just putted well, made some putts, real pleased.

Q.   No.7, what did you make on there?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I hit a 7‑iron to about five feet.   Just a great shot and converted with a putt.

Q.   What was the hole that always gives you trouble?   Maybe it's the one with matter around it and you made a birdie, was that 14?
BRIAN HARMAN:   14.   I think I made a birdie at the Junior Heritage, is the last time I did that. 

Q.   That's not your favorite hole?
BRIAN HARMAN:   No, it's not.   If I hit a great shot up there it's one of my favorite holes.
