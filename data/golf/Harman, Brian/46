Q. How would you describe that?
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I mean, I'd trade both of them to be in contention.  That was pretty wild.  First one, you know, I looked at my caddie, I said, That's my first one out there.
He's like, Well, they come in bunches.
I was like, Yeah, whatever.
Both of them were good shots.  They felt going right in there.
Q. What did you hit at 3 and what did you hit at 14?
BRIAN HARMAN: I hit a 7-iron on 3 and 4-iron on 14.
Q. And the look on Charles' face; he was astounded, as you were.
BRIAN HARMAN: He hit right in front of me.  I think he hit a 4-iron, as well.  Had a bad break, goes right over the hole, over the green on 14.  We go up there, he goes, I want to hit a good shot.
Like I said, I'm still in a little shock about it.  It's pretty crazy to play a hundred-some-odd tournaments and never have one, but to have two in the same tournament is pretty awesome.
Q. You almost eagled 16.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I was aiming low those last few.
Yeah, you know, it was a tough week.  I really had been struggling.  This is a hard golf course.  It was getting better throughout the week.  It's good to at least get it for a couple.
Q. Where would this rank?  You've won on the PGA TOUR, had a lot of success, but this is something that's very unique.  Where does this rank as far as what you've accomplished?
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Obviously I'm trying to make a lot of hole-in-ones.  Hopefully I'll have a lot more, but definitely I'll remember this day for sure.
Q. You have to buy drinks for how long?
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, bad day to do it.  All of us are going into the city tonight, so...  I would much rather had it yesterday.
