 Q.  How were you able to dispose of Rory today?  
BRIAN HARMAN: Well, Rory did not play his best golf today.  I played extremely well.  I'm proud of the way I came out.  Rory is an intimidating guy.  He hits it a mile.  Especially what he did last week.  I kind of had this circled this week and I'm glad I came out and played well.   
 Q.  You are the first guy in this tournament to advance to the weekend.  What does that say about your confidence and your game right now that you got past your pod?  
BRIAN HARMAN: It's good.  I played well last week.  I made lots of doubles and triples.  In this format I can get away with some big numbers.  I knew I was making plenty of birdies and have played well the last three days.   
 Q.  Convincing win over Rory McIlroy.  
BRIAN HARMAN: I played really well.  I made some birdies.  Just had the one X on the card, No. 12.  I made some putts.  Rory started playing a little bit better on the back nine but I was able to make some birdies and keep the momentum going.   
 Q.  Big birdie there on No. 11.  That was a pretty putt.  
BRIAN HARMAN: 11 and I think the one on 13 was the one.  Rory hits it so far.  He's got the advantage on that hole because I can't carry it to the green and he can.  I won that hole.  I'm probably a half a shot underdog on that hole to start with.  So I thought that was the biggest hole of the match.   
 Q.  You are on to the round of 16 for the weekend.  Very difficult to make it there in this format?  
BRIAN HARMAN: It is.  It's hard because you've always got a guy or two in your pod that you are really looking forward to playing.  For me it was Rory.  He's one of the -- he's the hottest player in the world right now.  He won last week.  It was really tough to focus the first two days but I thought I did a really good job of that.  Jhonattan and Peter both played well.  So I'm glad that it kind of brought me back to the present to not look forward because they were both playing well.
