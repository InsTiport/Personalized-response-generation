 Q.   Just overall great round, 6‑under par, first round today.   Talk about how it was out there.   
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, it's a long course, and the pins were tough.   It forced me‑‑ I always kind of fall into the trap of playing too aggressive, and it forced me today to play away from the‑‑ play to the fat side of the green, and I did that really well and made a couple long putts and was really good inside 10 feet.   I hit some great shots, too, pretty much good start to finish.  
   
 Q.   Talk about being in the Playoffs, first time going through this and packing your schedule in here at the end of the year.   Talk about what you're looking forward to the next four weeks, what you have to do to keep going.   
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I've just got to keep playing well.   I haven't done a very good job this year of keeping my emotions in check.   I get really upset when things aren't going my way, and I'm just going to try to do as best I can in these Playoffs to not throw away in the shots and just see where it pans out.  
   
 Q.   Saying you're going to play conservative but then you actually go out and shoot 6‑under‑‑  
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, I made some putts, and then I'm obviously not playing conservative on the shots that I feel really comfortable with, but on the ones that I'm a little iffy about, playing towards the middle of the green and trying to work it back towards the flag.   Yeah, I kept it in the middle of a lot of greens.   My distance control was really good.   Yeah, just solid golf today.  
   
 Q.   One group behind the super group?  
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, one group behind the show.   No, they've done some incredible things for the game.   It was fun to watch them.   I got to watch them hit a bunch of shots, and I've gotten to talk to Tiger a couple times.   He's an awesome dude.   That's cool to watch those guys in their element and learn something.   
   
 Q.   Any distraction with the crowds moving?   
BRIAN HARMAN:   No, no.   The crowds out here are great.   I'm an old baseball player, I like it kind of boisterous out here.   It was fun.   It was great.   Once a couple of their galleries sort of hung around on a couple holes to watch me play a little bit, so it was really cool.
