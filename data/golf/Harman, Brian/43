Q. Goods round today.  Take me through that eagle on the front nine.
BRIAN HARMAN: Yeah, I hit a great drive and had a good number and hit a nice high 5-wood and kind of took the slope and I thought I was going to have about a 15-footer and I guess it trickled back -- I didn't get to watch it -- but it trickled back to a couple feet.  So very fortunate there.
Q. Talk about the importance of just being a few shots off the lead of getting off to a great start on the front nine tomorrow?
BRIAN HARMAN: There's 18 holes left, so I'll try to be as patient as I can.  Obviously, I would love to get off to a great start, but I'm going to try to play the 18 holes the best I can and see where it stacks me up.
Q. What's the one thing this week that's got you in a position you are?
BRIAN HARMAN: Well, I've been hitting it pretty well the last couple weeks.  I just haven't gotten much out of it.  I'm managing my game a little bit better and just making a couple more putts.
