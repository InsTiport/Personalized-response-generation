Q.   Another pretty good day. 
BRIAN HARMAN:   Yeah, yeah, I struck it great today.   I left a couple out there on the greens, but I think I was inside of 15 feet every hole other than No.9 on the front side, so I gave myself a lot of chances and hopefully tomorrow a few more will drop.

Q.   A number of guys said they played really well today but could have done even better.   Do you think that's maybe a theme?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, the playing conditions are very favorable right now, and even late this afternoon the wind kind of died and when it started raining a little bit.   There's plenty of chances there, you just‑‑ it's tough to stay patient sometimes. 

Q.   Good to have your own guy back on the bag?
BRIAN HARMAN:   It was.   Jay did an awesome job yesterday, but I've been with Scott for a long time, and we've done some good work together.   There's definitely a sense of comfort there. 

Q.   What's been really working for you in terms of how you're approaching these holes?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, I do have some experience around this place.   I had a good chance a couple years ago.   I know the golf course well.   I feel very at home around the area here, so I've just been in a really good frame of mind all week. 

Q.   Anything in particular you like about this golf course?
BRIAN HARMAN:   I like that it's in this part of the country.   I enjoy this part of the country.   It's a great golf course.   It's always in really good shape, so I enjoy that, too.   It fits my eye.   Most of the holes fit my eye, so I enjoy that.

Q.   Did you notice any difference in conditions of the course from yesterday morning until this afternoon?
BRIAN HARMAN:   No, not really.   You know, the greens are starting to get a little firmer, but they were still holding solid golf shots, which is pretty typical for here.

Q.   Any particular plan of attack going into the final two days?   You're playing threesomes tomorrow, hopefully to miss some rain.   Any thoughts on that?
BRIAN HARMAN:   Well, there's no telling with the weather, but until you get out there and get a feel for how the round is going, I won't do any planning tonight.   It'll be kind of on the fly tomorrow.   It all depends on how you're feeling and how the course is playing and what feels good and what doesn't feel good.
