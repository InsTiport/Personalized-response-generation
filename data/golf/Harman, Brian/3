  Q. Brian, just a couple real quick.  You've obviously had a lot of success here, two top 10s coming into this week.  What does it mean to string four rounds together on a tough golf course?
 BRIAN HARMAN:   Just a couple swings I wish I could have back today.  Just a couple sloppy bogeys on the front, but nice to make a run on the back nine.  Yeah, I was trying to make birdies.  I was aiming at flags, proud of the way I played 17 and 18, and just came up short.
 Q. Next coming month or so, you've got another few big events coming up.  What does this do for you confidence-wise?  I know you say you don't rank them but --
 BRIAN HARMAN:   I'm not in Augusta.  I'm not in the Match Play.  For me, I've got to keep going.  I've got to keep playing good.  Seems like every time I start playing really well out here, it's like I take a mental break, oh, I'm playing good.  I'm going to try to push through that and keep working hard and just elevate my game to where I think it should be.
