Q.   Congratulations on a nice round today.   5â€‘under par 67 toward the end of the day.   Tied for the lead now.   Just tell us how you played. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I got off to a good start.   Started with three birdies and made a couple more birdies, so it feels like a good start.

Q.   Just talk about what you think about this golf course and whether you thought when you woke up today you had 67 in you? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, well, I've been hitting it very solid lately.   I felt like if I could have a good day, I could shoot low. 
I made a lot of birdies and made it close, so that helped a lot.

Q.   You've made a name for yourself on the Ladies European Tour with a few wins last year.   You played well on the European Solheim Cup team.   How much would it mean to you to come and play consistently well in the U.S.? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Of course I hope to do well here, as well.   I feel like I have the game, and hopefully I can continue to play well.   I've started off good.
