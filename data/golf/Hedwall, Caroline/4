Q. You found something today obviously.  What was the difference?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I was playing well yesterday, too.  Hitting good drives and stuff.  Just didn't make as many putts.
Greens are a bit slower than in the past I feel like.  Or they might not be, but I just feel like I needed to -- like I missed a couple just because I thought they were going to be quicker and turn more.
So today I was a bit more aggressive.  Actually suits me to be able to hit my putts a bit harder.  So I just started hitting a couple close and rolling from some putts.  Yeah, it was nice.
Q. Know how many you had?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Probably eight.  I took a bogey on the first.
Q. Putts I meant.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I have no idea.
Q. You're feeling better now, I think.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I am.
Q. You're taking antibiotics?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I went to the doctor and she said I had like an infection in my throat, so I got some penicillin and some Paracetomol and ibuprofen and I'm taking and vitamin C just to stronger my immune system.  Getting better.
Q. It's been how many weeks now?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I've just had different illnesses coming.  Like I started off with like a belly virus at KPMG that I had for two and a half weeks, and then a normal cold and then a throat infection.  Just been taking over each other.
Q. KPMG was where...
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, a lot of people caught something there.  Like it was something -- like had the same symptoms as food poisoning, but so many people just caught on to it so it must have been something else, like a virus or something.
Q. Charley said it was a something they'd eaten.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I heard something in the air.
Q. That's a kind explanation.  (Indiscernible.)
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, yeah, well, I don't know.  A lot of people picked something up there and everyone has just been -- the people that have had it, they've said they've been bad for two, three weeks.
Q. So you're back playing as well as when?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I don't know.  I mean, I --
Q. The game we saw in Chicago, you had a lot of problems haven't you, injury problems and things?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.  Well, I feel like my game is getting better.  Yeah, and especially my confidence, too.  But, yeah, I guess I haven't played this well since 2013.
Q. Yeah.  We were just discussing the injuries.  It was luggage or something picking up.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, my major injury.  That was m injury when I twisted my wrist when I picked up luggage at the airport.
Q. How long ago was that?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: That was 2014 actually.
Q. And then the next one you had something -- a lump on your wrist?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.  Ganglion.  I had surgery on that.
Q. That was completely different?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, that's one I've had from when I was young.  I had problems with ganglions but they didn't hurt me.  This one kept growing and eventually it was just -- well, turned out -- because I couldn't hit driver for a year.  I was playing a full system without a driver, and then I had it removed and all a sudden I could hit driver again.
It was something with my flexibility and also started hurting.  It was just getting bigger and bigger.  So I had that removed in 2017 I think that was.  Yeah, last year was the first year I played without it.
Q. So it was lost years, weren't they?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, been a struggle.  I feel like, yeah, I just haven't got what I want out of my golf.  I know I can do better.  It's just on a struggle and definitely been tough on my confidence.
Had a couple ups, like when I won in France last year, but it's just been, yeah, tough.
Q. Good for you.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.  Well, still, two more days to go.
Q. Still showing it's there.  That's what matters.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.
Q. Think you can continue this over the weekend?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I hope so.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm not going to have too high expectations.  Right now I'm enjoying playing, and that's what I'm going to try to keep doing.
We'll see what happens.
Q. Your caddie, Jack, has he been working this...
CAROLINE HEDWALL: He actually worked last year at Evian for me and worked KPMG, and then I asked him here.  Always liked working with him.  Now he's doing a three-tournament run with me.
We'll see.  I haven't decided on having a steady caddie.  I kind of like switching around a little bit.  I really enjoy working with Jack.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I need to be sort of in my own bubble on the course and Jack really let's me do that.  He's there if I need help.  That's key for me.  Like I go a lot off my gut when I play, especially when I play well.
Sometimes the number may be saying 7-iron but I feel like it's an 8.  I just hit a hard 8.  I just need a caddie that can trust me in what I'm doing.  I feel like Jack is definitely doing that.
Q. Jack who?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Jack Clarke.
Q. French Jacques or...
CAROLINE HEDWALL: No, Jack, Jack Clark.  He's from outside London.
Q. Do you know if there is an E?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, there is an E.
Q. What would winning a major mean to you?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, that's always been a goal growing up, so, yeah, it would mean everything.  I haven't even won on the LPGA yet, so it would be sort of -- it would be huge.
Q. Swedes have done really well here.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.
Q. Has this inspired you?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Absolutely.  This is one of those tournaments that I remember watching on TV when I was young.  I always wanted to come here.  Now I think this is my eighth time here.
I mean, I love coming here.  It's such a beautiful city and the course.  It's just a great venue.  I love it being a major as well.  So, yeah.
