Q. Did you find something in your game?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: No, changed up my putting quite a bit.  I'm just happy I started rolling in some putts.  Today I didn't have a single bogey, so that was a long time ago, so that felt nice.
Q. When did you change your putting style?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: After China, after Ximin, I had eight weeks off and changed my grip and been working hard on that.  It's nice that it's paying off.
Q. Are you doing left-hand low like a lot of people?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: The opposite.  I used to be left-hand low, now I'm right-hand low.  I've been putting cross-handed for 13 years.  I changed that.
Q. And it's working for you now?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.
Q. So how confident do you feel about this tournament?  Do you feel you've got a chance to win here or are you just looking to --
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I've had a struggle this season.  It feels nice to have finally played a tournament where you don't have to worry about making the cut when you're playing the second round.  I'm just trying to enjoy it and play nice golf.
Q. How is everything fitness-wise, health-wise?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: It feels good.  It turned out -- that's why I changed my putting style because I was still kind of -- it just affected the wrist injury that I had, the one that I had a few years ago, still affected my putting.  So now I have a much smoother stroke and it just feels nice to be rolling the ball really well.
