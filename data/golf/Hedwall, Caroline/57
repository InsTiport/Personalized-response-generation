   THE MODERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We have Caroline Hedwall who was the first out this morning who returned a 3-under par 69. Can I first of all ask you for your reaction.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I didn't hit the ball that great today actually. I saved myself with good putting. So I think I need to go and work on my game on the range because if it starts to -- if the wind starts to pick up, I'm going to struggle if I hit it like that.
 THE MODERATOR: Were the conditions out there pretty easy? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, they were, for sure.

 Q. You've had a tremendous start to your professional career winning twice this year. Are you sort of ahead of the game as far as that's concerned? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I didn't expect to win twice already on the European Tour, but I thought I was ready, and obviously I was. It was just great to get a good start.
 THE MODERATOR: You also won the PowerPlay at Celtic Manor a couple years ago. Everything has been good so far?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: It's been really good. 

 Q. There seems to be a bit of confusion over your score. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, they thought I made a birdie on No. 15, but I made a par. 
 THE MODERATOR: Why don't we go through your birdies and bogeys. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: The 3rd hole I think I got a bad yardage. I hit a 5-iron off the tee and then I hit it short of the water, which was kind of surprising. I hit a chip too long and then two-putted.
 THE MODERATOR: Par-5, 6, what did you hit in there? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: 3-wood, driver off the tee.
 THE MODERATOR: Birdied the 7th.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I hit a hybrid and then 6-iron and then holed like a four-metre putt.
 THE MODERATOR: Bogeyed the short hole, the par-3. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I hit my 7-iron in the bunker and didn't manage to get it up-and-down. 
 THE MODERATOR: Birdied the 9th.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I hit it from the rough to about a metre. 
 THE MODERATOR: What did you hit in there? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: 7-iron. 
 THE MODERATOR: Birdied the 11th.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Just hit a 56-degree wedge to a metre. 
 THE MODERATOR: Bogeyed 13. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I got the wrong yardage again. I hit it too far.

 Q. What did you hit there? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: A 6-iron, should have been a 7. 
 THE MODERATOR: Birdied the 14th. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I hit it on in two and two-putted, driver and 3-wood. 
 THE MODERATOR: How long was the first putt.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Probably about 15 metres.
 THE MODERATOR: And birdied 17. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I made a sand save from the bunker. 
 THE MODERATOR: What did you hit off the tee there.
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Hybrid and then a 4-iron into the green bunker. 

 Q. Can you talk about having your sister on the bag? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: She's not doing the yardages. That was all my fault. It was just, yeah, a bad day obviously.

 Q. But just having her alongside you and how she helped you?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, she's really good at reading putts, so she helped me a lot about that. She just gives me confidence and we have a lot of fun, so it's great.

 Q. What is your sister called?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Jacqueline.

 Q. Talk about hitting the first shot, how that felt. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: That was kind of cool, yeah. Someone told me I was going to be the first one, and I thought, yeah, that's a great honour for sure. It's a great golf course and a lot of fun that the women get to play here. It's fun. 

 Q. Early on on the 5th when you didn't hole a birdie putt and you got a little bit angry and you were sort of looking a little bit frustrated on the greens, how did you sort of turn that around?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: On 5? Did I look angry? Actually it's my serious face, I guess. I guess because I hit a good putt, and it was right in the line but I didn't hit it hard enough. I felt pretty confident. I was just -- I had a few good chances and I didn't make any birdies the first five holes, but then I made it on 6, so after that I kept putting well. 

 Q. Can I ask what your plans are? Are you going to try LPGA qualifying school at the end of the year?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I don't think so. I'm pretty comfortable in Europe right now, and I'm not in a hurry to get over to the LPGA really. We'll see what happens. 

 Q. Talk about the Solheim Cup and your feelings about trying to make the team. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I guess I need to win this one or the next one to be able to play into the team, but I mean, I think I have a good chance to get a wild card. But I don't want to have too high expectations because I don't know what they're looking for in their wild cards and I'm still a rookie and everything, but of course I want to play. That would be a lot of fun.

 Q. Does your sister caddie all the time?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, she is actually doing her internship for a major in the States. She goes to Louisiana State University and she's in a sports administration and leadership major, so this is her 300-hour internship for the summer. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I don't really have any goals. I enjoy playing professional golf, and of course I want to -- well, I want to win majors in the future, but right now I just want to have fun and enjoy life. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course. I've always wanted to go to Dubai, so I think it will be a lot of fun. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, we'll see. I guess Miyazato is far ahead, but we'll see. 

 Q. How has your game changed since this time last year where you were low am? Do you feel you're a better player?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yes, for sure, I think I'm a better player, but it's hard to say what I've changed. I think I'm just a little bit better in everything. Yeah, and I have better confidence I would say. 

 Q. Do you feel LPGA Q-school last year not finishing probably like you would have liked, do you feel that worked out for the best being in Europe?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yes, last year after all the Q-schools and everything, I felt it was quite nice to be in Europe and be close to home, and it turned out to be good for me. I'm not sure I'm ready to move to the States yet. But I really want to play there in the future, of course, yeah. 
 THE MODERATOR: What time did you have to get up this morning to make your 6:30 start time? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: 4:30. It was early, but it turned out to be nice. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, and good luck for the rest of the week.
