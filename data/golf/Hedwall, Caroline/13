 Q.  Tough finish obviously at the end there.  How would you describe the round?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, it was just as solid as yesterday really.  I'm really happy with my game.  I could have made a couple more putts out there and obviously had a better finish, but I'm just happy with my game.   
I'm looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  You said yesterday you have been working a lot on your putting.  What specifically?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, basically just trusting it.  My technique is pretty good, but when you get out there and you start thinking too much, it's going to mess you up.   
I'm just trying to work on my confidence really.  Now I feel like I found a way to just start the ball online and live with it, see if it falls in.   
 Q.  Why do you think your confidence has been affected over the last couple years?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I think it all started with that injury I had 2014.  I hadn't really had any struggles before that.  It was just going up and going forward.   
All of a sudden it was just being tougher and my technique wasn't there.  It was just tough.   
 Q.  What did you do to turn it all around?  Did you work with anybody?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, not really.  I mean, you just kind of have to realize that this is how good I am.  In the end, you have to trust it when you're out there, too.
