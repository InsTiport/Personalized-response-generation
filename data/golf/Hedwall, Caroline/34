 Q.   I just want to ask you about your round today.   How did you feel out there today?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I just didn't‑‑ I felt like I didn't get the right club.   It was just in between yardage, so I couldn't commit to that many shots, and I didn't hit it close enough.   Then Lydia just went off.   I mean, she was unbelievable today.  
   
 Q.   How much does that affect you guys playing with her when she's playing so well?   Do you just have to try to concentrate on your game and not worry about what she's doing?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, of course.   I was trying to keep up with her, but at the same tie I couldn't hit it as close and make as many putts.   She was just really impressive today.  
   
 Q.   Overall, what were your impressions with the tournament?   Are you happy with the way you played all week?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, this is one of my better finishes on the LPGA, so I'm very happy this week.   I'm still waiting for my first win, but hopefully it will come soon.   
   
 Q.   You were saying after being I guess so dominant at the Solheim Cup and then coming in today what were the nerves like last night?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I slept okay, to be honest.   I was just excited to come out and play today.   I had a lot of fun out there.   It's just that Lydia was way too good today.
