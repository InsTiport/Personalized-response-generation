 Q.   You dropped a few yesterday, but you're still in the top 10.   Tell us how you feel about your position going into round three?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, it was a little unfortunate with that triple I had on number 4 yesterday, but I think I still played well in the end.   I mean, 3‑over with a triple, that's okay on a U.S. Open golf course.   I'm still happy I'm in the top 10, and hopefully I can play well this afternoon.   
   
 Q.   Now with the top 10 positioning, you probably won't play till later; what will you do the rest of the day?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I think I'm going to go back to where I'm staying and probably take a nap, rest a little bit, and come out and warm‑up like I usually do for a round just to start it over.  
   
 Q.   When you got here, did you still feel like you had what you had when you started the championship, do you feel like you're getting better?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I feel good about my game, and especially I've been putting really well.   I did struggle a little bit off the tees, but if I can try to get it on the fairways, I feel that I can give myself a lot of birdie opportunities and hopefully score low in the afternoon.  
   
 Q.   After playing two rounds, what do you think is the one factor that's critical and the main thing that determines scoring here?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Putting.
