Q.   Congratulations on another solid day out there today.   Can you just take me through the round? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I can't really remember it.   It was just up and down all day, but I was playing solid.   It's just I hit my longer irons a little bit worse than the rest of the game.   So if I can just work on that, I'm back tomorrow and hopefully can shoot low.

Q.   Anything different between yesterday and today for you out on the course?   The game was pretty steady both days? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   My longer irons weren't as good as they were yesterday.   That's what I need to work on so hopefully I can have a good weekend.

Q.   What is the big key out here for the final days heading into the weekend?   What is the big thing going low on this golf course? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Just to hit fairways because it's pretty tight on the greens, obviously.   They're pretty small, so you need to hit your irons really well.

Q.   To have that feeling that you weren't hitting your irons as well as your longer irons and to still be at the top of the leaderboard, you have to feel good about your game now?
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I do feel good.   I just need to work a little more on my longer irons.   If I can do that, I'll have a good weekend.

Q.   Overall to the start this year, how have you felt about your game? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   It feels good.   I feel like my putting is getting better and better.   That's what I think I need to improve the most to shoot low all the time.

Q.   Do you feel more comfortable out here as well?   Second year on Tour, getting more accustomed, I guess, to everything that goes on throughout the season? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, I think it was good for me to get one year in Europe.   Now I feel like I'm ready to come over here. 
I do enjoy it a lot and I feel very comfortable, so it's fun.
