 Q.   Talk to me about that match.   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   It was really important.   Obviously if we can have as big a lead as possible tomorrow, that's important.  
   
 Q.   You're playing unbelievable golf for Europe right now.   What's the key for you right now?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, it's just unbelievable to play under these circumstances.   I love the atmosphere and it's just, it pumps me up, I guess.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel no lead is safe going into tomorrow though?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   No, well definitely not.   We need to play well tomorrow.   The Americans are really strong in the singles, so we just have to focus on getting all the points we can.
