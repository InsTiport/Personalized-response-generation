 Q.   Obviously you guys wanted two points, but one is still good.   How did you guys feel throughout the round?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I'm disappointed because I felt that we played a lot better and I'm just very impressed by their short game and how they managed to make a lot of good putts and make a lot of good up‑and‑downs.   
I felt like we had a lot of good chances, but we couldn't really convert on the greens.  
   
 Q.   Do you think that was where it was, where they just converted on putts mostly?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, mostly.   I felt like we always gave us at least one or even two good chances for birdie, and they just managed to get up‑and‑downs when they missed the greens.   
But definitely felt like we played pretty good, but just couldn't get anything going.   
   
 Q.   First tee, take me back to the National Anthem, bring me through that.   I know that was probably a good start for you guys and you didn't even end up starting good.   But take me through that.   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, it was just a nice feeling, hearing your national anthem and teeing off, it was a fun thing to get going.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about throughout the round, did you guys say, Hey, let's get it going?   Was there any game plan, any strategy?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   We played really well, both of us, and just gave ourselves a lot of chances.   Then they managed to hole a couple more putts than we did.   But I think we fought back really nice and it's good to get one point at least.
