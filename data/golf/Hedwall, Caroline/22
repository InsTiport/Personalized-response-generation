 Q.   Caroline, great tournament despite the outcome.   How are you feeling right now?  
    CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Of course you're always a little disappointed that you couldn't pull it off and win.   
    At the same time, the up and down she made 0n 17 was just incredible.  
    So, I mean, I'm still happy with the second place.   I struggled this season, so it's nice to get a good finish.   It gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the Asian swing.  
   
 Q.   How about course conditions, especially the wind?   What kind of factor was that?   
    CAROLINE HEDWALL:   It was tougher out there today.   Mirim shot a really good score today.   I think most girls out there were struggling a little bit with the wind, because it's a tough golf course in the wind.   
    I think even par is a decent score today.   Could've made a couple of birdies, but it just didn't happen.   
   
 Q.   How about pace of play?   Long day out there.   Was it grueling?  
    CAROLINE HEDWALL:   A little bit too long.   We turned at three hours.   I think took six hours to play.   That's kind of what happens when the wind picks up.   It gets confusing and gets hard to commit to the shots and make decisions.   I didn't think about it that much, but it was slow, yeah.   
   
 Q.   So you're going to leave here with overall good impressions of the Reignwood LPGA Classic?  
    CAROLINE HEDWALL:   For sure.   Like I said, just gives me a lot of confidence having a good finish like this.   No, I'm definitely happy.   
   
 Q.   Good.   Well, congratulations.   
    CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Thank you.
