 Q.   You're the first person in Solheim Cup history to win five points out of five, and you have retained the Solheim Cup for Europe in America for the first time.   How does that feel?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I don't know what to say right now.   I'm just shaking.   It's unbelievable.   It's such a good feeling.   
   
 Q.   And the atmosphere here, this is something you sort of dream of, isn't it?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   This is really what you practice for, to be part of this moment.   It's unbelievable.   
   
 Q.   Your sister was in Ireland this week, and she was playing over there, what are you going to say to her when you speak to her?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I don't know.   I don't know what to say.   I can't believe this.   
   
 Q.   Is this the most exciting moment in your career?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   It is.   It is.   
   
 Q.   When you came here in the beginning of the week, you thought this golf course would suit you, but there's no way in your wildest dreams could you ever imagine you're going to win five points on the final hole the putt for Europe to win in America for the first time.   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, I don't know what to say.   I'm still shaking here.   It's just amazing.   It's so great.   There are no words, to be honest.  
   
 Q.   Were you tired playing every single match?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I was really pumped up on 17 and then when they blew the horn I said, oh, no.   
But I went in there and gave a little talk to myself, and I went out there, and I was just as pumped as I was before.   And I kind of took right off.  
   
 Q.   How about that second shot?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I don't know what to say.   
   
 Q.   Tell me how you're feeling when you're walking around reading that putt on the last green.   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well I was shaking and I was just‑‑ because I wasn't really sure of the line, and then just decided that I wanted to hit it inside the left and I did.   And it went right in.   I don't know what to say.   
   
 Q.   Well Europe played really well this week, what was the mental approach that you guys had, starting from Monday when you arrived here?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well I think that we could just‑‑ we knew that we could win here.
