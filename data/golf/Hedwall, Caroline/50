 Q.   All right.   We're joined by Caroline Hedwall.   Congratulations on a great round today; 67.   Can you just take me through the day and what was working well for you?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I played really solid the first two days, and then today the putts started to roll in, so that helped a lot.  
I made a good putt on No. 4, I think, and then an eagle on No. 5, and then I was just on a good roll.  
Unfortunately I had two bogeys, but managed to shoot pretty low on the Back 9 as well, so it was nice.  
   
 Q.   Is it ever disappointing when you're having that day?   I mean you had so many birdies and then the eagle to kind of have those little stumbling block bogeys in there as well?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah.   I shot 5‑under and I made three bogeys, so if I can just try to not make any bogeys tomorrow it will be good.  
   
 Q.   But to be able to move up so far on the leaderboard heading into Sunday, feel pretty good about the position you've put yourself in?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Oh, yeah, I do.   I mean 8‑under is a good score coming into the last day, so hopefully I can have a good round tomorrow, too.  
   
 Q.   I know the weather is supposed to change for tomorrow, and everybody's been talking about the conditions.   Any keys ‑‑ did you feel like you kind of needed to go out there and shoot low today to kind of put yourself ‑‑  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah.   I'm kind of used to playing in bad weather, coming from Sweden.   So I'm looking forward to the bad weather tomorrow.   I think it's an advantage for me, so just bring it on.  
   
 Q.   Wonderful.   Thank you very much.
