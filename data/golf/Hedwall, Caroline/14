Q. Bogey-free 66.  Incredible.  You have to be happy with that round.
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  It was just a solid day.  I hit it really well and started making a couple putts in my back nine.
Just I'm really happy with how I'm playing and looking forward to the rest of the days.
Q. It's been is difficult couple of years for you dealing with a wrist injury.  How are you feeling now?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Now I feel like my game is really solid.  It's just my putting that I've actually been struggling with the past couple years.
It's just all about trust and having self-confidence.  I feel like I've gained that now.  I had good practice sessions the last couple days, and it's starting to pay off.  That's really nice.
Q. What's your game plan for the rest of the week?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Trying to do the same thing.  It would be nice to keeping bogey-free.
