  Q. You had a great round today, you were 2-under, including a double bogey or a triple?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: A triple.  
  
  Q. Could you talk about that a little bit?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I just hit it too far and I was up in this yellow kind of thing, and I just hit two shots there and then three-putted.  
  
  Q. And you had some amazing birdies?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I started off really well and I played extremely good, and then I had the triple, but I finished good with three birdies.   
  
  Q. How did it feel to be the leading amateur?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: It feels really good.  
  
  Q. Is this your first major?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: No, I've played this tournament three times, so this is my third time.  
  
  Q. How have you done in the past?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I've missed the cut both years.  
  
  Q. At the moment you're tied 32nd, I think, so you're doing really well.   
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Anna Nordqvist won this, your countryman. Does this inspire you to try and go on and do some other things perhaps?  
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course. She's been playing really well, and we played a lot on the national team together, so of course it's inspiring.  
  
  Q. And in 2005 Michelle Wie actually won the amateur medal.   
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Oh, okay.   
  
  Q. How did you qualify for this?   
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I won the European Individual Championship.
