 Q.  So how do you feel just being in the position that you're in?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I'm just looking forward to it.  I mean, it's been a long time.  Just be nice to be in contention.  Hopefully I can pull off a decent round tomorrow, too.   
 Q.  Are you like excited?  Battling adrenaline because you know you're right there at the top?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, absolutely.  I did hit it a little bit further today just because of that.  I kind of had to take that into account when I was picking clubs.   
But it's just a really great feeling.  I also get nervous, of course.  That's a good feeling.  That's what I'm trying to convince myself about sometimes.   
Obviously I need a good week here to get into ANA.  That's my main goal really.  I am hoping to just pull off a good round tomorrow and qualify into next week.   
 Q.  So that's been in the back of your mind?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Oh, absolutely.  I love ANA and everything about that tournament.  That's been a big goal for this week.  I knew I needed a decent week, and now I'm in a good position.   
I'm just looking forward to tomorrow, and we'll see what happens.
