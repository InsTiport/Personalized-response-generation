 Q.   At what point did you see or hear that 5‑under was where the lead was?   How far along were you?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I saw maybe after 14 holes or something, I can't remember.   I just saw that Inbee was 5‑under, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel a little pressure going in?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Not really, I like being in this position.   I mean, I hit a good wedge in.   I just was a little unlucky that it bounced over.   I hit a good putt, but it broke more than I thought.   4‑under is still a great start for the tournament, and I'm happy with that.  
   
 Q.   What did you think when you saw the set‑up of the course today, when you got here and saw where they put the tees?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, they moved a lot of the tees up, so it played easier than I thought it would.   The conditions have been nice all day for me too.   I guess it will get tougher during the week though, so I just have to fight.  
   
 Q.   Knowing that, how important is this start for you today?   You touched on it briefly, but knowing that these pins are going to be a little crazy on Sunday?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, well, 4‑under is a great start for a U.S. Open, so I'm really happy with it.   I think it's really going to be a battle for pars for the rest of the week.   So I'm in a great position.   It's fun.  
   
 Q.   How did you read that putt on 9?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Just left edge, and I hit the left edge, but it broke more.  
   
 Q.   The greens here, the tees are moved, but did the greens play the way that you practiced them as well?   
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, I think so, but I think I stayed on the right side of the pin all day which helped a lot.   I didn't have that many tricky putts.   I stayed away from three‑putts, I think.   So that's always good on this course.
