Q. Obviously let's start with the 18th.  It seemed like a little frustration there.  Probably a birdie potentially.  I know you birdied 16th and 17th as well.  How big was that hole?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: I didn't birdie 16, but I birdied 17.  So that was a really nice birdie.  But obviously, you want to finish off with a birdie on 18 too.  And I thought I hit a really great putt down there.  It looked great, and it just stopped at the top.  It was nice to get that par, and I'm really happy with my round today, and hopefully a Top 10.  No, it's a good tournament, so I'm happy with that.
Q. Your name has been at the top of the leaderboard the entire weekend.  What has kept you in contention?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I've been striking it really well this week.  Yesterday was just really disappointing with my putting, but I think I just wanted it so bad that I just got too tense and didn't make anything.  So I'm -- it was just very disappointing yesterday, but I'm happy with the way I finished today, and it's good to have a good event in my bag now.
Q. How much momentum does this give you going forward to the rest of the season?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, it means a lot to be up there.  I mean, it's a good experience to play in the last group on a Saturday.  I'm just really looking forward to the rest of the season now.
