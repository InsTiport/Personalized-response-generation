Q. It might temper feelings a bit, but it's a pretty good start to your Evian Championship today?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, for sure, I'm very happy with it.  I played very solid.  I could have made a couple more putts, but it was a solid and good round, so I'm happy with that start.
Q. This is a big couple weeks for you, for a lot of players out here.  But for you, last major and then into the Solheim.  Is it confidence building to get a first round in?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course.  I struggled a little bit last week in Sweden on the greens, and I felt like I made a couple more putts today.  It just feels good to see a couple roll in.  Hopefully there can be some more in the coming days.  But I'm happy with the red number today.
Q. What do you do tomorrow then to kind of continue this moving forward?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, basically just play the same game and hopefully just roll in a couple.  I feel solid.  I had a lot of good looks and maybe a couple more will fall tomorrow.
Q. It was really the greens, like you played really well on the greens today, or did you feel you played well overall?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I played really well from tee to green, but at least I made three-putts today.  So I'm happy with that.  I had a lot of good looks, but last week I didn't make a single putt, so today I made three, so that's going forward.
Q. It was about ten feet here on 18?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I've actually had good looks on 15, 16, 17, 18, but I didn't make them.  But then again I'm happy with I read one today and it feels like a good start.
Q. How long were the birdie putts on three?
CAROLINE HEDWALL: On 15 it was only three, but downhill and 15 about 8, 9, and 17 maybe 10 and here.
