 Q.  A round of seven under, the best by far so far this afternoon.  What was going right for you?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I was actually 6-under.  They had it wrong.  But 6-under, I'm really pleased with that round.  I was struggling a little bit off the tee, but I was just putting amazing today, so I was just taking advantage of a hot putter and got a low one in, so that's nice with the weather coming in tomorrow.   
 Q.  Stayed pretty fair today, so important to have a good score?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, it's nice to have a low one coming into tomorrow.  You never know what you're going to get tomorrow.  Seems like a pretty big storm coming in.  I'm just very pleased with my game and I'm going to go hit a couple of tee shots, and if I can just get that sorted for tomorrow, I feel like I'm ready for it.   
 Q.  We just said it's not as if you're unused to these conditions tomorrow, growing up in Sweden.  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: For sure.  I've played many rounds in bad weather conditions, so I think I am ready for it.  It was a couple years ago, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.   
 Q.  It was a very good day to shoot a score like that, wasn't it, considering the group you were playing in and a certain tournament coming up?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, I was very pleased to play really well today obviously, playing with Catriona, but it's not going to be one round counting for Solheim.  I mean, I'm just looking into this tournament and trying to play well and it's just a bonus that I get to play with Catriona because she's nice to play with.   
 Q.  And when you shoot 6-under, let's face it, what a nice bonus?  
CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, absolutely.  I'm pleased.
