   BETHAN CUTLER: Thank you for joining us, Caroline. Congratulations on your excellent 5-4 victory with Sophie today. Can you just tell us how important that point on the board was for you? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, of course, it gives me a lot of self-confidence coming into the rest of the week. It was just a great win. I think we both played really well, and that's good. 
 BETHAN CUTLER: What do you think that says about you in your debut appearance and the way you played today? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I just loved the moment. It's been so much fun, and I'm just really enjoying myself out there. And I think that's why I can play so well. It's just great. 
 BETHAN CUTLER: An all-Swedish pairing, how was it playing with Sophie? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: It was great. I think we have a similar game. Like I said, I think we played really well both of us, and that makes us a really good team.

 Q. When did you know you were going to play this afternoon? When did Alison tell you? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, Ali told me to prepare and warm up, but I didn't know who I was going to play with until like 11:30 or something.

 Q. What did you think of the pace of play? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: It was pretty slow, for sure. But we had a lot of rulings out there, and Sophie had to take some medical time off at number 7, because I think her knee was -- she wasn't feeling good in her knee, obviously. 
 So that's why we were behind a little bit. But we caught up, but it was still pretty slow.

 Q. Could you tell us about how you felt on the first tee? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, of course, I was very nervous, but I really love those situations. I just enjoy it so much. Just I hit a good drive on the fairway, so that was nice.

 Q. Can you just give us an idea of the atmosphere and the fans and the noises that are going around? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: It's just a great atmosphere. I love playing, and the crowd, they're so good. It's so much fun to play.

 Q. Have you played in front of a crowd as noisy and supportive as that before? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: No, never.

 Q. How did you deal with it then? How did you cope? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I just think it's so much fun, and I enjoy it, so it's not very hard to cope.

 Q. Have you a personal shot of the day? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: That would probably be my hybrid on number -- the one before we finished, number 13. It was just such a good shot to that pin, too.

 Q. What was the distance that you had? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I think it was like 170 meters.

 Q. Is that how far you normally hit the hybrid? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: No, it was a pretty strong wind, into the wind, but it was a good hybrid.

 Q. Congratulations, what a wonderful victory the pair of you. Rookie game for you, Caroline, but you didn't look like a rookie out there?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: I don't know. I just tried to play my game, and we had a lot of fun out there, and we played well, both of us. It was a good win.

 Q. With such a large victory, it must be beyond your expectations? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I think we have a good team, and I think Sophie and I make a good pair. I'm not surprised we won. 

 Q. Talking about the margin of victory, but 2 points out of 2 today for your partner. She's taken some part in what's looking like a very decent leaderboard right now?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Oh, yeah, it's looking great. I hope we can continue to play well.

 Q. So you think maybe you can increase the lead and get a bit more for you? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course. Tomorrow's a new day, and hopefully we can play well tomorrow too.
