 Q.  First of all, talk about the hole in one.  
YOONA KIM: You know, didn't expect it at all.  Coming into this week at the practice rounds I thought 7 would be a little tough.  The tees are moved up, so I grabbed the club I liked, and when it was up in the air looked pretty good.   
I told it to sit a little because I thought it might be over.  My mom started screaming, people started clapping, and I was like, Okay, I'll take it.   
 Q.  Have you had one before?  
YOONA KIM: No.  This is my first one.   
 Q.  Congrats.  
YOONA KIM: Thank you.   
 Q.  Talk about the match in general.  
YOONA KIM: Yes, I haven't had a lot of match play experience.  Definitely something new.  It was definitely a different mindset than stroke play, just taking it one hole at a time, not letting mistakes affect me too much.  You know, it's once and done.   
So that was definitely the mindset throughout the entire 18 holes.  I kind of had it getting away from me the last couple holes, but I stayed in, grinded it out.  Had a good birdie on 16.  Just made me more confident for the rest of the match, and I got it.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Talk about the course in general.  Have you enjoyed it?  
YOONA KIM: Yes, it's so beautiful.  There is definitely a couple holes where you just have to be very accurate, so I think that's what really tests your game.  But the conditions are amazing.  Greens are so nice.  Of course the flower hole will be so nice to play.
