 Q.   Max opening 4‑under par.   Your thoughts on today?  
MAX ALVERIO:   A little frustrating because I hit the ball ‑‑ I've been hitting the ball good for the last three weeks, you know, and I came into today's round with really no expectations because it's hard to execute with this kind of pressure.   I don't really feel a whole lot of pressure, but it's there, you know.  
You know, I had some opportunities to get a decent round, you know.   A couple bad breaks here and there, but I hit the ball decent through the middle of the round.   Then again, you know, I didn't execute towards the end.   So I gave myself some opportunities toward the end to get out, at least shoot even par or one over to have a good chance tomorrow.   
But you know, it didn't happen that way.   It's a crazy game and we'll see what happens tomorrow.   I look forward to try to make good swings and stay in the present.
