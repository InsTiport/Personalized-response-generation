Q.   That was a good round.   That put you in contention for tomorrow.   What do you think of your chances for winning tomorrow? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I just don't want to get pressure.   I just try to play my own game tomorrow. 

Q.   What has been working well for you the last three days? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Actually my putter improved much and then my iron shot was good, and no wind when I play.   So I think I can play like this. 

Q.   Do you feel comfortable being the joint leader in the last tournament on the Asian Tour? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I'll be nervous, yes.   Actually, yes. 

Q.   Feel a bit of pressure?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Yes. 

Q.   Can you talk us through your round today?   How many birdies? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Six birdies. 

Q.   And were they long putts? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   No.   My wedge shot was good this time, like 150 yards in, everything was like ten feet inside.   My putter was good, so I made all of that one. 

Q.   What do you think you need to do to win tomorrow, do you think?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   No pressure.   Just play my own game.
