Q.   I know you must be disappointed, talk to us about the 18th hole, what happened there. 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I have a lot of pressure.   I just try my best.   I don't have regret this week.   I think I do my best today. 

Q.   You led by three shots at the turn.   How did you feel at the time and what did you try to do at the time?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I just try to play my game, but I cannot do that because of pressure.   I hope I have next time.

Q.   What happened with the second shot?   What were you trying to do?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I tried to putt it because if I swing a poor shot, it's over.   So I'm trying to control the ball.   It's going to slice. 

Q.   What club was it?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   3‑wood.

Q.   What were you trying to do with the third shot?   Were you trying to skid it on? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I was just trying to roll it but the ball‑‑

Q.   Was it under the bush?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Yes, on the bush. 

Q.   On the 17th, as well, you started to lose‑‑ did the pressure start to get to you on 17?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Exactly.

Q.   What happened on 17?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   I missed short putt, like three feet, two feet. 

Q.   Arjun made three birdies in a row on the back nine to narrow the gap.   Did that rattle you a little bit? 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   No, there is no pressure there.   But I just pressure on myself. 

Q.   But you must be very happy with the way your season has been, even though the end was a little disappointing.   You played well in the season. 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Yeah, I don't have regret this season.   I really happy about this. 

Q.   How will you combat the pressure?   How will you learn from today?
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Just try to play your own game every time. 

Q.   I suppose this is good experience for you. 
    WANG JEUNG‑HUN:   Yes, I hope so.
