Q. Really great run.  Made it to the semifinals.  Thoughts about the week and performance?
SUSAN COHN: Well, honestly, if you told me I would be here on Wednesday afternoon I don't know that I would've been real confident about that.
But it was a great tournament.  Sue played well this afternoon.  I just didn't have my best this afternoon.
Q. Sure.  What do you think the key was this afternoon?  Anything particular about your game that just wasn't working?
SUSAN COHN: Just didn't feel maybe confident enough.  Came back at times; and I think I was a little nervous.
Then I would get it back and it would go away.
Q. Sure.
SUSAN COHN: And it's golf.  Yeah, it's not really explainable.
Q. Right.  Seemed like you were putting pretty well; just couldn't get anything to actually drop.  A lot of good lag putts, mid-rangers just right on the edge.
SUSAN COHN: And then two bad three-putts earlier today, and you don't get that back.  Then a few clubs where I didn't align myself well.
Hit a shot and say, What was that?  Mistakes that you don't normally make.  Maybe I'm tired, but I hate to use that as an excuse because I feel fine.
But it's a long week.  It's been amazing.  Everybody here has been amazing.  USGA is always wonderful.  They always are.
