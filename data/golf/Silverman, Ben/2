Q. Good start for you.  You missed only four fairways, and scrambling you got up-and-down five out of seven including one at No. 9.  That's a pretty good formula.
BEN SILVERMAN: Yeah, I didn't know I hit that many fairways, but I'm used to hitting fairways, so for me it feels comfortable.  But yeah, me and my caddie have a great strategy for this week for kind of moving forward.  We've picked a style of swing that is comfortable for me, and we just move my targets for wind, and I think that helped hit more fairways, and when I missed greens, I was missing because we had a better club in hand and I had a slightly easier up-and-down where I could bump it into a low spot.  I was never short sided.
Q. You're from Canada, but you live down here now.  You went to FAU, Florida Atlantic, so you're familiar with the weather and the south Florida scene, so it must be pretty comfortable for you here?
BEN SILVERMAN: It's really comfortable.  It's like a second home.  I've been here since '06, and I'm 31, so it's almost half my life I've been down here really, so I'm used to the weather, I'm used to the Bermuda, the style of course, and I've played this course a ton of times, mini-Tour events plus Q-school.
Q. You made it through the Web.com TOUR to here, finished top 25 last year on the Money List.  You've made five of eight cuts so far.  What have you learned so far in this short stint on the PGA TOUR?
BEN SILVERMAN: I'm slowly getting more comfortable out here.  I know the courses now, so I'm working more on my game in the practice area and less on practice rounds, and I think it's going to pay off moving forward.
Q. Tomorrow you'll have the afternoon tee time; do you think the wind will be up, or did you catch it good today?
BEN SILVERMAN: You know, any wind I think we'll get this week won't compare to Puerto Rico from last week, so I'll be ready for it.  It's fine.
