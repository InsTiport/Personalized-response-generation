Q. A second round 65, no dropped shots today.  You must be pleased with the day's work?
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, it was obviously really nice.  Always nice being paired with Matthew Southgate.  I tend to play well when I'm paired with him.  It was really cool and had a nice day.  Nice South African weather, so it's cool.
Q. Three birdies early on and it's always nice at this kind of golf course to get a little run going early on.
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, I lipped-out for birdie on the first and left it in the jaws on the second, but hit it stiff on the third and made about a 45-footer on the fourth, which kind of got me going.
Yeah, it was just nice to go on from there and kind of just keep it going really and not slowdown.
Q. You had a great year last year, tied fourth in this competition.  How much of that experience have you been able to bring to this week?
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, obviously a lot.  I feel right at home for some reason.  I walk on to this golf course and feel right at home.  I see the tee shots and see the shots into the greens and know the lines around the pins.
It's just a matter of controlling my emotions and staying patient, and come the weekend, we'll see what happens.
Q. You're tied for the lead at the moment, so whatever happens, you're going in in a strong position on the weekend.  How excited are you about thinking about tomorrow and Sunday from there on?
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, Race to Dubai, it ends here, you know, so two more days of the season left.  So excited to go and give it everything and see what happens.
