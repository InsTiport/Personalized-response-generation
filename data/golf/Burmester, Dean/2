 Q.  Tied fourth second year running.  Give us your assessment.  
DEAN BURMESTER: It was a good day.  It was tough out there.  A couple things didn't go my way, but you can't complain if you finish fourth in an event.  All in all, I'm happy to finish the season that way and I'm looking forward to the new one.   
 Q.  Overall, what have you taken positively about the game over the last four days?  What's pleased you most?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, look, practise has been paying off.  I've started playing better from the British Masters.  It's nice to get another Top-10.  It's nice to have two weeks in a row like that.   
 Q.  Top five in the driving distances for the first three days.  Must be nice to have a course where you can get the driver out on a lot of holes and be aggressive.  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, that's probably one of the reasons why I like it so much.  Like you say, a lot of holes, I can just get out there and rip it.  A lot of lines I'm taking at, the guys don't have.   
On the 8th hole, for instance, that bunker on the left is never in play.  Doesn't matter where the wind is.  I suppose that kind of thing plays in my favour.  It's pretty nice, and I look forward to coming back next year.   
 Q.  How pleasing to finish with a birdie on 18 with the big crowds around?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, that was big.  I was looking at the leaderboard I said, come on, can't finish worse than last year.  It was nice to knock it in.
