 Q.  Lowest round of the week, a 65.  You must be exceptionally pleased with that?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, I am.  Obviously I feel like I've been playing well for a little while.  Just been missing a couple easy shots.  Today I managed to put everything together.  Could have hit it better with the driver but it was a great day with the putter and I'm just ecstatic.   
 Q.  It's been like playing four different golf courses over four days.  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, the wind on middle two days was kind of all over the place, a little different both days.  And yesterday, Pete and I were just saying it was brutal yesterday; it was just hanging there.   
And early this morning, we just had perfect weather and a little bit of rain that they had maybe overnight just softened the greens up a little bit.  Managed to play a little easier and reward good shots.  It was good fun.   
 Q.  Your reaction on 18 shows what this kind of score means to you.  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, it does.  I feel like first Rolex Series Event, it's always good to get off to a great start and it's a great initiative.  You know, other than the things that come with it, you never know, Open spots and stuff like that.   
But I was staying in the moment and I was just trying to post the best score I could, and I just signed the court, the new course record.  That's quite cool.   
 Q.  What targets did you set for the rest of this year?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Main target is play as many major championships as I can, get into them.  I'm playing the qualifier tomorrow at Walton Heath.  After that, try and get into The Open and then maybe the PGA.   
So that's goal No. 1, and then goal No. 2 would be just get into that Race to Dubai final and enjoy the week.
