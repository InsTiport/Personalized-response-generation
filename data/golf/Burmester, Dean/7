 Q.  Fantastic way to finish.  Tell us about the eagle on 15.  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, it was good.  A bit into the wind today so it was playing really tough.  Hit a really big drive down there and left myself with a nice 8-iron draw and pitched three yards right of it, three yards short of it, spun a little left and rolled straight in the middle of the hole.   
 Q.  Two birdies in the last three holes have put you into a tie for the lead with your fellow countryman, Darren Fichardt.  Fantastic day for you?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, the South Africans are all geared up.  Most of us have had a bit of time off, so it's been nice, nice to get back and I think all of us love Wentworth.  So it's really good to be back here and hopefully Darren makes a birdie on the last.   
 Q.  What's the main thing that's gone right for you today?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, I've just been working on my swing.  I've been struggling with a shot I've been hitting left.  I've been hitting a hook now and again which has gotten me into trouble.   
I've been grinding in the last three weeks in my time off with my coach and we worked on a draw that I really like, and you know, I just warm up with it now every day, and I do it every day and it's making a difference.   
 Q.  First in the Rolex Series, of course, iconic place like Wentworth.  Is there a feeling this could really kick-start your season?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, it's been quiet.  It's not been the season I really wanted, barring one round in MÃ©xico, it's been really quiet.  This is a good place to kind of kick-start the year and I'm looking forward to the next three days.
