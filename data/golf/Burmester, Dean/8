Q. The opening four holes really helped set the tone for the way today's 18 have gone.
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, I've gotten off to a hot start pretty much every day.  I like those first four holes.  It was just nice to make a couple putts on those and keep it rolling throughout the day.
Q. A round of 65 has played you right up into contention.  That must be nice, seeing your name at the top of the leaderboard, when all the talk has been about The Race to Dubai?
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, it was good.  I played with Tommy today, as well.  A lot of fans out there shouting his name and he's got a lot of support.  I'm kind of holding thumbs for him.  He also made an unbelievable come back today with a run of birdies there.
It's good for both of us, and I'm sure I'll see him tomorrow on the tee.
Q. What's been the most pleasing part about the game this week?
DEAN BURMESTER: I made a couple putts.  That's kind of what's been missing the last three, four months.  It's been nice to find a putter I really, really like.  Big thanks to Henry from Scotty Cameron who fits me with an unbelievable putter.  I just feel really comfortable and I'm rolling it great.
Q. What's the strategy now, you go into the final day of this big tournament in contention.  Is there any change to your mind-set?
DEAN BURMESTER: No, I don't think there can be a change.  After a day like today, just looking at the scoring, I think it will be more of the same tomorrow.  The weather is always good here, so guys will be firing at every pin and that will be kind of the same and hopefully I wake up with the same swing tomorrow morning.
