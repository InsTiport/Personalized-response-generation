 Q.  I know it would have been nice to see that birdie putt drop there on 18 but how pleased are you with a round of 68?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Pretty pleased.  Look, I just had three 3-putts and that's it.  To be fair, it was just poor iron shots coming in.  I left myself three really hard first putts and that's just how the cookie crumbles; a day, what could have been, but 68 at the end of the day and I'm still in the tournament, so I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  Nice to get off to a birdie, birdie start, as well.  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, you can probably birdie any hole out here, barring maybe one or two that are a little bit tougher than the others, but when you start like that, you kind of just want to push on.  I did that today and it a nice, solid day and I really enjoyed my day with Patrick.   
 Q.  How did the wind change things?  It seemed to pick up towards the end of your round today.  One or two players were sort of going astray a little bit.  Did you have to make many adjustments?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Yeah, a little bit.  There were a couple tough tee shots out there.  A tee shot on 17 comes to mind.  Hit a good iron shot there straight into the wind off the left.  So not easy, but you know, like you say, just adjust and for a minute there, it looked like it could rain, I couldn't believe it.  It was quite cool to get in.   
 Q.  You shot 65 on Saturday last year and ended up finishing tied fourth.  What can you take from that, knowing at the moment you're just two shots off the lead?  
DEAN BURMESTER: Let's hope I make 65 tomorrow, that's all I can say.
