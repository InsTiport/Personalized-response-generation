   DANIEL VANCSIK: I played very well. My putter worked very well. I missed a few fairways but when I had a chance for birdie I made it and when I missed a green I chipped and putted very well.  
  
  Q. No bogeys today?  
 DANIEL VANCSIK: It is very nice , as when you miss the fairway you need a bit of luck. I chipped well and got up and won well, made the birdies when needed to. The greens are perfect, and if you play well on the tee you have so many chances for birdie. If you hit a good shot you have a lot of chances. The rough is the only defence on this course with the greens soft and the ball rolling so well.  
  
  Q. Did you feel the benefit of having some time off?  
 DANIEL VANCSIK: I feel good. I worked a bit on my putting and short game last week as I have played really well in the last tournament tee to green but my short game was not so good. Today I am really pleased with the results. I tried for focus as this is the start of four very good tournaments for me and I hope to then get into the British Open.
