  Q.  So how happy are you with the way you're playing generally now?  You must be very pleased.   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  Yeah, I'm really happy because the last week on Sunday, I played really well for all the week, and lost the tournament in one hole.  And then that night, I tried to say, okay, take it easy and play well this week.  Today this start is really good for me and I'm really happy with that.   
  
  Q.  You say "lost the tournament"; does it feel like it is one that got away, considering that you were leading so well?   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  Yeah, that's because Saturday, before tee No. 14, I was leading by five shots.  Then I hit the ball to the water and then missed a little bit after that.  I played well later but that one hole, lost everything, my work.   
 And this week, this is a new week as you say and I take my putter and short game and say just forget it and try to do it this week.   
  
  Q.  Sort of what you said last week, do you really feel that you do belong out here and that you're much more relaxed about things now since the victory at Madeira?   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  Yeah, I real much more relaxed.  I've played too much tournaments this year.  My experience is a little better.  So to just say go with it and relax and go hole-by-hole, it's really difficult for me.   
 The last few weeks I've played like this; it's all right.   
  
  Q.  It's great to carry it on from last week.  Sometimes you could be a little bit tired or annoyed at yourself if a tournament gets away, but to play a round like this ...   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  Yeah, I feel really tired from the last week.  But I speak with my psychologist and I relaxed this week, Monday and Tuesday, just practised a little bit.  I'm lucky because I don't have to play the Pro-Am yesterday and just relax and today my body is really good.
