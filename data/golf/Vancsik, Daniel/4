   DANIEL VANCSIK:  I played really well from tee to greens. I didn't play so well on the greens as sometimes they were very fast and others very slow depending on the grain. Depends where you put the ball. I had some many chances for birdie. I had seven chances for birdie and two for eagle. I made the putt on the ninth from four metres for eagle which was very nice. After that I got more confidence on the greens and it was a good day.   
 The course is really tough and I was perfect with my tee shots. I had so  many chances for birdie and made a few of them. Which was nice.   
  
  Q.  Last year was a great year for Argentine golf, so how do you feel coming into a new year?   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  I have been working hard since the end of the season. I have worked with my coach and psychology for this year and I feel very well. Every player in Argentina feels more confident after what happened last year.   
  
  Q.  Still a long way to go, but this is a nice start in a big tournament?   
 DANIEL VANCSIK:  This is a big tournament and I am delighted I am able to play. If I can have a good week I might have a chance as I am swinging it very well but there are another three days and a long way to go.
