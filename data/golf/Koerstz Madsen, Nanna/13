Q. Please describe your Olympic experience so far. 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's different from a normal tournament. It's like a little camp. We're staying at the village. It's very fun to see all the other Danish athletes who are famous in Denmark. You suddenly become friends with them. 
The golf tournament is really good. I haven't played the tournament yet, so I don't know how it's going to be. But the course is good. Yeah, it's in fantastic condition. You can't even see that the men played last week. It's really good. 

Q. What part of the game does it reward? What needs to be on fire this week? 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I would say, pretty much everything, because if you're not straight off the tee, then you're going to be in a lot of trouble. And if your approach shot isn't there, then you have these big run‑offs on greens, so they will be tough for you. 
Yeah, tee shots and approach shots, putting always. 

Q. How is your game? 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's okay. 

Q. Feeling confident? 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's okay.

Q. How would it rate on the scale of achievements if you were to win an Olympic medal here?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It would definitely rate as one of the biggest achievements so far. Probably the biggest one. 
I saw the men at the prize ceremony for the men and it was just amazing. You couldn't describe the feeling I think when they are standing there on the one through three. 

Q. What would you rate more highly, an Olympic medal or a major‑‑ Olympic Gold I suppose. 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: This week I think I would sacrifice a major title for an Olympic medal. 

Q. Gold Medal? 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, Gold Medal, of course. But I don't know, major is big, too. But this is just an incredible experience. 

Q. And how special is it to have your boyfriend caddying for you? 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's really good to have him here to share the experience with, yeah. 

Q. He's been caddying for you like part‑time this year?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, pretty much all year, apart from where I won. 

Q. But he wanted to be here. 
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, he wanted to be here.
