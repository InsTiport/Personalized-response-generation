 Q.  7-under par.  What was going well for you?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: My putting was really good today.  Dropped a lot of putts out there.  I have a right miss with my woods and I still had the right miss out there, but I didn't get into too much trouble.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Okay.  What's been the difference for you today?  Have you been working on anything?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Since last year?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.  I mean, I've been working a lot over the winter trying to be more relaxed about playing on the LPGA.   
Yeah, so I'm actually just trying to have more fun and do something else beside golf when we're here.   
 Q.  Did you do anything this week?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Actually, no, but right before we went here we went to Miami, so we went to see a basketball game with Miami Heat and someone from North Carolina.   
 Q.  Okay.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: On Sunday.  Yeah, it was fun.   
 Q.  Are you feeling more comfortable out here your second year on tour?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I mean, I'm still trying to not get too nervous and stuff, but, yeah, I'm feeling a lot more confident.   
 Q.  Did you see the bobcat?  We heard there was a bobcat behind your group.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I think I did.  I saw someone -- they were all over there, but we only saw the ass of it.   
 Q.  Oh.  Was there any highlight of your round today?  Any long putts?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, well, 1st hole I was in the woods on the right, but then I had a chance to play two and I hit it long and made fifteen-meter putt.   
And then on 17 I made ten-meter putt down the hill there.  Two good putts.
