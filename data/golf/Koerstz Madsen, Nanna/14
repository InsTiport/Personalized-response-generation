Q. So how would you assess that round?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I was happy about the first 16 holes, and not so happy about the last two holes, but okay.
Q. Let's start with the good stuff.  What was going right for the first 16 holes?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I made some good putts.  I actually didn't hit a lot of fairways today.  So that's one of the things I have to do different tomorrow.  So the putting was pretty good.
Q. And the last two?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I didn't hit the fairway and then I missed two greens, so I didn't get up and down.
Q. Obviously the Rookie of the Year race is up for grabs, so to speak, and you had to get off to a good start here this week.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, that's right, I'm kind of happy with my start.  I played some poor rounds the last couple of months, so I'm just happy to be under par.  I'm not really focusing that much on the rookie title because I'm a bit behind and I just want to do a good result in this tournament.  The rookie list, it's just a bonus.
