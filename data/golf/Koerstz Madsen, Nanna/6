 Q.  Tell us about your round overall.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I played pretty good.  I had more putts dropping today than yesterday and the day before.  I actually played pretty good the other two days as well, but the putts just didn't want to drop.   
 Q.  What do you think of the golf course?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I like it.  There's quite a lot of space from tee.  It's mostly a second shot course and greens, of course.  The greens are really tough.  Yeah, tough to read and -- yeah.  So yeah.   
 Q.  Tell us a little bit about your ties with the University of South Carolina -- why you ended up there, why you didn't stay longer.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I was only going to be there one year.  I was -- from the very beginning, I was only committed for one year.  But then I played really good in that year for the team when I started.  So I figured I'd rather turn professional.  So, yeah, after a while I was more certain that I wanted to turn professional.  So I did that instead.   
 Q.  Just one year there?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: No, three months.   
 Q.  Three months?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.  So not very long.   
 Q.  Did you play for the team?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, I played the fall season.  Yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Kalen Anderson.  Yeah, and hockey was as well at that time.   
 Q.  What brought you to South Carolina to play there?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Why I decided that?  To be honest, I didn't have that many offers, and I wanted to go to a state where it was sunny and warm all year round.  And it was a good school.  I visited, and I liked the girls and the coach and stuff.   
I liked it there, actually.  I just wanted to start professional.   
 Q.  Did you find the pin placement today a little bit more accessible, versus the first two days?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Accessible?   
 Q.  Gettable?  Were there more scoring opportunities for you?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, there were.  A little bit easier maybe.  Still some tough ones here and there, but not some crazy ones as some of the first days.   
 Q.  Can you explain this lemon wedges thing?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.  Well, it's just if I get nervous or too angry or something, it's just to take my mind off that stuff.  So, yeah, bite a lemon.   
 Q.  When did you start doing this?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: This season, so beginning of this season.   
 Q.  Has it been happening all day?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Not today, no.   
 Q.  That's pretty gross?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It is, yeah.  That's why I'm doing this.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Mental coach, yeah.   
 Q.  What's his name?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Jacob Henson.   
 Q.  What's it like being in the hunt in a Major going into Sunday?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's exciting.  I like being in this position.  Yeah, I'm just happy to be here, and I feel like my game is pretty solid, and I'm confident in my game.  So, yeah, I'm just excited for tomorrow, and I like going and playing tomorrow.   
 Q.  Is today about as well as you can play out there?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, I made two bogeys, so you can always play better.  But -- and I missed a couple of two-meter putts as well.  So if everything was going my way, I could probably have shot three shots better, but it was a good day.   
 Q.  Where do you play out of?  When did you turn professional?  Where do you play out of now?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: 2015, I turned professional, yeah.   
 Q.  Where do you live?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I still live in Denmark, yeah.  I have a deal with a club at Boca West in Florida.  So, yeah, I can come and go whenever I want there.   
 Q.  What did you learn on Sunday in L.A. that is going to be helpful to you?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I learned a lot of stuff that round.  First of all, just being in that position.  Every time you try, you learn to be there, and yeah.  I mean, yeah, I learned a lot.  Just stay calm and enjoy it a little bit more out there and be aware that you probably are not going to think it's funny all day long, because you're going to be nervous and stuff, and that's okay.  So just those kind of things.   
 Q.  At USC, you qualified immediately for the Ladies Tour in Europe, did you not?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I qualified.  Actually, I won the Q school in '14.
