Q. 9-under ties your lowest round ever.  Congrats.  What a great round.  What was working for you today?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Thanks.  Well, I just hit it a lot closer than the other days.  Like today I hit it to a lot of three meters; whereas yesterday it was five and six meters.
And then I made the three meters today and I just lipped out yesterday and the day before all the time.  The first day I hit a lot of shots in the water and the trees, so I had a lot of (indiscernible) there.
Q. Tell me about yesterday.  Just to make the cut you had to birdie your last hole of the day; now all of a sudden you're way up the leaderboard.  Tell me about yesterday and making the cut on the number.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, I been playing not very well this season, so yesterday I was just like, I really want to make the cut kind of, but that's not how you can think out there.  We're just really trying not to think about the cut and just try and play some good golf..
Yeah, so I had to birdie the last hole and I missed the green on 9.  I had a chip-in, and then I had like one and a half meter.  I was like really nervous on that putt because I knew I had to make it.  I didn't even know if that was enough, but I made it.
Yeah, it was good.
Q. Thinking about it, you went from just making the cut with the putt on the last hole and now all of a sudden you're way up the leaderboard.  What's the last four, I don't know, five hours been like for you?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's been fun.  Yeah, the weather has just been great.  Yeah, we just enjoyed it out there.  I'm really trying not to focus on the score at the moment because, yeah, just been doing that way too much.
Yeah, just trying to hit some good shots and stay in every shot; not think about the score.
