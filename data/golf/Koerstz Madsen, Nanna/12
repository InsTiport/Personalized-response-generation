 Q.  Congratulations.  A round of 4 under.  Great start for you.  You must be very pleased.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Thank you.  I'm very happy with the round today.  I didn't hit it very close today or anything.  I made some good putts and didn't make too many mistakes.  I'm just happy to finish.   
 Q.  There's lots of entertaining golf for you out on the course, and you had lots of birdies and bogeys from the 1st, which is your back nine, of course.  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, I had two bogeys.  Missed the green and 3-putted, so yeah that's two bogeys.  I made three birdies.   
 Q.  What do you make of this course?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: What do I make of this course?   
 Q.  How would you assess it?  How would you describe this course?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's a course where you can hit the driver pretty much everywhere.  There are some holes where you can.  Lots of room.  So if you can hit a good driver then you are good to go.   
Tricky greens.  Not too much slopes, but a lot of rain, I think.  A little tricky.   
 Q.  How was your season?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, I've been playing Symetra Tour this year.  My goal was to get the LPGA card and I got it through Symetra Tour.  So yeah, it's been good.  I won three times.   
 Q.  Goals for 2018?  
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I haven't set them yet.  But something with LPGA.
