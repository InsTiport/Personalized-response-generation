Q. Nice birdie, birdie finish there to close out.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Uh-huh.
Q. How was it the first day here in Naples?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: It's good. Great weather. Tree golf course, but I like it here. I like Florida.
Q. What is it about this golf course that kind of lends itself to shooting some lower numbers, even on the first day?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Lends itself?
Q. What is about this golf course?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, you have good opportunities on the par-5s. I think I took pretty good advantage of those. It's actually quite -- some of the par-4s played quite long today, into the wind a lot of them.
But, yeah, you do have some good chances out there.
Q. Some major changes to this tournament with the $1.5 million. Was there a certain strategy going into to this week, any changes, or did you or approach it like a regular tournament?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I approached it like regular tournament. I didn't do much practice last week. I was really tired after the Asian swing, so, yeah, I was just relaxing a little bit and doing a little bit of work.
Q. Do you touch a golf club last week?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I did touch a club last week, but I made, what, three practice schedule. Didn't do much putting. So I was actually quite surprised with my putting today.
Yeah, I did a little bit.
Q. Did you stay in the States or go back home?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Go back home. So it was really cold, so it wasn't really fun to practice.
Q. What's the change like that, you know, heading into the final week of the season? Kind of relief that it's almost over or are you looking out for the next season already?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Well, I really want to finish well in this tournament. It's a big purse. But I'm also really excited for the off-season and also excited for a new season.
I'm just excited for everything.
Q. What is there to change for the rest of this tournament?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: To change?
Q. Or improve upon.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I'm just going to go work on my driver. It worked quite well, but I'm not really comfortable over it. Just got to hit a few more and see if I can get a little bit more comfortable.
