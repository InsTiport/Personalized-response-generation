Q. String of birdies on the back being able to keep yourself if contention.  What's the feeling now that you're done with your round?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I'm glad to be done.  I mean, I got the putter going on the last couple holes, but it was a little bit shaky all day kind of.
Yeah, I'm just going to go in and work a little bit on the putting.  I feel pretty good a with my game.  I didn't make in many misses.  I'm feeling good.
Q. When you're in a grouping with someone like Minjee Lee who also was on fire, what do you tell yourself to really keep yourself going?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I think I'm just going to try and stick to what I've done the last two days and try not to get too emotional.  Yeah, if I do something good, staying a little bit calm, and the same if I do something bad.
So I'm just trying to focus on myself and focus on that.
Q. What kind of expectations did you have coming in and would you have imagined that you could have been in the last group on Sunday?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Before the tournament?
Q. Before the tournament.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: My expectation was not to be in the last grouping.  I mean, it's always fun to be in the last group.  I haven't been there that many times, and when I've been there I've got a little bit nervous and shaky.  I was actually expecting today I would be more shaky.
But you learn from it.  I mean, I don't know, I like playing in the last group, yeah.
Q. You feel like have to do anything differently tomorrow, or do you just need to force yourself to stay calm?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, just going to, yeah, do the same thing as the last two days, three days.  Really just focus on my own game.  If it's enough, that's good and I'm happy with whatever.  I mean, I'm already happy with how I've been emotionally this week.
Yeah, just going to enjoy tomorrow I think.
Q. What is your technique to keep your emotions in check?  What's your process?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: To be honest, it's just like, how do you say the word, just ice cold, like -- I mean, like -- we say taking an ice cold beer.  I don't know how you say it.  (Laughter.)
But like it's don't do anything.  You can always say to yourself, Don't react.  It's just like, I don't know, I'm not doing anything specific.  I have this thing where if I get too nervous or mad I can take a lemon and bite on the lemon.
Q. You have a bag of lemons on the course?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I do, yes.
Q. That's fascinating.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.  It's kind of working with my mental coach, but it's like taking your senses away from whatever you're on and thinking about this lemon which is really disgusting and not very nice.
Taking away your mind of what you're...
Q. How long you been doing that?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: This year.
Q. Did you suck on a lemon today?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: One time.
Q. When was that?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: After my 3-putt on 11.
Q. I love this.  So the ice cold beer --
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: No, it's not beer, it's like -- how do you say that?  It's just like setting a limit and like you cannot do this.
Q. Telling yourself you can't or just...
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Like I don't even know.  Taking an ice cold Turkish is what we say actually.
Q. Turkish?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.
Q. Ice cold Turkish.  (Laughter.)
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Forget about that.  I can't explain it.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It's an expression to reset.
Q. Who is your mental coach?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: A guy from Denmark called Jacob, Jacob Henson.
Q. How did you meet him?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: He's a part of -- we have this thing called Team Denmark, so he works with Team Denmark.  Yeah, so now he's working for the golf union as well.
Q. Like the national team?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.
Q. Got it.  Fascinating.  Thank you.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Sorry I couldn't explain.
Q. We'll look for your lemons tomorrow.
