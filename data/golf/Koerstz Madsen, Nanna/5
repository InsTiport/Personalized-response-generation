Q. What a way to finish with a birdie on 18.  Just take us through your round and overall, how are you feeling after a tough second day?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I'm feeling good being done with this second day.  The green was really hard out there.  It was tough.  But I played pretty solid.  Didn't make too many mistakes, and my putter wasn't really my friend today but it wasn't too terrible.  So I just played quite solid all day.
Q. For you, how does this Bay Course fit your game?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I think it fits my game okay.  You can hit driver pretty much everywhere, and I like when the wind is up a little bit, so that makes it a little bit harder.  Yes, I like it.
Q. Speaking of the wind, it definitely made things difficult here this afternoon.  How do you think you played?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I played some really good shots into the wind.  I actually had birdie chances on all the hard par 4s into the wind.  So I was really happy with some of the shots going into the wind.
Yeah, I was just overall really happy with my long game, yeah.
Q. And for you, you're known for the lemons on the course.  Did you have to bite into any lemons today?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: No, not today.
Q. Any yesterday?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: No.
Q. So what is there for you to focus on going into the final round?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Just try and stay calm and do the same thing as I've been doing the last two days.  Try and make some more putts and I think I'll be fine.
