Q.  Mr. Stockton, how do you feel the golf course is compared to the other golf courses for previous championship tournaments?
DAVE STOCKTON:  This is probably would be one of my favorites.  Certainly for the PGA Championship.  For the seniors.  This is going to be a great test of golf.

Q.  How do you feel the weather will play a factor in this?
DAVE STOCKTON:  Well, seeing that I'm from California, and didn't check the weather forecast, I've already made a call to my wife to send me stuff that would be appropriate for this wonderful Pennsylvania wet sun or whatever they call this.  I'm not sure.

The golf course is in good shape.  As long as it doesn't get a ton of rain we're going to be in good shape.
