  Q. Talk about your round today and some positives and negatives.   
 DAVE STOCKTON: Well, I made a few birdies. It was a little more fun yesterday with no birdies and that bogey and a double, that was for 73. I had just, I was excited. I made a birdie, I chipped in on the second hole from in front of the green and made another birdie and a couple of bogeys and then bogeyed 9 to turn at 1-over.   
 I kind of hung pretty good on the back side. I bogeyed 10. And I made a mess of the first par-5 on 15. I'm lucky to make six there.   
 And I almost made six on the 16th.   
 And then I knocked it stiff, about less than two feet on 17 for birdie. So I played the last few holes 1-under par to get to 72. So I was pleased with the outcome.  
  
  Q. Your thoughts about memories of 13 years ago and coming back here and going into tomorrow?  
 DAVE STOCKTON: Yeah, it's fun. I enjoy it. It's a tough golf course. I like it because every single hole you play, it kind of tells you, okay, you got to try to fade it, and I'm having trouble with all the fade holes, number 5 and number 7. Those are the holes that I seem to be having the difficulty with for some reason or other.   
 But I enjoy it and the conditions of the golf course compared to '91 I think is much improved. Greens are slicker and the whole thing is perfect. So it's just fun to be here and I'm enjoying it.
