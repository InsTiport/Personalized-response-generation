K.T. KIM: I lost the last two days, a bit of a concern, but made plenty of birdies today, made seven.  You see the board and everyone is down, but still glad that I played well.
Q. This clearly is a team event but how much satisfaction do you get personally out of a nice, handsome win?
K.T. KIM: We had high expectations but we prepare for next in two years and see what happens then.
Q. What is your personal opinion on why it's Europe that has won so commandingly?
K.T. KIM: Well, to have a Ryder Cup and team matches -- overall, can't deny they have a better team overall by the World Ranking, and obviously stronger field.  So I think that's where they have an advantage in this week's event.
