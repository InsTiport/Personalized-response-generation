 Q.  What are thoughts on the hole-in-one?  
K.T. KIM: I'm so happy, but the hole-in-one, it's my third time on Tour.  I'm going to decide later if I'll bring the car to Korea or not.   
 Q.  Have you seen the car?  Is it a good one?  How does it compare to what you drive now?  
K.T. KIM: I drove the car in the other WGC tournament, so I love the car.   
 Q.  Please talk us through the hole-in-one itself.  What did you do?  Did you see it all the way?  
K.T. KIM: I hit 3-iron and then on 16, I just made birdie, so I've got a good feeling.  And then I just did that, I was so happy about it.
