   K.T. KIM: I tried to maintain a good condition from yesterday. It wasn't really a good start today but I tried to just think of myself, just play myself. 
 But I had a tough time on the 16th hole, but still, I had a good result and I'm happy and I'm satisfied with today. 

 Q. How about your Presidents Cup experience overall? 
 K.T. KIM: I enjoyed it here, and this is the most memorable event that I have ever played. The team is really, they are like family here. 
 I want my team to win this year.
