Q.   I followed you for about 10 holes out there. 
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Hopefully on the back nine. 

Q.   I saw you were struggling there on the front.   What is the difference between you and the guys on the TOUR?   What's that difference?
FRANK ESPOSITO:   I think they're just used to doing it, used to playing all the time.   I struggled early, but playing with Tom was great.   He got up there and hit good shots and didn't worry about where they were going and played well.

Q.   How hard is it coming into a competition like this without all the bullets that these guys have?
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Well, it shows up over time.   I played good the first day and then you think about it, but it's difficult, but that's no excuse. 

Q.   I talked to Will Thursday and he said that you hadn't gotten your clubs out of the bag since your last competition?   He said like a month ago. 
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Yeah, pretty much.   Pretty much.   I played in jersey, but, no, that was when I was in, I think it was in Mississippi when I played there and I left them in the travel cover for about a month. 
And I just went out and played there.   So it's tough, plus it's been a little cool up north.   We played a couple of tournaments, but that was it.
