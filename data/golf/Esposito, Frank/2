Q.   Just walk me through your round today and how everything went, especially the last couple holes. 
FRANK ESPOSITO:   I played very well today, I really did.   I hit the ball good, I really made only one bad swing on 17, cost me a double bogey, and that was pretty much it. 

Q.   Last couple a little tough, just walk me through those. 
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Yeah, on 17 I just pulled a 4â€‘iron left and then I had no shot.   And I hit it over the back of the green and made double. 
18, I hit it in the fairway bunker and I buried in the green side bunker.   Was lucky to make a five.
