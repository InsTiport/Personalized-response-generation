Q.   What are your overall thoughts on its round today?   It seemed like it was up‑and‑down but you were able to finish with a birdie. 
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Yeah, I started off, I was a little nervous and I started off really nice. 
I made a nice birdie on 11, and then just played nicely. 
Had a couple birdie chances and then birdied 13. 
Then was hitting nice shots, I hit good shots. 
On 18, I hit a nice drive and I had a perfect yardage and I cold shanked one. 
And then the front nine was all ‑‑ as soon as you do that, your mind starts wandering and you get a little apprehensive.   But, no, overall I hit it okay. 
I made a couple of stupid bogeys on the front with short irons in my hand, which you can't do. 

Q.   You mentioned the nerves and now you're only a few shots off the lead, what is your mentality heading into the weekend?
FRANK ESPOSITO:   The same thing.   I'm playing the course and I'm playing it nice.   I like the golf course.   Driving it relatively well.   I'm just going to keep doing the same thing I'm doing.

Q.   What are your thoughts overall now with yesterday and today on the course?
FRANK ESPOSITO:   I thought the pins were a little tougher today.   No, the golf course is very fair, very playable.   You got to hit it in the right spot on the greens, but besides that, it's fine.

Q.   I imagine you have a lot of people now, only a few shots off the lead in contention cheering for you and keeping track of what's happening for you on the weekend?
FRANK ESPOSITO:   Yeah, it will be fun.
