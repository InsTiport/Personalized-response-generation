  Q. How would you assess the match today?
 RYAN PALMER:   Good.  (Laughing)   No, the match was just solid.  I had never really felt any kind of stress or anxiety out there.  It was a solid day, I drove the ball about as good as I wanted to for sure.  Good thing was I was able it make some long putts.  12 was a nice putt, I made a 2-putt to win the hole.  But 13 was kind of a crucial moment, I thought.  James talked me into laying up and then I got to good wedge and hit a great wedge shot.  So to go 3-up there was, made the last five holes a little easier, I think.  But overall just solid day.  Ball striking, drove the ball beautifully, and I was able to, I putted pretty well today I thought too.
 Q. Logically, this doesn't make sense, but do putts feel more important in match play than they do in stroke play?
 RYAN PALMER:   It's a good question.  It feels the same.  To appoint to me just because it gives me a confidence going throughout the next rest of the round.  Because you make a putt here and there and then you get over another one it gives you that much more to make, but match play it gives you more momentum I guess you could say, where stroke play it's, you 2-putt for par, no big deal, go on, we're still playing well.  But in match play, the more you make, the more he's probably going to get a little more stressed and start grinding and pressing a little more.  So you make a few putts in match play, it kind of relax he's yourself I guess and gives them a little bit more pressure.
 Q. I don't know if you played in this before 2015 and they changed the format.
 RYAN PALMER:   No first time since they changed it.
 Q. Do you prefer pool play versus the straight knockout stages?
 RYAN PALMER:   I don't know.  I guess you -- it's hard to say.  I think I won a match and then lost the second match.  Back in the knockouts format.  But this is nice.  It gives you obviously three rounds to play.  It's going to be fun to, late afternoon tomorrow, and then seeing what Rahm does and Lowry, so I just got to take care of my game and then we'll see where we stand.
