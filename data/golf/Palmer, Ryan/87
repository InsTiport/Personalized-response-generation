  RYAN PALMER:   Getting the ball in front of me.   Today I played the par-5s good and hit some really good shots into the wind today.   When you get the winds like this, lot of cross winds, if you're not hitting it solid, that ball is going to be everywhere.   Luckily I found my rhythm out there and I hit it good coming in.

Q.   You're not that far from College Station where you went to Texas A&M.   Do you have a lot of support in here?
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it's 129 miles from here, I believe.   Hopefully, if the weather holds up, people will be out here.   It's fun being close to College Station and the fan base.

Q.   Talk to me a little bit about your pre-shot putting routine.   Frequently I see you take practice strokes, left hand, then reposition your hands on the putter and putt conventionally.
RYAN PALMER:   I started last year at Humana.   I struggled with putting one day.   I started putting cross-handed and my stroke was perfect.   I -- it squared my shoulders up a little more.   Gets me in a better position, I think, at address so I started doing it last year and I'm back and forth.   I use it once in awhile.   Then I wouldn't use it.   It seems to help a lot.   So, you know, it's one of those quirky little things us Tour players have.
