 Q.   A long day but you're obviously pretty happy with the results today?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was a great day.   I felt great coming into the week, played great, my tempo was there with my irons and my driver.   Really focused on driving the ball well this week, and the putter was rolling today.   
I'm pretty good with my irons and confident with that, and I'm putting well.   When I combine the two together and do both well, good scores come from it.   So, yeah, it was a great, long day.  
   
 Q.   How did you manage the break?   How many holes did you get in before you had to come in?  
RYAN PALMER:   Three, then the break, and I guess played five more I guess.   Just I went in each time and ate every time I was in there and laid around.   So kind of went through my routine each time and kept me calm out there.   Yeah, better late than never.   
   
 Q.   Can you comment on the changes to Liberty National, and how were conditions out there?  
RYAN PALMER:   It's softer and the fairways, they weren't rolling as much.   The greens, they were rolling at pretty good speed but overall, just softer and some of the fringe were a little spongier from all the rain, but overall, great condition.
