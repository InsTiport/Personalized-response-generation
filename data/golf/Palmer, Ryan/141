Q.  What does this do for your confidence?
RYAN PALMER:  A lot of confidence going into Friday because you're not forcing things.  When you get a good Thursday round in, you get some more and you're not worried about    inaudible    take tomorrow and the next day and you're at the weekend.  It's a good start.
Q.  Are you happy with the group, playing with Tiger, you guys all seemed to maybe even challenge each other out there?
RYAN PALMER:  When you play with Tiger it's a challenge because you're playing with the best player in the world.  He's a great player and fun to get along with.

You play in front of a lot of people, play in front of those big crowds, it's the same on the weekend, it makes it a lot more enjoyable in front of Tiger.
Q.  What needs to change for tomorrow to get that game a little better?
RYAN PALMER:  Nothing, I think I need to hit the driver a little better.  If I can get the ball in the fairway a lot more, if I can give myself a lot more birdie opportunities    I just didn't drive the ball very well and hopefully tomorrow play better.
Q.  Any extra pressure for you
RYAN PALMER:  It's just something you get used to.  People are walking around and    on the weekend, you're going to be out in front of a big crowd.
