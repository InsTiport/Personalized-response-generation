Q. Tell me what was it like playing in the afternoon.  The wind seemed to be a factor in the morning, but less wind in the morning was there more in the afternoon?
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, we definitely got the higher of the winds, I think, of the two groups, for sure.  This morning the winds weren't blowing very much and the greens were definitely soft.
We still got some soft greens, but they were definitely baking the greens out a little more and they're getting a lot quicker.
But I was able to withstand some of the winds we had, but overall it was a great day for me, putted great today, I think.  Just stayed patient all day.
Q. Was the putter what you leaned on for the whole day today?
RYAN PALMER: I made a long putt, obviously, on 16 and some good putts on 17 and made some great par putts today, I think.  Those were the key moments in my round to keep the round golf course.  5-, 6-footers that I need to make.
So, if we keep the putter hot and making our 6-footers all week, we'll, we'll have a good week, hopefully.
Q. What's the mindset going into tomorrow?
RYAN PALMER: Cool air the rest of the night.  Obviously some rest.  But I got the kids here, so that's, obviously, hard to do sometimes.
But tomorrow it's just a matter of trying to play my game, not worry about Jason or anybody else and not worrying about the lead.  Randy Smith told me, don't worry about the leaderboard because it's going to be different all week.
The greens are going to bake out and get tougher and tough.  I think if I just keep playing the game I'm playing and keep my mental game as sharp as it's been lately, we're going to be okay.
