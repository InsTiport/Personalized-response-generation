Q. Ryan, overall thoughts for week.
RYAN PALMER: Good, really good.  I won't say relief but, you know, it's been solid all year, I guess.  Can't get the rounds in there kind of.  Finally finished off a round.  Like a sure Top-10 which is the first one of the year.  It's a great feeling.
Q. We spoke on Friday and you were kind of talking that it was training in this direction, about finding the putter.  Is that still the final piece of the puzzle, maybe knocking in putts?
RYAN PALMER: I think so.  I had a lot of chances today.  I knew there were good putts to win.  Two big putts on last two holes were huge.  Overall, I mean it was -- my ball-striking was there all day under pressure, stay calm and pressure.  I guess technically I'm not really out of it yet.  See what happens.  I'm excited about finishing off and getting my first Top-10.
Q. Certainly not out of it.  Congratulations on a great week.
RYAN PALMER: Thank you.  I appreciate it.
Q. Ryan, thanks for taking the time.  Birdie, birdie to put an exclamation point on a wonderful week.  Tell us about your feelings.
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it's exciting.  Great feeling -- my first Top 10, maybe Top-5 but to finish off two good solid rounds on the weekend, really good finish today.
Got my ball-striking back to where I want it.  Made some putts today.  I kept my mental preparation, mental focus was there.  Spent a lot of time talking to Neal Smith and put my mind in the right place.  The work we did the first three days this week paid off this week.
Q. You mentioned that work.  Does this Top-10 presumably feel like something you've really been building towards?
RYAN PALMER: I think so.  I just needed the extra work.  I finally put the work in it with Randy being here.  My mind was right and the work Randy and I did, you know, this is a good jump start and some good courses coming up.
Q. Thanks Ryan for the time.  Best of luck.
RYAN PALMER: Thank you.
