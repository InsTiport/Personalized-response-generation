  Q. Ryan, a solid 7-under par 64 in the second round. You really came out on fire.   
 RYAN PALMER: I did. You know, I felt good. Birdied you know, 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3 yesterday -- Thursday. What day is it today?   
  
  Q. We're all doing that?  
 RYAN PALMER: I just came out and putted good. Ben putting good the last week and a half. Had a couple close ones, 2-putted No. 2. Tell you what, it's one of the best putting days I've had in years.  
  
  Q. The best shot I've seen all week was the shot that you used to get up-and-down, the fourth shot at the 17th. After hitting a really good bunker shot, you caught a bad break. Take me through your mind while all that's going on.   
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, I hit a bad 3-wood and had that kind of 30-, 40-yard bunker shot. I hit a great bunker shot, just kind of hit it a little too far and landed short of the hole. The spin it had on it took it down the hill, and then kind of up on the upslope. So I actually got a little downhill lie.   
 James just said, Take your medicine and put it on the green and let's go. A lot of golf left. Happened to just nip it perfect. One of those shots you don't expect to hit.   
  
  Q. Just for the listeners who didn't see the shot, how many out of ten do you get up-and-down from that spot by hitting it that close?  
 RYAN PALMER: Top 5 up-and-downs of all time for me.   
  
  Q. Thanks Ryan. Great round, good playing.
