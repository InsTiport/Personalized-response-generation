  Q. Let's start out with that front side. Seven birdies, a 28. Your thoughts as you were just racing through the first nine?  
 RYAN PALMER: Just I was hitting it close and I made a couple good putts. It was one of those days that just kind of dominoed from the start. Making -- I missed two of the three fairways, made two birdies by hitting it. Good wedges out of the rough. The golf course is just soft, easy to do, especially from the rough, even the fairway, just throw out the pin and it's going to stop.   
 I hit it close and made a couple of putts. But I guess you could say the double kind of deadened the whole thoughts there, ready for something special. But a little disappointed with the way I finished on 18, but a great start to a fun week.  
  
  Q. Could you talk about the double on No. 10 what happened there?  
 RYAN PALMER: Hit a bad bunker shot, hit a pretty simple -- hit it too hard, thought it might stop a little quicker than it did. Bad chip over that. Kind of cleared the head after that and hit some good shots coming in, missed some short putts.   
 But I shot 5-under Thursday at the Barclays, one of the best starts of the year, excited about that and looking forward to the weekend.
