  Q. Assess your match against Sebastian today.
 RYAN PALMER:   It was a grind.  I said earlier, my bad golf beat his bad golf today.  It was tricky.  The swirling winds, and we both didn't give ourselves many chances today.  We just grinded it out.  But I'll tell you what, my putter came through in a lot of ways today.  Made a lot of big putts to halve holes or to win holes, and par putts.
 It was nice to finish the day with a birdie to close it out after he missed, but it was a grind.  A lot of good stuff coming down the stretch, which is nice to see under that pressure.  Fun day ahead.
 Q. I know you probably didn't want to go as deep into that match as you did, but does it help to have a grinding-out match knowing what you have tomorrow with Jon, a winner-take-all?
 RYAN PALMER:   It did because I hit some great shots coming down, starting on 14, the tee shot I hit, the wedge I hit, and then a great shot and a wedge on 15, a solid tee ball, and then I was able to win 16 with ease and then hit a great wedge on 17.  A lot of great tee balls, wedges, and so I can carry that into tomorrow for sure.
 Q. You guys are good friends, obviously played at Zurich together.  What does he bring as a match play opponent to you?
 RYAN PALMER:   He's just good.  I mean, it's going to be a hard one to win.  I'm going to have to play some of my best golf I've played in a long time.  He's a grinder.  He's never out of a hole because of how good his short game is.  Like I said, it's going to be one of those days like I played on Wednesday.  I'm going to have to play that kind of game to beat him, I think, but it's going to be fun.  We are close friends, Adam, his caddie, James and Rahm.  We'll have a good tomorrow time, but we're also going to try to beat each other's brains in.
 Q. Is it tough to play somebody you're close with in a match, especially a winner-take-all match like that?
 RYAN PALMER:   I don't know, I've never done it.  I don't have a lot of -- I'm pretty friendly with a lot of the guys out here so I kind of take that attitude towards each match.  It'll be hard.  It'll be fun.  I'm sure we'll have some chatter early in the match and then I'm sure we won't talk as much, but it's kind of fun to both be at 2-0, and like you said, winner take all tomorrow.
