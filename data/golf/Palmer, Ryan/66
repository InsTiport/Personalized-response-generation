 Q.   Ryan Palmer, 10-under.   Overall, a solid week.  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah.   At this point not as frustrated is a good word.   Didn't make much, didn't feel like.   Overall, very pleased.   Last month hasn't been that great.   Sort of what I've been doing lately.   Nice to try to get back into it, get back in the thick of things and chance to win.   But, overall, yeah, happy but still frustrated.  
   
 Q.   Just the ebbs and flows of the game, kind of just something that I assume you have to kind of get used to even though it's frustrating.  
RYAN PALMER:   You do.   You get down on yourself, I do.   You just got to kind of look at good things that happen.   Just keep playing along and you can always finish higher each hole you make a birdie on.   
Take a lot of positives this week for sure and I can't believe we finished on Sunday which is nice.   We'll take a lot of positives and work on some things, nothing major.   Probably more in my head than anything.  
   
 Q.   The support that you have in the last two weeks, that's been good.   Talk about the 3rd hole, they were blaring music for you.   It felt good to have that.  
RYAN PALMER:   It is.   It's awesome.   You know, that's probably where I put the pressure on myself, playing all last week and this week a lot of friends and probably beat myself up too much.   It's part of playing at home.   Yeah, it's fun playing in front of guys I grew up with and playing songs.   Makes it fun for sure and it puts a smile on my face even though I bogeyed it both days.  
   
 Q.   Enjoy tonight and especially enjoy some time off.
