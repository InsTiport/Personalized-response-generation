Q.   Well, you found something these last three days.
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, I played great today, really good.   Misfortune, I had a bogey on 15 and bogey on 17, but again, I gave myself a chance.   That's all I can ask for.   You know, come up one short at this time, but, you know, another good week.   Hopefully another Top-5 two weeks in a row.   Things are good.
I putted great.   I hit it good, too.   You do that together, you're going to shoot some good rounds.   The ball striking has been really well the past few weeks.   I'm putting good.   It's fun.

Q.   What's the one shot that you would like back?
RYAN PALMER:   Probably the tee shot on 15 I would have to say.   Actually the -- the tee shot on 15, give myself a better wedge into the green.   The second shot on 18 I had a perfect wedge.   Just came out a little bit.   You know, shoot 74 first round and then have a chance to win, that's pretty good.

Q.   15th tee shot got away from you?
RYAN PALMER:   Pulled it a little bit.   Stuck it on the left side.   Oh, well.

Q.   Congratulations.
RYAN PALMER:   Thanks.
