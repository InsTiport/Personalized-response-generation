Q. Here with Ryan Palmer.  A home event for you but it was pretty exciting earlier in the week, you got an ace out here in the Warrior Open.  Same hole that President George W. Bush got his.
What was that like?
RYAN PALMER: It was pretty wool.  We were actually in the locker room before the round talking about -- he was signing flags for us and had a framed golf ball and everything.  An hour later I end up making it.  They radioed him and here he comes screaming down in the golf cart.
He joked about being in the Hole-In-One Club on No. 12.  So, President Bush is an unbelievable man.  I'm proud to know him.
Q. Like I said, this is a home event for you coming off of a win at the Zurich Classic.  What was your feeling coming into the week prior to all of that excitement?
RYAN PALMER: It was a fun, kind of taking it all in, enjoying it again after 9 years.  The key to today was just come out and get something going in the first six holes and try to not get complacent with my game.
I played solid.  Nothing really spectacular, to be honest with you.  Kind of pretty much feel like even par the way the scores are around this golf course.  It's going to take a low number this week to win.  It's golf.
Q. Thank for your time and good luck the rest of the week.
RYAN PALMER: Thank you.
