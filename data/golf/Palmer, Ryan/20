 Q.  Ryan, I know you would've loved to make that eagle putt on the last, but a good round. Good contention going into Sunday. Assess your round today.  
RYAN PALMER: Solid. Didn't make much today. Putted pretty well yesterday and today didn't make very much.   
Good putt on 16; crappy one on 17; a blind one on 18. So actually a little disappointed and frustrated.   
I'm five or six shots back again going into Sunday. With the winds, who knows what tomorrow will bring. Give it a go.   
 Q.  What's the one key you have to focus on tomorrow to make a good run?  
RYAN PALMER: Just the same thing I've been doing. It's a patient day when the winds are blowing. I expect them to blow a bit tomorrow. I don't think the rain is going to come in, so mainly just be patient.   
Just take what the course gives me. Make birdies when I can. You know, hopefully I can shoot the lowest round and see what happens.
