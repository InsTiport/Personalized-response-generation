  Q. 16 looked like you flushed it. Thought it was going to be close, didn't you?   
 RYAN PALMER: No. I didn't hit it very good. It wasn't good.   
  
  Q. Almost a little disappointed?   
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, but pleased. I stayed within myself. I was patient. And I actually made a few putts out there on 15 and 17. It's great to make a birdie on the last hole. And I told James, I didn't want to make myself shoot even, I didn't want to shoot over par the way I hit it.   
 It was a good day. The wind was hard though.   
  
  Q. What did you hit coming into 18?  
 RYAN PALMER: A 9-iron.  
  
  Q. Was it in the sand?  
 RYAN PALMER: No, it was in the fairway. I could have hit wedge, but I played that slope behind the green, knowing that it would come back.   
  
  Q. You kind of glanced at the Tiger mania. What was your thought?  
 RYAN PALMER: You could tell there was roars and I'm glad they're out. He's playing good and that's good for golf and good for fans out here.   
  
  Q. You drove it really well.   
 RYAN PALMER: I did, I drove it perfect. I had one bad drive that actually I got lucky on 2. But other than that I drove it awesome, man. And I just kept telling myself, tempo. And James said on each shot, good tempo. I told myself, great shot, just walking into it, you know, great tempo. So it was great.   
 I had a little miscue on 16 that hurt me. I hit it solid, but with the rain it just kept it out. I hung it out. It wasn't a very good shot.   
  
  Q. It looks like 5-under is going to be the score today. And you're even par. You have to like that.   
 RYAN PALMER: Oh, yeah. I didn't hurt myself. I could have very easily shot myself out of possibly a chance to win or if not being in contention.   
 So I have a lot to build on. Glad I made that putt on the last hole and I'll come out in the morning and get the putter rolling and be ready for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What's your night look like?  
 RYAN PALMER: Well, I'll be out of here about 6:15 and get me a cold beer.   
  
  Q. Were you excited over the whole deal?  
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, very excited. But I was really calm. James made a comment to my dad saying how relaxed I looked and I felt relaxed out there.   
 And the shot I hit on 1 tee, I knew I thought it was a big shot. I was glad to hit it like I did.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, I let him go.
