 Q.   Nice round out there.   Will you run us through it?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was.   It's always nice to play Thursday and get off to a good start.   You can't win on Thursday but you can sure lose it.   I birdied the first and got off to a good start and then plodded my way around the back nine, which was my front nine, and made a few birdies coming in.   I drove it great, and I made a few more putts today than I have been the past few weeks.   Great day.   
   
 Q.   Were the greens a little slow because of the rain that we've had?  
RYAN PALMER:   No, they're actually shockingly pretty quick, I thought, especially on Tuesday.   But yeah, they're rolling perfect.   I lot better than they were last year for sure.   The golf course is in probably the best shape I've seen it in years.   They're rolling about as true as you can get, and it's out there for the taking.   
   
 Q.   Were you aware of what Phil was doing on the front nine and was it in your mind to keep up?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, I was aware.   Obviously there are scoreboards everywhere and you see it, but all you can do is shoot a low round today, but you can't worry about a guy leading the golf tournament and going low like that on the first day.   It's fitting it's Phil.   It will be fun to see how it all pans out.  
   
 Q.   Weren't you the early leader last year?  
RYAN PALMER:   I was.   
   
 Q.   So this is kind of familiar territory?  
RYAN PALMER:   Didn't have the best three days after, so hopefully we can make up for what we did last year on the last two rounds.   I think my game is in better shape than it was, so I'm looking forward to playing well.  
   
 Q.   Any highlights to the round, anything that sort of kick‑started‑‑  
RYAN PALMER:   Not really, I just hit a lot of good shots, made some 15‑footers throughout the day.   I hit a good 3‑iron on 15.   That could probably be the‑‑ if I had one shot of the day, it would be the 3‑iron.   I hit it to about 15 feet for eagle.   Other than that, pretty solid and pretty steady.
