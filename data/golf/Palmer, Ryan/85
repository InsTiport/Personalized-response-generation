Q.   Four rounds in the 60s, first time ever at Colonial.   That has to be a big positive?
RYAN PALMER:   It's good, it definitely is.   It's positive, obviously.   I don't know what was going on, to be honest with you.   I had it there.   It was there.   I think I let it‑‑ 11 cost me on that.   I look back on that hole.   I could have kept a pretty good momentum going. 
But, you know, I played good.   I finished top‑10 this week, with no putter the first few days.   I think we had a pretty good one.

Q.   What happened on 11?   I know you had 22 feet out of the bunker?
RYAN PALMER:   I had a perfect gap wedge from the first cut.   It was a little downwind, and I tried but the wind didn't bring it.   The first cut, it won't draw at all, so I think it hung too far, and just caught the top edge keeping it in the bunker.
Unfortunate, but I was pretty proud to come back with a birdie the next hole and give myself a chance.   All I can ask for are chances and I gave myself that.

Q.   You look back ever and say how many I gave away?
RYAN PALMER:   Oh, yeah.   I don't know if I gave away any today, except 11, obviously.   The first few days I look back on that, sure.   Again, I came in strong, feeling good about it, and I performed today. 

Q.   You've had a great year, especially in the top‑10 finishes?
RYAN PALMER:   It's been great.   It's been awesome.   I think this tournament has so much meaning to me.   And it means so much to me to try to win.   I can't explain what it would feel like if I did do that.   That's where the disappointment, if any, comes in.   Not disappointment, just upset, I guess.   I had a chance.
