 Q.   Pretty sporty up‑and‑down there on 18.   Green‑side bunker.   You knew that putt was in as soon as it left the blade, didn't you?  
RYAN PALMER:   I did, yeah.   Today was a good day putting, a little hiccup there on 13 and 14.   For some reason some of those tee shots don't set up well for me, but great putt on 17 and a huge up‑and‑down, confidence going into tomorrow, from 18.   I hit it good today.   I felt like especially there on the front nine, I could have had a few more there, but overall it was a really good day.  
   
 Q.   I've always thought the key to winning is putting yourself in position time after time, give something good the opportunity to happen on the weekend.   This is, what, the third week in a row that you'll have that opportunity.   
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it's been fun.   This is my second day with Sergio, and I've been playing well, and he kind of gave me a pretty good compliment on 8, told me he was glad I wasn't on the Ryder Cup team.   I thought that was pretty good.   
But no, it's been fun being in contention during these Playoffs, grinding out four weeks in a row, and I'm out there in position to have a good weekend.   
   
 Q.   A 3‑under today, 4‑under overall.   You hit more fairways, you hit more greens, and still minimal amount of putts, 26 both rounds.   You have to be happy with where you're at.   
RYAN PALMER:   Oh, yeah, very happy.   A little hiccup there in the middle of the back nine, but the way I'm hitting the ball, if I can get the ball in these fairways, which is tough, I have a good chance the way I'm swinging it.   
I'm excited where my game is at.   I'm not worn out yet, not tired yet, but I'm having a lot of fun.   Getting here was a big goal, and now that I'm here, I want to take advantage of it.   Who knows; if I was to pull this out, you never know what I can continue to do.   We'll give it our best and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   You've heard a lot of players talk about how tired they are.   Patrick Reed said, I've played seven in a row, I've never done that before.   Billy Horschel said, I've been playing a lot, but it's a mindset; I want to be here.   If you can't get up for the Playoffs, when can you get up?   Is it a mindset for you to not feel fatigued, for you to not be mentally worn out?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, of course.   This is where I want to be, and I'm going to have some bad rounds, but you can let the fatigue get in your mind and you feel like you're tired, you're not going to play good golf.   It's a matter of resting when you need to.   You take a few days off between weeks, and mentally just be into it.   It's easy when you're playing well not to be tired, and I think that's what's carried me throughout these Playoffs, same with Billy Horschel.   We'll grind it out two more days and then pass out Sunday night.   
   
 Q.   Unfortunately you were not one of Captain Tom Watson's picks.   I think your name was flying around there during it, and Sergio Garcia had quite the moment with you today to remind you of‑‑ did he not?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was quite a compliment.   I hit it close on 8‑‑ we played last week together and I played well, and he kind of joked with me, told me he was glad I wasn't on the Ryder Cup team, which was a pretty good compliment I thought from Sergio.   But yeah, Tom Watson picked his best team, and they're going to go over and play great.   I hope they go over there and tear them up.   I wish them the best, and we'll give it a shot next time.
