Q.   Ryan, roller coaster, 2‑under par 68 today, comments? 
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, made some bogeys, a few missed shots out there, but I wish I had the putt back on 15, easy putt for birdie. 
Made a great birdie on 16, good two pars on the last two so four or five shots going into tomorrow if he holds up where he is, 7‑under, two takes, can't complain about that. 

Q.   Talk about the difference in the conditions from this morning?
RYAN PALMER:   The greens had a little more pep to them, for sure, we had a tricky breeze out there, you could tell this morning the wind wasn't much because of the scores but I stayed calm, stayed in check, never got ahead of myself, hit some smart shots, James gave me safe numbers, never brought in trouble behind the greens and I'm probably getting mad because I'm not getting close to the hole but he knows what he's doing. 

Q.   Best birdie out there? 
RYAN PALMER:   By far 16, I hit it in the trees, had to punch it out with an 8‑iron, 175 to 180 to the back pin, flushed a 6‑iron to 5 feet, that had to be my best shot of the day. 

Q.   Thank you, sir.
