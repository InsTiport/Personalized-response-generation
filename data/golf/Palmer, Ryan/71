 Q.   So, good finish.   What do you think was working for you towards the end of the round?  
RYAN PALMER:   I played better today.   I drove it well.   Just gave myself more chances.   I had a little hiccup on 10 and 11, but overall just played solid from tee to green, made the putts.  
   
 Q.   This is your last stop before the Masters, how do you feel about your game for the first major?  
RYAN PALMER:   Really good.   Today was big, just to see some putts going in.   I just played solid.  
It was a roller coaster week.   I mean five doubles.   To still have a top‑10 is good.  
It's there.   I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to go home for the week and do some work.   And go up early Saturday and play Sunday.   I'm excited where I'm at.  
   
 Q.   What did you think about the course and the conditions this week?  
RYAN PALMER:   Hard.   Honestly one guy, not too hard, he's got a 6‑shot lead.   The lowest score behind him is 3‑under, that tells you how hard it played.   The wind.   The golf course the way it's set up, it's a hard golf course with this wind.
