JON RAHM: Obviously a lot to it is how we started, right.  Made a good putt on 10 for birdie, and then we just didn't miss many shots, got ourselves in good positions to make a lot of putts.  I made putts yesterday, Ryan was making putts today, and the few times we made mistakes, we just were able to fix it, which was just towards the end, and then get a little bit of a bonus on chipping in on that one.  Just really solid play.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind when Jon had that lie on 9?  
RYAN PALMER: I was thankful it stayed where it was.  I knew it was a good lie because I went and looked at it.  That's why he's so good.  His short game is unbelievable.  It was funny on the last, he goes, we're going to end this round like yesterday.  He chipped in on 18 to finish the round.  It's nice knowing when you make mistakes you've got a short game like that to back you up.  But our games are so good together because we both drive the ball so well, and when our iron play is on, knowing how good he can putt and when I get the putter rolling, we're going to make a lot of birdies in both formats.  It's exciting to be in this position.   
 Q.  What's the mindset going into later, assuming you have the lead or are up near the top of the lead?  
JON RAHM: I mean, still two rounds.  I feel like we've been playing for five days already.  Still two rounds to play.  That leaderboard is packed, so I think we'll try to stick to what we've been doing and get a low round going today.   
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, this next round is the key round.  You've got to shoot 7-, 8-, 9-under par, I think, in the low ball format, and that's where the scores are at.  I'm excited about our alternate-shot format the way we're playing.  If we go and take care of our business, I think we'll be there on Sunday.
