 Q. 64 opening round but you lose to both your playing competitors out there. 
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, that's okay. For me, I shot 7-under and that's all I care about. It was an unbelievable day. I've never been a part of a group like that in any round of golf on TOUR, and to go out with three guys, two guys that I like a lot, and for us to play like that and shoot 23-under par, it was awesome and fun. We all fed off each other and had a great time.

 Q. You were waiting on me as I was coming between 3 and 4 on that path, and I thought something was wrong. Maybe you heard me calling your shot or something. You said, man, this is fun, isn't it? 
 RYAN PALMER: It was wild. It was something, like I said, I've never been a part of. The way we kept making birdie after birdie, and when all three of us were doing it, that makes it fun for the people watching and of course for us in the group.

 Q. There were some holes out there that were left on the plate for all three of you. 
 RYAN PALMER: Oh, no doubt. I think I left one out on 4, and then also on 7, the par-5. I missed a short one on 4 and then failed to get up-and-down for birdie on 7. But it's going to happen in a round of golf. I made that putt on No. 9, my last hole, so that makes up for one of them.
