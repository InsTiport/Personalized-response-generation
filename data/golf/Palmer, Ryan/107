 Q.   Eight birdies and an eagle, what an effort today.   62, it's not going to be good enough, as you know, but that's a solid round of golf on a Sunday.   
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was.   The start was huge.   When I got 4 under through 3, I told James, 10 back.  
I have been in the gate all week.   I have been playing really well.   Today, just keep doing what I have been doing.   Finally the putts went in.   
I hit it in the middle of the green and took a long putt and actually made a couple of them.   It's great to get a low round like that in there.  
   
 Q.   Second hole, the shot you hit at 2 was by far and away the best.   That's so tough to get it close at the second hole this morning to get it started.   
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it is.   I was fighting to get down that par.   I was always hitting driver there.   I didn't expect to get that close to the green, and when that pin is on the right, there's no way of getting it there.   
And I landed it in the perfect spot and had like a 12â€‘footer.   Things like that happen, have a low round like that, and some breaks went my way, but what a day to end the week.  
   
 Q.   It's a good way to start the year out.   What's your plans the next few weeks?  
RYAN PALMER:   I'm on my way to Pebble to play next week, and play LA as well.   If I do well those two weeks, maybe match play.   Then Honda Classic.   
I have got a nice little schedule, and it's hard to miss home like that, but, you know, everyone at home is doing well.
