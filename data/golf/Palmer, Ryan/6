  Q. When I was leaving the hotel today I passed you on the steps and said, Play well today, so you followed my advice there, didn't you?
 RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was pretty solid day.  It was a, you know, nothing spectacular, just solid golf.  I actually putted pretty well today I thought, made a lot of putts from the five to eight foot range today and stroked it nicely.  Never got in trouble.  Just a poor 3-putt on number 7, but other than that it was 18 holes of solid golf.
 Q. Teeing off later did you look at scoring and what was happening with the guys who played earlier in the day to see that, hey, the scoring conditions are prime today here at Kapalua?
 RYAN PALMER:   Oh, yeah, no doubt.  You saw the leaderboard, guys were shooting 5-, 6- 7-under pretty easily so I knew, to keep pace, I had to go out and shoot 4-, 5-under par.  And I was able to play some good golf and shoot 6-under, so I know it's going to take probably a couple more, possibly, but, yeah, I love where I'm at and I love what the game is doing right now.
 Q. Second consecutive 67 today.  The number is the same as yesterday, but did your round today feel just like yesterday?
 RYAN PALMER:   It was solid today.  Today was a good 18 holes of just solid golf.  I hit it good, solid, drove it well, actually putted better today, I think.  I made a lot of putts five to eight foot range.  Just kept it in front of me like I need to on this golf course.  But I saw a leaderboard before I teed off, knowing the scores were low, 5-, 6-under par was kind of the average it looked like out there.
 So I knew I had to play a good round to keep pace with the leader and I was able to do that.  So a very satisfying 18 holes of golf, for sure.
 Q. You're doing lot of things well, that is obvious, you're on the first page of the leaderboard.  But is there a certain thing to your game that you would like to elevate heading into the weekend to put yourself in contention on Sunday?
 RYAN PALMER:   Oh, that's a good question.  I could probably hit my irons a little better, I think.  They're still pretty solid, I think.  But there's a lot of shots out there today I could have hit a little better, I thought.  But overall just keep the pedal to the metal, I mean it's going to be a race to the finish, a birdiefest -- depends on the winds, obviously -- so if I just keep doing what I'm doing I know I'm going to play well, I believe.  I love where my game's at, my head's at mentally and physically I feel great, so I don't see any reason why I can't have a chance to win.
