Q. When you stood on the bunker on 18, did you know where you were in the golf tournament? Talk about the second shot there.
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, no, I knew I was one back. It's a shot I hit every time. There is no doubt about it. I probably hit the wrong shot trying to hit more of a hard draw; whereas the second time I did it I hit (indiscernible).
That's golf. I told Slugger driving up, I was trying to hit the left side of the cylinders holding up the scoreboard, not the right side.
Yeah, it's unfortunate. I had a chance, but we went for it. Good week.
Q. One swing doesn't take away from the week as a whole.
RYAN PALMER: No, not at all. It's the way the game is played. You're going to have things like that happen. Yeah, love to have it back, but at the end of the day I'm going to leave and enjoy and look back on this week and be proud of the way I played, the way I fought with these weather conditions.
Shot in the 60s every day and gave myself a chance to win, and that's all I can ask for.
