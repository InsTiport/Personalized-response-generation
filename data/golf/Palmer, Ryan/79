Q.   How would you assess your day? 
RYAN PALMER:   It was a little up‑and‑down the front.   I hit it pretty solid.   Just never could quite get it going.   The eagle on 10 was huge.   Disappointing bogey on 11.   Overall I hung in there all day.   To be in that position and never could quite get up there to get close to the guys that are leading. 

Q.   With the soft conditions and the course playing so long, how much was it an advantage being a long hitter? 
RYAN PALMER:   For me‑‑ because I can hit a lot more 8‑ and 9‑irons to the hole, 7‑irons, but overall, I can get to the par 5s pretty easy and I wasn't hitting any long irons, so that was nice.   Great experience for me, especially getting ready for the Playoffs and if I can farewell in the Playoffs the first few weeks, maybe I can get a phone call from Mr.Watson, who knows.

Q.   How much is The Ryder Cup on your mind?
RYAN PALMER:   I was a little out of it I think.   But it helped get me up there, I don't know how far, but you know, he talked about wanting to have the hottest players, so if I can play well in the Playoffs, who knows. 

Q.   What does this do for your confidence going into the Playoffs? 
RYAN PALMER:   It's huge.   James made a good point when we finished.   He said, "You're going to win one of those coming up, so get ready.   You're there."   Go home, rest, relax and enjoy this for a few days and then get back to work.
