Q.   Can you even describe what that run was like?
RYAN PALMER:   Not really.   No, I can't.   I parred the first two holes thinking, okay, that's all right.   Let's gets the round going.   Try to shoot a good number to stay within striking distance.   And then I holed out the next shot for an on 12 for eagle. 
Then from there, I just, I hit it close.   I was swinging so good today.   I putted well, I didn't make anything long, except for the eagle on 16. 
I made a great putt on 17. 
But other than that it was just hitting it close and making a lot of putts inside 10 feet.
But walking off 10, after I got to 10-under, I just, I didn't know, I was staying calm, trying not to think about anything, just trying to keep my momentum going, my pace with my walk.   It's hard not to think about it. 
But a couple loose swings there on 2 and 3, but a great putt on the next par-5 to get back. 
Then to finish at 11-under, what a memorable day.

Q. Did the bogeys at all settle you to a point where you were able to kind of get back into that rhythm and get it out of your head a little bit?
RYAN PALMER:   No, I guess you could say that.   I mean probably so.   But I had some good swings on the par-5 coming in. 
And a great shot on No. 6. 
Then I had two good chances, I missed a chance on 7 and a putt on 8 I barely missed.   And then the putt on 9. 
I guess the bogeys did kind of calm me down a little bit more and I didn't worry about, obviously, the number.   But the most important thing now was getting back to the within striking distance of Matt and I was able to get two or three shots back on him.   So it's a fun weekend ahead.

Q. This place obviously agrees with you and the birdies you're able to make here.   What sets up to your eye here that's just so good for you?
RYAN PALMER:   There's no wind.   I know I'm swinging well and the work that Granny Smith and I put in on my wedges before I went to Hawaii was more than I did in my career.   And it's shown these first two weeks and TOUR and today it showed again. 
So, I just love coming here.   I love the people we stay with, over at Indian Wells, they keep us relaxed, we have a good time and it keeps me relaxed on this golf course and I'm able to showcase my game and it's been, it's helped me out so far.

Q. Great playing.   Can't wait to see the encore tomorrow. 
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, me, too.   Hopefully. 

Q. Have you ever had a stretch like that?
RYAN PALMER:   No.
