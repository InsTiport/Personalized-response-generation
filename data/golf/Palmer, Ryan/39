 Q.  Ryan, 13 points today.  Excellent start.  Just give some comments.  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it was.  It was kind of a (inaudible) I think, just the way it's been going lately.  Came in, wasn't planning on playing this week, but we decided to because we needed to, obviously.   
So had some great work in the last three days, and with this putting grip I changed to, this claw, it's finally got a good round under my belt with it.  So overall, yeah, great day, great start for me personally, mentally.   
 Q.  How much you want to make the FedExCup playoffs, are you putting extra pressure on yourself?  
RYAN PALMER: No, not really.  I've got some other things that'll work in my favor based on the time I missed in the fall.  But, yeah, other than that, with -- I'm just going to play hard this week and then go to Greensboro and play hard.  So just kind of see where I stand after that.   
 Q.  Been a while since you've been here.  But you have had past success here.  Has the course change at all?  
RYAN PALMER: No, but I enjoy playing this though.  The hardest thing about this is getting the yardages.  And we worked hard on the yardages the last couple of days, trying to figure out how we were going to do it.  And we stuck with it today, and overall our numbers were great.  Our distance control was spot on.  So some work paid off from that part of the game, so I do enjoying playing this golf course.  Always have.  Love the mountains, love the scenery.  So it was a great day.   
 Q.  When you changed putting clubs like you did, how long does it take to set in?  
RYAN PALMER: Two weeks, a week at home working on it and then a week, last week I played in Canada with it.  So it was time for a change.  New putter.  Obviously going to claw grip, trying to get my right hand out of it, and today I think the work finally paid off today.
