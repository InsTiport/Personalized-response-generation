 Q. How was the microphone?
 RYAN PALMER: It was okay. I honestly didn't feel like I had it on me most of the time. I felt it in my shirt just from my arm hitting it, but other than that, I hope it came off good. There wasn't a whole lot of commentating going on today, talking, but I'm glad to get through it. 

 Q. 2-under par was your highest score on last year when you went on to victory. You said today wasn't a lot of commentary. Is that because you found it a little more difficult out there?
 RYAN PALMER: It was, it really was. Especially on the putting greens, they were a little slow. Obviously with the rain they couldn't cut them down. I hit the ball good. I drove it pretty good. My irons weren't as crisp as I could have had, but my short game was there when I needed it. I finally had a putt over two feet. 
 It's good to get off to a good start. You can hurt yourself on Thursday, so I'll take a day like today all year long.
