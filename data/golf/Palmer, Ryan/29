Q. So you've not only secured your spot in next week, but Philadelphia.  Stuck with the round.
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it was a huge day, for sure.  One more frustrating round yesterday, knowing the position I was in, going into the third round and to hit the ball the way I did with the driver; I was packed up and ready to go to the house yesterday until James was pretty adamant about, let's go hit some drivers.
We hit about 20 yesterday and found the rhythm, the tempo I needed.  Carried over to today with my irons, everything, I think I missed one fairway.  I'm not counting 12.  That's kind of like a par 3.  Typically I missed one fairway today, which is huge on this golf course.  Putter was there.
What a huge day.  Coming into the week, you're 100 and knowing if I miss the cut, I'm going home, and if I make the cut and play decent, I'd at least be in Boston.  But lock up BMW is even more special and one step closer to East Lake.
Q. Does it give you anymore confidence or momentum, just the fact that you've played so well with your back against the wall?
RYAN PALMER: It's huge.  I'm excited for next week.  I love that golf course and knowing I can come in in the situation I was in and play the way I did; and then when I struggled, I didn't hit the driver good Thursday and I salvaged 3-under, and then yesterday was a rough day.
But knowing I can play this type of round on a Sunday, where I was at and locking up BMW and closer to East Lake, who knows, go to Boston, win next week and make Captain Furyk think about me.
Q. On 18, you had a big sigh of relief.  What was going through your mind walking off 18?
RYAN PALMER: Happy more than anything.  Big sigh of relief when I saw where the ball landed on the second shot.  Obviously sigh of relief but more than anything just happy.  The way I'm feeling, my mind, my body, I'm just happy where my game is at and excited for what's ahead.
