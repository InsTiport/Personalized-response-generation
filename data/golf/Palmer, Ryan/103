 Q.   The tee shot on 17 was a wedge?   
RYAN PALMER:   A 50‑degree wedge.  
   
 Q.   And you went back two club lengths?  
RYAN PALMER:   No, I went back a club to get an extra yard.   I was going to hit a 54, but then we thought about it, you know, let's just put it on the green.   I was going to take two pars and get out of here.   So we took it back a club, and fortunately I got the spin on it and it came down a couple feet.   
It was probably the most nerve‑racking 122‑yard shot for the first shot of the day.  
   
 Q.   I was going to say it's a difficult combination?   
RYAN PALMER:   There is still a slight breeze left to right so, it's one of those shots if I didn't catch the 54 it could have easily come up short, or if you're trying to hit it hard, you can tug it a lot easier left.   So I think going back a club, and hitting a little three‑quarter, 15‑degree wedge.  
   
 Q.   But had you no choice, right?   You were told you couldn't hit that tee shot last night, right?   
RYAN PALMER:   No, because they blew the horn and we were on 16 fairway.  
   
 Q.   So it's a nice one to go to bed thinking about that shot?   Did you think about it?   
RYAN PALMER:   Not really.   I mean, when we got out here, I prepared for it pretty good.   We had a pin on the range, 122 yards exactly, so I hit probably a good two dozen of them on the range.  
   
 Q.   Is that what it was, 122?   
RYAN PALMER:   122 to the hole.  
   
 Q.   Did you hit mostly 50‑degree?   
RYAN PALMER:   I went through my normal routine.   I went through my whole warm-up like I was teeing off in a normal round.   In the trailer, and then went through my whole routine on the range, putting, everything and, and came back and hit a few extra 50‑degree wedges and drivers.   Then had that shot on 17 and a tee ball on 18.   I made sure I at least blocked it on 18.  
   
 Q.   You hit a 6‑iron and then hit a good second?   
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it's so hard to control it coming out of there.   You saw it; it was just moving.   I was going to hit 7, but if I didn't catch it and it came up short.   I was thinking well, if I can catch a 6 just perfectly, it will come down a little softer, but I had a good putt.   So now I'll go to sleep.
