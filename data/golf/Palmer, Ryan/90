Q.   Final round 69 got you in the playoff, how aware were you in terms of what else was doing; that 8‑under would get in a playoff?
RYAN PALMER:   I knew when Henley doubled 15, then I guess Rory doubled 16‑‑ or I bogeyed 17.   I was done by then, but I heard and you could hear the groans on 18.   I didn't know it until I had my bogey putt on 18.   That's when I knew I was tied for the lead at the moment, so missing the putt on 18 for par, I mean, you look back now, and like, man, it was that close.
But I was there, gave myself a chance, played great all week, played unbelievable all day in these tough conditions and very pleased, very happy.

Q.   How surprised are you that 69 and 8‑under, compared that you started the day five back, gave you a chance?
RYAN PALMER:   If you told me 8‑under was in a playoff, I would have said B.S. But I was thinking 11, 12, start of the day and as the day went on, I thought okay, maybe ten, maybe 11.   But this game's hard, and you can see when it becomes crunch time under pressure, things happen.   So happy I was there and I love where my game is at and it's coming soon.
