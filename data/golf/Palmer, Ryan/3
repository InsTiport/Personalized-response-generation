  Q. The birdies at 12 and 13, close match there.  You pick up a couple of holes there and close it out at 16.
 RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, no, the 12 was a lucky long putt, obviously.  I was just trying to 2-putt to win the hole, and James talked me into laying up on 13 to a good wedge number and I was able to make birdie there.
 So I played great.  I think I made seven birdies today, so if you look at a first round in any golf tournament, I think seven birdies is huge.
 So, no, I love it.  I love where my game's at.  To make some long putts today is huge going into tomorrow, so it gives me that much more confidence with the putter.
 Q. There haven't been many ties today so far.  A lot of guys picking up first points.  So this is huge for anybody to get a first point on the first day.
 RYAN PALMER:   Of course.  We obviously have to win tomorrow to give myself even more of a chance on Friday, but, no, it's always nice to win that first match because you know you have a little, I don't know if you call it advantage or ahead, because I'm with Rahm and Sebastian, but I know it gives you confidence for tomorrow and puts you in a good spot to try to win your pool.
