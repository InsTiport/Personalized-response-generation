 Q. You're going to the North tomorrow. 
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, looking at the scores on the scoreboard, there's definitely a lot of North scores up there. Very fortunate to play well on this golf course. It's a long golf course, it's tough, and very happy to get out of there with a good round under par.

 Q. You're having a great start to the year with a big win. 
 RYAN PALMER: It's nice to play confident, stress-free golf, and it's showing a little bit. It is, I've refocused some goals obviously after that week, and it's carrying over to this week, and I'm still playing well and looking forward to a good chance again this week.

 Q. Can you talk about your par save on 8? 
 RYAN PALMER: It's fun how those are coming now. It was one of those shots I just tried to put on the green, give myself a putt for par from where I was, hit perfectly into the slope and bounced off, trickled on, and of course I made a good putt. No doubt, it was a nice 20-footer I made. One of those things that happens. Some of those shots you hit they come out right, and a lot of them don't come out right, as well. This time it went my way again.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 RYAN PALMER: I didn't think the wind was blowing that hard, but when we got up on the green you could really feel it coming off the water up there. You know, lesson learned, first day, so we know what to do now the rest of the week.

 Q. What did you have in on 18, your second shot?
 RYAN PALMER: I had 256 front.

 Q. Did you think about going?
 RYAN PALMER: No, it never crossed my mind. Ten more yards I would have definitely given it a go.

 Q. Playing with the confidence of the victory, what is that like?
 RYAN PALMER: It just frees me up. I definitely get on every tee ball, tee shot, think, I can make birdie here. The way I'm swinging the irons for sure is a big plus because I'm able to put myself in position to make a lot of putts, and I'm putting the ball good. It makes me more aggressive, I think, and I'm able to go at a lot more pins than normal. It keeps me smiling all day, that's for sure. 

 Q. Is the course playing fairly?
 RYAN PALMER: Well, all the low scores are on the North Course. There was a 5 and a 4 and a 3 I saw, so to shoot 4-under on the South Course is a big bonus, because now I can go to the North tomorrow and put up a low round and put myself in position for the weekend.

 Q. Do you think the golf course is playing fairly, though?
 RYAN PALMER: It's definitely playing hard, no doubt, harder than the North Course. It's playing long. The tee boxes are set up a little tough, but there's one par-5 that's playing a little shorter, too. The course is so soft, you've got to hit your mid-irons in. Definitely shooting 2- or 3-under par on this golf course today is a great day. 

 Q. It's been said that after the putting lesson Phil got, his body language is different, he has more hop in his step. Do you see that kind of confidence out of him?
 RYAN PALMER: I also noticed a different putting style that he's doing. He rolled the ball unbelievable. He hit some putts today I couldn't believe they went in. That's the first time I've played with him, so I really can't base it on any past experience playing with him. But honestly when you play the first day you're trying to just see what's going on. But he was pretty solid and putted the ball great, so he's going to be in there toward the weekend.

 Q. Your putt on 16 on the par-3, did it go right across the cup?
 RYAN PALMER: Well, it had to hit a heel print or something. It was dead center. I was shocked. You get some funny bounces on these greens, and that took a funny bounce, that's for sure.
