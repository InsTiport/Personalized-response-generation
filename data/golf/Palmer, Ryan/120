 Q. Ryan, you got off to a good start there first couple holes, just couldn't really get anything going the rest of the way?
 RYAN PALMER: No, same story as last week. I'm struggling just making putts, plain and simple. Hitting it good, driving it good, irons are pretty good, short game is pretty good, but I'm fighting hard to make a putt. You know, I'm still only five shots back I think right now. I think at the most maybe I'll be five or six, and with a long day tomorrow, that's great. I'm excited about my spot, and I can't wait to get in there and give it a shot.

 Q. What's the key tomorrow when it's 36 holes, a marathon?
 RYAN PALMER: You know, it's one of those things you've got to stay just -- I don't want to say mellow, but no highs or lows during the round because you've got so many holes to play golf. The main thing is just stay even keel the whole way and try to keep yourself energized. It's going to be a long day.
