 Q. Ryan, 5-under, talk about your day after the rain came?
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it was pretty good. I felt great. I had a good little putting lesson with James about what I was doing, sure enough, it paid off. I putted great today. Got a little ahead of myself on 14, 15, was acting like it was Sunday and mentally just got down made a bogey. Came back with two birdies, and 5-under is a good start.

 Q. You hit just two fairways but pretty good after that, out of the rough?
 RYAN PALMER: With the way the greens are -- you can hit a lot of shots out of the rough and still hit the greens. A lot were first cut, too. I think the fairway stats are misleading anyway, so I drove it really good today I felt, and hit my irons good and putted good. 

 Q. Those red numbers are the important stats when you look at that leaderboard, surprised at the red numbers, we were all kind of wondering what the scores would play like once the competition started. 
 RYAN PALMER: I really thought it wouldn't be that low. We were talking about it yesterday, because all of the putts we are going to have were going to be breaking putts and I think obviously as soft as the greens got, playing the ball-in-hand helped. You can throw darts in there. You know, it's there for the taking and you're going to have a lot of tough putts.
