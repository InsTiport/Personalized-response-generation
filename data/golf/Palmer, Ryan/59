 Q.  Solid round out there today.  How would you assess it?  
RYAN PALMER: It was good.  I had a hiccup on the start, obviously, bogeying the first hole, but I've done it before, bogeying the first hole and shooting a low round, so I kind of drew off that.  But overall, I just kept driving it well.  I've been driving it with this new driver a long time.  I've spent a lot of time putting these greens the last few days, and it paid off today.   
 Q.  How is the course?  It seems like the conditions are really good out there.  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, you've got soft greens.  When you get firm fairways, soft greens, you can shoot low, low scores.  You can tell that by the leaderboard.  But the greens are starting to firm up a little bit.  They need to firm up a little more for the weekend, but it's definitely there for the taking.   
 Q.  When you see guys go out and shoot a low score in the morning, since you've won three times on the PGA TOUR, do you keep your mind's eye on that scoreboard even though it's just the first round?  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, when you see it there, you know it's there.  The hard part is not worrying about it, just don't worry about what's out there, just hit a good shot and go out and try to play a solid round.  You can't win it on Thursday, but you can definitely put yourself behind the 8-ball.  Just took a lot of work that I've putt in the last two days on the range and putting, and today it paid off.   
 Q.  You had seven birdies, one bogey.  You have to believe in your mind there are a couple birdies you left out there, particularly on No. 7.  I think that was a short one that you want back?  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it wasn't an easy putt.  I mean, it was a pretty good-sized break, about five feet downhill, so it wasn't the easiest of putts.  But you know, overall I made a lot of longer putts that I haven't been making.  I've been looking at my stats, and I haven't been making much from 15 to 20 feet, and I feel like I made quite a few of those today.  It's a great feeling.  Knowing I get to be up in the morning is even better because I can get out and get back at it.   
 Q.  Did you and William feed off each other there on what was your opening nine with the back nine, he went five in a row, you went four in a row?  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, for some reason we've played well together.  Well, that does happen.  We definitely played off each other, knowing what he was doing, and I kind of got hot there towards the end of the front nine.  Yeah, I think we fed off each other, and we've played well together in the past.  It definitely helped us.   
 Q.  Does this tournament hold a little bit of a special meaning to you because your dad was a Shriner?  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, that's part of the reason I played this year.  When it happened, I told myself I was going to play.  It was during the Playoffs when I told myself I'm definitely going to play Shriners, just in honor of him.  It's got more meaning.  I brought my mom out here and my uncle, just kind of a -- they needed to be here.  So yeah, I think there's definitely a lot of meaning this weekend.  Hopefully it will keep me calm and have a good week.   
 Q.  Any memories you have of going to any events with your dad?  
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, we used to spend a lot of time at their temple in Amarillo when my dad was in that band, and run around the Khiva Temple, up and down their six or seven flights of stairs they have and going crazy as kids.  I've definitely got some great memories of trips I've taken with the Shriners, and still a lot of great friends I have there that are a part of it.   
 Q.  Do you have any interest in ever becoming a Shriner at some point?  
RYAN PALMER: We've talked about it.  I almost did in college.  Time-wise it wasn't, but I think one day -- there will definitely be a time that I will.
