Q. Wonderful 5-under par round today, how difficult was the golf course today compared to the first two days?
RYAN PALMER: You know, it wasn't too bad actually.  The greens were softer than I expected.  I knew the weather was going to be good. Figured they would be a little firmer.  Overall the pins were pretty good, and especially if you were reading them well.
Fortunately I'm hitting it good now and putting well.  You could tell by the scores that were shot, the two guys in front of me both had 7-under and a couple 8-unders out there.  I knew there was a low score out there.  A little hiccup the last few holes coming down the stretch but I'm right there for tomorrow.
Q. How special would it be for you to win and pay tribute to your father?
RYAN PALMER: I don't know if I can put into words -- if that happens hopefully.  It all happened -- we spent all last week just really being with the family.  But I knew I was going to play.  I said the last thing he would want me to do was not play.  All I could do was come out and play for him.  You never get to see me win, except on TV but he's been there every step of the way all day and all week.  Hopefully week try and talk about it tomorrow if it happens.  We'll go out and give it our best.
