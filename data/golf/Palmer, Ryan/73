  THE MODERATOR: Welcome Ryan Palmer to the Waste Management Phoenix Open media center.  6-under through 36 holes.  You've got to be pleased with your position as well as some strong play of late.  Do you feel that's kind of continuing into this week?   RYAN PALMER: Yeah.  No, it was great to be in this position again going into the weekend.  Little rough one today.  You know, my game, I'm confident with my game right now, what I'm doing, but today was one of those off the tee I could not get comfortable, find the swing. It was pretty poor, but I fought through it, managed to hit some greens, and, you know, salvaged that 1-over par.  Sitting at 6-under, one back if not tied for the lead going into tomorrow.  I'm excited.   Q.  Other than the game off the tee, is that it, simply to put it that way off the tee today, or was the weather a condition, the greens, the course setup, all that stuff?  Maybe you haven't played in it yet, these kinds of conditions.  Has to be more than just the game off the tee, yes?  RYAN PALMER: Yeah.  Well, for me it was the driver today, but overall obviously they were playing longer.  Greens were a lot slower with the water on the greens, and when I had chances I struggled making putts. Overall it was tough, because it would come and go.  You'd take the umbrella out, put it up.  This kind of rain, it's one of those rains it just sticks on you.  You can't keep your grip dry. And we battled through it today, and, you know, everybody played tough.  Scores showed it.  Weren't very many scores at all this morning. The greens softened up, but it was hard to make a lot of putts because they were a lot slower.
