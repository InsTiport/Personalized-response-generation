JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Ryan, for joining us.  Another great round today, 69, still in great position going into the final two days, not the weekend, but the final two days of this tournament.

Why don't you just talk and maybe compare yesterday to today, and then we'll go into a couple of questions.
RYAN PALMER:  Yesterday obviously I got off to a good start and held on all day.  I played well.  Today I struggled at the beginning, struggled hitting fairways and greens.  And fortunately I was able to get up-and-down in some tough spots.  Kind of took a deep breath going to the last two holes on the back nine, my front nine, and birdied 17, 18.  Kind of relaxed myself and played solid on the front.  Actually kind of feel like I left a couple out there.

Today was a big day for me just to go out and have a solid round after a good round yesterday.  Looking forward to the next two days.
Q.  When you have a good first round and you're in contention, is round two the important round, just to maintain and then be in position for round three and four to make your moves?
RYAN PALMER:  I think so.  Especially for myself, being a rookie out here and having a good day like this that, it's hard to come back from a low round I think.

I was really pleased with the way I hung on today.  2-under par was a big day for me, and I probably still left a couple out there on the front, but got a couple good breaks on the back nine, my front nine.
Q.  Finishing out yesterday, was it good for you to start in the morning right away?
RYAN PALMER:  I think so.  That way I wasn't sitting around all morning thinking about it and pondering what the day is going to be like.  Fortunately, the wind didn't blow this morning.

I enjoy playing late/early.  After you play that first round, you have time to eat and relax and then get up in the morning and get ready to do it again.  It was a big help to tee off early this morning.
Q.  You hit the same number of greens and fairways as yesterday, maybe one off; does it all come down to putting, is that what it is?
RYAN PALMER:  Yeah, today it did.  I missed all of my greens and fairways on the first six holes.   Then I don't know how many greens I hit today compared to yesterday.  I made a few more putts today I think for birdie, made a few longer ones, about a 15-footer on 17, about a 10-footer on 18.

Fortunately my putter has been hot.  Inside ten feet, I feel like I'm going to make every one I have a chance to look at.  The key for me is just to give myself birdie putts.  James and I keep talking, give myself a chance at birdie, I'm going to make a lot of them the way I'm putting.
Q.  Do you change putters much?
RYAN PALMER:  I've used an Odyssey for years.  Every once in a while I'll switch for a couple days.  Other than that, I've used the same putter as I did last year and in college.  I think I switched for two days this year.

I switch my routine up a little bit this week actually.  It's helped me not think so much about it and helped me focus on a good line.
Q.  Are you looking for a spot to hit on the green?
RYAN PALMER:  Not really.  Just picking out a line and just making sure I put a good stroke on it.
Q.  Starting on the back nine, is that tougher than the front nine, do you think?
RYAN PALMER:  The back nine is tough.  Those first holes, the way I played them this morning, James and I were talking, if I could just make five or six pars in a row, I'd be happy.  They are not easy.  If you don't get the ball in the fairway, you're looking at 200 yards out of the rough that you can't hardly advance it out of.  It was a rough start, but I got through it 1-over par, maybe 2-over par I guess and held on.
Q.  14 and 15, could you just not get to the green from where you were?
RYAN PALMER:  Both of them, I hit my -- 14, I had to lay up, and then I had to punch out with a wedge.

Then on 15, I hit short of the green and actually missed a 5-footer for par there.  That was one of my few putts I've missed this week.  A little disappointed, a little disappointing start, but proud of myself the way I hung on.  I played that front nine real well.
Q.  Tiger spoke about the course this year compared to last year rewarding good shots.  In your opinion, how does this course stack up to others that you've played and what do you think of it?
RYAN PALMER:  He's right.  The greens are getting firm, and where they are putting some of the pins it's difficult to get close.  It definitely rewards good approach shots.  It makes it a little easier when you hit the fairways, because obviously if you don't, you're punching out.

But it does it makes you think about it, as far as your approaches to the greens, where you want to land it.  You might want to take back out of play or front out of play.  It's getting firm out there, and it's definitely rewarding good shots, that's for sure.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you for joining us.
