Q.     Ryan, moving today.   68 will do it.
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, it was good today.   I made 7 birdies somehow out there but, you know, I played solid.   It's a hard golf course.   When the wind picks up it's tricky, firm, fast greens.   But double on 7 kind of irritated me pretty good but stayed calm camp, positive and finished off a good round.

Q.   Felt like the wind kind of switched direction.   How is it playing out there right now? 
RYAN PALMER:   I felt like it was dying down a little bit the last two holes.   It would pick up and die.   Pretty solid direction, I think.   It's hard to decide how hard it's blowing, you know, so -- but hit it good.   I was putt -- I putted great today and put myself in position for tomorrow.

Q.   I know tomorrow there's a lot of golf.   You still thinking about those Aggies?
RYAN PALMER:   I have no dog.   A & M struggled this year-in basketball.   I watch for entertainment value.

Q.   What's kind of your situation this week as far as Augusta and finish here?
RYAN PALMER:   I know where I got to finish, that's all there is.   I've got to win or maybe a Top-5 will be enough.   I don't know.   Just depends how it all stacks up with the European Tour.   Are they playing?

Q.   They're not.
RYAN PALMER:   I just take care of my business.

Q.   You want to know what you do?
RYAN PALMER:   I'd say a Top-5.

Q.   Top-3.   You're an Aggie man.
