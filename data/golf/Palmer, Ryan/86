 Q.   Tell us about your round.   
RYAN PALMER:   It's great.   It was awesome.   Obviously a good start to this major championship and got off to a nice start with birdies at the first two holes, 10 and 11.   
Just played great from there on in, birdies I think it was 14 and then a great birdie on 17 and 18.   
What was strange is the back nine was real soft, I felt.   I went to the front and they firmed up, it seemed like.   Totally two different greens on the back as compared to the front.   
Great up‑and‑down on 2 and 3 and then‑‑ excuse me, of course my chip‑in on 5, that was huge.   
Then made a great birdie on 7.   
Little disappointed on the par on 8.   Hit a great shot that went farther than I expected to.   Then the horseshoe to putt.   
Overall, 6‑under par on Thursdays are never bad.   
   
 Q.   What is it about this course that maybe suits your game?  
RYAN PALMER:   I think you can attack it a lot, I think.   I mean, I can hit the ball pretty good with my driver.   By keeping it in play, I have got small, short irons in.   My putting is coming around finally.   
I did a lot of work with my Randy on my short game this week, so I think I can attack the golf course a little bit more, along with the some of the other big hitters.   
My mindset going into tomorrow is keep attacking as much as I can.  
   
 Q.   What were you thinking when you were going by the leaderboard and saw your name?  
RYAN PALMER:   That's cool.   You don't‑‑ I always look at it for some reason.   Great to see your name up there.   Of course, you are thinking I want to get one more, I want to get another one.   I don't want to be tied.   I want to lead by three or four.   
Tomorrow I will come out and keep the same game plan and keep attacking the way I did today.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RYAN PALMER:   No, no surprise.   Very happy.   I have been playing well I just haven't got the rounds in, the scores, the results.   
After Colonial I felt like I was playing good golf, just couldn't get a round in there.   I missed a U.S. Open cut, but made the cut at the Scottish and British Open.   Played decent at DC, but I couldn't get that low round in there.   
So I knew my game was in good shape, it was just a matter of getting the result.   It was nice to finally get a result out of it.  
   
 Q.   It's only Day 1, but how does it feel to be in the position that you are in right now?  
RYAN PALMER:   Oh, it's great knowing that I can come out tomorrow and keep moving forward and try to build on where I'm at.   It's hard to come out when you are struggling Thursday and you come out Friday knowing you got to shoot low to make the cut.   
Tomorrow the idea is to try to go out and get the 7‑under and 8‑under, maybe get to double digits after Friday.   The confidence is there, I know I'm playing well, which is nice going into tomorrow.   Keep carrying that over.
