 Q.   What are your thoughts?   Obviously you're playing very well, but you got a guy that's kind of running away with it right now.   Your thoughts?  
RYAN PALMER:   Yeah, today was big for me.   I managed 2‑under, but probably, I can't look back on the last day, it was the worst playing day I've had.   It was.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday was?  
RYAN PALMER:   Today was.   Today was absolutely disgusting.   I'm talking about four, five 6‑footers all day long.   Just ‑‑ I hit the ball okay, but I settled with 2‑under, but that's good going into tomorrow that I didn't hurt myself too bad, I guess, but it will be a couple shots for second so we'll go play that golf tournament tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   A little disappointed in the putting and the facts that if you had made some of those you might be within striking distance of the leader?  
RYAN PALMER:   Five or six, I think.   That's reasonable.   And then again, you know, I mean it's, there's been crazy things that have happened and there's no telling what could happen tomorrow.   I could go out and pull a Duval, you never know.   
So we'll give it a shot and see where we stand.   
   
 Q.   Work on your putting a little bit before you leave?  
RYAN PALMER:   I'll probably do a few drills.   Just to get a little better feeling about what I'm doing.   But overall I'm playing great, I hit the ball pretty solid, I felt, I just didn't make the putts I wish I could have made.   But we'll go work on it and try it again tomorrow.
