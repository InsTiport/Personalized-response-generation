Q. Ryan, good day out there for you.  Just get some comments on your round.
RYAN PALMER: It was.  It was one of those days.  It was right in the middle of, they call it the zone, I guess.  I was hitting my wedges close today.  I'd been struggling with my wedges all week.  Finally got wedges close.  Made some great putts.  Got up and down a few times out of the bunker again.  Just one, little, downhill shot -- the heel caught on my six iron.  It was the perfect club, and just tugged it enough.
And that bunker is impossible.  And hit a perfect putt on 18.  And I hit a lot of those putts today.  And it could have been two or three lower.
But I'll wait around and see.  I don't see myself hanging around for the win, but I think it's an opportunity that will take care of a lot of things.
Q. Have to be pretty happy with making a pretty good jump here with just a couple of weeks left in standings?
RYAN PALMER: Yeah, I looked at it -- looked at it last week and thought a top-10 would get me back inside 120, I think.  I don't know where it's going to stand if I finish where I'm at now.  So there's a lot of golf to be played, some birdies to be made.  But we'll just kind of wait and see, I guess.
Q. You were not a happy camper at the end of yesterday's round.  How tough was it to put that back and--
RYAN PALMER: It's funny, same thing happened today.  Had a great shot on 17, got winded and came up short and pretty much the hardest, one of the hardest 2-putts I've ever had.  And then to get on 18 and hit the drive I hit, the ball was just enough below my feet where if you don't get down a little more the heel grabs it and pulls it.  And to par 18 from 185 yards, that was pretty frustrating.
