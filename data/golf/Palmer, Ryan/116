 Q. You've got a 1-shot lead. If I would have told you starting out the day that it was going to be that tough out there and you were going to finish with a 1-shot lead would you have believed me? 
 RYAN PALMER: The way it got goin', I don't know. If you told me I was going to have a 1-shot lead on Thursday, I would have called you a liar. (Laughter.) This golf course was -- James and I just talked. I chalked it up as a hard day. 
 I was playing well, hitin' a lot of good shots, didn't get any birdie putts. The way the wind blows, it just kept blowin' through. Struggled out of the rough, but it was a grind -- I grinded it out all day, I fought and fought. 
 The way I'm looking at it, I could have separated myself pretty easy, if I could have made a couple of shots better, but, hey, 1-shot lead at the Byron Nelson. That can't be better. 

 Q. It was like a 15-round fight with this wind, and it seemed like it was never straight in or straight down, it was always at an angle at every hole. 
 RYAN PALMER: Yeah, it was, it was gusting and calm then gusting and calm. That's always the hard part, trying to figure out the right gust. But, you know, I'm in a 1-shot lead, it's fun, having a blast, looking forward to tomorrow, getting at it again. I'm thankful where I'm at. 

 Q. After a day like today you're going to sleep good tonight, aren't you? 
 RYAN PALMER: Oh, yeah. I'm going to go soak in the tub and get something to drink. 

 Q. Go get in the hot tub, get yourself a drink and we'll see you out there tomorrow. 
 RYAN PALMER: Thanks.
