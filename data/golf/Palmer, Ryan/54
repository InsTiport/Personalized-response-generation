Q. Walk me through it?
RYAN PALMER: 8-iron, 175.  It was playing downhill, so about 165 we thought.  Just hit a nice high one.  Actually thought it was going to go in the bunker.  So I was kind of hoping it would get over the bunker and it kind of caught the fringe and released towards the hole and rolled in like a 20 foot putt.
Q. How many aces have you made in your career?
RYAN PALMER: This is number 11.  In my career.
Q. First one since?
RYAN PALMER: I don't even know when the last one was.  I think it was Malaysia.  It's been awhile.
Q. What do you think about Quicken Loans giving that money?
RYAN PALMER: It's great.  I see it every week when they have one.  It's pretty cool to be able to give somebody a free mortgage for a year.  That's awesome.
