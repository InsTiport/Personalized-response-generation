Q. Great play today.  A little bit of a roller coaster?
AARON WISE: Yes.
Q. Finishing strong with birdies toward the end, that's got to be a good taste in your mouth right now?
AARON WISE: Absolutely.  It was a bit of a struggle today.  Didn't hit the ball as well.  Was out of position a lot of times.  The hardest part of playing an Open, especially when you're playing well and maybe not having your best day, is staying patient and not trying to force things.
I felt I did an amazing job.  I was able to stay patient, wait for the birdies to come to me.  And 17 was a huge birdie, and to get one on 18 and finish even for the day makes me feel good.
Q. 17?
AARON WISE: 17 I hit a 4-iron, and 18 I hit 3-wood, 3-wood into the front bunker, and got up-and-down.
Q. So right now, T2, that's pretty fine in your mind, I'm sure.
AARON WISE: Yeah, it's a good spot.  These events, what I've learned is if you can just stick somewhere around the lead, you never know what's going to happen.  We've seen it multiple U.S. Opens where people who go out early on Saturday or early on Sunday fire great rounds, and it plays way harder in the afternoon.
It's just a matter of being there.  This is my first made cut in the U.S. Open.  I love the fact that I was able to do that.  But I'm looking forward to hopefully just playing more consistent golf, maybe the hitting a few more fairways, a few more greens and being able to at least post some good scores.  But we're yet to see what those scores are going to be on the weekend.  It could be even or 1-over is a great round around here.
Q. It seemed as though, just watching you play a little bit, the little bit that I saw, kind of a real composed guy, naturally fluid and calm.  Is that you?  Was that you today or you all the time?
AARON WISE: That's me all the time.  Since I was a kid I've kind of always been grown up and always been pretty flat demeanor, don't let things get to me.  I feel that's one of the best things that suits me around U.S. Opens and majors and stuff.
Things are going to happen.  On 7 I hit a great shot but didn't realize how firm the green was going to be, went over the back.  And that can maybe get to a few people, but I was able to let it roll off my back.  I made a double there, which sucked, but I was able to make some birdies coming in and get my round back to even, where other people could have let that influence them.
Q. Interchangeable with the golf and where you are, give us an overview of your experience here at Pebble and the area, what you think about the area, how you feel about the area?
AARON WISE: Yeah, Pebble is amazing.  Knowing that they were having their 100th U.S. Open here, you knew it was going to be special.  I know it was a little cloudy and overcast this morning, but we've had incredible weather all week.  I think the course is playing just how they want it to.
And playing alongside the ocean, this is a course a lot of people say they would want it to be the last place they want to play.  I can see why, especially coming June with the weather we have and everything else.
