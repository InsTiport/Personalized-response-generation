 Q.  Aaron Wise, could you have imagined playing a more consistent perfect round of golf to get your first win on the PGA TOUR as you did here Sunday?  
AARON WISE: No.  You know, I hit the ball incredible all week along and it got better as the week went long which was fun for me to see.  It continued today.  I absolutely striped it.  Hit it incredible.   
I had a talk with my putter there on 3 a little bit about it because I missed a couple chances early.  "You need to cooperate for me."  It got red hot in the middle of that round and kind of shot me off to a huge lead.   
I knew coming down the stretch Marc was going to get some chances because he was hitting the ball great as well and luckily the ball kind of bounced my way.  I was able to par in and get the victory.   
 Q.  How about the four birdies in a row starting with No. 7 right in the middle of the round for you?  
AARON WISE: That was about the time when the putter was getting hot.  Right before that actually on 6 was the key turning point for me.   
I missed the ridge to the right which is a mistake and yesterday I missed the ridge to the left and I three-putted, and today I was able to knock in about a 7-footer for par which kept the momentum going and allowed that stretch to happen.   
Great up and down on 7.  Knocked in it there stiff on 8 and then made two really nice putts on 9 and 10.  It was huge.   
 Q.  You've had a few minutes to shake some hands, give out some hugs.  How does this one feel and how were you able to control the emotions all day long?  
AARON WISE: It feels amazing, you know.  It's incredible.  It's everything I've dreamed of.  I have to thank everyone on my team, Callaway, Nike.  I felt like when it rained today I was really going to tear the course up just because it allowed me to hit driver, which is my strength, and, you know, I got that Rogue driver and absolutely love it.  I'm smashing it.  I really -- I took it apart with the driver today.  I got a lot of short irons in my hand and was able to make a lot birdies.   
 Q.  Congrats on No. 1.  Hope it's for many more.  
AARON WISE: Thank you.  I appreciate it.
