Q. You got off to a hot start today and then the eagle on 16 to get you back to 7-under.  What was working so well for you?
AARON WISE: Just played well.  I hit it in good spots -- and it's a tricky, tough golf course and I think I hit a lot of fairways, hit a bunch of good iron shots and then rolled some putts and it was kind of a bit of everything.
Q. Good conditions out there for you, did that kind of help, the wind was kind of down, nice weather, kind of warmed up a little bit.
AARON WISE: Yeah, all week it's been windy and then the forecast looks pretty good from here on out.  So it's nice to play this course with no wind, it's a tougher course, you don't need to make it any tougher, and just a good start to the week.
Q. Is it a course that seems to fit your eye?  I know this is probably your first time around.
AARON WISE: Yeah.  I don't really know yet, I haven't played it enough.  It's in great shape though, so I'll give it that.  If you play great golf, your score's going to show it.  There's nothing that's going to come out and jump at you.  It's kind of out in front of you and you just have to play well.
Q. Your game, coming into this week, was your game trending in the right direction?  Did you see this kind of round coming?
AARON WISE: I would say so.  I took a week off two weeks ago and kind of had some rust last week and felt like I knocked it off as the week went on and then had some good practice this week and off to a great start, hopefully I can keep it up.
Q. Take me through 16.  Clubs you hit?
AARON WISE: The par-5?
Q. Yeah.
AARON WISE: Driver off the tee, right down the middle, and then I had 199 pin and kind of just hit a draw 7-iron in there that landed 15 feet short and kind of rolled up there to like a foot, tap-in range and tapped it in.
