 Q.   9‑under.   3‑under today, tougher conditions today.   Take me through your round.   
GEORGE MCNEILL:   Just like you said, 3‑under today and tougher conditions today.   
You just had to pay attention a little bit, just like the first two days.   Greens are getting a little harder and faster, some of the greens, like No. 1, for example, is very, very hard.   
So just kind of position your ball and try and make a few putts.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to change anything for tomorrow or same strategy?  
GEORGE MCNEILL:   As long as the wind stays the same, I'll probably try keep doing the same things, so we'll see.   I think it's forecast to do the same thing, so I'll probably ‑‑ I don't anticipate changing anything.
