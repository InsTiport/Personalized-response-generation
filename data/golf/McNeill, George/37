  Q. George, tremendous round. 66 on the Magnolia course. That very well may be the low round of the week. That's tremendous playing over here.   
 GEORGE McNEILL: I'm sure there's some low rounds today. It didn't seem that it was playing all that difficult. The tough holes were playing downwind. The easy holes were playing in the wind, which made them a little tougher, but not as bad.   
  
  Q. Looks like you did very well today.   
 GEORGE McNEILL: Yeah. Absolutely. I kept it in play, made some putts in. Obviously that's what you gotta to do shoot that. That's the way it goes, I guess.   
  
  Q. Everybody gets to Magnolia on the weekend. This has gotta give you a little momentum heading into the weekend. How do you feel?  
 GEORGE McNEILL: Absolutely. We'll find out tomorrow, I guess. There's some things I've been working on, especially with my swing. Feel like I'm starting to get a little more comfortable.   
 My putting's more comfortable. Obviously I'm from Florida, so the Bermudagrass and Bermuda greens don't make me feel awkward or anything else. I'm pretty comfortable, so we'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. You're off to a great start today. Go get 'em.   
 GEORGE McNEILL: Absolutely. Thank you.   
  
  Q. Anything about the round, any good saves in there, any long putts you made?  
 GEORGE McNEILL: I mean I birdied three of the four par-5s. The only bogey made was on par-3 where I crossed the shot and made it to the green. But no, it was almost boring, in a good way.   
  
  Q. That's good.   
 GEORGE McNEILL: Yeah. It was nice to make birdie on the last hole. It's always nice to make birdie on the last.
