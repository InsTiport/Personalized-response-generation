 Q.  George, 67-65, good start.  You come in at No. 70.  Obviously you know what you've got to do, third or better.  What's your plan the rest of the way?  
GEORGE McNEILL: To continue doing what I've been doing the first two days.  I have very little expectations.  The way I've been playing the last two months really, I haven't played all that well.  I had a couple good rounds here and there.  But overall, I really haven't been playing that well.  I had no expectations.  I was surprised to even get in.  I came in here and said to Pete, let's just wing it and see what happens, so I'm just going to try and take that same attitude on the weekend.   
 Q.  What's gone right this week?  
GEORGE McNEILL: Hitting it nice, making a few putts here and there, missing a few, but that's golf.  But keeping the ball in play, hitting a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.   
 Q.  Obviously the conditions out there today, soft fairways are important.  Do you feel like the golf course is playing pretty easy?  
GEORGE McNEILL: Well, the wind laid down, and that's a big difference between yesterday and today.  Obviously Jason Day doesn't have any effect for any conditions out there.  He just does what he wants.  But the wind laid down today, and obviously with it being soft, no wind or very little wind, it made it very scorable, and that's what you're seeing.   
 Q.  Well, just keep doing what you've been doing, and you never know come Sunday afternoon.  
GEORGE McNEILL: You never know.
