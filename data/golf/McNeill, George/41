 Q. Just comment, 5-under today, great playing. 
 GEORGE McNEILL: Thanks. It was a little more benign than the last two days obviously with the weather and whatever else. 
 Tadd Fujikawa, that's unbelievable, phenomenal, and especially for however many TOUR events he's played in, I don't know; but not many, I know that. We knew there were some scores out there so Adam and I just started feeding off each other and had a good time and played well. 

 Q. What's working for you?
 GEORGE McNEILL: Actually, I hit it pretty well. It got to where I felt more comfortable with my swing the first two days. I think being able to stand up and not get blown around so much, that helps. That, and I made a couple of putts coming in, so it's nice to see some balls go in the hole.

 Q. Talk about tomorrow's final round. 
 GEORGE McNEILL: Show up and see what happens. I'm not really going to plan on anything. 
 Golf's golf. I know all too well how this works, and last year, I had a good chance to win the last couple of events and didn't really play all that well, but you live and learn. I'm just going to go out and try like I said and I'm feeling much more comfortable with my swing and just try to make some putts here.
