Q. You hit the ball really well, 16 of 18 greens?GEORGE McNEILL: Yeah, I did, and I didn't even realize it until about the 14th or 15th hole, kind of going around and going, I don't think I've chipped today.  It was a nice way to go around this golf course.  Chipping and putting is always difficult.  So to hit a lot of greens and have opportunities, it's always good.
Q. Pretty tough golf course out there.GEORGE McNEILL: It is.  The wind was blowing a little bit early and it has not really laid down much to this point.  I think it's forecast to lay down.  It was calm and then it got blowing and now it's just steady.  So it gets your attention and long golf course, a lot of good golf holes going in all different directions, so that means the wind is going all different directions. That makes you keep your eyes and your ears open and pay attention.
Q. You seem to find your way to the top of the leaderboard on tough golf courses.  Any particular reason for that?GEORGE McNEILL: Maybe I concentrate a little more.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I like this golf course and maybe that's part of it.  Some of the courses where guys are making a lot of birdies and even par is not really a good score, that becomes more of a putting contest and I'm not real comfortable. I just feel better when par is a good score.
