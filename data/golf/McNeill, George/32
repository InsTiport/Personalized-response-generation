   GEORGE McNEILL: It was pretty much damage control. Windy and it's cold and conditions aren't very favorable for scoring, but obviously you've got to get out there and keep it together. 
 Fortunately kept in play for the most part. 

 Q. Just talk about the wind and how you were able to keep it where you wanted to be?
 GEORGE McNEILL: I don't really know. I just basically missed it in the right spots. I hit a lot of bad shots but I hit a lot of good shots. I got away with the bad ones and took advantage of the good ones. 
 So, I mean, that's basically how golf is, but especially today on this golf course. 
 Three more days to go, it's just a tough golf course. Conditions are always tough here.
