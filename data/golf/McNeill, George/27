  THE MODERATOR:   George, we were talking about last year.   You finished fifth here, and that was your first top‑ten finish, and then you went on to have one of your best seasons.   How did this start last year jump start it?  
GEORGE McNEILL:   Obviously coming in here and playing well and gettin' a little bit of confidence.   I was in the 126 to 150 last year, so not a great category to be in.   
I had to take my starts where I got 'em, and fortunately this was my third event of the year, and it's just like Florida so it felt comfortable, and I happened to play well.   
   
 Q.   What went so right on a day like today?   
GEORGE McNEILL:   Obviously I hit it pretty well and putted pretty well, and the few greens that I missed I chipped 'em close and had tap‑ins and everything else, so I avoided the mistakes.   
   
 Q.   I had the win in '07, but last year was as good of a year as you've played.   How have you been able to elevate your game?   
GEORGE McNEILL:   I have no idea!   I think I was able to bear down.   Because I was in the situation that I was, not getting that many starts, I had to take advantage of the ones I did, and for whatever reason I played well.   
I had four top‑tens last year, and two seconds, so hope to improve on that from last year, a jumping board to keep the momentum going.   
   
 Q.   Is it windy?   What was the key out there?   
GEORGE McNEILL:   Patience, not getting too excited about making a par, and I didn't make any bogeys, so that was nice, but not messing up a hole that I thought I should take advantage of, so staying patient.
