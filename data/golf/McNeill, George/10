 Q.   So you came up just a little bit short, but talk about your week and also qualifying for the Open.  
GEORGE McNEILL:   I mean great week altogether, obviously.   I mean I can't explain the round today.   Got off to a nice start and everything else.   And finished well.   So hole‑in‑ones and birdies and everything else.   So it was a nice day, a nice week.   It's been a nice few weeks.  
Qualifying for the Open is awesome.   I mean I've only played in one.   I'm looking forward very much to playing in a few weeks, and hopefully I'll play better than I did the first time because I played awful the first time.   It just depends on the weather and everything else.   
But I'm very much looking forward to it, and you know, having a good time over there.  
   
 Q.   And then what do you build off this performance this week?  
GEORGE McNEILL:   I don't know.   I mean it's obviously maybe a little confidence.   I moved way up in the FedEx I saw.   Moved up in the money, moved up in everything.   Probably world ranking, I have no clue.   But again, that's kind of‑‑ the FedEx is really the thing‑‑ I mean Top 30 is my ultimate goal, and obviously a win would have probably jumped me way higher, but just playing well and having an opportunity to win is always cool.  
But Top 30 is my ultimate goal.   That way I guarantee myself into all the majors, because I haven't played one in a while.   So I think this should guarantee me into the PGA as well with the points list and everything else for that.   So that would be nice playing a couple majors over the next month and hopefully play halfway decent and maybe play like this or play like I have been all year.   I've been playing pretty well for the most part all year.
