Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: I went to the rules officials first and then the executive committee and they said it was okay.  She gets to carry a carry bag.  My big bag is huge, and she has a bad back.  It was really fun.  I knew she would be really supportive.  We kind of went out there and had some fun and laughs.  I always play better when I'm relaxed.  She got a little tired towards the end though.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: Yeah, until the last two holes.  We didn't read them very good.  That was because of the couple hills coming up.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: I played really solid on my first 9, which was the Back  9, just pretty steady.  I turned 4 under, and then I struggled a little bit on the Front 9, made a bogey on one, which was a really bad bogey and caught a bad lie in the ruff and hit it over the green.  And then I came back with a birdie on the next hole, which was probably the best birdie of the day.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: Yeah.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: Okay.  12, I had a good drive and hit it in there like about 10 feet and  -- maybe 8 feet and had a little left-to-right break in putt, and I hit an 8-iron.  And then on 13, I hit a gripped 8-iron just a little shot in there to like 5 feet; and then 15, actually I hit my second shot actually short in the ruff and hit it out probably about 10 feet behind the hole.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: A wedge.  And then 18, I was just down in front like maybe a 35-yard shot with a wedge and hit it to about 5 feet.  The bogey, I hit a good drive, and then my second shot, I was laying up conservatively with a 7-iron, and I pushed it into the ruff and got a pretty bad lie and then hit a good shot out, and it just passed the pin over the green. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: I got a draw and then actually got a worse lie.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: 2, I hit a gripped 9-iron to about 8 feet.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: It was playing like I think 132 to the front, 141 to the pin, downhill.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: 6, I hit a good drive and had a wedge in, and I pulled it, but it was on the green, and then I hit a bad first putt and was actually below the ridge and had to hit up over the ridge and left it like 5 feet and then just hit a good putt, but I hit it firm and I played it outside the hole.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: Yeah, it was probably maybe 30 feet maybe.  That's a guess, but it was two tiered.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
PAM KERRIGAN: Yeah, I think so.  I mean, you try and just play one shot at a time and try to keep it in the fairway, try to hit the green.  I think the greens started getting a little firmer my last few holes so that in the afternoon that's something you have to consider so you can't be quite as aggressive as you can when they're softer, and the greens are  -- you know, there's a few that are a little inconsistent, but I think just taking it one shot at a time, and you can definitely score out there.  I hit it well, but the girls I was playing with were having some trouble.  There's definitely some trouble out there.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.
