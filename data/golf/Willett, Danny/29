DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, that was good.  Steady, right?  Missed a few chances in there, but I got another under par round, and conditions were relatively simple.  So you'll see some good scores.  Yeah, another one in the red.   
 Q.  How are you feeling going into tomorrow?  
DANNY WILLETT: Well, obviously a long way back now.  It's just nice.  Build another four rounds under the belt in a major, you've got some of the best players in the world.  We've not been here for long.  It's nice to get back here and get the juices flowing and hit some good golf shots.
