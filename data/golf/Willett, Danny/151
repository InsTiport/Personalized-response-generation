  DANNY WILLETT:   A few good shots, a few putts.   So all in all it was all right.   Hit a few good shots, but everyone has them.   
   
 Q.   No great expectation in coming from that temperature to this?   
DANNY WILLETT:   You try and say you've had a few days off, but you still do, you still get frustrated when you don't hit shots, made a couple of silly errors that shouldn't have been there but you think you can progress and build up your game.   
   
 Q.   What works, what didn't, because you've got the room to contend with, and dropped down with‑‑   
DANNY WILLETT:   It's strange, there's a lot of elevated tee shots and you've got the breeze coming across or into you and it's quite tricky.   You're trying to hit 2‑iron or a 3‑wood or a driver and you've got to keep it down or if you get too far up it's up in the trees and it knocks down.   
A lot of it is just ball flight controlling.   You've just got to keep your flight under control.   If you keep your ball down on one side of the hole where the breeze it, you keep yourself out of too much trouble but there is a decent score obviously on the par 5s that are relatively reachable and you've got a couple of short par 4s.
