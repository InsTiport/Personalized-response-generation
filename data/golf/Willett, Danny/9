Q. Danny, round of 68, solid start to the week. What was working for you out there today?
DANNY WILLETT: Nothing too silly, got us out of position maybe twice. Just hit everything pretty solid. 8, hit it close and missed. This week, it's just about progressing through the week. You're going to get guys who go out and shoot the low scores, but hopefully we can just keep on focused.
Q. Have you seen the rough this week around this golf course?
DANNY WILLETT: No. Usually you get a lot of flyers around here which makes it really tricky to hold the greens and stuff. This week, you're looking at it, if you get a good lie, you're still getting a fly but if you get a bad lie, you're looking at hacking it. It's definitely the longest I've ever seen it, especially kind of off the tee and fairway.
Q. 302nd this day last year in the World Ranking and now you're 30th making your climb back up to the player we all know you can be. What was the most difficult part about this climb?
DANNY WILLETT: Just sticking to it, kind of what you know. This time last year we were still doing some work with Foles and just had not quite hit that little spell of results, but we were doing some good work. We had had a couple glimpses of the light shining through the trees, but we kept working hard and doing the same things and trusting what Foles was saying and doing the work in the golf course off the gym.
A few months later, won a couple of events and back playing in the World Golf Championships and having some success and happy to be here.
