Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANIEL WILLETT:  Kind of, yeah, I would say.  It's always
nice to finish well.  It's still part of golf.  But it would be
nice to finish strong.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANIEL WILLETT:  I can't think of any at the moment.
Q.  Just how tough is it out there?
DANIEL WILLETT:  No, I mean, I don't know what they've
done, if they've done anything.  They're massively different than
yesterday and the first couple of days.  I don't know if they've
obviously not watered them.  We played yesterday morning, and it's
much different than what it is today.  I don't know what the plans
are for the rest of the week.  It's a bit different, when you try
to pitch up and get warmed up the last couple of day, and today
it's completely different.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANIEL WILLETT:  There's a couple of them out there that
are a bit tricky.  The one on 8 is interesting.  And the one on
17.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANIEL WILLETT:  I don't know, to be honest.  You can
still have a score, if you hit them on the right side.  It's just
a little bit harder.  I would say if you get on the wrong side.
(Indiscernible).  The R&A I'm sure will be happy.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANIEL WILLETT:  If it picks up even more, it might be
interesting.
