  Q. Good effort?   
 DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it's good, I'm playing really nice. Yesterday at Carnoustie, pretty tough day, 4-over, and then shoot 3-under on the back nine and finish 1-over and today come out, only missed a couple of greens, hit a lot of fairways.   
 Obviously you would have preferred to have been either Thursday or today, but that's the draw and you've got it put up with it and do what you can. The third of the field have to do exactly the same as me so you just have to get in the mind-set as you're going out there and playing and see what you can do.   
  
  Q. Going out later on --  
 DANNY WILLETT: We're all back at St. Andrews, everyone is there. It's going to be good fun. I'm playing well. You know, it's a about golf course and hopefully the weather is pretty good. I think the boys have still got the back nine, I'm hoping they are on the back nine at Carnoustie and not the front nine. I'm hoping they turn into the back, and that will make it difficult. Depends on which nine they are playing.   
 I don't think anybody are going to get stupidly far away from that. You know, five at worst, and then at St. Andrews, Sunday, pretty big tournament. Play well and see what we can do.   
 I've never played the Old Course. Last year was the first time I played it in this competition. I mean, our rounds have been pretty good out there so far.
