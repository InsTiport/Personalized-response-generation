   DANNY WILLETT: It's been a good week. I've been playing well now all year really but played really nice today. 17 was big, obviously Martin holing that, thought there might be another chance on the end, but still a good result and a bit disappointed at the same time.  
  
  Q. Your chances came early in the back nine.  
 DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, but again he holed that on top of me from 25 feet for birdie. He putted well today, and he's had a chance to make birdie and stay up there, he's done it. Take your hat off to him. Played really nice and he's holed the putts when he needed to.  
  
  Q. You mentioned 17, what goes through your mind when he holes a putt from just off the green like that and you're in the same position with 4-wood?  
 DANNY WILLETT: It's a little bit annoying, a little bit harsh, but that's out it goes. I holed one on the par 5 and he holed one right back. I gave it a good chance but didn't quite make it.   
 That one shot coming down the last, birdie to par, nothing, but two shots down you still need to make bogey but never mind.   
 He's a well-oiled machine. He's a terrific player. He keeps his calm, he plays his golf, and I mean, he really is playing well at the minute.  
  
  Q. And that means you're some player, as well, to get so close?  
 DANNY WILLETT: I'm getting there, second year on Tour, it's getting close every time we play and just need to keep putting myself in contention. I've been up there now a few weeks and it's nice to finish second, best finish on Tour, there will be a few World Ranking points and stuff and try to push that Top-50 for the end of the year.  
 You know, it's a really good spell at the back end of the season, the five events are going to be massive. If I can have a few more finishes like that, it will do me a world of good.
