DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, I played quite good.  Game's obviously getting better.  So, my time's coming up, I think.   
 Q.  Would you say this shows that you're back now?  
DANNY WILLETT: It can come and go as it pleases, but the game is definitely on a path that it is a lot better than where it was.  It's nice to come off disappointed, in 25th position in a major, whereas a year ago that would have been a really nice finish.  It just says the state of where we are at is a lot better.   
 Q.  Was it like out there?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it was good.  It always is, Sunday at any major.  Obviously in the position that you're in with the conditions out there, people can make moves.  Obviously, Pep's made a good move on there.  You never know, it might get pretty close.   
So you always know there's a chance of doing anything with 18 to go, and the conditions can obviously vary a lot in The Open.  Just fun to be back out playing.  Obviously the fans are amazing as they always are.  It's kind of what we do it for, isn't it?   
 Q.  How exciting are you about the prospects it's in Northern Ireland next year?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it will be.  Obviously, I played Portrush in the Irish Open a few years back.  Great tournament.  Fantastic Open venue.   Yeah, another very, very good week.   
 Q.  Especially with the crowds, they're talking about 40,000 a day there, limiting the tickets.  
DANNY WILLETT: The course is old school, so there's not a great deal of room between the holes.  And what room there is, is some pretty steep mounds.  So they might have to for health and safety, I think.  You always get a great crowd.  At the Irish Opens I've played, you get fantastic crowds.  So for The Open to be in Portrush will be great.
