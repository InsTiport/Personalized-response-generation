Q.   3 & 2 victory over Ryan Moore, what gave you the edge?
    DANNY WILLETT:   I don't know, really.   It was a little bit to and fro.   We just got the putt going.   I think I had four or five nice putts within six holes, kind of 10, 12 feet for birdies, and one for a big par.   And it just kind of gives an edge and he never got too much back in it.

Q.   This is the first time at the championship.   You've played all the majors now and all the WGCs.   Is this one you always wanted to play?
    DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, it's good fun.   It's different.   We don't play this golf or I haven't played this golf for seven years, so it's always good fun to play in a professional format. 
    I think the format this year is really good.   You're not just flying home after one day like you used to.   It's one of them I've always wanted to play.   I like myself in match play.   I always had a good record as an amateur.   It's different in the professional game, but it's good.

Q.   Your thoughts on your match tomorrow?
    DANNY WILLETT:   It will be good.   Top 64 players in the world, so you've got to play your best to win.

Q.   You came to San Francisco early, celebrating your seventh anniversary, enjoy the city?
    DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, it's been good.   We were tourists for a couple of days, did Alcatraz and did the Big Red because and Fisherman's Wharf, so it's been really good.   It's a fantastic city, and obviously this golf course is pretty special to me.
