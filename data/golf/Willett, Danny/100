 Q.  Danny, a hot day and some hot golf.  Well played.  
DANNY WILLETT: It was good. Started a bit scrappy.  Level or 1-over through five or six and he took advantage.  Stepped it up a little bit and felt like we needed to press him a little bit and did kind of from 8 onwards.  Really got on top and got the back against the wall.  Tried to keep pressing apart from 16, that was a little bit of a hiccup.  All in all it was a good day.   
 Q.  How much talk was there about what was going to happen today, because clearly they were going to putt out their strong players at the top and you were out there competing.  
DANNY WILLETT: Me and Ben have played obviously all three days.  Our mind-set, Clarkey just said, he wants the lads who like get playing quick and getting up for it going out early, me, Poults, Sully and Fitzy.  He wanted someone stronger around the middle and obviously he stood Westwood in there and you can see Westwood has nicely tucked that away early.   
The team room was basically no complacency, go out there, try to get it done early, try to get it done properly.  Fortunate enough, quarter past 12, it's all wrapped up.   
 Q.  I know it's a team effort but you had the honor of getting the point that actually seals the deal.  
DANNY WILLETT: It's nice, but I think nobody's really that bothered about who gets it as long as someone does.  Like I say, going on last year, you know you can relive what happened two years ago and you see the lads came back strong in singles.  In our own separate ways, we're trying to contribute.
