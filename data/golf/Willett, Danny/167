  Q. Can I just ask you this morning had you saw the rain coming down you must have wondered what conditions would face you this afternoon?   
 DANNY WILLETT: I was having lunch with one of my mates, Paul Waring, we just looked outside and obviously they had brought some guys off because of the rain. It was terrible; the golf course filled up in five minutes, and you wondered if it had more. You're not sure if it could hold it, because it's been raining for three days, and luckily we have had a great afternoon of golf.  
  
  Q. Looking at your score of 67, didn't seem to bother you too much with a fantastic finish and an eagle on the 18th.   
 DANNY WILLETT: It was good. We've had little showers here and there, but nothing major. The wind has not really been there to be fair. It has been pretty good conditions. As good as we could ask for the last few days.  
  
  Q. Your first year on Tour how, do you feel you're settling in?   
 DANNY WILLETT: It's getting better. A little bit edgy on a few of them, and I almost feel like I belong here now. I've been out here six, eight months and starting to play good golf and feel good about it.  
  
  Q. In general what courses do you like to play?   
 DANNY WILLETT: The course is good. Obviously just wherever your ball pitches pretty much it's stopping. A couple of tight holes, a couple long holes with it being wet.  
 But it's good fun out there to play when it's wet like this, so hopefully the rain keeps away and it can stay like this.  
  
  Q. Slightly earlier start, so hopefully the rain won't be too bad and you'll have favorable conditions tomorrow morning as well?  
 DANNY WILLETT: I think if the rain stays off this afternoon, I think the golf course could be in really good shape tomorrow morning. Go out there and post a score maybe and see what you can do.
