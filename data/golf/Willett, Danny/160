 Q. 5-under par for the opening round, first big, big tournament of the season, how was your game today?
 DANNY WILLETT: Played really good and everything was spot on. Holed out quite nicely. Really the only botch was on the last on the tee, made bogey, but still 5-under is a good, steady start.

 Q. Looks like the course is demanding to play very consistent, very solid. Is the course playing tough?
 DANNY WILLETT: It's strange, in the practise rounds it was the complete opposite way around. It played really, really difficult and then today a few of the longer holes are playing a little bit downwind and it's a little bit nicer. 
 The course is in such good condition; the greens are that pure that if you hit some good shots, you can actually go really low.
