Q.   Tell us what it feels like to come in and put in a round like that on the second day. 
DANNY WILLETT:   It was good.   Yesterday was a bit hit and miss, a little bit shaky.   I haven't played a lot of tournament golf in the last 14 weeks, so it was a bit rusty.   And today hit some proper golf shots again and I played really nicely. 
It's good to put yourself in a position.   Obviously Ernie has got a round to go and a few other guys at 7‑, 8‑under par, so it will be interesting at the end of the day, put ourselves in with a shout.

Q.   What's been the key? 
DANNY WILLETT:   We're just playing very sensible golf.   It is a birdie‑fest out here and people make a lot of putts and stuff.   If you can just keep hitting it inside 20‑foot, 15 feet, you are going to hole your fair share.   We had some good numbers, played the par 5s pretty nicely, nothing special.   It's just been pretty good all the way around. 

Q.   How nice is it to come back here as defending champion?
DANNY WILLETT:   It is good, first time coming back to a tournament defending champion is always nice, obviously different golf course but still the same atmosphere and it's BMW's 25th anniversary, so it's a nice event this year.
