 Q.  Danny, some fantastic stuff, and it got away from you a little bit.  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, just a couple of bad shots, really.  Probably three.  I got the bad breaks.  Three bad swings on the iron shots.  I really had been playing nicely all day, but unfortunately that can happen.   
 Q.  Is there any part the weather played, say 11, for example?  
DANNY WILLETT: 11 is a tough hole.  But, yeah, just not enough, really.  The conditions are rather what you expect at an Open.  I think it's been pretty similar all day, pretty fair for the guys.  It's been windy on and off.   
Just three bad swings.  Relatively benign at the time.  And then, yeah, just a shame really to kind of finish like I did.   
 Q.  Still have a shot?  
DANNY WILLETT: You never know.  Obviously depends on the weather again tomorrow.  But if we can put it in play off the tee like we did today and take out the silly mistakes, then, yeah, we'll need some pretty nice stuff the next three days.   
 Q.  Is the atmosphere good out there?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it is.  Whenever you come to The Open as a Brit it's a pretty special feeling.  Jordan and Leish, as well, we had a great round.  It's always nice to come back and play The Open in front of the crowds.
