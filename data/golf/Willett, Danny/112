Q. How was that out there?  Pretty hot finish.
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, a good finish.  Very stale the first nine holes.  Played all right, eight pars and a bogey and it was just like, here we go again.
Then yeah, just kept pressing and like I say, a few things went my way the back nine.  Got lucky once or twice.  Yeah, polished off with a decent round.
Q. What were your thoughts coming into The Final Series in the position you're in?
DANNY WILLETT: Try and win.  I think it's one of them where if you're in the position we're in, I'm probably in the top 5 and win one, gets up that next level to how much everybody else kind of makes.  My goal was to try and win one, and if not, try to make a hell of a lot of money along the way and see if we can jump Rory.
Q. And have the top players like yourself really got it, what it feels like to be in The Final Series and what can happen?
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, obviously a lot can happen.  It's a strange one because not everyone's playing every event and you're not quite sure who is going to play, who is going to count afterwards.  For us it was just a case of we know we're going to play four, we know we're behind; try and knuckle down and have a good four weeks.
Q. Are you playing all four?
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, we're going to play all four and then obviously a week off and Nedbank.  First thing's first, we have tomorrow to try to score.
Q. What would you like to shoot tomorrow?
DANNY WILLETT: 59 would be good.  It's going to take -- to win, it's going to be something daft but looking at it, no one is really doing anything stupid today.  I think top five at the minute is about 12-under.  It's nice, we've given ourselves a chance to have a reasonable finish from what could have been a pretty average week.
