 Q.  Tough day?  
DANNY WILLETT: Just a long day.  Yeah, tricky out there, obviously stopping, starting, all the weather and stuff.  Hopefully we can get some good weather tomorrow and everyone can get done.   
 Q.  Tough to keep the concentration going, as well.  
DANNY WILLETT: It's tough to kind of get your mind-set, stopping, starting, sitting around in between, you get a bit tired and it's obviously not the warmest place in the world.   
There's a good leaderboard shaping up and they can get it all finished and everything's good to go for a good Sunday.   
 Q.  And still got a chance?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, not too far back.  Thrown a couple of silly ones away, but I think you're going to do that in the conditions that there were.  I didn't make a bogey yet, which is great golf in that weather.  Just get some rest and hopefully come out and have a good day tomorrow.
