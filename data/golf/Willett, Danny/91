 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, not the best start in the world.  A little bit of a scrappy day but four back, and yeah, just a bit of a shame to drop one on the last.  7-under par, going into tomorrow, all to play for.   
 Q.  Game plan for tomorrow?  
DANNY WILLETT: Depends what the weather is going to do, what the wind is going to do, how they set the golf course up.  Today was pretty tricky.  Rory's score out there, very, very good score today.  Depends how they set the golf course up and what the weather does.   
And yeah, I think it's Rory's to lose, really.  I haven't seen the scores, but a three-shot lead or so.  We're going to have to go out there and play clever and play aggressive when we can, and hopefully we can knock a few birdies off and post a good number.
