Q.   A few weeks ago, it was at the Shell Houston Open, and Darren Clarke was describing you as the best young European player, Danny.   How does that confidence from a player like Darren and through your own mind translate itself to a tournament like this when you're playing match play for the first time?
DANNY WILLETT:   I scored, obviously.   It's a little bit easier in this format to kind of trust yourself to a little bit of comfort within yourself because you've only got one guy to beat at a time.
But, yeah, it's been a pretty good feel day so far.

Q.   The American audience might not know Danny Willett or Tommy Fleetwood very well.   But the two of you, from England, will be playing in the round of 8.   What does that say about English golf right now under the age of 30?
DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, there's a few of us in this under the age of 30 just trying to get really established.
