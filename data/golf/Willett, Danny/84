Q. Danny, you are a Masters champion. You must feel pretty good about it?
DANNY WILLETT: It's still not quite sunk in yet. Yeah, it's a great week. It was very special today. Obviously 67, I wasnt quite sure if it was going to be enough, in the end to win by three is pretty special. It's not really sunk in.

Q. Especially with the birth of your child, this must be a magical time for you?
DANNY WILLETT: Its not been a bad last 12 days. Yeah, words can't describe the feelings of what's going on and what we've just accomplished. And this week. I don't know, I'm just going to have to wait and see if it sinks in. 

Q. How crazy was it that you weren't even going to be here, and now shortly they'll be putting a green jacket on your shoulders?
DANNY WILLETT: No, it's mental. 

Q. You're the first European to win in a long time. 
DANNY WILLETT: It's great. Obviously Sandy and Nick were the last two Brits, a long, long time ago. And to follow up with them it's fantastic. They were great champions to win the Masters. And I still can't believe I'm going to be in and amongst them. And in the Champions locker room. It really boggles me. 

Q. When did you realize you were leading what was going through your mind?
DANNY WILLETT: It all happened very, very quick, obviously. We went from behind to obviously two in front. It was all a bit surreal.
