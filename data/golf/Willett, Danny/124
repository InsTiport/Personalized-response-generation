 Q.   You are the third Englishman in a row.   (Inaudible).   
DANNY WILLETT:   Good.   Swung it really well.   Hit some good golf shots, putted nicely.   Missed a couple of short ones in around the middle, which was a shame.   It was a good, solid match.   
   
 Q.   How powerful is it play with momentum?   
DANNY WILLETT:   It's good.   I mean, I kind of feel like it's‑‑ but it's always nice.   You have to feel comfortable in this format.   Everyone is a good player.   It can very easily throw a few birdies at you.   Just keep trying to press, keep trying to press.   
   
 Q.   Did your win last year lead you to believe I can win anywhere if I play well?  
DANNY WILLETT:   I mean, it's like everyone in the Top 64 guys in the world, if anyone brings their A game, they are going to be difficult to beat difficult regardless of who they are up against.   Like I said, we played some good golf.  
   
 Q.   Gary Woodland tomorrow.   Have you played with him?  
DANNY WILLETT:   No, I haven't played with him.   Said hello to him.
