Q. Worked till the last couple of holes --
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, struggled a little bit, Westy was playing really nice and solid.  We just couldn't quite back each other up on all the putts at the right time.
You know, we had it nice through kind of 12 and then J.B. made a great birdie at 13 and we had chances 14, 15, obviously 16 we made birdie, 17, 18.  Just four putts that slipped by.
Q. Westy holed a 30-footer and a 20-footer and it just goes to show how much pressure there is on these smaller, shorter putts at this level in The Ryder Cup.
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, like you say, especially most weeks but this is that little bit extra.  But yeah, it's a shame.  I think we both hit pretty good putts down the stretch.  Obviously the last two, they are pretty tricky where the flag is and it's just a shame with two great golf shots in there and put the pressure on and couldn't capitalize.
Q. You guys have shown some fight already in this match, you're going to have to show some more as we go into the singles tomorrow.
DANNY WILLETT: Doesn't change the job in hand.  The job in hand is to try to win all 12 matches tomorrow.  Looking at the score line, no one is at 14 1/2, so there's a long way to go.
