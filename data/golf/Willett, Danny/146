  Q.  How pleased are you with your round today?
DANNY WILLETT:  Yeah, I played nice again today, made a
few silly mistakes.  And 5, 6, 7, but now in the main place.
Played pretty good.  The course is, again, there for the taking.
It's breezier than when I played yesterday.  Didn't get much of
this wind playing yesterday.  So it's good to get out there and
see what it was like for the boys yesterday afternoon.  The course
is in great condition still, and the wind picks up it's going to
get tougher and tougher.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANNY WILLETT:  Yeah, they've got a couple of things
flags in more normal places.  I think everyone is going to be
happy on 14 and 15.  A lot of people have said -- you can't lose
your concentration, you know, for a second.  And coming up 17,
even second shots in there, you can't just blast 3-wood and it's
going to be all right.  To actually pick your places where you can
hit it, where the pins are, it's tough.  If you whip it into the
left rough there, you've obviously got a tough pitch to a firm
green.  You've got to be thinking all the time.
So like I said, the person who is going to come out top
today is going to be the guy thinking the best and hole a few
putts.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANNY WILLETT:  Yeah, it's been a while actually.  She
has not seen me for a while.  She came up on Thursday.  A couple
of lads came up from Yorkshire.  It's good to have a few people
out there.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DANNY WILLETT:  No, it's nice to have them here.
