Q Danny, can you tell me just your experience this week at Pebble Beach?
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it's been great.  This is back to a real classic U.S. Open style venue that I think the guys enjoy.  Fairway's probably a little wider than the guys were used to back here when they played when G-Mac won.
But a great golf course.  The golf course is in fantastic condition.  USGA did a great job.  You look at the score and still only a couple of guys at double figures under par, and you've got the best guys in the world, then it stretches out pretty quickly after that.
I think if you look at that, if you add the wind, this place would have been a bit of a brute this week if the wind did a pump-up.  I know the forecast was kind of calm all week, but I think they did a much better job of letting guys shoot good scores.  If the wind did pick up, it was going to be difficult, whereas obviously in years gone past, it kind of teetered on the edge of it being a little bit (indiscernible) and then the winds picked up and it kind of got a bit messy.
So, no, I think that if you ask every player this week, I think at the end of the tournament, in 40 minutes' time, the person who's played the best golf and all the putts at the right time will have won.  They've got a world-class leaderboard, as you always do in a major.  I think it's just been a fantastic week.
Q What was your mindset coming in today?  Was there a number that you wanted to shoot?  Was there a way you wanted to play?
DANNY WILLETT: No, we're making some good moves.  There's still a few bad ones in there.  But it's just more rounds under the belt, under pressure, certain ones, certain shots that you're trying to hit.  And we've still got some bad in there, but there's a lot of good.  No, we're just on our own little path trying to do as good as possible.
