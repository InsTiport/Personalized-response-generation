Q. How frustrating was it? You seemed like you were right there going into 17. 
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, no, I mean it was tricky out there, but, no, we had a lot of decent shots out there, I just hit one bad one and got really, really screwed. So, yeah, it was one of those things. But it's tricky out there. If you put the ball in the right spots you can make birdie, as you can see from the scoring between 1st and probably 20th it's probably about 10 shots. So you see the guys at the front page playing well and spreading themselves out a little bit and then everyone else is going around 1‑, 2‑over.

Q. How disappointed are you to not be able to play the weekend?
DANNY WILLETT: It's a bummer. I have a lot of good positives to take from the week and how we played and, but, yeah, just didn't quite fall into place today. You talk about luck, hit a pretty good one on the 18th, gets a bad bounce, goes in the bunker, you get a terrible lie, and it's one of them things that I think if things aren't going your way, they're not quite going your way.
