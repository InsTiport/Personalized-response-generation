 Q.   Do you feel like you played today?   
DANNY WILLETT:   Played all right.   Front half was a little bit scrappy.   I was a little bit scrappy earlier on but seemed to get a good score on the back nine, 2‑under, and hit some really nice shots on the other nine and shot 1‑under there.   It was a very steady day.   Only one bogey out there on the second, which is forgivable.   But all in all, it was a good day's work.   
   
 Q.   How did you find the course?  
DANNY WILLETT:   Pretty good.   The end of the day, it's firming up a little bit.   You can tell it's had a lot of play over the last three days.   But in general, it's a good, fun golf course to play.     Doesn't take driver out of your hands a whole lot.   If you are hitting it straight, you know you can hit driver every hole, and it's what most people want to see.   Will leave you a little bit shorter in, and if you do that and you do that well, there are scores out there.  
Like I said, a good day's work, so hopefully go out and do the same tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Were the crowds good?  
DANNY WILLETT:   They were good.   It was a bit quiet this afternoon later on.   Rory and the other guys were on the other side of the draw to us, so it takes the ridiculousness of everyone out, so it's quite nice.   Getting around in a few groups, it's a little bit too busy but on Sunday, you quite welcome it, because it means you're doing quite well.
