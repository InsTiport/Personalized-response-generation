 Q.  A little bit of a frustrating one for you?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, a little bit.  We didn't really hit it close enough.  We had a lot of putts but they were kind of 20, 25 feet.  On your day, you might have holed a couple of little bonuses in there and found you scraped a really nice score out of it.   
Haven't gone too far backwards.  Haotong has gone deep today, and we're only a couple behind Rosey at 14, so all to play for tomorrow.   
You've still got to hit the good golf shots, even as easy as it can play, you still have to hit the shots and hole the putts.  There's still a hell of a lot of chances out there.  17-under through three rounds is pretty impressive scoring.  You just know that tomorrow, again, same thing, you have to try and stay patient and at the same time hopefully you can get a few birdies in there.   
 Q.  Five shots off the lead but you're at the right end of the leaderboard, nice to be in a Sunday in the final groups and enjoying the good atmosphere.  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it is.  Some nice crowds out there.  There are a lot of British that have come over and supporting Rosey trying to get back to No. 1 and Fleets in his bid to get the Race to Dubai again.  The lads have come over and they are supporting well.   
It's a pretty relaxed week and the weather's been pretty perfect.  Like I said, the golf course is there for the taking which means it's exciting for the guys to come and watch.  It's been a great day so far.
