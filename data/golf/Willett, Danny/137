 Q.   What was the key out there for you?  
DANNY WILLETT:   We just played really steady, 18 greens, 31 putts, really nice round of golf especially in the condition, it's not been cold but just on and off with the rain, we've had rain jacket on and off so everything is a bit wet.   This morning on the rain I'd definitely have take that.  
   
 Q.   A golf course you've felt comfortable on?   
DANNY WILLETT:   I've never done fantastic around here but it's a golf course that should suit my game.   We got it rolling good on the greens today, the front nine, and then hit it really nice on the back nine.   Just it was one of them that was relatively simple issue 65.  
   
 Q.   How much confidence have you taken from your performances in the majors as you head into what is a busy and crucial end of The European Tour season?  
DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, it is.   It's been a good year, really consistent, only missed two cuts by one.   It's been a really, really good year.   We obviously haven't been in contention as what I wanted to be.   
So you just have to really take the positives, keep playing, keep working hard and not get too frustrated when things are not going your way.   I'm playing six or seven events before Christmas, so if you can stay fresh, you can really make a big difference the last few weeks.  
   
 Q.   I'm always a little concerned about you injuryâ€‘wise, are you fully fighting fit right now?  
DANNY WILLETT:   It's all right, yeah.   Last week wasn't great.   It was really, really cold and wet obviously up at the Dunhill but it's miles better from where it was earlier on in the season.   We've not been close to withdrawing at all the last six months, so touch wood, it's kind of gone.
