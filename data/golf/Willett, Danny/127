 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DANNY WILLETT:   It was good.   We knew it was going to be a tough match.   I had a really good warm‑up.   You knew it was going to be good shots, birdies to win.   He holed out on the first for eagle.   And then it was a really close match.   A lot of really good, solid golf out there.   And then a couple of birdies and then hit it stiff on the par‑4, to kind of give a little bit of breathing room.   
   
 Q.   That description of the tee shot was nearly perfect?  
DANNY WILLETT:   No, it was, it was a perfect spot.   
   
 Q.   Sullivan tomorrow, tell me what you know about him.   What do you know about his game?  
DANNY WILLETT:     I haven't played with him much at all.   Amateur‑wise, we were a couple of years apart.   Just going to go out and same game plan tomorrow and see what we can do.
