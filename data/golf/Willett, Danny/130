Q.   Your thoughts? 
DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, it was a little bit trickier today.   We had a bit of breeze and the greens were a little bit firmer.   I didn't play great golf, so 2‑under par is good. 

Q.   Maybe not great golf but a lovely putt near the end there?
DANNY WILLETT:   Yeah, it was just getting out‑‑ a little bit scruffy over four or five holes, a little bit frustrated.   Got a little bit scruffy from 13 onwards.   Yeah, 2‑under par on a day like that, see if we can go on tomorrow. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on your position on the board? 
DANNY WILLETT:   I don't know what it is.   Don't know what the lads are at.   Position‑wise, it looks pretty good.   Shots behind, it looks worse.   We'll just have to shoot a good one tomorrow. 
Keep putting your foot on the gas.   It's going to take a round like 64 and hope he makes a couple mistakes to kind of help you out.
