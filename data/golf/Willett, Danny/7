 Q.  Thoughts on 66?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, it was good. A lot better than yesterday. Real solid. Didn't really give ourselves too many silly things. Had a couple of three-putts in there which was slightly annoying but a nice score to build on over the weekend.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for the weekend?  
DANNY WILLETT: You know what, we're make something good moves. Trying to keep doing the same. Golf course is there for the taking. Going to see a lot of low scores. You've just got to hope that someone doesn't go too crazy over the weekend and hope that you're still in there with a shout with 18 or 9 to play.   
Like I say, at the beginning of the week, it could be at least 20-under par winning this tournament and it's right on track for that. You just have to keep your foot down and keep trying at birdies and see what you can do.   
 Q.  You've added a 66 to a 67. Give us your verdict.  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, really good today. A lot of good, solid golf shots. Kind of playing the golf course as it should be playing. I think take it quite a aggressive on the holes where you can and it's paying off so far. Rolling it well. A couple silly three-putts in there but on the whole it was really good.   
 Q.  How important is experience?  
DANNY WILLETT: Yeah, Sam said, I know it feels like a does or Sunday because the redraw and playing with Rosey and things like that. He knows I can get a bit fiery, and just settles us down a little bit. We're obviously moving well, but yeah, three 5s in a row were pretty annoying, and front edge on 10, as well. We probably let that get to us a little too much and felt like we threw a couple away, but really dug in deep. It was nice, 3-under for the last five holes, some really good looks, as well, a solid way to finish.
