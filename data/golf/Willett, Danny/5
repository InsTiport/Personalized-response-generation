Q. Is 67, is there a sense this could have been a lot better?
DANNY WILLETT: I don't know, we holed a couple of nice long ones and missed a couple of short, medium-range ones. Obviously the last, sad way to finish, but if someone had said 67 at the beginning of the day, we're going to be a hell of a long way back. But nice to have some good rounds under the belt and have a nice finish tomorrow.
Q. Being the defending champion, is it the sort of golf course, you're 8-under, a way back at the moment, can you make up that sort of ground?
DANNY WILLETT: Depends. You probably need it to blow a little bit tomorrow, and then obviously to have a pretty phenomenal round. Probably have to get to 17, 18, so we're talking about a very low one tomorrow.
But like I said, just keep ticking away and if we can get a nice finish out of the week, it would be nice to have a steady defence.
Q. 67, happy with that?
DANNY WILLETT: Steady day's work. Breeze was whipping around again and greens are getting a little bit quicker, a little bit firmer and they try and tuck a few flags. A steady day's work, but too far back to really do anything to challenge for the lead or anything, but we can certainly challenge for a really good finish tomorrow.
Q. What was the difference out there today compared to the other two days? You played well, but there was a big score.
DANNY WILLETT: We drove it better today. Just when it's windy like this and even if you're just in the semi, the rough is not up but just enough to lose control a little bit. Yeah, a few more fairways today gave us option, a few more decent looks, and we took a few. Just a little bit cleaner.
