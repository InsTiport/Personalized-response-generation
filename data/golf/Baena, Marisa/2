MARISA BAENA:  Unfortunately I did not hit the ball very well today and Paula played unbelievable.  I think she was 5  or 6 under going through 14.  I didn't even have any chance to recover.  I mean, she played great and she beat me.  My game wasn't my A Game either, so it was very tough for me.  You know what I tried my best and you know what, that's all I can do.
Q.  Was it tough overcoming yesterday?
MARISA BAENA:  It was.  I wasn't feeling very comfortable the way I was hitting my golf ball and unfortunately I did not hit it solid on the first holes either.  So I think my confidence wasn't there.  I guess I felt like she wasn't hitting the ball so good.
Q.  Are you going to watch on the weekend?
MARISA BAENA:  No, my family is here.  So I'll stay here until Sunday and then heading home Monday.
Q.  Are you looking forward to the next tournament; tough not being here where you're defending.
MARISA BAENA:  Yeah, but you know, my next event will be Evian, so just go home and rest a little bit and hopefully I'll hit it better next week.
