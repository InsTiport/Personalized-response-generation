Q. Just thoughts on today's round; obviously +10 is a pretty good score so far this morning.
SEAMUS POWER:   It's +11 actually, it was even better.  There was one thing wrong on the card.  Yeah, really can't complain.  Got off to a great start.  Got that eagle, which is like two and a half birdies this week, so that was nice, and all day it was kind of in control.  Drove it well, gave myself chances and was able to hit a couple shots close, so overall pretty pleased.
Q. This golf course does give you a lot of opportunities with the two par-5 and a few par-4s.  What do you like about it the most?
SEAMUS POWER:   Like I said, it's a beautiful golf course.  You stand on some of those tees and it's just lined with those tall -- I don't know, pine trees of some sort, I guess.  It's just beautiful, the whole backdrop.  But it's a good test.  The fairways are generous, but then if you kind of get away from it a little bit at all, you're going to find some nasty spots.  I think driving is going to be huge this week.
Q. You've struck some pretty good form.  I think you were top 15 at Rocket Mortgage and now obviously in contention here after the first round.  What have you been doing a little differently that might have led to that?
SEAMUS POWER:   Yeah, I did a lot of work in our downtime.  I knew my chances, I wasn't going to have a lot of opportunities here, so it was nice to play well in Detroit and a good first round here, so I guess it's something to build on, but it is only the first round.
