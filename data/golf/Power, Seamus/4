 Q.  You had the third ace of the week on No. 3.  What was that like for you?  
SEAMUS POWER: Yeah, it was -- I mean, it was obviously fantastic.  I haven't had one for a while.  First one actually on the PGA TOUR, so that's kind of a nice feeling.  It looked good all the way and hit the green -- it seemed to take a while to fall in, but it was a great feeling, just such a surprise.   
 Q.  So early in the morning, but some big roars for you out there.  
SEAMUS POWER: Yeah, I was surprised actually.  There was a great atmosphere out.  I think on the back of the driving range you had kind of a lot of people around, so it was fantastic.  I think it was heard on most of the course, so it was fun.   
 Q.  Tomorrow is St. Patrick's day, and you are Irish.  Anything special because you've got this ace going down then?  
SEAMUS POWER: No, but I think one at 17 tomorrow would be very appropriate on St. Patrick's day, but we'll see.  Yeah, hopefully luck has got to be on my side tomorrow of all the days of the year.   
 Q.  There's only been three aces three times in history, so what does it feel like to go down in history?  
SEAMUS POWER: Yeah, to be a part of it is nice.  I think it would be nicer to be the only one that week, but yeah, that is unusual.  I know there was an albatross on some hole, and there was some hole-out on 5 today.  It's one of those weeks, the hole is just going to attract it in, but yeah, it's nice to be a part of.
