 Q.  First of all, congratulations on that.  It was quite a battle.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Thank you.   
 Q.  You were 2-up.  Did you ever feel comfortable like...  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: No.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: We never felt comfortable.  Have to keep fighting.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: It's never good to feel comfortable.  That's when you know you need to like get your head screwed on again.   
 Q.  You made a big putt on 13 I believe for par to keep yourselves 2-up, but then they won the next two holes.  You probably knew, okay, this is going to come down to the wire.  You knew it was going to be a nail biter.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Oh, yeah.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We just knew that we had to keep it strong, like always press on the gas pedal and just do our job.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yep, that's what's we were saying.  Keep pressing the gas pedal.   
 Q.  This hole is a very difficult hole if you get above it obviously.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yeah.   
 Q.  You also had a great lag putt there.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you.   
 Q.  As you were standing over it, just don't let this get away?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Pretty much.  Just go for par and get as close as I can without blowing it off the green.   
 Q.  And you had two looks on the first playoff hole as well for birdie?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yes.   
 Q.  Again, not easy putts by any means, but...  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: No.  I miss-read my put and then her putt was very slow, so it just didn't work out.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Got it on this one.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: You scared me today, Casey.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yeah, and you scared me.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I was freaking out over the putt.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: She scared me a few times, too, so...   
 Q.  Well you got your personalities down now.  You know what each is going to provide and bring to the table.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
 Q.  You kind of fought through it all.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes, correct.   
 Q.  Do you know your opponents for the final?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes, we do.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yes.   
 Q.  You've played a lot golf against and with them.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Never against them in person.  This is the first time meeting both of them.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I've played with Megan once.  She beat me in a playoff.  Yeah, so that's pretty much it.  I've never really met her other than that.   
 Q.  Thank you for the time and good luck in the final.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you so much.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Thank you so much.
