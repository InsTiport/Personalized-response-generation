Q. Three birdies in a row; how good does that feel.  You started getting the putter going I'm assuming?
MIKA LIU: My putter was on fire.  I didn't expect all my golf holes to go in, but they did.
Q. And then coming out here, what do you think of the course?  Does it fit your eye, because right now you're leading.
MIKA LIU: I like the course.  It kind of reminds me of Lancaster, and I think the setup really suits my driver because I like to shape the ball more.
Q. What else did you do?  Obviously the putter was going.  What else was it about your game today and about the course?
MIKA LIU: I had my dad on the bag, and he's really solid on where to hit and where not to hit, so it's good to have him there by me.
Q. Can you walk us through the last three birdies and kind of tell us what happened?  You got on a roll there.
MIKA LIU: My first two drives I hit it slightly right, but then my iron shots were on point.  I hit it about one foot.  And then the other one over there I had about 10 feet, and I made all my putts.
Q. Were you feeling good coming into the week?
MIKA LIU: Yeah.  I'm feeling good.  Not much different.  I'm just playing golf, enjoying it.  I just want to play a good round of golf and then have a nap and rest.
Q. I ran into you early in the week at CordeValle and you were all excited.  What was the week like for you at the Women's Open?
MIKA LIU: Oh, it was great.  I played fantastic, and I got to play with some great pros, and it was really, really a nice experience.
Q. What's it mean for you to have the low score right now?
MIKA LIU: Nothing different.  I know there are a lot of great players out there, and I shot a good score, but it doesn't really matter.
