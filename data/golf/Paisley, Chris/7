 Q.  Talk us through the hole-in-one on 17.  
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, 17th hole, I was kind of in between a wedge and a 9-iron and, decided to go with a little 9-iron.  Just hit it perfectly and when it landed, I said, go in, and it did.  So yeah, just delighted.   
 Q.  Nice feeling?  
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, great.  Strange, I went 27 holes this week without making a birdie, and I go 3-over par, struggling to make the cut.  And then all of a sudden made a couple of birdies and had a hole-in-one and I was inside the cut mark.  I suppose it shows you, never give up.   
 Q.  How many have you had previously?  
CHRIS PAISLEY: This is my first on The European Tour.  I think that's five in total.  This is definitely the most memorable.   
 Q.  And the prize, 150,000 dollars, what will you spend that on?  
CHRIS PAISLEY: I don't think it's going to be me that's spending it.  My wife's here this week, so I think she'll probably take care of that.
