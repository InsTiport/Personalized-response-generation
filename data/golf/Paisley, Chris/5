CHRIS PAISLEY: Great fun, nice group to play in, great weather, great golf course and I played really well.   Doesn't get any better than that.  Just try and ride the wave.  Obviously the confidence has shot up since last week, and it's been a strange week.  I kind of felt not quite mentally as sharp as last week, maybe a bit tired and frazzled from everything that's happened but my game is there.  Just tomorrow try and give it a go.
Q. Getting into contention for the final round --
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, I was making lots of birdies.  Made eight birdies today.  So just keep doing what I'm doing.
Q. Have you had had a chance to reflect on last week at all?
CHRIS PAISLEY: I haven't been able to celebrate, really.  The first time I really got a chance to think about it was Friday -- Thursday morning.  I was off in the afternoon and had a few hours on my own in the hotel room, and just reading through messages and e-mails and almost got a bit emotional because it kind of hit me, what I had done.
Prior to that, I had been so busy, and also trying to prepare for this week and had a lot going on, almost had not thought about it.  I won last week, and it's a whole new week again, so it's not as if you can enjoy it too much.  I'll play next week and then I've got a week on, so then I'll go see my family and celebrate then.
Q. Nice way to finish on 18.
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, I didn't hit a very good drive so I had to lay up going in, perfect yardage.  My wedges have been really good this week, so I felt really good about hitting it pretty close, and then to have a foot tap-in was really nice.
