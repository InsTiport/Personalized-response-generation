Q. Another good round out there, how was it for you?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Really good.  It was the best I've played so far this week, no bogeys, and just played really well.  Really enjoyed it.
Q. Great way to finish off on the 18th?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Got a good read off Paul right next to me.  I knew the line.  Just had to make sure I got it there and it was a nice one to hole.
Q. Obviously concentrating on your own game but how much can you learn playing with guys like Paul Lawrie?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, fantastic.  I think it's the first time I've played with a past Major Champion.  It was great just seeing how he goes about things and his temperament.  It was definitely a good experience.
Q. Looking forward to heading into the last round?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Absolutely.  Like I said the other day, it's really kind of a nice situation I'm in with having my card and everything.  I'm just going to go for it and see how low I can go tomorrow without having to worry about making a certain amount of money or whatever.  Look forward to it.
