Q. 5-under opening round of 67, how would you assess that?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Played really well.  Really happy with it.  It's a course that suits my eye and I did okay; did well last year.  Game is actually in better shape than what my results have shown, so it was nice to have a good round to show it.
Q. How would you assess conditions?
CHRIS PAISLEY: The greens are beautiful.  Just rolling perfectly.  Obviously weather's great.  It's a good, fun course to play.
Q. Form coming in, not so good, but you've had some good results this season.  Just give us an overview?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, like I said, my results the last kind of month or so haven't been great but last week at the Dunhill, felt like I played really well.  Just had a bad week on the greens.
British Masters, I had a bad start in the first round and then played quite well from then on.  Kind of felt as though there's been a good score in me the last few weeks, I just haven't shown it.  Got the putting sorted out on that weekend off I had, so yeah, happy with how it all came together.
Q. That restore the confidence going into the rest of the week, that round today?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, absolutely.  Even when you're playing well, but not shooting the scores, you still need to shoot a good score to start building the confidence.  To do that on the first day and get off to a great start, it's perfect.
