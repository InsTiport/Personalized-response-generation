CHRIS PAISLEY: I didn't really kind of deserve to, didn't play well enough to win, but to still shoot 4-under and finish fifth I think is a really good result.
Q. How happy with the week as a whole?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Really happy.  Any time you finish, certainly top five, it's a really good week.  Obviously it would have been nice to be a little closer to winning, but considering I didn't have my A Game for most of the week, I'm really happy.
Q. Lots of positives to take out of this week?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Loads, money towards Race to Dubai, and overall it's a good week.
