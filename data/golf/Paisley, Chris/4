Q. 17-under total?  Reflections on today?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, it was obviously a really tough day with the wind, it was obviously going to be a completely different day than the last three.  Got the most out of it, especially on the back nine.
I don't think I've hit that many greens but I was kind of getting them down, holed a really good putt on 17 for birdie.  Also going to be one of those days where it was going to be hard work but I'm really proud of another good finish following up last week.
Q. When you hole a putt like the fourth, did you think something was going to happen today?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Yeah, it was going to be a few feet past, and when it went in, you never know, might be my day.  I saw a few of the boys were playing really well behind, so I knew it was going to be tough to wind.  I knew it was going to be really tough and yeah, I'm happy with how I finished.
Q. Great to take this after last week, as well, great couple of weeks to start the season.  How much confidence do you have heading into the next few weeks?
CHRIS PAISLEY: Absolutely, I know my game is in really good shape.  This week I felt a little bit frazzled mentally but still managed to keep it going.  Yeah, just go play well again next week.
