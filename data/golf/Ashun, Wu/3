 Q.  An opening 67, happy with that?  
WU ASHUN: Yeah, pretty happy today, five birdies and no bogeys.  So it's a nice round today.   
 Q.  What were the key putts to your round?  Was it driving, putting?  
WU ASHUN: I think putting was more important.  You can make a few birdies when you have a good putt.   
The conditions are good here.  They are always good here.  The temperature was nice, perfect, today.  Yeah, if you can hole the putts, you can make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  Obviously lots of home support out there for you, as well.  
WU ASHUN: Yeah, China is my home.  I feel very, very comfortable when I come back and many friends come to watch and fans here.  So very happy and very relaxed here.
