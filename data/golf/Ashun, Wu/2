 Q.  3-under to start this week.  Just overall, assess that round for us?  
WU ASHUN: Yeah, I think 3-under, it's a good start today.  I like the golf course here.  Beautiful golf course.  Some holes are very, very hard, difficult to play.  Even you can make par, you're pretty happy.  So I'm happy to play here, and first round, pretty happy.   
 Q.  Great conditions out there to play, no wind.  Did that help you?  
WU ASHUN: Yeah, today in the morning, it was quite small wind here.  So I think everybody was happy here and quite good conditions right now, yeah.
