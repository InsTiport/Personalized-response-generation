 Q.  How would you evaluate that 68, round one, Scottish Open?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: It was brilliant.  I mean, I've not yet thought about what I could have done better, what I've learned yet, but I'll do that later on tonight.  To get in at 3-under par, playing with these two guys, I'd say it's pretty good.   
 Q.  Mean, taking you back to when the draw was made and you saw it, there would be a lot to think about in the buildup to the round, I would imagine?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, even this morning, all I'm thinking about is that first tee, meeting the two guys.  Luckily I met Rickie on Monday.  But meeting Rory; these are guys I've watched over the years, and Rory winning majors.  So to get put into that bracket for the day was absolutely brilliant.  I'm sure I'll learn a lot.   
 Q.  How were they to play with?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Brilliant.  Two chilled-out guys, chatting all the way around.  It's a day that I'll never forget.   
 Q.  And you must feel delighted, you outscored Rickie, one behind Rory, but just in terms of your own game, you're playing the tournament, and you've done okay.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, that was the idea, just go out there and play your game.  I mean, I tried not to actually watch Rory hit the driver because it would just make me want to try and keep up.  I just kind of said "good shot" because nine times out of ten, it was right down of the middle.  I just tried to do my own thing and I think I've done it well.   
 Q.  Must give you confidence, seeing that you're in this light and worthy of being put in such a group?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, I don't really know what to say just now.  It's still a shock that I managed to put a good score in.  I was worried that I wasn't playing great.  I felt like I played as good as I've played in a while, so I'm happy with that.
