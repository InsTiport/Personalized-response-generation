Q. The sun is shining, it's a fantastic round of golf to kick off your week.  You must be feeling pretty chuffed with things right now?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Yeah, things are going well just now.  Didn't play my best golf.  Off the tee, I was really bad, but managed to get the breaks.  My short game was sharp.  Makes it easier.
Q. Tell me how important this week, and obviously next week is, in terms of your aspirations, when we look at the week after that, The Open Championship?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Yeah, it's links golf, anything can happen.  You don't know what the side of the draw you're going to get, but this week looks like it's going to be pretty good all sides.
These next two weeks are huge, especially next week, being a home open, first time on the European Tour.  I'm sure the crowds will be unbelievable.
I put different clubs into the bag this week.  Might not have needed them this week, but just to prepare myself for obviously The Open, is the big one, but no, things are going well.
Q. How comfortable are you on links golf?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: I played links golf as an amateur; everything's links.  But yeah, the way I play golf is shot-shaping.  With the wind you've got to shape the ball, and go into the wind, try and get it going with it.  I love it.
Q. You've had a great season, a couple of runner-up finishes.  What do you put the success to this year, the quick adjustment from Challenge to European?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: I just think the golf on here suits me more, where it's a premium on ball-striking, more than the short game.  A lot of the events on Challenge Tour, it's sort of a putting competition, and that's normally not the strongest part.  So it's been -- tee-to-green game is the best part, so this is where it's at.
