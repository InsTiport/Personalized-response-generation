Q. Terrific round of 67.  Six birdies, an eagle, a double-bogey, bogeys.  How would you describe it overall?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Eventful.  I played great golf.  Again, I controlled my golf ball I think as good as I have all week.  The wind was up more today.  Yeah, I just -- I was patient, and committed to every shot.  That's something I struggled with last year.  But this year, it's been drilled into me by many people:  Accept what comes.  Just control what you can control.  And it's working well.
Q. How would you describe your level of confidence then right now?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Oh, it's as high as it's ever been.  I'm driving it great.  3-wood, 5-wood, new clubs in the bag, they have been absolutely brilliant.  And I'm striking it.  I really am striking my irons as well as I struck it late last year.  Looking forward to tomorrow and see what it brings.
Q. Despite only being on Tour for a couple years, you've had quite a lot of experience in contention on the final day.  What have you learnt from those experiences that you can put into action tomorrow?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Same as always:  Go for it.  I'm not going to hang about.  I'm going to putt it all on the line whether it's good or bad.  But tomorrow, hopefully it's going to be good and I've just got to enjoy it again.  It's another experience that I want to get, you know what I mean.  It's something that not many people get the chance at my age to do, and it's just -- I'll give it everything I've got.
Q. How exciting to have the opportunity to win a tournament that Tiger Woods has won, Severiano Ballesteros, Ernie Els, Rory McIlroy, on and on and on?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   It would be unbelievable.  Still a long way to go, 18 holes.  I'm just focused on the tee shot off the first tomorrow.
