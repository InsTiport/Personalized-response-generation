 Q.  Wonderful round of 68.  What pleased you most about your play?  
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Patience really.  Stuck to the game plan.  I have the experience, so me and Greg did a good job controlling the crowds and controlling the golf game.   
 Q.  How would you describe the atmosphere, having not experienced something like that before?  
ROBERT MACINTYRE: It was brilliant.  Once I holed the 5-footer on 16, walking off the green with a roar, talking to Greg, going, how cool is this.  You're just not used to it.   
 Q.  How much do these conditions examine the different conditions of the game?  
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Yeah, the weather, whether it's good or bad, you have to get on with it.   
 Q.  Your rookie season.  How has it compared to expectation?  
ROBERT MACINTYRE: I'm doing what I'm expecting myself to do.  I just need to just keep doing what I'm doing and play if I good golf -- I just have to take it as it comes.  Just going to try to stick to what I do and see what happens.
