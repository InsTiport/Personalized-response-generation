Q. 6-up, obviously how were you feeling after that?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Delighted.  First Walker Cup, first game, first point, so it's all good.
Q. You didn't play in the foursomes this morning, do you think that helped your game today?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Yes, everyone wants to play every game, so you just got to be ready when you're called upon.  So getting a point's as good as it can get.
Q. What did you do out there in that event that has made you win with a convincing victory?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Cameron hits it so far, so I knew that before I went out and played him, so I just had to play my own game and just hole putts, because I knew that on that long a golf course you're not going to hit every green.  So just putt well and you win.
Q. That final putt you were talking through with the caddie, what was going through your mind?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Just get it down there in two and if it goes in, it goes in.  But it's just, you hope to hole every putt, but you can't.  So you just give it a good go, give it everything you can, and hope it goes in.
Q. Quite an atmosphere out there.  Have you experienced anything like this before?
ROBERT MACINTYRE: Nothing like this.  I'm from a small town and I think the crowds are as big as the town that I'm from, so it's not, it's a new experience for me.
