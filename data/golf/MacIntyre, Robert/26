 Q.  64, 7-under. Speaking to you a few times this year, you've had a great season, but where would you rank that round in terms of performances in 2019?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: That's up there. I seem to be getting in positions and just letting it fall away, but today, me and Greg have been talking about just staying in the present. Just do what we do, and today, we done that. Managed to get a good result.   
 Q.  Is that just nice little conversations, something you've been working on? What do you mentally say to yourself?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: When I get too aggressive, it actually affects me. So it's just about playing to my strengths and the course kind of suits the driver. So we're just going at it this week. Seems to be working.   
 Q.  Driver's been good and putter has been good. Mark Roe was waxing lyrical about your performance on the greens today. How solid does that putting stroke feel?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: It doesn't feel the strongest it's been all year but it does feel good. It's good to see them going in, but a bit of work to do yet.   
 Q.  Having that great season, amazing consistency. What's the comfort level for you as you try to push on and pick up that victory tomorrow?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: My goal now is just trying to get my mind off trying to win. It's about trying to get as many World Ranking points really, as I can, to try to end the season as high as possible. Everybody knows why they want to end the season high, but the win is irrelevant of what I'm trying to achieve. I've just got to go and play my game, and if the win comes, well, I'm sure I'll celebrate it.   
 Q.  Give us your assessment of how things went today.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, it was good. It went probably as good as it could. I didn't let many shots slip really. Just picked up the shots where I knew I could, and got quite lucky on 10.   
 Q.  Some good shot this week. That must be really pleasing.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, it's not the style of grass that I like. I went to uni in the States, Louisiana, and it's the same kind of grass, so I know how to play it. I'm just trying to play my own game, and if it's good, it's good. And if it's not, go on to the next one.   
 Q.  Did it help that SÃ¸ren was playing well at the same time?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, he was unbelievable early on. He was holing putts from all over the place, chipping in. His long irons were unbelievable. I was just saying to Greg, hold on it to him, and managed to do that and got a few on the way in.   
 Q.  A good result this week can push you towards the Top-10 now in The Race to Dubai. That must be pleasing for you, in your debut season, as well?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, I'm not really looking at the World Ranking now. Just trying to run up that as fast as I can, to end the season really high. Obviously Race to Dubai, if I get into position coming into the last three, you go for gold, don't you.
