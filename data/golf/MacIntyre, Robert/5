Q Perhaps not the final round you were looking for, but can you sum up the week for us and how you feel the season has gone?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Obviously disappointed with the round, but as Mike said coming down the last, we've got to take all the positives.  I mean, from where I was about eight weeks ago, we weren't in a good place on the golf course.  We weren't in a good place mentally.  We weren't in a good place, just all over the place.
We sorted on the golf course, we sorted the mind and here we are at the final event.  I didn't think I would be here if I'm honest with you, after everything that's gone on, but no, I'm delighted with the season.  Obviously disappointed with today, but you get days like that.
Q Obviously you learn a lot through winning, but do you feel you can learn as much from a day like today?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   I don't know.  It's going to take a wee while this, one.  You're trying to fight to win a golf tournament and you finish, I don't even know where I finished, disastrous, but again, I have to go away from this and learn.  I mean, I've played with someone that's an absolute magician around the greens, and that shows if his game's not there, he still gets it around.  That's the level you get to, I know I need to work on to get there.
Q Is it one of those days that the start maybe set the tone?
ROBERT MacINTYRE:   I didn't actually play that bad.  I didn't hit disastrous, I probably hit one bad shot all day and that was the tee shot off 12.  Other than that, I was just out there; the putter didn't show up today.  But we go away from here, have a few weeks off with the family and yeah, come back out in Abu Dhabi raring to go.
