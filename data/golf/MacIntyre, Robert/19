 Q.  Rookie of the Year, we know there's still a day to go. What do you put your performance down to?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, I had a tough day yesterday. Tough finish, really. But today, I just came out -- yesterday I didn't go to the range after. I didn't worry about it. I was a bit disappointed in my round but today I came out, carefree, not having a look over my shoulder for Kurt; we've been playing side-by-side the last two days.   
So today, I could just turn up and play free golf and that's exactly what I've done.   
 Q.  What's the strategy? The gap is ten strokes and you already have the lead over him. How much will you be paying attention, and how much do you allow yourself to look forward to what might be?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: First time I actually looked today was on 17. Halfway to the walk to the green, I turned around and looked at the TV and I seen the scores.   
But I can't worry about what he's doing. I've got to finish as high up on this tournament leaderboard as I can.   
 Q.  Just give us an idea of what something like Rookie of the Year means to you in your own mind.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: It's a great achievement. Once it came in my sight, then that was obviously a goal that we set, and to be in with a shout now, it would mean everything for the season I've had, and it would put a right good stamp for the family, as well.
