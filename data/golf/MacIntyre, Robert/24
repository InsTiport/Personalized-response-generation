 Q.  You must be pleased with that 63.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, just hung in there, missed a few early putts, but good to see some good putts go in there at the end.   
 Q.  Respectable 1-under under par yesterday, but what was the difference out there today? Something you worked on?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: My coach, David, is here this weekend. Last week, I just didn't feel great with the swing but managed to get it around. This week, last hole there today, was probably the best shot this week.   
 Q.  Playing with Patrick, he shot 7-under, how much does that help you along?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, going into the back nine, I was just trying to hang on to the coattails and see how far I could go. It's brilliant to do that and it's an enjoyable round when you see guys holing putts.   
 Q.  Anything you'll change going into the weekend?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Nothing at all. Just stay aggressive. It's a golf course that I can do that, so just going to continue to do that and see where we end up.
