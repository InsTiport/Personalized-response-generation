 Q.  Slow start to the week, a 68 to finishing and another Top-10. How satisfied with your performance?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: It was good. Overall delighted with the way I finished. After the Friday, I thought, oh, no, but worked on a few things on the range on Friday and seem to be working.   
 Q.  We appreciate that you don't like to come to talk about outcomes and the results and where you are in The Race to Dubai, but it's a brilliant race. Rookie of the Year, it's the one thing in your life you get one go at trying to win, and you have a great set up for next week and just ahead of Kurt Kitayama going into the final event. What would it mean to be able to the claim Rookie of the Year title, but also how do you go about adapting your play for next year and the mind-set as well?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I don't know how I'm going to change for next year. That's going to be something to think about on the break. Winning Rookie of the Year would mean everything. That's what you play golf for, for the rewards, and the reward of winning Rookie of the Year I think would be unbelievable.   
But I have another week to go. My game is finally turning from Friday, so we're in good shape heading into next week.
