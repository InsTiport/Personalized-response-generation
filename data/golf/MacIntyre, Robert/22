Q. 69. You seem to have it going quite a lot. Tell us about your round?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, I played great. Thought I was going to be bogey-free, but let a couple slip and quite disappointed with the finish, but still sitting in a nice spot.
Q. Pleased the way it's going?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I have not touched a club the two weeks I was off, so first tee was a wee bit extra, so started with a double (first round) and now sitting here in a good position and hopefully get going on the weekend.
Q. How much preparation do you need on a golf course you've never seen before?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, I think the big thing this week was the greens for me. Coming from wintertime, greens are slow, so trying our best out there and greens are running about 12, so it's not easy. But we're getting there.
Q. Some friendly faces out here?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, it's good. I think everyone's dragging each other on. I'm not sure how many actually kept their card this year, but there's a fair few of us. It's good to see familiar faces. Not just for the competitive side in the practice rounds, but you can play with the boys. It's been good.
Q. On Monday, would you have taken a tied for 10th after two rounds?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I would. I would. But a bit disappointing today, but overall, I'd take it.
