  Q. It's called moving day and that's exactly what you've done today, a brilliant 66.  What was the secret to that performance?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Yeah, same as the last couple of days, hit a lot of greens, driving it well.  Today I holed a few putts again.  That's the difference in my game.  I normally hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways.  If the putter is there, then there are good scores, and if it's not, then what happens yesterday, level par.  But game is feeling great, looking forward to tomorrow.
 Q. You're in that final group yesterday when you went out on the golf course, nice place to be, final event of the year, didn't go according to plan.  How easy was it to reset and how important was the safe you made at the end yesterday?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   It was huge, gave me a different attitude going into today.  If I drop a shot there, I'm disappointed but making a 5, felt like a birdie the position I was in.  I know what it feels like to be in contention.  I've had a few last year.  Just looking out there and sticking to what I can do and see where I end up.
 Q. I'm not going to try and make you move ahead too far, but enjoying fact that opportunity, if things go your way, to perhaps follow in the steps of Colin Montgomerie who did it many times before.  What would it mean to be able to say you're European No. 1?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   It would mean everything, not just to me but my whole time, my family.  But I've got a job to do, as you said.  I can't look too far ahead.  Keep could go what I'm doing.  If it's good enough, it's good enough.  If not, well, then I've been beaten by a better man.
