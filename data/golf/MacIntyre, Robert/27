 Q.  Thoughts on the final round?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: A bit disappointing. Finished with bogey on 17. Parred 18. Another under-par round. Today I just felt like I had it going. Just disappointed today.   
 Q.  Was there a reason for that bogey or just one of these things out there on the golf course?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Didn't really -- well, just a mistake. You can't keep doing it. So just got to go away from here and learn how not to keep doing it.   
 Q.  The positive from that, if you know what you're doing wrong, you can try and fix it.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, exactly. That's all you can do in golf. I feel like I'm playing great still. I just finished in the middle of the pack this week, but I feel like I should have been knocking on the door again, but it just wasn't to be this week.   
 Q.  You're new to the professional game and learning. What have you taken from these four days, we talked on Friday, the special element of this tournament and how much you've enjoyed that. As a professional golfer, what have you learned?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I have to be patient. Every week it's the same. Be patient. Same this week. Links golf, you never know what the weather is going to do and today is was a wee bit tougher. Just be patient out there and enjoy yourself.   
 Q.  As a Scotsman playing here, the iconic golf course?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I loved every bit of it, Kingsbarns, Carnoustie and here. To be here Sunday with my playing partner is something I dreamed of.
