Q. Talk about what occurred today.
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Just putting.
Q. Can you give examples of a couple to give highlights.
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Missed a 7-foot on the last.  Missed a 3 1/2-foot on 15.  The game is there, just the putting is not.
Q. Before you started you would have taken that, but you'll still be happy with that, but sort of mixed feelings?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah, there's a few things that I've been not happy about today.  And coming down the last I wasn't happy with the one on 17.  Not just with me.  I played great overall tee to green, but just disappointing finish.
Q. What happened?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Playing partner doesn't shout "fore."  The ball is going in the crowd.  We're shouting "fore," the ball is coming down.  We're shouting as it's coming into the crowd and he's just standing watching it.  People don't have enough time to react after we shout.  It hits Greg, my caddie's, mom.  And so I told them how it was.
Q. You told them?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I said I wasn't happy.  And they -- I didn't really like the response.  He's the only one I've seen.  Straight in the crowd.  It was in the crowd from the word go.  And we expect them to shout "fore."
Q. And it hits Greg's mother?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah.
Q. Is she okay?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: I think she's all right.  It's not what you want.
Q. That kind of unsettles everybody.  Were they harsh words?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: It wasn't too pleasant.  But you've got to tell them.
Q. He didn't take it well?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: He didn't take it well at all.  That ball was going straight in the crowd.  From the word go, it's going in the crowd.  Just shout, simple as that.  Us, too, shouted as it was coming down, but you don't have time.  It's too late then.  People are diving out of the way of things when they should have more time.
Q. Guy who hits it has got to shout?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Yeah.
Q. Goal for the weekend?
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Keep doing what I'm doing.  Hopefully the putts drop.  Keep patient.
