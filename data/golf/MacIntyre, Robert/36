 Q.  Fantastic fourth round, what way a to finish, eagle, birdie.  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Stuck to the game plan.  Doubled early, doubled the second.  My caddie said to me, just be patient.  Really this week was probably the best I've hit my irons.  I hit them much better this week.  I struggled a bit off the tee.  I thought, I just had to hang in.   
 Q.  Great British Masters week, incredible fans, the weather's come out and the fans.  Is this the kind of week you dream of coming off The Challenge Tour?  
ROBERT MacINTYRE: Oh, for sure.  Today on the 16th tee, I looked back and thought, this is what it's all about.  The fans were brilliant.  Tommy was great, as well.
