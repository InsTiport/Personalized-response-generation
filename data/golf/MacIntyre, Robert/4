  Q Obviously not the victory you were hoping for but you battled all the way the to end.  Give us your reflections on the day?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   That's what I do, I fight till the end.  It was the start I was looking for.  I thought, here we go.  Sometimes it doesn't go for you, and today was one of them days.
 Q How valuable are experiences like this though in your development as a player?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   Yeah, not right now, it's not learning anything, but when I go away, I'll learn a lot.  But I felt like I gave one away there today.
 Q Third-place finish does win you a lot of World Ranking points and as far as I can see with obviously the projections and the way things might go in America this evening, you will be in the Top-50 in the world, potentially; therefore, invitation to the WGC MÃ©xico, THE PLAYERS Championship and your first Masters.  How excited about that?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   It would be unbelievable, but again, it's not done till the 25th of March and I have a lot to do.  I just have to keep giving myself chances.  Like today, if I keep giving myself these chances, then I'm going to bundle over the line again at some point.
 Q A word for Paul Casey today?
 ROBERT MacINTYRE:   He was brilliant.  Again, he stuck to his own game.  He played great.  He controlled himself.  I've just got to look up to that and see what I can get to.
