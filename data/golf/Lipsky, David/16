Q. What are your thoughts?
DAVID LIPSKY: I played well today.  I shot bogey-free 4-under.  If at the start of the day, if you told me I would have shot that, I would have taken it.
But obviously Thomas played really well coming down the stretch and hats off to him.  I'm pretty happy with my round.
Q. Fantastic at one point, I think there were four of you at the top of the leaderboard and lots going on below; emphasised what a fantastic weekend it's been?
DAVID LIPSKY: Definitely.  Himmerland makes a great stage for tournament golf, and it showed it.  Down the stretch with those closing holes, the best player won this week. It was fun.
Q. Good form going into an event that's very close to your heart, one you won two years ago at Crans Montana, so you'll be looking to carry on this form next week?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, definitely.  I finished sixth last week and third this week, so hopefully I can jump up three places again.
Q. How did rain delay affect you; sitting around for four hours is not ideal.
DAVID LIPSKY: No, it isn't.  There's a lot of uncertainty, like are we going to finish, what are we going to do. I ended up all right and I actually came back out and made some birdies after I didn't have any momentum earlier going on.
