 Q.  A fine round of 70, you're up to 5-under, how much did the weather change?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Definitely on the back nine the wind picked up.  When we started off, there wasn't of of a greens and nice scoring conditions, and the wind picked up and the greens started firming up a bit.   
 Q.  A lot of talk about how difficult and challenging the greens are.  How did you find them?  
DAVID LIPSKY: They are so tough.  I mean, if you're on the wrong side of these ridges, it's always a tough two-putt.  It's tough getting close to the pins.  It's tough -- everything's tough about it.  It's just managing your way around the course.   
 Q.  Great two-putt on the final green.  
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, I think it broke ten different ways.  That's such a tough hole.  With the wind where it was today, you're almost start in the water close to the pin -- I'd take par on that hole every day.   
 Q.  Overall, happy with where you're positioned now because it looks like the wind is going to get stronger in the afternoon?  
DAVID LIPSKY: I'm really happy with where I'm at.  I played great today and I dropped a few shots yesterday coming in but made up for it today so looking forward to the weekend.
