Q. Your thoughts on your score out here?
DAVID LIPSKY: I played pretty well today.  I left a few out there coming down the stretch, but overall I'm really happy with how I played and gave myself lots of chances for birdies today.
Q. Did you think anything was possible the way you started today, got off to a bit of a flyer?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, it was going nice.  Hitting it close and holing putts, and I just kept it going throughout the day and I think I only really missed like one or two greens today.  So other than that, it was pretty good.
Q. Did it help that Bernd Wiesberger alongside you was playing equally as well?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, exactly.  Me and person and Pablo are good friends.  It was a nice, relaxing group and we all played pretty well.
Q. What was your attitude at the start of play knowing ThorbjÃ¸rn was so far ahead?
DAVID LIPSKY: It's sort of like without ThorbjÃ¸rn, it's a good tournament.  I just thought, look at second place as winning right now.  That was my goal is to just put myself in position on Sunday to finish as high as I can.
Q. Clearly you have already got a huge prize courtesy of Switzerland but the prize money on offer here, it's astronomical, isn't it?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, The Final Series is great and to play well here really sets you up for The Race to Dubai.  Good week here and we'll see what happens.
Q. Is money ever on your mind or just the best finish possible?
DAVID LIPSKY: It always is, but best finish possible.  That's what I've got to say.
Q. What do you reckon now into the final day?
DAVID LIPSKY: My game is pretty good.  It's been getting better each and every day, so I'm really looking forward to see what happens tomorrow.
