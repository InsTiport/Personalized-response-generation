 Q.  Thoughts on shooting a 66 on moving day?  
DAVID LIPSKY: It was really good.  I took advantage of my opportunities today and hit the ball well.  I hit the ball terrible yesterday, so it was nice to see some solid shots today.   
 Q.  That back nine was interesting, as well.  Slipped up, but got it all back together.  
DAVID LIPSKY: Rub of the green.  I hit a tree and lost the ball and not sure what happened to it but made up for it with a long eagle putt.  So can't be too mad.   
 Q.  What's the story of the week, because you started very neatly and then it didn't seem to happen for you on the second day?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Like I said, lost my ball-striking yesterday and I scrambled really well to keep myself in it, and when you do that, going into the weekend, anything can happen.  I played well today and set myself up nicely.   
 Q.  How was the course this afternoon, because if anything, we've seen some really good scores during the early part of the day, and a little bit tougher as the afternoons wore on?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, the greens are definitely getting firm and fast, so you have to control your ball coming into some of these pins.  With where they cut the pins this week, you have to be on the right side of the holes.  I did that well today and we'll see what we do tomorrow.   
 Q.  When you look at that leaderboard, what do you fancy for tomorrow now?  
DAVID LIPSKY: I got myself in position and got myself closer to the lead and that's all I can ask for.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.   
I'll give it my all tomorrow, nothing to lose, really.  I'm looking forward to it.
