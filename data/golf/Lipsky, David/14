Q. How was it out there for you?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, it was really good today.  I had it going on the front nine.  Hit the brakes a little bit on the back nine but finished strong with a birdie on 17, so happy with my round.
Q. How is the course playing?
DAVID LIPSKY: Easy, as you can see by the scores and what the cut has moved to.  With the soft greens and the no rough, guys are just taking advantage of it out here.
Q. Great position going into the weekend.  How are you feeling for that?
DAVID LIPSKY: My game is in good shape, holing putts, which is always good when it's a birdie-fest, so I'm looking forward to it.
Q. Obviously a bit of rain coming, soften up the greens, so maybe a bit more target practice on the weekend?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, you can throw more darts out here.  It will be fun and it's going to be a shootout and I've just got to get ready for that.
Q. How will you prepare for that?
DAVID LIPSKY: Just stay aggressive.  It's not too often where you're aiming at pins with mid- to long-irons, and this is one of those courses.  Just going to get ready for that and work on that and see what happens tomorrow.
