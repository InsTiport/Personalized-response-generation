Q. 67, how was that for you today?
DAVID LIPSKY: It was really good.  I played very solid.  I was a little rusty after taking two weeks off, and each day I've been getting better and sharpening my game, so I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. The birdies between 7 and 10, you had a few?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, I just hit some really good shots down the stretch.  I don't think I had more than ten feet for birdie on any of those holes.  Definitely good ball-striking day helped me out, especially a little windy, greens are firming up.  So I definitely hit the ball well today.
Q. Nearly made a nice up-and-down on the last to get to double figures, just missed the putt?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, it's a tricky putt.  It goes up and over a ridge.  It was a tough bunker shot, a long bunker shot with water behind it, so that's always scary.  Gave myself a chance and I hit a good putt, and that's all you can do.
Q. Happy with your position going into Sunday?
DAVID LIPSKY: Definitely.  I'm right around the lead.  We'll see what it gets to later on in the day, but I'm there, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.
