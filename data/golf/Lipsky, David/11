 Q.  Good tournament but final round perhaps.  
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, it was frustrating.  Today and yesterday, I hit it really well and I didn't really get the putts to drop, which I didn't get any momentum going.  But you know, it is what it is, and that's all I can do is give myself opportunities.   
 Q.  Is that one of those where you go away and then you look at that leaderboard and think, that's a good week?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, at the end of the day it's a good week.  Going into the event, if you had told me that I would have finished sixth, I would have taken it.  It sets myself up for Dubai.  I'm pretty happy about it.  That's my goal, just to make it to Dubai and looks like I'm making my way there.   
 Q.  With all the ranking points and prize money on offer, this is a terrific week, isn't it?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Definitely.  Overall I'm really happy with my game and I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.   
 Q.  As you played alongside the man who has won this tournament, do you have an appreciation of how he's played?  
DAVID LIPSKY: He's playing great.  He's holing putts when he needs to and hits clutch iron shots.  He deserved it this week.
