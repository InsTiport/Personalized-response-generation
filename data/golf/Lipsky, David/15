 Q.  Very well played, tell me how pleased you are with that start here in Portugal?  
DAVID LIPSKY: It was really good.  7-under is great.  It's my first time here and second time playing a full round of 18 around this course, so I'm pretty happy with that one.   
 Q.  A lot of players talk about the vibe here this week, obviously high-pressure for a lot of players on the bubble, but you're not in that situation, 64 in The Race to Dubai.  What's the general feeling for you here this week?  
DAVID LIPSKY: You know, after the last couple weeks in England and Scotland, where it was really cold, I'm enjoying the sun.  So I'm very relaxed this week.   
 Q.  I mentioned your position Race to Dubai, to be 60 make it through The Final Series, how much is that in the forefront of your mind?  
DAVID LIPSKY: Definitely, as of now I'm into the first couple of The Final Series and a good tournament here would really help my cause to make it to Dubai.   
 Q.  When you look at playing conditions this morning, how much can you go out there and be aggressive and attack, and knowing what this course has produced, last year was 23-under?  
DAVID LIPSKY: It's one of those courses where there's a low score out there, especially with the soft greens this week.  You can just fire at all the pins and not really have any penalties.  You have to be aggressive out here to go low.   
 Q.  What would you say is the strength of your game?  What worked particularly well today?  
DAVID LIPSKY: I holed a lot of nice putts coming in on the back nine.  I didn't get anything going on the front and luckily got some momentum, three in a row, so that really helped.
