Q. What are your thoughts on the week as a whole?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, played well here.  Finished top five.  Love the course.  Pretty good week.  I'm really happy.
Q. A lot of pride the way you stayed and stayed in there right till the death?
DAVID LIPSKY: To be honest I didn't play great today.  Hats off to Sam, who played well and won.  I didn't take care of business today, and that's all right.  I played hard, and what happened, happened.
Q. You say playing hard; the last hole, was that indicative of that?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, I knew I had to try to make a birdie there to give myself a chance.  I had to take it on.  You don't get too many opportunities like that.  Unfortunately this time, it didn't work out for me but hopefully they pan out in the future.
Q. Not a bad way to start the season for The European Tour; presumably a break and regenerate for next year?
DAVID LIPSKY: I'm in good position going into the Desert Swing, so I'm pretty happy with the way things went.
