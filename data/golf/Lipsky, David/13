DAVID LIPSKY: Bogey-free, 65, 6-under, I played great, and that's all I can do.
Q. Top five, that's even better?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, going into the week, I just wanted to move myself up on The Race to Dubai and get myself in that Top 60, so this is definitely helping my cause.
My game is in good shape, so I'm looking forward to The Final Series.  Hitting it well and putting it well, so I'm really confident going into this last stretch.
Q. Just got to prep for Turkey?
DAVID LIPSKY: Exactly.  I'm just going to get ready for those events and see what happens.
