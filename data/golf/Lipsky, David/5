Q. How would you assess your round today?
DAVID LIPSKY: Oh, I played great.  I mean, it was tough out there.  It was really tough with that wind, and the rain started coming down.  The fairways are really firm.  I played really well today.  Really happy with it.
Q. You got off to a great start.  Take us through that.
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, I almost holed it on the 1st hole, and two-putt birdie on the next, and that sort of got my round going.  Quick starts always help, especially in these conditions.  Birdies are hard to come by.
Q. Bogeys at 4 and 6, but you bounced back, two more birdies to get back to 4-under?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, it's a tough course, to be honest, with this wind, especially those holes back into the wind.  It's going to happen.  I fought through and made some putts and hit some good shots.  So pretty happy with it.
Q. Does that give you a lot of confidence to be able to piece together such a good score given the conditions today?
DAVID LIPSKY: Yeah, definitely.  I've been playing terrible.  So to get this round going really helps me going.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.  I've figured some stuff out, so yeah, I'm pretty excited.
