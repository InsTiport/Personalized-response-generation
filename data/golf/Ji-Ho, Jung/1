Q.   Minus three today, and minus one yesterday, how would you rate the last two days? 
JUNG JI‑HO:   So actually yesterday's game went really well.   Today I think my shots were a bit unstable, but I think I was able to make up for my shots by putting very well and I think my short game was very strong today. 

Q.   What are your thoughts about the weekend, going into the weekend? 
JUNG JI‑HO:   So the course here is very tricky, so instead of playing aggressively, would I like to play more steady and stably, and every time a chance comes up, I'll try to grab that chance.

Q.   How do you feel heading into the weekend as the leading Korean?
JUNG JI‑HO:   So if I think that, you know, I'm representing the Korean team, I think it will put too much pressure on me. 
So I just hope to enjoy the game in a very relaxed manner.
