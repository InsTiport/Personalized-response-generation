 Q.   So one question.   Keep it simple.   Went a bit downhill today.   
MICHELLE KOH:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.   In the beginning it was a little ‑‑ it was very just, you know, pars and pars and pars and pars, then after that a birdie came along.  
As I took the turn after nine holes, I don't know, my focus wasn't very sharp today.   
Doesn't matter.   Another day tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)   
MICHELLE KOH:   (Indiscernible) I had a two‑shot penalty.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
MICHELLE KOH:   I came out of the (indiscernible) and I missed my shot to the right.   So I took a right, and I don't know, I guess because I was already behind.   (Indiscernible.)  
Q.(Indiscenible.)  
MICHELLE KOH:   Because of the right, yes.   Very expensive, right.   Yeah.
