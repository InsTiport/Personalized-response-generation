  MICHELLE KOH:   I will take it.   I've got to say I got a little bit technical on the golf course in the beginning.   Had a good start, but I sort of started leaning into the technical side, so I was hitting it bad in the middle, saved a few strokes, got the comeback, and hit it good.   Didn't make as many birdies as I would like, gave myself opportunities.   Going to bring it to the next couple of days and sink another extra few birdies.  
   
 Q.   You had a very exciting first nine and a mixed back nine, very quiet back nine.   
MICHELLE KOH:   Very quiet, yes.   I'm giving myself a lot of opportunities, hitting it on the green, hitting it pretty decently close, and I just have to go out tomorrow and maximize on the opportunities.  
   
 Q.   You had a couple of bogeys on the day.   
MICHELLE KOH:   They were just really technical thoughts because right now I'm still working on my swing.   Everything is still pretty new, and trying to bring it out to the golf course, trying to move from the technical side to the playing side.   I guess I got a little bit carried away this morning.  
   
 Q.   You said you were really calm on Tuesday.   Did you start feeling a bit of the nerves today?  
MICHELLE KOH:   A little bit.   A little bit.   I've got to say, last night as I was going to bed, I was thinking like, oh, my gosh, the first day already; what's going to happen.   Then I told myself it's just golf.   You've just got to go out there, do your best and see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   Will you switch anything for tomorrow?   
MICHELLE KOH:   Yes, I've got to make more birdies.   I've got to make more putts.
