 Q.  Your overall thoughts on the campaign?  
MICHELLE KOH: It's been a long week.  It was really not the week I was looking for, hoping for and looking forward towards.  But what's done is done.  Just got to keep working and moving forward and keep improving myself.  There's a lot more out there to look forward to.   
 Q.  What's the biggest takeaway from this week personally?  
MICHELLE KOH: I think I have to learn how to handle expectations.  I think being an ambassador here, being given the opportunity and the privilege of playing and practicing here, I might have overdone it a little bit.   
So that created a lot of expectation this week, and I believe that was the biggest downfall for my week.   
 Q.  What's next after this?  
MICHELLE KOH: After this, I will be going to Sanya for the co-sanctioned event.  That's in two weeks.  Then I finish off the year in Taiwan, so that's another -- I think that's a co-sanction, or that's another Taiwan event.  Just another two, three events and end my season.   
 Q.  What frustrated you the most this week?  
MICHELLE KOH: I think not hitting the ball as good, because I was really hitting the ball good coming into this week.  I think it's just the expectations.  Tension ruins the most beautiful swings and I think that's kind of what happened to me this week.  I struggled out there and I was hitting it awful, but thank God for my chipping and putting, really.  My short game helped me out a lot this week.  So I've got a lot to be thankful for in my short game.
