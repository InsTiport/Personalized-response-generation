   Q  An interesting day and you're still right in there. 
 SIMON WAKEFIELD:  Yeah, it's obviously a bit tricky.  Yesterday was just the same really.  It was, you know, wind was sort of consistent.  Got off to a really good start, 1-under after nine, and bogeyed 10 and 11 really, and then missed a short one on 12, which sort of knocked the wind out of my sails.  A good birdie on 16 and two good pars to finish, so overall, very pleased. 

 Q.  How was it playing with the crowd here?  Obviously there's a favourite out there. 
 SIMON WAKEFIELD:  Yeah, they are very knowledgeable with golf and everything, so they were applauding me, as well, and obviously not as much as Padraig, but what do you expect. 
 I've played with Ernie and we had crowds in China that were fantastic, so I knew it was going to be a big day.  I thought I handled it quite well. 

 Q.  You enjoy being in the thick end of these things, really, playing with the big stars? 
 SIMON WAKEFIELD:  Yeah, I've sort of grown up with David Gilford.  So trying to beat David on a weekday at Trenton Park has always been difficult, so I've sort of grown up with playing against David. 
 But it's nice to play with Padraig.  I think it's first time I've played competitive golf with Padraig.  I played a practise round in Brazil in 2000.  But yeah, it's nice to play with the big guys. 

 Q.  And what are your thoughts heading out tomorrow?  You're only three back. 
 SIMON WAKEFIELD:  I don't really know to be honest.  I've not looked at the forecast, so I don't know what the weather is going to be like.  But you know, at the end of the day, I'm just going to go out with a level head and do the same as I've done today.
