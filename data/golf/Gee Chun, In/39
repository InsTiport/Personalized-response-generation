IN GEE CHUN: I asked more help my caddie, and we had good teamwork on the course.
Q. How were the conditions today versus yesterday?
IN GEE CHUN: The conditions were really good here.  Just wind was the same direction.  Yeah, I think conditions were really nice.  Then I was surprised how many people come out here.  I know Canadian people like the sport.  I really like it and appreciate it.
Q. You finished second a couple of times this year.  How motivated and excited are you to maybe get that first victory this year?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I made a lot of seconds this year, but I think it was a good memory for me and good experience.  So I think I'm ready to win.
Q. You said the greens were hard to read or bumpy?
IN GEE CHUN: Hard to read.  Yeah, it's my problem.  The greens start break consistent here.  It's just my problem.
Q. How are you going to relax or prepare for tomorrow?  Will you do anything different?
IN GEE CHUN: No, I will try the same.  I really enjoy to play on the course, so I really like playing in Canada.  So just enjoy everything.
Q. Did you miss a lot of short putts today or you had long ones that you just missed?
IN GEE CHUN: Just before hitting, I had hard to see the putting line, so I asked my caddie, and he picked good lines.  I trust my line and make it.
