 Q.  How proud are you of how you played today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, did I make another bogey-free round, and then I think it was great round today.   
But Stacy play was good, too.  I really enjoy play with Stacy.  I know Stacy have a little hard time before, so I want to give to her big congratulations.   
And then that's it.  I want to try and keep going.  My goal.   
 Q.  Does this bring momentum going to Evian?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yes, of course.  Because before British my mind was not normal.  I think almost back to normal.   
Now I can enjoy more my golf, so I'm ready to go to Evian, yeah.
