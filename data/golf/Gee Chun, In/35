 Q.  You were right there in the thick of contention.  Victory not there for you, but you've got to be pretty pleased with how you played today.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yes, I didn't make win, but during this week my shot was not good, so I think it was great finish for me with those shot.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  What was it like playing in that last group?  The three of you are so popular here in Korea and we have record crowds today for this tournament.  
IN GEE CHUN: Sung Hyun and Jin Young both are famous player in Korea.  It was great to all the fans.  I think they really enjoy watching her play.   
So I really enjoy too.   
 Q.  What can you say about Jin Young's performance today?  She was the overnight leader; she made two bogeys in the first three holes; she came back really strong after that.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yes, I play with Jin Young yesterday.  Her shot was really good.  Today is good, too.   
Just her play was good, so I'm just saying congratulation to her.   
 Q.  I think most fans would've expected Sung Young to win today.  She's the world No. 2 and she had the lead for a while, yet Jin Young stayed very composed, very confident.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yes, so this event is her sponsor event, so her fans want to she make win.   
But Jin Young play really well.  It's golf.  Just say congratulation to her.
