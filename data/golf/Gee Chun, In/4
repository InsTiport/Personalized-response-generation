  Q. What part of your game do you think you've been really working on coming up to this event?
 IN GEE CHUN:   Yesterday I said I would be patient because after three weeks off.  This week I try just enjoy my play, enjoy to see all my friend on the tour.  That makes me happy.  Then look forward to play on the course.
 Q. What's your goal going into the weekend?
 IN GEE CHUN:   I really want to try to make bogey-free round next two days.  I will try.
 Q. Last question is:  What do you think would be a really good final pairing?  Who do you want to play with on Sunday?
 IN GEE CHUN:   You know, even if I play with my best friend it's really good, but if I play with new people then I have a chance to get to know the person.  So I really enjoy to play with anyone.  Yeah.
