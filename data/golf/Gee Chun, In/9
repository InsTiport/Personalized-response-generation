Q. Impressive finish.  You must just be feeling such a huge high coming off another win from last week.  What's going on in your mind right now?
IN GEE CHUN: I'm just really happy, because before this week, I won 13 times in professional tournaments.  I'm glad that I'm finally done with the No. 13.  I hated this number.  I just want to say thank you to my sponsor, KB Financial Group, LG, SAP and ISPS Handa, PING, Srixon and Nike.  I just cannot say thanks enough to them for their belief in me.  I think they are winners in golf and I really appreciate it.
Thanks to HanaBank for this wonderful tournament, and I really want to say thanks to the greenskeepers and SKY 72 for their wonderful job this week.
Q. What was the hardest part of not getting a win these past two years?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I had a little tough time but I just keep trying and trust by myself.  When I made a win from last week, everyone says, this is a really good turning point for you.  I'm really happy to what they said, but also I had a lot of pressure from there.  I really want to show them everything.
Q. You must be so thrilled.  What was it like playing in such a fantastic crowd?  They love you to death, and your golf was so good.
IN GEE CHUN: Today, my play was really well, because I really want to make win from here.  Before this week, I won 13 times as a professional, and I am glad that I am done with the No. 13.  I really hate that number.
I saw, 10/14 today, and it's still 13, and then I made 14 wins, so really happy.
Q. Only two double-bogeys early, but then the rest of your golf, you must be really happy with your play.
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, first two days, I made two double-bogeys, and I made one bogey in the third round.  When I made a bogey on No. 10, I just believed that I'm done for no more bogeys today, and then tried to focus on the other eight holes and I did.
