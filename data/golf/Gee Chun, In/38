Q. Another top 5 finish.  How did you feel out there this weekend?
IN GEE CHUN: I really enjoyed this week.  Today is Sunday, so a lot of spectators come out here.  I really like their support for the players.  I really appreciate it.  So Sung Hyun had a really good round today.  But I don't know, my game was not really bad, so I'm happy for her to win this week.  I'll just keep going to next week.
Q. Did you know on 18 that you needed to make eagle to tie?
IN GEE CHUN: Yes.
Q. You seemed to do very well in Canada.  At Manulife you finished second here and had a very strong showing.  What is it about Canada that you really enjoy?
IN GEE CHUN: I think all the Canadian people like golf and sports.
Q. What are your thoughts on their support for Brooke?
IN GEE CHUN: Brooke?  It was amazing.  Yeah.
Q. Could you hear or see what was going on ahead of you?
IN GEE CHUN: Oh, yeah, I could hear on the course.  It was amazing.  So now I'm really missing for my club in Korea, playing in Korea.
Q. You're looking forward to Evian in a couple weeks?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I'm going to next week first, and then week off before Evian, and then going to Evian.  Because also I like Canada, but also I like the Evian too.  So I'm really excited to go there.
