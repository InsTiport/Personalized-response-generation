  Q. Still a wonderful round here third round.  How do you feel after your third round today?
 IN GEE CHUN:   I had my ball finish on the lip of the hole three times.  It was my game today, but it was one of those days, so I'm already looking for tomorrow.  Yeah.
 Q. It wasn't any of our days because no one was expecting the rain.  Were you anticipating the rain?
 IN GEE CHUN:   Yes.  When I check weathercast maybe had chance to get rain a little bit, so I brought all the rain gear.  Yeah.
 Q. How did you play in the rain?
 IN GEE CHUN:   It was not really heavy rain, so it was okay.  Yeah.
 Q. And then last question:  What is your game plan for the final round tomorrow?
