  Q. Take us through this second round here today; what was the rebound like for you after the two bogeys in the beginning?
 IN GEE CHUN:   Oh, I just tried to make good concentration after the two bogeys.  Just kept trying to enjoy to play golf because I want to have a lot of fun from out there.  That's it, yeah.
 Q. How important is it for you to remain patient out there when something like that happens in your round?
 IN GEE CHUN:   I think staying in the present is really important for golf, because it's already gone.  So I tried to forget the missed shots from the last hole and the last shot.  I kept patient with the shot I had, so my target was my goal every time.
 Q. What was the ending like for you today?  How do you think you fared in these type of conditions?
 IN GEE CHUN:   Conditions, like weather?
 Q. Yeah, what was the weather like for you today compared to yesterday?
 IN GEE CHUN:   We played in the morning today, so we got a little cool air at the beginning.  It was nice.  I was happy to play with Haru, so I had a great yesterday and today.
 Q. Does that make it for fun when you're paired with someone like a friend like Haru?
 IN GEE CHUN:   Sure.
 Q. What is there to work on going into tomorrow?
 IN GEE CHUN:   So I heard the temperature is going up tomorrow, so try drinking a lot of water and trying to enjoy the nature sound out there.
