Q. After last week, was it easy to put that aside and get back into the mode of playing, or were you still kind of enjoying the moment from last week?
IN GEE CHUN: After the win last week, a lot of spectators have a lot of expectations for me.  I know, but I try to keep enjoy my golf on the course, because the whole season, my golf was not really well.  But I think I got turning point from the last week.
So I try to just play my game and believe in myself on the course.  It worked during the front nine.  But I made a double-bogey on 10.  But still, I keep trying.  I made a good finish, so I'm really happy to come back.
Q. Were a lot of the fans cheering left over from the Crown?
IN GEE CHUN: Yes.  And when I made a birdie on 17, it was crowd there.  I played with Megan, and when people saw the tournament, everybody said congratulations, all the players.  I really appreciate it and I'm really happy to see all my friends.
