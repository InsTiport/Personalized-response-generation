Q. In Gee Chun, 5-under for the day, first round here at Marathon Classic.  It probably feels really good to be at the top of the leaderboard today.  Can you talk to us about your round?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, it was a good start, and then I made a really good up-and-down on the last hole.  My second shot was into the water.  I had a really good, nice shot.  So I did a really good up-and-down from there.  I'm really happy.
Q. The wind picked up a little bit compared to the morning wave.  Did that make any difference as you saw the leaderboard and the high scores kind of reaching to 5-under par?
IN GEE CHUN: We did always same schedule, so I'm ready to play tomorrow.  I really enjoyed to play with my partner today, so I'm ready, yeah.
Q. On the back nine, you had four birdies in a row.  What was the key to your success today?
IN GEE CHUN: I missed a couple birdie chances during the first nine holes, so I tried to be patient on the course and trust myself.  I made four birdies.
Q. What does that do for your confidence going into tomorrow's round?
IN GEE CHUN: I did work really hard last month, so I try by myself and keep going and see where I am later.
