Q. Solid day today.  You're going to be only a few back headed into the weekend.  How do you feel after two rounds?
IN GEE CHUN: I couldn't make a birdie in the first nine holes.  I thought it was a little tough day, but I tried to focus again on the back nine, and I made a couple birdies.  I really enjoyed playing today.
Q. Seems like a lot of the girls have said that it's playing a little tough.  Was it pin placements, conditions being hard and fast?  What is it that's difficult?
IN GEE CHUN: I think pin position was okay, but more my game was a little tough today.  I didn't know the other players were saying that.
Q. Going into the weekend, what's your strategy?
IN GEE CHUN: I'm a little tired playing in the morning, but if I have a good rest this afternoon, from the rest I'll be ready to play this weekend.
Q. Are you going to putt and hit at all or are you done for the day?
IN GEE CHUN: I will a little try to practice my swing and putter.
