 Q.  What was the key to your round today?  
IN GEE CHUN: This is my first time to play this tournament, so I try to be patient on the course.   
I had great experience from the U.S. Women's Open.  Yeah, so I try to keep going.  Then I try make good teamwork with my caddie.   
 Q.  So you were able to play a couple times early this week?  
IN GEE CHUN: No.   
 Q.  No, not at all?  
IN GEE CHUN: No.  I play only pro-am and nine holes on Tuesday.   
 Q.  Uh-huh.  What are your impressions of the golf course, what do you think about it?  
IN GEE CHUN: I know a lot of bounce on the course, but great shape.  I think great conditions.   
And then this is my first time, but everyone said better than last year for golf conditions, course conditions.   
So I really enjoy play today.   
 Q.  What do you think the best part of your game is right now?  
IN GEE CHUN: I don't know.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  What about something you may need to work on?  
IN GEE CHUN: I'm still work my swing with my coach.  Change backswing and downswing.  I try to keep work those.   
 Q.  When did you start changing that?  
IN GEE CHUN: Two weeks ago.   
 Q.  Really?  Before Kingsmill?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah.  Actually I start three years ago, but we play a lot on the course so I doesn't have plenty of time to focus on swing.   
Now I find something, so I try.   
 Q.  And it seems to be working for you.  
IN GEE CHUN: Uh-huh.
