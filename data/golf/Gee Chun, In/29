Q. So a nice 5-under round today.  You had four birdies on your back nine.  How did you feel coming off the golf course?
IN GEE CHUN: I was little nervous during the first nine holes, but I tried trust myself because I have been working really hard with my coach and trainer during the wintertime.
That's it.  I trust myself.  It was help for calm on the back nine.
Q. How did you deal with this heat?  It's so hot out there.
IN GEE CHUN: I know it's very hot here and very humid, but I never think about the negative.  Just I think about just enjoy nature's sauna this week.
Q. Enjoy nature's sauna.  I love it.
