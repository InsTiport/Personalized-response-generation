Q. 5-under 67. That was a very good round, a lot of birdies, just two bogeys. How do you feel right now coming off the golf course?
IN GEE CHUN: It was great. I'm always happy to play in front of my Korean fans. I really enjoyed today, because of my par, also, but still I'm happy.
Q. What was the strongest part of your game today that let you get around this course so well?
IN GEE CHUN: When I make bogey, my fans cheer me, that makes me more pumped because of my game. Come back to my game, it always helps a lot.
Q. Tell everyone what it's like to have the fans out here, lots of Dumbo, lots of "Go Ingee." It has to be a very proud feeling?
IN GEE CHUN: With some fans coming from Japan, I think I'm a really lucky person. Always very feel happy and lucky always with them. I want to say thank you to them.
Q. How do you prepare as you head to the final round tomorrow?
IN GEE CHUN: My goal is try to make bogey-free round today, and I'm going to try more enjoy with my fans on the course and then we'll see where I am later.
