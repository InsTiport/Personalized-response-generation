Q. Bogey-free today.  Tell us about your day out there.
IN GEE CHUN: I felt little off this morning, so before start play I try more talk with my coach and I try more calm by myself.
So I try for deep breaths on the course.  It was help a lot.
Q. Is that the first time you've done something like that?
IN GEE CHUN: I don't know why, but just I felt like.
Q. Okay.  How was the weather for you?

Q. What about the course?
IN GEE CHUN: I think always really good condition here.  Really good green conditions.  Rough was really tough, but it was make me more challenge on the course.
Q. You really seemed to really get hot on the back nine, your back nine.  Just talk about that little run of birdies you had there.  Any particularly memorable shots there?
IN GEE CHUN: I had a couple birdie chance during the first nine holes, but I couldn't make some short putt chance.  But I try forget it and then try focus on my game.
I think it was good score during the last nine holes.
