Q. So you had a pretty good day today.  You bogeyed the last hole, but overall a pretty good day for you.
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I had two bogeys from par-5s today, but still, I had bounced back because I was a little down about my game during the last week, so I tried to enjoy my game again.  So I really enjoyed today, so I'm happy now.
Q. Did you work on something in particular?
IN GEE CHUN: Clear my mind.
Q. How do you do that?
IN GEE CHUN: Just deep breaths and then find something positive.
Q. Are there certain things you think about to be at peace?
IN GEE CHUN: Because I want to make a believer, so I try hard work, and it was my -- too much think on the course, so I tried like a simple on the course.  Today was not 100 percent but almost very close.
Q. Do you like this course?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I think everyone is very kind here and good energy, and I really enjoy to play this course.  It was really good.
Q. How important do you think it is to get off to a good start like you did?
IN GEE CHUN: Just keep going and we'll see later.
Q. Have you thought about next week with the major coming up, and how are you preparing for that?
IN GEE CHUN: Last year was -- I'm first defending champion for me, so I had a lot of pressure.  I couldn't make a good believer.  I was cut off.  But today, this year, I will try and enjoy my game and then just enjoy the USGA and the U.S. Women's Open.
