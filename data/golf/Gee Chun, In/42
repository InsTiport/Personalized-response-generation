 Q.  How did you feel on the golf course today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, was confident on the course.  (Plane interference.)   
 Q.  Any holes stand out to you?  The putt on nine was pretty good.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, made really good up and down in the tough situation, No. 9.  My last hole was great, so I'm really happy.  I made strong finish.   
 Q.  It's your first time in Portland.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Anything about this course fit your eye at all?  
IN GEE CHUN: Before coming here...   
 Q.  Did you see anything today that made you feel like this is a course you could do something with?  
IN GEE CHUN: Before coming here everyone said course is really good, I agreed.  You know, I like big trees.  It's amazing.   
And green is very consistent and really good condition.   
 Q.  Do you have momentum from last week in Canada then starting well today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Oh, so I have not been able to win, but I think it was strong finish.  Sometimes I had small stress from that part.   
Changing my mind, just keep going, enjoying the process.  I think that thinking was make more comfortable on the course today.
