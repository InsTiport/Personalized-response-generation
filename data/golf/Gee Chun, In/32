 Q.  In Gee, you shot 4-under today, can you tell us about your round today?  
IN GEE CHUN: It was a great day today, especially after I was able to bounce back from a double bogey and bogey.  I just wanted to get back to my play as fast as I could.  And even though I had an OB, I think I'm pretty satisfied with my score at the end of the day.   
 Q.  Was there anything that was tough out there today?  
IN GEE CHUN: The roughs out there were a little tougher than I thought they were last year and so that posed a challenge to my approach shots.  So when you miss a green, itâs definitely a challenge for everyone.   
 Q.  How will you get ready for tomorrow?  
IN GEE CHUN: I'm gonna get some good sleep, and since I'm teeing off pretty early in the morning, I'm just gonna get prepped for tomorrow.
