Q. Bogey the first hole.  How were you able to bounce back and finish your round bogey-free?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, make bogey 1st hole.  Was just 3-putt on the green.  I think was too flat my concentration.
And then after made bogey almost just wake up then forget about bogey and start again.
Q. How was the course today compared to yesterday?  Play any different?
IN GEE CHUN: Same.  Green conditions are really good, still good.  Very consistent here.
Then just a little bit more windy on the course.
Q. How are you feeling heading into the weekend at the top of the leaderboard?
IN GEE CHUN: I also playing for a win, but when I place second or third I get depressed a little bit, too.  That means -- it just means there was a player who played better, deserve big congratulations.
I did not think I played bad because I did very well, so I want to just keep going for weekend.
So I really like this course.  Also spectators so kind here.  I really enjoy with them.
Q. How is it having Dylan back on your bag?  How does he help you?
IN GEE CHUN: He's really good guy so really hard work on the course.  (Plane interference.)  So I really excited to work together.
I really like him.  We just talk a lot on the course not golf.  Really enjoy together.
