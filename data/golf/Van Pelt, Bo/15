Q.   Did you have a part of finishing that or was it more important to let your daughter‑‑
BO VAN PELT:   You know, my son got to hit it last time.   I didn't think she would have cared about hitting it, but she wanted to hit.   So I said, yeah, that's fine. 
If I would have kept birdieing all of them‑‑ I birdied the first four and I said, well, I'll see how many I can get in a row.   If I would have got to six, I would have probably tried to finish it out just because I think seven was the lowest of all time. 
So once I couldn't do that, then it was just have fun there at the end.

Q.   What's her name?
BO VAN PELT:   Olivia.

Q.   We always ask about the curse.   Did you think about that?
BO VAN PELT:   You know, it was funny, we were laughing about it after I birdied the first four. 
Kip, Brian's caddie was like, come on, somebody's got to break it.   I wasn't thinking too much about it. 
What a special memory.   I mean, in 2005, my dad got to caddie for me and to have my kids do it two of the‑‑ last year we got rained out, so it almost was just three years in a row.   It's a special day, a special day.

Q.   And you kind of in your mind unless someone else comes up with a five, you will know that you were‑‑
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, exactly.   You know, I think I could have got a three in there on that last one. 

Q.   Last year you shot 64 on Sunday, right?   So are you using that experience?   Are you keying in on it for this year? 
BO VAN PELT:   Well, you know, obviously that was a year ago, but obviously got good memories of the back 9 the last twoyears that I played. 
Hopefully I can get off to a good start.   That's what you are looking for is a chance to try to play well on Sunday.   So definitely looking forward to the week for sure. 

Q.   If you won the par‑3 you get a big trophy, right? 
BO VAN PELT:   I'm not sure.
