Q.   Could I just get some comments on your round?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah.   Obviously shooting 4â€‘under, disappointing bogey on the last, but it could have been worse. 
All in all I have taken quite a bit of time off, so to come out and shoot two rounds under par, I feel pretty good about it.

Q.   Conditions easier today, less wind?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, a little less wind, and I think guys were used to the speed of the greens a little bit and used to them being soft.   And ball in hand, whenever you put guys with that kind of opportunity to put their hand on it, they're probably going to shoot some good scores.
