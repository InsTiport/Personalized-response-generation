 Q.   That's a great way to end the 2nd Round at the Wyndham Championship.   Birdie four of your last five.  
BO VAN PELT:   It was nice.   I birdied 9 yesterday to finish and it's always good to finish with that and kind of came on late there at the end.   So, definitely a nice way to finish.  
   
 Q.   Give us an idea of the scoring conditions, light breezes, light clouds and beautiful temperatures.  
BO VAN PELT:   The weather is perfect.   Greens are really good.   They're rolling really smooth this morning.   There's not a breath of wind.   Ideal conditions like you said but this bermuda is firm so you got to drive the ball in the fairway.   Still going to be tough.   
I thought there were some good pin positions throughout today but if you hit the fairway you could manage them but if you were in the rough it was going to be tough.  
   
 Q.   You come in at 118 in the FedExCup Points but so far you're putting on a display here at Sedgefield.   Prospects for the weekend?  
BO VAN PELT:   No.   Brian played great.   It was the first time I ever played with him and I was just kind of drafting off him.   He got off to a great start.   You felt like you were falling behind.   
You know, I hit the ball well.   I think I missed the first green just over the back and I hit the next 17 in a row.   I think that's key here, is just keep it in play and hit a bunch of greens to give yourself looks because these greens are pure.  
   
 Q.   Great playing.  
BO VAN PELT:   Thank you.
