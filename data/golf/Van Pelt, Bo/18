Q.   Nice way to finish with a birdie on 18.   That had to feel good. 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, obviously I didn't play that great today, but it's always nice to finish with a 3.

Q.   It looked like you were really scrambling out there. 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, I hadn't touched a club for three weeks before I got here, so I was pleased with how I hit it the first two days, but I was a little out of sync early on and kind of fought it, so I was pleased to get in under par today.

Q.   You're going to be playing with Tiger again tomorrow.   Talk about that.
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, it's fun.   We go way back.   I've known him since high school and we enjoy playing together, so I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   Looks like you're going to need a low one tomorrow.   Do you think it's out there?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, it is.   Obviously Graeme is playing great, and he's going to be tough to catch, so hopefully we can get off to a good start, and who knows.
