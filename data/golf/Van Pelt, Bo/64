  Q. Bo, minus three after the morning wave. Talk a little bit about the conditions and how it played out there. 
   BO VAN PELT: Yeah, golf course is playing pretty tough. You know, it's windy and it's been gusting, so you can miss a gust or catch one. I think probably overall you're not gonna see the total scores be as low as they have been in the last couple years where there wasn't much wind. 
   It's a tight golf course and it's got some wind do it. Add in wind like this, it'll bring the scores up.

   Q. You're kind of a Midwest guy. Can you talk about playing this event? You've had some good success here in the past. 
   BO VAN PELT: I like coming back. You know, growing up in Indiana and played golf courses that looked a lot like this. I've had a bunch of good rounds here and a couple good tournaments. 
   I like coming back. I have some friends up here in the Milwaukee area, so I enjoy coming back. Hopefully this isn't the last one we get to play here.

   Q. Do you think it's gonna get tougher today with the wind up and maybe drying out a little?
   BO VAN PELT: Yeah, you know, it just all depends. If the wind stays up -- obviously the greens were perfect this morning. If the wind stays up, these guys are gonna have a challenge this afternoon just like we might have tomorrow afternoon. Hopefully it stays up. The golf course is a test both morning and afternoon.
