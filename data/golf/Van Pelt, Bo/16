Q.   Neither rain nor sleet nor snow can slow down the Bo Van Pelt expression?
BO VAN PELT:   Definitely got on a little run yesterday before we got on.   It's match play.   Had good holes and bad holes.   We were kind of trading back and forth and got on a little run right around the turn, and it was‑‑ John was in a tough spot kind of in the desert when we stopped yesterday. 
I feel fortunate.   He's a great player, and the weather was tough yesterday, so it was easy‑‑ it wasn't hard to be a little bit off yesterday.   So just thought, you know‑‑ I think Mark Wilson last year was about 9‑under on me, so it was nice to get through the first round this year. 

Q.   It seems like the last couple years you've kind of taken that next step and you're currently in the top 50 in the world now, getting into these World Golf Championships a lot more.   Are you getting more comfortable in the majors and the World Golf Championships kind of in these events all the time now?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, definitely.   It's been easier for me to kind of make a schedule, making the TOUR Championship the last couple years and knowing that you're in these kind of events and you can try to work up towards those and know what you're schedule is going to be and kind of try to prime towards those.   So that's been huge for me the last couple years to kind of have that luxury, so to speak. 
Definitely once you get a taste of playing in majors and World Golf events, you want to keep working hard to make sure you keep getting in them.

Q.   Talk about the rest of the week.   Looking forward to it?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah.   You know, game didn't feel that great coming into the week, but it's kind of slowly progressed, so hopefully I'll kind of stay in the rhythm that I'm in and see.   You never know in match play, so definitely looking forward to tomorrow.
