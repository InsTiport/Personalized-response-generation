 Q. Obviously a great position you're in now after today. Can you talk about it? 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, a little disappointed. I mean, got to 10. I really had a three or four-hole stretch where I kind of let about three or four shots get away from me on the back nine. But obviously finishing up 16 and 18, depends on what everybody gets in at, hopefully I'll have a shot at it tomorrow.

 Q. On 17, fewest balls in the water maybe of any PLAYERS Championship coming into today. I saw you had a little indecisiveness there on 17. Talk about that for a second?
 BO VAN PELT: I had similar yardage a couple of days ago. It was like 124, but there was a little bit of help wind. I hit a 52-degree, which was perfect. But the wind was a little back into me. 
 And I just saw Luke hit a pitching wedge long, so I knew that wasn't any good. So I was trying to hit 52, but the wind was in our face, so it was just a little too much. 
 I was just going back and forth pretty much. It was pitching wedge the whole way. I just have to convince myself that was the right shot.

 Q. Is that what you used, the pitching wedge? 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah.

 Q. How did it turn out? 
 BO VAN PELT: About 10 feet below the hole.

 Q. Birdie?
 BO VAN PELT: No par.

 Q. How did you do the other two days on 17? 
 BO VAN PELT: Two pars.
