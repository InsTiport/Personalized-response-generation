 Q. Bo, great finish, great run in the final round. That eagle at 5 really kind of kick start it all?
 BO VAN PELT: It did. You know, Jeev and I both played really well. He birdied 3, and he holed out for eagle on 4. And then I made eagle on 5, and all our momentum just kind of kept going from there. 
 And I had two bogeys on the Back 9, par-3 that I'll probably think about a lot, but other than that, I was real happy how I played today. 

 Q. You only missed one green, yeah, from tee to green, you can't play much better than that. 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah. Exactly. You know, only day I didn't strike them real well was yesterday. I missed two greens I think on Friday, three on Thursday and one today. All in all it was a good week, and I'll probably come up a little short, but I'm real happy how I played. 

 Q. You've already won this year. You're good for a while now. How much more do you play this fall?
 BO VAN PELT: I'm going to play quite a few. 

 Q. Are you?
 BO VAN PELT: You know, I probably won't play Jackson just because we got a good football game. Not that I don't love the Viking Classic. It's been really good to me, but my daughter's going to be down on the field cheering, so we'll be in Stillwater that night, but other than that, I'm going to try to play them all. 

 Q. You have some great momentum going. This oughta be great heading to Vegas. 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah. No, I've been feeling really good. I've had some good tournaments in Vegas, and I like Scottsdale. 
 And I haven't quite figured out that Disney tournament, but it's still a good family vacation for us, so I'm looking forward to playing some this fall. 

 Q. Keep up the great work. 
 BO VAN PELT: Thank you.
