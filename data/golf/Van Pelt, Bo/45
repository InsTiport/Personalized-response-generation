 Q. A lot of the folks listening to us, when they start their rounds with a bogey, they just want to pack it in. You started off badly and somehow you found something. What did you find out there?
 BO VAN PELT: You know, I've done the same thing the first two days. I've driven it perfect, hit kind of a so-so wedge shot and had a pitiful three-putt to start the first two rounds. I guess it just woke me up a little bit, kind of ticked me off. I felt like I was swinging well, so I hated to throw one away yesterday and today. 
 The key was I came right back and birdied 11 and then just played pretty solid from there on in.

 Q. What is it that's going well for you? What are you doing best this week?
 BO VAN PELT: You know, just tee to green. I missed one green yesterday, I think I missed three today. Just putting the ball in play and putting it on the greens. It's a tough golf course, and it's what I'm going to try to do this weekend.
