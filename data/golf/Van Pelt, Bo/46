   BO VAN PELT: I got off to a good start, hit it close on 1 and 2 and then played three holes pretty poorly, but made a birdie on 9, kind of got my back nine going. A lot can happen on that back nine. Went eagle, birdie, birdie on 13, 14, 15. So kind of got hot there towards the end.   
 Unfortunately, weather, Mother Nature took over and didn't get to play any more golf today.  
  
  Q. What's it like sitting around? You know, you want to just at some point just get the hell out of here?  
 BO VAN PELT: Well, I had some lunch and I took a nap. I can fall asleep anywhere, so I was right in the middle of the locker room. I slept for a good while, so it wasn't too bad.  
  
  Q. So how much do you have left? You have about a hole and a half?  
 BO VAN PELT: I got two and a half holes. I'm putting on 16 for birdie and then 17 and 18.  
  
  Q. Do you know where your ball is?  
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah. I'm about 14-footer, 14, 15-footer up the hill on 16.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah. No. It's a good spot up the hill, right-of-way breaker, so hopefully I'll get a good look at it tomorrow and play 17, 18 and then go back to bed.  
  
  Q. Really. I know. It sounds good. Thanks, buddy.
