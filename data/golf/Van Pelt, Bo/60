  Q. Good day out there. Just comment on the round if you can.   
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, you know, I didn't hit as many fairways as I did yesterday, but I still felt like I was driving it pretty good. I was just barely missing.   
 I had a couple good par saves out of the bunker and also had a couple coming in here.  
  
  Q. Talk about those on 7 and 8 if you can.   
 BO VAN PELT: I drove it just through the fairway on 7, in the fairway bunker, and I had a good number for a pitching wedge and hit it in there about six feet, made a pretty good putt. And then hit 4-iron off of 8 and another pitching wedge to about three feet on 8, but it was a tricky downhill area.  
  
  Q. We've got Tiger at 7-under, you and Harrington and several others at 6-under. Talk about what should be an exciting weekend.   
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, I'm excited. I'm playing well, and I felt like my game was better than my past two or three weeks results, so it's exciting to be in this position.
