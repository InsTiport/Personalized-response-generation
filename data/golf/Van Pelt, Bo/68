 Q. Bo, 69 today, 3-under par. Talk about your round. 
 BO VAN PELT: It was good. You know, got off to a pretty good start and got 3-under pretty early. I was just fortunate not to make any bogeys. I had a stretch in the middle of the round where I missed quite a few greens and I wasn't driving the ball particularly well. I kept the round going getting it up-and-down and hit a bunch of good shots coming in and just didn't make birdie putts. I had five good chances coming in, just didn't convert. But I think it was pretty good.

 Q. You guys were the first off the tee today. How did you find the conditions early in the morning?
 BO VAN PELT: It was dark (laughing). But other than that, it was perfect. The golf course is in great shape. We've got great weather, and it's just a great test of golf. It's one of my favorite tournaments of the year.

 Q. Talk about those finishing holes one more time. Those are going to be a big subject all weekend. 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, a lot can happen I guess probably 14 on in. And really 11 and 12 are two kind of -- it's hard to get comfortable off the tee. But definitely 14 on in, you'd better hit some good shots, and you can see a lot of change of position on those holes.
