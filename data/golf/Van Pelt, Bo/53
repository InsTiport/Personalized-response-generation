 Q. 2-under today for a total of 5-under for 36 holes. Really good playing out here. 
 BO VAN PELT: Thanks. I didn't hit it my best today but short game held me in there and made some good swings coming down the stretch, birdied 17. Any time you're in the 60s on this golf course you feel pretty good about it.

 Q. The course is playing soft. Is that helping?
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, I think with the rain they've had and I think the superintendent, they had all this heat prior to it, so I think he just had to keep the golf course soft and just err on the side of caution. It's in beautiful shape, it's just the ball is sitting down by the greens and in the fairways. 

 Q. We followed you a lot this year. You've had a heck of a year. You're on the verge. Confidence has to be really high going into the weekend. 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, game feels good. Coming off two weeks off, kind of my summer break. I feel like I've played a bunch since March. My body feels good and just trying to stay in a good rhythm. But feel like we've made some strides but there's always room for improvement.

 Q. You are confident heading into tomorrow?
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, game feels good. I like the golf course. I grew up in Indiana, so this kind of look suits my eye and just see if we can get the scoring club straightened up a little bit. I feel like the first three holes you can take advantage of and I've played them over par so far. Just trying to take advantage of the holes that you can take advantage of out here and then just play the hard holes the same way I've been playing them.
