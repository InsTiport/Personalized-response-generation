  Q. Coming in did you feel like you had that kind of good momentum?  
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, I was coming off of two good weeks and felt like I played pretty solid. I like this golf course. I haven't played well the last couple years, but I had a good week here a couple years ago. I had a good feeling and played good today, 4-under, and I had two balls in the water. So it was all in all a good day and a good start to the week.  
  
  Q. Do you hear that more often than not? A lot of players say they like this place but they haven't played well here. Why is that?  
 BO VAN PELT: Well, I don't know. I guess it's probably because we get to play a great place every week. Most guys like most courses that they go play because the weeks off, you're probably going to take weeks off from the courses that you don't like.   
 But I think I just was over-prepared the last couple years, probably put too much pressure on myself, and it was more that than anything. So coming off two Top 5s I was pretty relaxed coming into this week.  
  
  Q. How important was it for you to get that par at the last?  
 BO VAN PELT: It was good. You know, I had a good number. I had a perfect 7-iron, and I had hit it close there on I guess it was 14, and I just pushed it a little bit, and it was a tough up-and-down, so it was nice to make that one.
