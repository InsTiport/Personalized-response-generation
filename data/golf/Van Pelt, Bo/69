  Q. Let me ask you about coming out here early this morning and finishing up. Do you mind these kind of split days?  
 BO VAN PELT: Doesn't really make any difference. Got to play 72 to win a golf tournament so it doesn't matter when we get to play. You know, got to play with two great guys. We're all playing pretty well. It doesn't make any difference.  
  
  Q. The winds start picking up. You're from Oklahoma. There's a lot of wind up there. Do you like it when it blows?  
 BO VAN PELT: Being in Oklahoma from since '93 I'm pretty used to it. Keep hitting greens and fairways like I have been, that usually bodes pretty well when it's blowing.  
  
  Q. Because they're not re-pairing it's a little bit different because of scoreboard watching. You don't really have the leaders in the final group.   
 Is there a factor because you don't know how the guys behind you are going to be as aggressive as they can be?   
 BO VAN PELT: I think you got to try to shoot the lowest score you can. You can't control what other guys do. I have no idea what's going to happen. The last couple holes coming in could be interesting today so you better just take care of your own business and not worry about anybody else.
