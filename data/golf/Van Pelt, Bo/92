BO VAN PELT:  I tried to Monday qualify.  I feel like I've been playing good for a while so I'll hopefully keep it up.


Q.  Have you played in many Monday qualifiers?

BO VAN PELT:  Yeah, I've probably played five or six.  Monday is the first time, my rookie year in '99, I got into the LA Open, and then I missed in a playoff in San Diego a few years ago and got in this one, obviously.


Q.  Do you feel that the way you're playing sort of --

BO VAN PELT:  I played well in Hawaii.  I didn't play as well last week at the Bob Hope, even though I was playing okay the first couple of days, and I'm slowly starting to hit it better in the Monday qualifier and that gave me some confidence, just kind of worked on my game a little bit early in the week.  I started hitting it solid and I thought, if I keep doing what I'm doing it should be all right.


Q.  (Inaudible). 

BO VAN PELT:  No, I don't think so, because there's 112 guys here and you've got to finish first or second, so it's all or nothing.  Once you get a couple under, you've got to keep going, no backing off.  That's kind of how I approached it.  I was just fortunate to get in.
