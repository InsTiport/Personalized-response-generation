   BO VAN PELT: Hit it good. I missed four greens. I think every one I made bogey on. Driving the ball good. I think I missed one fairway. Tee to green. 

 Q. How is the golf course?
 BO VAN PELT: Real fair. The PGA is good about how they set up golf courses. It's long. But they moved a couple of the par 3s up and 12 about 30 yards. And playing real playable. You'll see guys here playing well, shoot 4 and 5-under and it's tough. Shoot 4 or 5 over, pretty easy.

 Q. Do you expect it to firm up?
 BO VAN PELT: A little bit. The greens have definitely dried out and be a little faster. And when you miss a green you're in the bunker, chip in a little firmer around there.

 Q. Do you feel like maybe you lost one?
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, I laid up. And it was one of those it wasn't that bad in a divot, but I caught the wedge a little heavy and it didn't carry. That's what happens. Love the green.
