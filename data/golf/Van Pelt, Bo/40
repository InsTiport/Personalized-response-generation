Q.   General comments about the conditions outs there.   How was it out there? 
BO VAN PELT:   The golf course was good.   I mean, it was wet in spots, but overall for the amount of harsh rain they've had three times this week and Saturday, golf course played really well.

Q.   You didn't have any mud issues? 
BO VAN PELT:   It was funny, I was telling him, I had a pretty good mud clob on 13, so I decided to lay‑up.   And I made 4. 
Then 15, I had a perfect lie in the fairway, hit it over the green and made six.   Maybe I should have had some mud on 15, and it would have helped save me a couple of shots
All in all, for the rain, the golf course is in good shape. 

Q.   How do you feel about your game and your position today? 
BO VAN PELT:   You know, I was happy through 13.   I was 1‑under. 
And hit it close on 14 and hit a good putt, just didn't make it. 
Then drove it perfect on 15, ended up making six.   Looked like I could go 2 or 3‑under for the day. 
Then the bogey on 18 from the fairway. 
And hit it close on 17. 
And 16, missed it. 
The last five I wasn't real happy with.   My game feels good.   If I can play like that the rest of the week and make a few more putts, I'll be all right. 

Q.   Do you think it's advantage teeing off early?   They are saying there's some weather coming in. 
BO VAN PELT:   You know, you've still got to play all 18 holes.   I don't think, you know, it's going to make that big a difference today.   I mean, unless it just gets crazy windy or really bad weather.   It could ‑‑ if it washes out, then you could play tomorrow and it's perfect condition and you have to play more.   You never know.   You can't control the weather, so I don't think too much about it.
