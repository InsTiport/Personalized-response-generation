 Q. You had eight birdies overall? BO VAN PELT: Yeah. I think I had seven on the front.

 Q. Nothing on the back?
 BO VAN PELT: No. I played solid. I hit a bunch of greens. I just didn't make the putt. I three-putted and then got the ball up-and-down on 18. Had a fair amount in the bunker. 

 Q. You're driving great and you're putting good. All you gotta do tomorrow is just keep going. 
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah. 

 Q. Any good feeling out here? BO VAN PELT: Yeah. I've been following a little bit the scores and keep getting frustrated. But I did. Got a bogey, and just came out a little bit early this morning, tried to get my speed down. My speed was very good all day. That was pretty much the key, started making putts. 

 Q. Your biggest fear. 
 BO VAN PELT: It's not a fear. 

 Q. Challenge. 
 BO VAN PELT: Exactly. Just trying to keep the speed.

 Q. I guess when you -- did you birdie the first hole or second hole? Had to be something early that jump-started you.  BO VAN PELT: I believe it was the par-5, whatever that is. I think it was 13. Yeah. I did birdie that hole. And then parred 14, 15. Then I was at even and shot six under.

 Q. Yeah. 
 BO VAN PELT: I hit a good drive. I was in a divot actually. Just trying to do everything. Obviously I think the key is the driving. 

 Q. For your game, what do you -- BO VAN PELT: I need it all. I mean I want to make it all good.

 Q. When you start getting it under control in one direction, which is more likely? What do you go back to?
 BO VAN PELT: I would say, you know, you can putt as much as you want. It's just kind of -- sometimes it comes and goes. I've been driving the ball well, better this year. I just want to keep going with that.

 Q. (Inaudible).
 BO VAN PELT: No. I just try to keep it in between pars and driving a 3-wood. It's not really an advantage to hit driver, maybe I'll hit 3-wood. 

 Q. Yeah. Did you make a lot of decisions today?
 BO VAN PELT: Yeah, every hole, you have to make a decision what your strategy is going to be. I played pretty aggressive today.
