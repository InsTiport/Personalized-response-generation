Q.   You had good looks at 17 and 18, all in all two good days?
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, I played solid.   I hit the ball well at PLAYERS and so far it's carried over here.   So just hope to convert on some of those opportunities.   I feel like I've been putting well, it's just around the hole.   So just read them a little better, and match the line will be a little better this weekend.

Q.   I followed you at Harbour Town and thought your game started coming together there? 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, it was kind of a shaky start to the year.   But I feel like I've corrected some of the problems, and my ball striking is definitely coming around.   So it's just nice to shoot some red numbers.

Q.   Tell us about the putter, the Bettinardi, Matt Kuchar has made famous over the years and you decided to go that way? 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, I did.   I picked it up in Tampa and my whole game was kind of struggling.   I was just looking for a spark.   Picked it up and I just was really impressed with the role I was getting.   It was rolling end over end really well, and I figured that was a good place to start.   I'm still learning with it, but I like it so just keep working at it every day.

Q.   You've been in this position a lot, but you have to be excited about this weekend? 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, for sure.   This week and next week are two of my favorite courses on TOUR, so it's always nice to have two good rounds.   Anything in the red is good on this golf course.   I'm just, like you said, I'm excited for the weekend, and hopefully I'll keep doing the same things I've been doing the last two days.

Q.   Being an Oklahoma guy, it's good to win in Texas? 
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, there are a lot of OK State fans in the Dallasâ€‘Fort Worth Metroplex, not far from where I live in Tulsa, so I know a bunch of the members here, and it's just a great place.
