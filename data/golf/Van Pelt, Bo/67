 Q. Talk about playing on this golf course you like so much. 
 BO VAN PELT: It reminds me of the course I grew up on a little bit. It's a little longer and a little tougher, but it's kind of comfortable. I like the slopy greens. I just like this town. They do such a great job of taking care of us all week. It's a neat club. I think places you feel comfortable at you play well.

 Q. Last week in New Orleans a lot of people were talking about first-time winners, guys trying to get that first win. Do you feel like this is the opportunity for you because you love the golf course so much and you're starting to play some better golf?
 BO VAN PELT: I mean, I think playing well, I played pretty well the last three events I've played in, and a lot can happen between now and Sunday. I'm just trying to shoot as low as I can. I think if I take care of my business, keep giving myself chances, it's going to happen. It's just a matter of when.
