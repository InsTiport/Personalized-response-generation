  BO VAN PELT: Obviously happy with 5-under. Got to have a shaky start and didn't hit the ball very well the first few holes, a hangover from yesterday, tough to play in those conditions. Made a good birdie on the par 5 and kind of settled down and started hitting some good shots. 
 Played well from there on. I made a bad bogey on No. 3, it was a pretty easy hole. Wasn't too happy walking off that green and made a par and birdied three in a row coming in. Happy with the how I played. 

 Q. Considering how you've been playing --
 BO VAN PELT: I don't think anybody that's playing for a living -- my goal every year is to try to get better and try to do the best I can every time I tee it up and that's all I'm trying to do. 
 Obviously I wasn't expecting to shoot 23-under, and very pleased. The two times I've won professionally, I haven't played well the following week, so obviously I'm concentrating today and hoping to try to keep -- this will probably be my last tournament of the year so want to end it on a high. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BO VAN PELT: No distractions as far as people. Basically I was on a plane to here and trying to get ready for this golf course and trying to get ready for this week. Came over here for two weeks and try to play the best I can, and go home and enjoy the off-season.

 Q. And what do you think of this golf course?
 BO VAN PELT: Oh, it's fantastic. The condition of it's unbelievable, especially with all of the rain they had yesterday. The greens are really nice. A lot of different holes out there, a lot of different second shots. 

 Q. Looking around, do you know you're in China? 
 BO VAN PELT: No, you know, it remind me of a couple of courses in Las Vegas and one that we play, San Antonio, with the roller coaster. So it's definitely got a home feel to it, that's for sure.
