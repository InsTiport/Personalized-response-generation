 Q.   Tight down the back stretch there but well played?  
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah, Jason and I had a good battle and we both played well.   Had a little bit of a lead there and made bogey, I think it was 14.   Thought I hit a pretty good shot.   Definitely got tight there at the end.   A little tighter than I wanted but luckily for me I came out on top.  
   
 Q.   Your first look at Lake Karrinyup, you looked comfortable from the get‑go.   
BO VAN PELT:   Lake Karrinyup was a great test.   The greens staff did a great job.   It was a battle all week.   The wind blew and the greens were firm and fast.   Just a joy to play all week.  
   
 Q.   You had some chances back home on the US PGA TOUR to lock down a victory; what does this mean to win in Perth this week?   
BO VAN PELT:   Kind of like last year, I felt like I had a consistent year last year without a win and I won in Malaysia and this year is the same thing, a lot of Top‑10s but let a couple chances slip by.   Whenever you get the lead, you want to try to take advantage of it, so it was nice to finish one off this week.   
   
 Q.   Defending champ next week in Malaysia, go back‑to‑back?   
BO VAN PELT:   We'll see.   It's going to be a good field there next week.   Looking forward to getting back.   Obviously have good memories there, and you know, it was just nice to come out on top today.   
We lost a good friend yesterday, Scotty Steele, a caddie on the PGA TOUR, Mark Chaney, my caddie, and I just wanted to have a good attitude and play hard.   This one is for him.
