  BO VAN PELT:   I putted well.   Just had a couple that looked pretty good that didn't go in, but all in all pleased.  
   
 Q.   I thought the putt at 16, aggressive with the birdie try from about 45 feet, but all in all, pretty good try.  
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah.   That was one you were just trying to get close.   It was just a little low on the line and just hit my second putt a little hard.  
But I had some really good looks on the Front 9 and kind of right around the turn.   They looked good.   Catching a piece of the hole, but it just didn't go in.  
But no complaints.   Just happy with the rhythm I had all day, and luckily we got in good weather all day.  
   
 Q.   And you've had a rhythm all year really.   What a year you've put together, quietly one of the best on TOUR.  
BO VAN PELT:   You know, it's been good.   I feel like it's been consistent.   I feel like a couple of tournaments I would have liked to finish off a little better, but all in all, just keep trying to get better every week.   You're either getting better or getting worse at this game, so just try to keep getting better.  
   
 Q.   And the goals, obviously Ryder Cup team and that sort of things in your sites?  
BO VAN PELT:   Yeah.   That's one of those things kind of out of my control.   My goal is to play the best I can each and every week, try to win golf tournaments, and all that stuff will take care of itself.  
   
 Q.   Well, keep it going.   Great start.  
BO VAN PELT:   Thank you.
