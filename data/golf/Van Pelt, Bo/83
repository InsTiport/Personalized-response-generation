BO VAN PELT:  Tee to green, just fought keeping the ball in play.  I was happy only shooting 1 over.  It could have been a lot worse.  I'll go hit a few balls and hopefully get back in that rhythm I was in for two days.
Q.  How do you shake it mentally?  What do you say?
BO VAN PELT:  If I would have shot 76 or 77 I would have probably been a little bit down in the dumps, but to shoot 1 over and be two shots back, I still feel good about where I'm at going into tomorrow.
Q.  What was the difference between today and the first two days?
BO VAN PELT:  Just my swing.  I got out of rhythm.  Since I was a little kid I've gotten quick on my backswing.  I got quick from the getgo, and I just kind of fought that all day.  I'm just going to try to get back in the rhythm I was in and start hitting the ball solid again.
Q.  Why is it so tough on Tour to follow a great round up with another one?
BO VAN PELT:  I think that's a testament to guys who win tournaments.  If you play four days in a row on good golf courses against the greatest players in the world, it's hard to string four good days together on anything, whether it be throwing a football, playing baseball or playing golf for that matter.  You can get bad weather, you can get sick.  In four days in a tournament you're going to have one day where you're not 100 percent, and you just try to get in on that day as low as you can.
