   BO VAN PELT:  Like I said yesterday, you know, when I decided to come down here, wanted to try and take advantage of coming down here, you know, I didn't want to just waste a trip, and so I was definitely focused coming in, even though spending a lot of time with the family, I definitely want to make it worth my while, so it's been good so far.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  Wasn't really different.  The wind was a little different direction, so you had to watch that.  I got a little bit tentative on the back 9.  I fought on a couple swings and had to kind of nick that in the bud and go ahead and stay aggressive, and did that when I came over to the front side and was able to make quite a few more birdies.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  No, they are good.  I left a couple putts short today thinking they were a little bit faster, I got a couple down wind putts, and down grain, that I left short.   
 So you just got to pay attention to your speed.  You know, grain makes a difference.  I had a long putt on 9, last hole, and I knew it was into the grain, so I had to hit it a lot harder than I wanted to, you know, even though it was downhill, so you have to factor all that in, the wind, the grain and everything.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  Maybe like Charlotte a year or two ago, Wachovia was probably the last time, if I had to guess, just off the top of my head.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  I played pretty solid.  It was tough conditions, it was kind of windy and rainy, and I think I still finished top 5, or right around then, and hung in there, I just didn't make as many birdies on the weekend, and it's a tough golf course, Quail Hollow, so I was proud of how I played there with the lead and stuff, it just wasn't my week.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  Yeah.  You know, I think just -- I was happy how I played the front 9.  I wasn't real happy when I came off 18, I had 230 or something and didn't make birdie there, which I wasn't real happy about, and then didn't make a very good drive on 1, but kind of calmed myself down and hit a good iron shot there, and got off on the right foot, so I think the way I played the front 9 will help me going into tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  14 for me, I hadn't hit the green yet.  I hit two really good drives and I made a bogey there today.  I actually hit a very good shot, just came up a little bit short on my second shot, so (inaudible) hole, that's the one I had a birdie putt on, I missed the green there twice, it's a good, long, tough hole.  So 13, 14, 15, pretty good stretch.  12, I mean, the start of that back 9, 11 through 15, really good stretch, and then you kind of get down wind 16, 17 and 18.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  Birdies and bogeys.  I birdied 11, made a long putt there, first long putt I have made all week, up and over a slope, it was probably 40 feet.  And I bogeyed 14 and came up just short of the green and hit a pretty good pitch, came up about three feet short and I missed it.   
 And then 1, I hit a 7-iron to about five feet; 2, hit it in the green side bunker, chipped it out to probably five feet and made it; bogeyed the next hole, hit a poor wedge shot, came up short, missed my first putt way short, missed about a 6, 8-footer for par there, three-putted.   
 Then I birdied the next hole, hit an 8-iron to about 10 feet.  And then the par 3, I hit a 5-iron to about 10 or 12 feet and made it, missed a close birdie putt on the next hole, 7, and then hit another 5-iron on 8 to probably 15 feet, probably 12, 15 feet.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  No, my kids don't care how I play.  It's the same routine.  It's all about them and what they are doing, so the golf just kind of gets in the way of their fun, so I will be going off their schedule.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 BO VAN PELT:  Last night we ordered pizza and just ate it out in the grass, so it was pretty much a redneck picnic in Puerto Rico.  So I don't know what we are going to do tonight.  It will probably be something similar.
