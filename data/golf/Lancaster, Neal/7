MODERATOR: Thank you, Neal, for joining us for a few minutes.  Great round today, no bogeys.  Maybe a couple comments about what you're thinking about tomorrow.

NEAL LANCASTER: Like they're calling for bad weather, we're just going to get up and see what happens in the morning.  No expectations.  Maybe if I play like I played today, instead of playing against Jim.  He's going to be difficult to beat.  I think somebody from 12 under can come out and win this thing.  Actually, I think it's a putting contest.  Somebody could post 61 or '2 out easy.  I have been in that position before, and I've just got to tell myself to do the best I can do and play the golf course and hopefully it's my time.

MODERATOR:  Questions?


Q.  (Inaudible)?

NEAL LANCASTER: I had played with both of them before, and I knew what to expect, and I just tried to go out and play the golf course and not play Tiger and Jim.  They're 1 in 5 in the world.  The best you can do is not play them.  Actually I was really comfortable with them.  That's where you want to be.  When I got inside the ropes, I was a lot more comfortable than I was an hour before we teed off.  I was a little nervous.  Once we got started, all the people loosened you up.  It's kind of hilarious how a lot of them act, like going crazy.  They're having a good time.  There was guys with their shirts on that had go Tiger across their chest.  They're having a good time.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

NEAL LANCASTER: It's a big crowd.  You feel like you're the only group being watched on the golf course.  I don't think anybody was watching anybody else.

MODERATOR:  Neal, can we go through your birdies. 

(Score card done.)

MODERATOR:  Couple more questions? 


Q.  (Inaudible)?

NEAL LANCASTER: Beautiful.
