  Q.  Maybe not the round you wanted, but you're still there.   
 NEAL LANCASTER:  I actually hit the ball better today, and the back nine I putted terrible and then three-putted the last hole.  I just didn't give myself -- well, I gave myself a great chance.  I probably needed to shoot 3- or 4-under on the back, and just to keep pace I had to make some putts, and I didn't make any.  I hit a couple loose shots, still working on my golf swing.   
 It was disappointing on the last hole.  When I birdied 17, I just wanted to make 4 on the last hole to shoot a round in the 60s, which I felt like would have been a good round.  And to bogey there -- I'll go off a little earlier tomorrow, maybe I'll go ahead and free-wheel it and make eight or nine birdies and no bogeys, and you never know.   
  
  Q.  Still, the shot of the day had to be on 9, the 35-footer.   
 NEAL LANCASTER:  Yeah, actually that was probably one of the worst irons I hit all day, but every time I missed a green I had a chip that I couldn't even hardly stand to hit it.  But the course firmed up, the wind was blowing pretty good, and I just didn't get it done.  I just didn't get it done.   
  
  Q.  How does it feel to be near the last group on a Sunday again?   
 NEAL LANCASTER:  It's going to feel good.  I hate I missed out when I would have been next-to-the-last group again or something like that, but I'm just lucky to be here, I guess.
