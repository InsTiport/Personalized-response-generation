Q. So the third-most players coming from Italy, there are four of you.  I know you had a chance to hang out last night.  What was that like getting to hang out with your Italian team?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: I think it's great.  I think it's great to end a round with Italians, we are funny people, so it's nice.  I think it talks a lot about how the game is growing.  I think a few years ago, we were hoping to make cuts, and now here, we are four at Augusta.  So it tells a lot about the younger people that are really making golf better.
Q. So that's a great segue to my next question, because you have little young Italian girls who I'm sure are watching the four of you this week do something that no women have ever done before you.  What does that mean when you think about that, that little girls are watching this week thinking, I could do that?
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, I think it's inspiring.  I hope we are able to show them that they can do it, too, and how great of a game golf is, and I hope we can just bring more people to this amazing game.  We have Francesco Molinari doing great things on Tour and I think he has been inspiring a lot of young players and I think we can do the same with this event.
