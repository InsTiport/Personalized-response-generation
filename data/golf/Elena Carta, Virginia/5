 Q.  Tell me a little bit about your play today and kind of coming back from a little bit of a rough day yesterday.  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, happened the same actually last year at the U.S. Am.  I started 3-over the first round and then 3-under the second, I think, so I was expecting to come back today and fight for it, fight to go into match play.  Right after breakfast, I felt very dizzy, so I couldn't really -- the first especially few holes when I was standing putting, I couldn't even like stand, so I was just hoping to hit the ball.  I'm still dizzy.  I'm not feeling very well.  But my caddie and I fought for the spot into the top 64.  That was the goal, and then tomorrow starts a new tournament.  We'll see.  I'm excited for how I played today.   
 Q.  Can you walk me through hole 9 here, what clubs you hit and so forth to get that birdie?  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: Yeah, we calculated really well the wind from the tee, so I hit a very good driver, and then same thing with the second shot.  I had 115 meters, which is like 126 yards, I guess, and we decided to hit a very soft and half 8-iron, which worked out very well.  It was just right of the pin.  And then I rolled in the putt, still hoping just to hit the ball and have a good roll, and it just happened to go in, so I'm very excited to have finished with a birdie.   
 Q.  How is your mindset changing a little bit going into match play tomorrow?  
VIRGINIA ELENA CARTA: I think it's not really going to change that much.  I really wanted this spot into match play, so I think if I fight as I fought today, it's going to be very good in match play, too, because you just need to be in the present and hit one shot at a time.
