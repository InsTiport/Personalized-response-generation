  Q.  How did you feel things were going today?   
 BETSY KING:  Well, we're not quite sure the rest of the morning, but all of them have been pretty close.  The weather is a little bit tough, but both teams are handling it well.   
  
  Q.  And you feel your partnerships are working out pretty well?   
 BETSY KING:  Pretty well.  I think they are for the most part.  You know, we have our lineup for the afternoon and then obviously â   
  
  Q.  What?   
 BETSY KING:  Well, I don't know if it's been announced.  I know we had to turn it in -- starting out with Pat and Brittany going out, and, you know, I don't remember who they're, playing against because I just heard the European side once.  Pat has got a little bit of a short turnaround.  She and Christy played tough this morning, so we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q.  What did you think about the last match?   
 BETSY KING:  Yeah, I'm sure Natalie and Morgan are a little bit disappointed they haven't done a little bit better, and obviously Maria played well and Gladys.  So, you know, it's going to be tough the whole way.  It will be.  I thought it would be, and it's turning out that way.
