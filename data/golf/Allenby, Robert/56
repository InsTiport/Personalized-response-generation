  Q. You were obviously consistent in your approaches today.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: This is just normal, I guess. I don't miss too many normally. I don't try to, anyway.   
 Yeah, I mean, obviously it's telling you that I'm hitting the ball pretty well. I felt like my putting was pretty good, too. There were a few holes out there where I was like 40 feet away and made some easy two-putts. But I feel like I'm playing solid and just have to be there for the weekend.
