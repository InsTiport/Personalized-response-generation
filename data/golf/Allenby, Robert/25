 Q. Real quick talk about the day?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, sure. I played well all day. Drove it well. Hit my irons well into the greens. I think I hit 16 greens, and the two greens I actually missed I was still putting because I was only like a foot off the green. So pretty close to eighteen greens. 
 But I putted well, I did everything well today. I was a bit unlucky with my tee shot on 8 where I hit a 3-iron in there. But I just left myself an impossible putt. But look, overall I'm very happy with the way I played.
