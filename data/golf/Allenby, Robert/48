   ROBERT ALLENBY: Probably about as fair as you're ever going to get it is today. It was set up, I think the TOUR did a good job. They set the course up really well. It's the kind of golf course from what we've seen already this week, could be a nightmare, but the TOUR did a great job in their setup.   
  
  Q. There was a lot of anxiety beforehand on some of the greens or playing a course that was a little different; was that better than expected then?   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: That's a tough question. I really don't know how to answer that in the right way, because I could really get myself into a lot of trouble.   
 They set it up very well. That's as good as I can go on the course. (Laughing).  
  
  Q. How did you play?  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: I played great. I only had two bogeys and two 3-putts. But that was just speed. I'm coming from a long distance away, like on the last hole there, I was 5-iron and in-between clubs and felt it was better to be up short, hit a 45-footer straight down the hill and hit a great first putt, nearly went in and hit it like six feet past and thought it was going to go right.   
  
  Q. Did you get the ball in the fairway mostly?  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: I think they are lucky today that it's not blowing. When the greens are that fast, and especially 18, coming back down to that flag, if it was blowing, if it was blowing over the green and down towards the sea, that green would be unplayable. There are six or seven greens out there where they are so fast already. I think they got rid of the tricky flags today. But they are in fair spots. It's a tricky golf course.
