 Q.   Could we just get some comments?  
ROBERT ALLENBY:   Obviously disappointed, disappointed that I didn't like hit 3‑wood off 18 in regulation, like I should have.   But that's the way it goes, you know.   You make some mistakes sometimes, and that was a major one, obviously.  
I mean I had this tournament in the bag, a two‑shot lead with one hole to play and just played it like a rookie, pretty much.  
   
 Q.   Does it feel like a lifetime ago, that 18 or 72nd hole?  
ROBERT ALLENBY:   Yeah, I played so awesome all day.   I mean I did nothing wrong all day.   I played great, I putted great.   I hit the ball great, and I did everything that I needed to do coming down the stretch and then to give it away at 18 is very, very disappointing.   
You know, it wasn't easy in the playoff as well.   I struggled with my swing a little bit, but I was still mentally not quite there from the 18th hole anyway, but look, John's a great player, and I played with him yesterday, and he's got a great future and he's a young guy, and you know, all the best to him.   
I mean it's great to see him win.
