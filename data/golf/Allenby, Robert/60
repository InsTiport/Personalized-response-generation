   ROBERT ALLENBY: There is a lot of golf to be played. I think anyone under par has a chance of winning.   
  
  Q. Really?  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Absolutely. All of the pressure is on the guys that are leading, and you know, they have got to hold onto it. Unless someone goes out there and just plays exceptional golf in the leading two groups, I just don't see that happening on this golf course. It's not a golf course that you can just go out there under pressure and shoot 6-, 7-under.   
 It's only a 3- to 4-under course. The guys are going to shoot in the morning and that's how they got up to where those scores are and there's no pressure on them. They start six or seven behind and shoot 5-, or 6-under, they can make up a lot of ground. The greens are a little bit bumpier in the afternoon, but it's harder to make putts.   
 I still like my chances. It's just a matter of being a little bit more aggressive and making a few more putts. When I hit bad shots, I didn't make the putts to get up-and-down a couple of times. You've got to do that if you're going to win the tournament. So I need less mistakes for tomorrow and be a little bit more aggressive.   
  
  Q. With the guys on the leaderboard, not a lot of guys with victory; does that help?  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: I don't think so. Even if you've won 50 tournaments, it doesn't help on this golf course. This course, it's tough even when there's no wind.   
 Yeah, I think it's wide open, there's no doubt about it. Definitely wide open for tomorrow.
