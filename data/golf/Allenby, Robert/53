 Q. 69 from you today. Talk about your round. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: A little bit up-and-down. I played pretty solid. Obviously there's some holes out there that are pretty tough. There's some tee shots that are hard to keep it on the fairway. 8 and 9 for two of them. 
 I still can't remember the last time I've hit the eighth fairway and can't remember the last time I made a par on it, either. But look, you know, I played solid. I'm playing well. I'm happy with the way I'm playing. It would have been nice to stay at 4 or even get it to 5. I had some chances, but I just didn't make it when I had the opportunity, really. 
 The front nine, it's not an easy nine. It's a tough nine, and the back nine is kind of like where you can kind of make a score. But there's a couple of -- the easy holes on the front nine I didn't play very well. Well, I didn't make birdies. 
 But you know, overall I'm pretty happy with the way I'm going.

 Q. I know you've been working on your putting. Have you changed a little bit of your putting stroke?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I've changed a lot, actually. I've changed my grip and got a bit of claw action going. Yeah, it's working well. Really the putts, if I miss any putts, it's only because I'm not hitting it hard enough or I've hit it too hard instead of -- I've got rid of the pull and the push. That's kind of a nice thing. 
 The short game feels really good and the long game is starting to match up. Really the last sort of six weeks my long game has been poor, as well. It's pretty hard to compete when you've got a bad short game and then the long game disappears on you, it makes things really interesting.
 But I worked hard last week, and I -- geez, I must have hit at least a couple thousand balls a day last week just to get it right.
