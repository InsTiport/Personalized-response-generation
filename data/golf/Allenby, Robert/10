 Q. How would you assess your day? 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: They played awesome golf. They made a lot of birdies, and making a lot of birdies in foursomes, you're doing very well and it's very hard to beat. 
 We had a couple of putts here and there, maybe a couple of shots here and there, but we tried our best and that's all you can do at the end of the day.

 Q. It's weird, right now, the second-best match performance was from Els and Ishikawa on paper, and they lost because a team won 7-under and there have been a few teams that played much worse and won their match. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: You know, that's The Presidents Cup. That's match play, too. Match play to an absolute T right there. You can play great and lose or play ordinary and win. It really just depends how you get matched up and how the pairings go.
 Look, this golf course, it's in such perfect condition. You know if you hit a 20-footer, you know in ten feet if it's going to go in. Tomorrow we'll come out firing, that's for sure.
