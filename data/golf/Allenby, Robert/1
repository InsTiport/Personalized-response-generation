 Q.  (Question about the round.)  ROBERT ALLENBY: Felt a little bit nervous on the first nine holes, just understandable with what's been going on, and, you know, very hard to put it all to the side when you're out there.  I tried my absolute best, and I think I did a really, really good job overall. Yeah, I was a little bit, you know, a little bit nervous going into 16.  I wasn't really sure what to expect.  But I just knew it was going to be loud and, you know, I was just like, You know what?  Just go with the flow and have fun with it.  You know, just don't let it get to you. And they were actually really good.  I was actually really surprised.  They were fantastic, you know.  There was nothing mean at all.  So, you know, I haven't done anything wrong to anyone, so I really shouldn't, you know...  I think some of the comments were actually pretty funny. But my caddie, Mick, he's an awesome guy.  He kept me pretty cool and kept me relaxed the whole way. I played well on the back 9, my second 9, hit a lot of great shots.  I was super happy to finish under par.  I really was.   Q.  Physically you were good to go?  You were able to concentrate?  ROBERT ALLENBY: You know what?  It's funny.  Today for some reason I had really bad headaches in my left eye before I teed off, and I don't know if that was just nerves, anticipation, what it was, but I took some, I think it was Tylenol Extra Strength just to sort of take the edge off a little bit. It sort of went away a little bit.  But it was there.  It could be allergies, as well, with the desert.
