   ROBERT ALLENBY: It's probably more exaggerated. I didn't hit the ball right early. I didn't get it close. And then I didn't putt fantastic early. The speed was off. I look back, I dried out a little bit. And putting, it was tricky with the wind as well. I sort of managed to sort of steady the ship a little bit through 16 and 17, around there. And didn't play terrible.   
 But finish a double with 8, that didn't help. It was a tough hole regardless. You've got the wind howling off the lip. It's just a tough shot. I was in between a 6 and a 7. Went with a 6 and played it easy and the wind got it and took it into the water. That was pretty much the end of the story there. But it bounced back with a birdie at 9. It's there. But it's just -- it was a bit sloppy on occasion, that's all.
