 Q. It wasn't the best of days there for a while, but you turned it on. Five birdies, I think, the last 10 or 11 holes. Way to come back. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, it was nice. I pulled my finger out of my ass and started playing some golf. I don't know, I struggled a little bit yesterday, and I struggled for the first sort of five, six, seven holes -- seven holes, really. Just my club selections kept coming up short and just putting myself in terrible position. And then I just said, bugger it, and started being aggressive and started making some birdies, so it was nice.

 Q. With four in a row coming in there, it changes your whole outlook, I'm sure, for the weekend. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, after 7 I looked at the board and it said I was coming about 64th or something. I thought, that's not good; I don't want to go home. So come on, pull my finger out. It was good. It was nice. It was nice to -- I think I got myself back down inside the 30s now. 
 You know, it's a long way to go, 36 holes, so I know what I've got to do and I know how I've got to play on the weekend. So hopefully I can continue the last 10 or 11 holes over the weekend. That would be nice. I mean, there's no reason why I shouldn't. My whole game is all there, it's just a matter of getting the mental side right.
