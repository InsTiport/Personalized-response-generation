  Q.  Just a couple of general comments on your round.  Your score 4 under 68.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY:  I actually shot 5, but that's all right.   
  
  Q.  5, sorry.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY:  Yeah, played pretty good.  And I just, I played solid.  I didn't do anything special.  I just played nicely, just sort of cruised along.   
  
  Q.  Is the course and the fairways are they still a little damp?   
 ROBERT ALLENBY:  Actually thought, believe it or not, I thought the greens were a lot softer today than yesterday.  Don't know why.  Maybe they water them overnight, I don't know.  And then yesterday it seemed like the ball was releasing more than it was today.   
  
  Q.  Then finally, just assess your game as it is right now just overall?   
 ROBERT ALLENBY:  My game, it's there.  It's all there.  The body is just waiting for three weeks off.  So I just scrape through this week and see how we go this week.   
 But, you know, it's all there.  It's normally always all there.  It's only the brain that gets in the way.   
  
  Q.  Okay, great.
