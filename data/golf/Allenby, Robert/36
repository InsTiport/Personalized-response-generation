 Q. Well, you kind of run into a buzzsaw at the 9th, that was a body blow having got to that stage where he got out of jail at the 8th, as well, didn't he?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I definitely should have won 8. Just hit a bad chip into it the grain there. This grass gets really wiry, and I hit a poor chip the hole before it, so that didn't help. 
 But anyway, you know, I just didn't quite play quite until enough this afternoon, and you know, he hit a lot of great shots and made a lot of good putts. 

 Q. 8 and 9 were probably the pivotal holes. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: 7, as well. 7, 8, 9; I shouldn't have missed the green there. I was just trying to get too cute. But that's the way it goes. The putter was pretty cold this afternoon. 

 Q. You said at lunchtime that you felt you needed to make a few, and you didn't get them. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: It's nice when they tell us on the third hole or fourth hole that they have double-cut them and double-rolled them; instead of every other day they told us that they had done that prior, 14 off. 

 Q. So you went into it cold in that respect?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Well, I had a putt on 2 -- my birdie putt from about 15, 20 feet and I knocked it off the green. Well, nearly. 
 You know, I'm like, shouldn't be that quick. And then I find out that they have double-cut them, and they have obviously watered the greens. We thought they were going to be hard and fiery and bounce, and it was soft as. 
 So, you know what, it made it perfect, it was just like American conditions. And obviously we are both used to it. 
 He putted well and hit a lot of great shots.
