 Q. Robert, you came really close. I know you got to be disappointed with some of those putts you hit today. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I'm disappointed. You know, I hit some putts that could have gone in. I mean, the greens are pretty bumpy and it's really hard. 
 The thing is when you're putting on greens like this it's so hard to commit to hit like, you know, a foot, two feet past the hole. 
 You know, I was just too tentative really over the weekend. Yesterday was probably my downfall. I probably left seven or eight putts out there yesterday. In hindsight, I know I should have won this tournament. There's no doubt about it. The putter just got a bit scared. That's all.

 Q. Seemed like your commitment was better today, and your focus with your putter, especially early on?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I mean, you know, I had to regroup last night. I putted for about an hour on the putting green after I finished. Just tried to regroup and jsut try and go back to the basics and just allow myself to get out of my way. 
 Because that's all it is. Whenever you got a flaw in something, it's only because your focused so much on a particular thing. Obviously with me it's the putter, and I just tried to get out of my own way. 
 That putt on the last, it was -- I should have hit it a bit harder. I haven't hit one all day, so...

 Q. You're having a great season. Keep playing well.
