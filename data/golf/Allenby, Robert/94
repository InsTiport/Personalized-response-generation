ROBERT ALLENBY: "He's a player that everyone looks up to. Just like when Ernie sorry, when Tiger and Vijay and Goosen, when they play, and you know, you just think those four, they are the four to beat; and when Mickelson plays, as well, there are five. I guess with the PGA coming up, everyone is going to miss him there. I think as far as the Presidents Cup goes, I mean, he has a major role there. He is obviously Vijay is in there, but Ernie is the man that normally you put against someone like Tiger and competes against him, and enjoys competing against him. I think for the Presidents Cup team for the International side, it's a huge loss. You know, he's either going to win or he's either going to halve pretty much his matches, and it really makes the International Team a little bit weaker now with not having his appearance there. I'm sure Gary (Player) is going to be disappointed, but on the other side, we all hope for a fast recovery for him, from this injury."
Q. Any chance of rallying around this on the International side? You lose one of the big guys on your team and you're obviously going to be a big underdog or somewhat of an underdog now without Ernie.
ROBERT ALLENBY: "Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a huge loss for the team. And it's not only for his play but his presence, just his experience under pressure and just the way he conducts himself with the other players in some of the meetings and stuff like that. He's always speaking out and letting us all in on some information, and it's all valuable information that always comes out of his mouth. You know, you always get that from your captain and your co captain, but a player of his stature to come out and give you that vote of confidence, will definitely be missed."
