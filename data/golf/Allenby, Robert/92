GORDON SIMPSON:  Robert, welcome back to the Vines and I think last three starts you won the Open, the PGA and the Masters, how about a four timer here in Australia?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Yeah, it would be nice, that's why I'm here to try and do it.  Yeah, obviously I definitely got my game into sixth gear and hopefully I can find that form that I had then for this week.
GORDON SIMPSON:  What was your assessment of your first start last week?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Last week was just pretty much to get rid of the rust and seven weeks off.  I took five weeks completely off golf, never touched a golf club.  I definitely felt a lot better for it.  I had two weeks of practice and then I played last week.  The first two days I played great.  The first day I didn't make many putts.

Then on the Friday, I played really good and then woke up Saturday and my back had gone, so that was not a very good weekend.  It was due to just I had not played much and my back locked up and made it pretty hard to make any turn.  I feel good right now, so I'm happy with the way my golf is.  Apart from a few extra pounds, I feel pretty good.
Q.  What's going to be, the back this year
ROBERT ALLENBY:  It's not going to be anything.  Last week was last week and this week is this week, and this week I feel great.
Q.  How does it feel?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Fine.  The hands are still the same, still have the swelling and stuff in the joints, but the hand injury part with the glass is fine.  It's not even an issue, it's gone.
Q.  What was the geography, did you go from Melbourne to Phoenix or Florida to Phoenix?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  I went from Florida.  I've been in the States since the 28th of December.
Q.  Is that the longest break you've had?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  That's the longest break I've ever had, apart from my car accident in '96 where I broke my sternum and I was forced to have some time off there.

Pretty much in the 15, 16 years I've been a pro, I've never taken seven weeks off.  The most I've ever taken is probably two or three weeks.
Q.  The Australian Order of Merit    is that one of the reasons why you're here this week?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  No.  I'm here because Johnnie Walker run a great tournament, always has and I've always enjoyed all of the Johnnie Walker Classics I've ever played in.  Obviously I won the Johnnie Walker Classic when it was at Royal Melbourne, that was my first    well, it was my second pro victory, but really my first big tournament that I had won.  I've always had a soft spot for this tournament and played well enough in Asia.

You know, it's really nice to come back here this week and play here.  Perth is one of my favorites cities in the country, and I have family over here.  Obviously with the way I played at the end of last year, it could be a great opportunity to try to make it four in a row.
Q.  Nobody's done thatÃ¢ï¿½ ¦
ROBERT ALLENBY:  No none has ever done the three, so obviously the four would be even better.
Q.  What do you think of the course now with the different front nine?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  The golf course, both nines are in great condition.  The front nine is definitely a totally different nine to the back nine.

I like it.  I think it's good.  I think it's a good challenge.  It's a good challenge off the tee.  I forgot how tight this golf course really was.  You know, obviously I've won at this golf course before, but not with this front nine.

The golf course definitely seems a lot tighter than last time I was here, but then we are hitting it about 30, 40 yards further than probably the last time I was here.  So you know, where I was hitting driver now I'm hitting 3 woods and I'm hitting it past where I was hitting driver.  So now some holes out there, I can't hit driver because there's nowhere to hit it.

You know, I think it's going it be a good test of golf.  Obviously most afternoons, wind gets up, it's a good test.  That back nine is a good closing few holes.
Q.  Do you set your schedule looking at the majors this year?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  I've always set my year looking to the majors.
Q.  But with the Majors specifically in mind?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Absolutely.  Until I've won about 15 over there    I don't worry about that.  I'll leave that one for Tiger.  I think he'll be the only one that will be able to match that.
Q.  Who are the dangers this week?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Obviously you've got Retief Goosen in the field, Michael Campbell, Fred Couples is here, too, capable of doing anything.  Obviously a lot of the local guys, Nick O'Hern, he's been playing great and I think his time will come pretty soon before he knocks on the door and brings home the trophy.  I guess he's a local.  He probably would be one of the favorites definitely for the tournament.

But then you've got Monty and there's a lot of players.  Anyone in the field could win but there's probably about a good 20 players that could really win.
Q.  The greens were running about 11.5 on the Stimpmeter this morning -  do you think that's about right?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Must have been on the downslope.  They are not that quick at the flag.
Q.  Do you think they are in good shape?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  I think the greens are fantastic.  I think they are great.  I think they are rolling really well, and I think if they don't water them much, they will be a lot better.  They are definitely a bit soft at the moment and the ball is backing up.  The ball is not plugging in the fairway.

I think the greens    if they do that, if they ease off on the water a little bit, then the course will be a little firmer and probably play tougher, because then the ball will be rolling on the fairway and the on the green, you can release a little bit more and catch some of those slopes, so then you have to pit position iron shots, not only off the tee but into the greens with your irons.

I think the greens will get quicker as the week wears on.  The weather is going to be warm and they are just protecting the greens at the moment, especially with the Pro Am.  I think tomorrow will be a little bit different and it will be a little bit different every day.
