Q.  Robert, what happened there on 18 on your second shot?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Well, I've had a cramp for the last three holes in my right calf.  I felt it on pretty much the last three holes.  I'm not looking for any excuses or anything like that.

I was a bit quick with the swing there, trying to make sure I got it right up in the middle of the green, got a little quick on the swing and blocked it out to the right.

It wasn't the best of lies and I wasn't really in a position where I could be really delicate with the chip shot, and it bounced, the club bounced, went across the green.  I wasn't expecting him to miss that putt.
Q.  Have you played with this condition before, ever had a cramp in your leg before?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  Yeah, a few times.  You know, that's just the way it is.  Look, we both sort of battled around there all day, and he made a few more birdies than me.  At least I made it interesting.

He's just come off a blitz yesterday, so I knew he was going to be pretty strong today.  I had my chances and probably a better shot at the last would have been a lot better result.
Q.  When did it cramp up on you?
ROBERT ALLENBY:  About three holes ago.
