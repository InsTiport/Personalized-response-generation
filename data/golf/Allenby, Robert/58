   No bogeys...  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: That's always a key, but the other key is the five birdies. I played solid and didn't really do anything fancy. I just made a few birdies and if I needed to save par, I seemed to make the putts for par. It was good and I'm happy with 5 under.  
 On his five birdies...   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: I never really hit any approaches super close, but I did have a couple of tap-ins on the par 5s. I had a chance on 15 for eagle from about 15 feet, but I missed that just on the high side. I don't feel like I made a lot of mistakes. I just managed myself well around the golf course.   
 On Woods being 7 under in the morning...   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Obviously they had perfect conditions with no wind and the greens were perfect. The greens got a little firm towards the end of the round today, and a little bit choppy. But the whole golf course is in unbelievable shape; probably top three on Tour. Definitely.
