ROBERT ALLENBY:  That was a good way to finish! I tried to cut in a five iron and came out of the shot and didn't execute properly. I got a lucky bounce and after that I think the eagle putt was meant to be.

I made a lot of mistakes this week and overall there was still some rust in my game. If I had played one or two more tournaments before this I might have been ready to play.

I got away to a good start with four birdies but didn't commit at the next four holes. Not deliberately, of course, but it was mighty hot out there and I lost my focus and momentum. The bogey on the 12th was silly. I had 80 yards left and I went for the sucker pin and I was the sucker! Went over the back of the green.

I said to my caddie, I needed to finish birdie, birdie, eagle and I finished par, birdie, eagle, so that wasn't too bad. I don't think it's enough. Kevin is playing too well to come back to me, but you never know.
