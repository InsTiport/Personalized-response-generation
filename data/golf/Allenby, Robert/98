ROBERT ALLENBY:  That doesn't matter.  A win is a win.  It was definitely nice to hole because it wasn't the easiest putt to hole.  I played solid, had a lot of birdies, so it makes it tough.  Brian played well, I probably made about four or five more birdies than him, so it makes it tough if your opponent is making a lot of putts and birdies.

Q.  What was kind of the overall feeling of your game today? 
ROBERT ALLENBY:  I probably only maybe missed one fairway, and that makes -- needless to say when you're talking a couple yards on the fairway it doesn't matter because the rough is pretty generous, the first cut, so I drove the ball very well, always kept myself in play.  A couple times it was out of play, so I made it tough on him.

Q.  Nice to want to go all the way to Sunday, but it's nice to not have to go home the first day and you don't have to have your weekend start on a Wednesday. 
ROBERT ALLENBY:  It's nice to get the first one over and done with.  I haven't been playing well the first few weeks, and I played really well, so I'm happy with that.
