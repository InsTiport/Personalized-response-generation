   ROBERT ALLENBY: It's always nice to have a hole-in-one. Obviously that hole was playing straight into, about 180 yards, I guess. I thought it's probably better to be up than short. So I took a 5-iron and just hit it, put it up in the air and hit the shot, and landed about three feet short and just trickled into the hole.

 Q. 6-under par heading into the weekend, is this a golf course you can be aggressive on?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: You can if you put your tee shot in the right spot, sure. But if you don't put your tee shot in the right spot, you're battling trying to get it around all these trees. There's a tree to go around every hole if you put your tee shot in the wrong spot.

 Q. The wind picked up this afternoon, 5-under par, pretty good round?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I played great. On the par-5 I left it a millimeter short for eagle, my putt. And then I left it another millimeter short on the next hole for birdie, too.
 I'm happy with my game. I'm happy to be here for the weekend. I'm just having a good time hanging out in the boat, and have a few buddies coming around tonight for a few beers.
