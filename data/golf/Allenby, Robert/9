  Q. Obviously got off to a tough start but pulled it back. Just some comments on the match, how you guys combined and general comments.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Obviously they played extremely well. You know, they never really let up really the whole way. So, yeah, I mean, look, we played okay. We played okay. A couple of tee shots that -- my tee shot down 15 was not great, under a tree but we managed to get away with a halve which was surprising. I made a good putt for a 5.   
 Yeah, there was a couple of holes we were out of play a little bit. But at least we fought all the way, that's for sure.   
  
  Q. Just talk about the conditions, obviously experiencing something different today than the last couple of days, but you've obviously experienced it here before?  
 ROBERT ALLENBY: The golf course is definitely more accessible today. It's definitely -- it's there, but it's still tough. It's tricky. And that's Royal Melbourne. It's just such a tricky putting course. We hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, and they made a couple at the right time.   
  
  Q. Did you have any concerns, the International Team, about this format? It's been sort of a bugaboo I guess after the first day, the result, being two behind. Do you feel that the pairings for these five matches were pretty good?   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: We all felt pretty comfortable with how everything was going, and you know, our pairings and that. We liked our pairings the first day and we like our pairings today. I mean, Geoff and I are pretty good together. But I just didn't -- yeah, I mean, you know, match play is such a fiddly game. You can play well and lose and you can play bad and win. It's just one of those things.
