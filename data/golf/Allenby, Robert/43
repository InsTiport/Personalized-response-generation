  Q. Huge point for you.   
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, we were very comfortable until 15 and make a bogey and next thing you know we are playing 17. But Robert made a great putt there to go 1-up.   
  
  Q. And Lucas missed the putt on 17. When you see all that's going on, are you paying attention to the scoreboard or just your match?   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Not really. Today my focus was just like Vijay, it was to try to get a point out of it for us. I think it's important to focus on what you're doing and worry about everything else after you're finished.  
 You know what, we're up against two major champions today, and they are very good players and that's why we knew they were going to hang in there all the way to the end.   
  
  Q. How about that putting, tell me about the putts at 2 and 3, that had to be huge.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: It was. Got us off to a good start. It helps when you have got a good partner. Vijay is awesome.   
 We just sort of strolled along and before we knew it, we had a few birdies in the first six holes. But you know, you've got to do it in this format, especially when you're up against Lucas Glover and Stewart Cink, two major winners this year.   
 We knew it was going to be a tough battle, that's for sure, but we stuck to our game plan and we played well.   
  
  Q. You shot 4-under on the front nine; that really put a lot of heat on them.   
 VIJAY SINGH: The goal was to hit a lot of greens, and try not to lose the hole with bogeys. We did that on 15, but you know, Robert made some great putts from the start, and we just hung in there. They are strong players and they are both long hitters and they were going to be tough to beat.   
 We played well. We just stayed very patient all day and pulled out a win.
