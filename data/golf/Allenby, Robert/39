  Q. Nice match, 18 wasn't quite how you wanted it.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: It was a crap lie where Vijay left me, but I was sitting way down and I tried to just punch a 5-wood out and just run it up like I did the other day. But it was such a bad lie.   
 I was hoping to get it up sort of a little bit closer to the green. Vijay hit a great shot in that just got unlucky, hit a soft spot.  
 And I thought I hit a good putt. It was pretty slow up that hill, and we both read it and we thought it was going to break from the right lip and it pretty much just stayed right out there.   
 But you know what, it was good. I made a great putt at 16 and 17, so you know, could have gone the other way. So you've got to accept what happens, and a halve is better than a loss.  
  
  Q. But you're playing well.   
 ROBERT ALLENBY: I'm playing nicely. Putting good.  
  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I got off to a rough start, but I spoke with my caddie, Mr. Kato, and we checked on some things and I was able to play better. I'm looking forward to the afternoon.   
  
  Q. Is there good chemistry by Y.E. and you?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: The course and format is very difficult, but I have been able to play relaxed. There were pressure situations, but I was able to overcome it.   
  
  Q. Talk about your match in the afternoon against Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker.   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: They are definitely the stronger team, but I feel that the International Team has some momentum, and I feel like we have a great chance in the afternoon.   
 I want to do my best and be able to contribute.
