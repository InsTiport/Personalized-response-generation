Q.   People have been saying all morning it looks like the scores are out there for the making, but nothing much is happening.   What's going on? 
ROBERT ALLENBY:   Yeah, I mean, this course‑‑ if you're ever going to shoot a low one, it was going to be today, I think because the wind is not too bad out there, especially early this morning it was really benign.   So, I don't know.   Just it was hard to get close on some holes and some putts looked like they were going in that didn't.   Yeah, I really, I don't know.   Obviously, Timmy Clark played all right, so, yeah. 
I'm happy with my score, but I probably should have been a couple better than what I was.   I played good enough to shoot 4 or 5‑under today, maybe 6.   But that's golf, you know?   I just made two silly bogeys out there in the middle of my back nine coming in, but, yeah.

Q.   If you hit it well, that's got to make you feel good going into tomorrow?
ROBERT ALLENBY:   Yeah, I've been hitting the ball well for a while now.   It's just a matter of making a few putts.   That's all.
