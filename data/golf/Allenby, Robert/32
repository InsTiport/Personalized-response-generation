 Q. You've got to be pretty happy with today even though some of the bumps got to you a little bit?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, it's a tricky course, and it's a difficult course to actually get close on the greens. You know, it's one of those days, concentration level wasn't 100 percent, but I'm still there.

 Q. It's not easy to stay focused on a golf course this beautiful and fighter jets flying over all the time. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: You know what, I'm happy with where I am. 

 Q. You've got to be one of the guys thinking to yourself I'm happy pretty we're going back to the South Course for the weekend. 
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Yeah, I played pretty well yesterday. I hope I have two more of those in me. That would be 10-under. That would probably be pretty good on the weekend. 

 Q. What color are you wearing tomorrow?
 ROBERT ALLENBY: Well, I don't normally wear pink on Fridays, I wear pink on Sundays, but today (inaudible) that's why I wore pink today. I don't know, maybe blue tomorrow?
