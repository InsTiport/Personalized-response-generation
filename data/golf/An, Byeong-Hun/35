 Q.   What do you think of your second round here in perfect conditions?  
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   It was good.   I did pretty well today and hit some proper putts but didn't hit as close as yesterday.   Definitely take my round today.  
   
 Q.   Some nice red figures against your name to move up that board on the back nine?  
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, I think I hit it better on the back nine and gave myself more chances.   Quite happy at the moment.  
   
 Q.   These are perfect conditions but it's not easy, is it.   Some of the pins are tucked away?  
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, exactly, they are tucked away and greens are getting firmer.   Not easy to get close to some of the flags, because the greens are firming, this really makes it tougher.  
   
 Q.   This is one of those courses you learn how to play, you learn some of those nuances of the greens and positions to hit it?  
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Definitely, yeah, because it was a bit soft this morning and you have to adjust to the firmness of the green.   I think I did it quite well this afternoon, and, well, it requires a different shot on every hole.  
   
 Q.   How is confidence at the moment?   This is a nice regular habit you seem to have over a couple of tournaments?  
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, I've been playing well, so big confidence.   Been playing pretty well the last couple rounds.   
   
 Q.   Obviously we are seeing you when you are looking very nice and relaxed.   Is this a general character trait?   
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely.   Try to not get nervous.   Doesn't help.   Just try to get relaxed and play with no pressure, but more focus, definitely.
