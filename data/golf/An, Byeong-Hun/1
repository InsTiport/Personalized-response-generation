BEN AN: There are a lot of awkward number holes off the tee, like 18.  I don't know.  I'm hitting pretty well, that helps.  I hit a lot of greens today, to be honest.  And I had a lot of birdie chances.
Q. Feel like you're trending towards a good result?  Your scoring is coming back?
BEN AN: Yeah, I struggled with the putting.  And putting at Phoenix, I got top-10.  And at the Wells Fargo and Byron Nelson.  That was the key for me this season, putting.  But my shot's been always there, I think.
And probably same as this week, if I get the putting in the plus area, I think I can make a good score and I definitely worked hard on it and it seems like it's paying off.
Q. Did you do anything specific?  Just hard working on the putting?
BEN AN: Yeah, mostly distance control, because I think that's really important in putting, because if your speed is off it won't go in.  And that's the only thing you can control is your speed on putts.  So I worked on that.  But everything, short putts, long putts, I tried to work hard.  And it's paying off.  I'm not going to pull it out every week, but at least I'm putting well some of those days.
Q. Try to limit the three-putts?
BEN AN: Exactly.  Three-putts, yeah, definitely you can limit it.  That's the key this week, too, with the fast greens.
Q. How many times have you played here before?
BEN AN: The third time.  I think I missed the cut way back when.  You have to hit it really straight and hit a lot of greens, to be honest.  You have to do everything to win here.  But there is long rough out here.  It's hard to get them to hold on the green.
