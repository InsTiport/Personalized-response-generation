Q.   Your thoughts on 5‑under par?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Very happy.   Could have made more putts but quite happy with it.   Good start.

Q.   Challenging course, isn't it, so anything like that is very rewarding?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, I think I've been lucky this afternoon.   The wind died down.   Still, it's a tough course and tough greens to read.   Some of the holes are quite long, and some of the par3s, too.   Really happy with my score.

Q.   Are you feeling all the positives taken from last week, just knowing that it rolls on from one week to the next?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely.   Definitely got a lot of confidence from last week.   I was hitting it great, even today I was hitting it really well.   I'm hitting it great at the moment. 

Q.   What do you think of Qatar? 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   It's a good place.   It's really good.   The hotel is great, and I'm loving it so far.   The food is good and the course is great. 

Q.   Is that when you look for in a tournament, as well? 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely.   Really happy with this course. 

Q.   It's important to get off to a good start for 2015, isn't it?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely, especially the first couple of events, I think it's really important.   Quite happy with how I started last week, so hopefully I'll get a couple better this week.
