Q.   Am I right to assume that that's a very happy way to finish the Qatar Masters? 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely.   Definitely play my‑‑ I didn't play‑‑ if I made everything, I would have won but I still played pretty well today.   I'm happy with it.

Q.   And it looked like chance upon chance.   You did play particularly well?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   I did have many chances today and I got some good par saves but I missed a couple birdie putts.   Could have been better, but 65, I'll definitely take it.

Q.   What are your thoughts on the last, because that's so agonizing, almost in. 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, after I putted, pushed it a little bit.   Definitely didn't deserve to make it but it looked like it was going in. 

Q.   What is your gut feeling; that you'll just miss out on the victory?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, probably, because there's some easy holes coming in, 16, 17 and 18 is a par 5.   Anything can happen, but I think I can go take a shower now.   There's a couple guys ahead of me. 

Q.   Particularly good for a finish on The European Tour. 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Yeah, definitely.   My goal is Top‑10 this week.   I think I did it.   So quite happy this week.   So we'll see what happens. 

Q.   We've seen you not evenly here but Abu Dhabi as well.   Does this all bode well for 2015? 
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   It's a good start, definitely.   Missed out Top‑10 by a shot last week, but kept the momentum going.

Q.   How beneficial was The Challenge Tour to you, because you've now seen the world a bit more and experienced different things?
BYEONG‑HUN AN:   Definitely helped me a lot.   The last three years, I definitely felt it developed my game, The Challenge Tour, and definitely helped me a lot.   Got all prepared for the big tour, and I think definitely helped.
