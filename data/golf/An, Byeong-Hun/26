 Q.  Thoughts on a round like this that keeps you nicely in the mix?  
BYEONG HUN AN: It wasn't a good day.  I struggled most of the time.  Got some good par saves and nice bogey save on the last hole.  Still shot under par.   
 Q.  Looks like a few up-and-downs out there today.  The weather conditions aren't helping presumably.  
BYEONG HUN AN: No, it was a bit cold.  Cold out and a bit windy out there than yesterday.  That's why you didn't see many low course today I think.   
I don't think the ball is flying very far, at least for me, this week and it's hard to judge the distance in the wind, so it's rough out there.   
 Q.  We always talk about having perhaps one bad round during the week, and if this is it, it's not too bad, it is.  
BYEONG HUN AN: I'll take it.  If this is the worst round this week, I'll definitely take it, under par.  Well, two more days and hopefully improve from today's round.   
 Q.  You've been playing a lot of golf lately, so how are the energy levels?  
BYEONG HUN AN: Don't feel tired or anything.  Always after a round today, feet hurt or a bit of fatigue but next day it's fine.   
 Q.  Still an awful lot to play for.  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yes, we got next week, as well, so six more rounds and hopefully I finish strong.
