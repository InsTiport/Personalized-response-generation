Q. After winning here two years ago, the defense last year didn't go as planned but you played your way in contention with a great second round today?
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, I'm in good form coming in here.  I was hitting pretty well, and my putts are dropping.  Seems like it's working that way.  I'm in better form than last year to be honest coming in here.  We've got two more days and hopefully I get a couple going.
Q. I think only two guys went around bogey-free yesterday.  You've just got one dropped shot on the car today.  That's quite difficult around this course, even with the changes that have been made?
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, I think so.  They are quite tough flags out there and greens are firmer.  I got some great up-and-downs today.  I chipped it great and I putted great.  So it was pretty good.  It's not easy out there.  You easily make bogeys out there, yeah, definitely.
Q. Fantastic experience for you two years ago.  What's it like for you coming back here knowing you've already won this tournament?
BYEONG HUN AN: Well, even with the course changes, the layout looks really similar.  Just a couple bunkers out and greens a bit firmer.  You know you've played well here, and even last year I think I played pretty well but just didn't do well on the weekend.  I still feel pretty confident on this course.  It's good.
