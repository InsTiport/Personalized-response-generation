Q. That was quite a match.
BYEONG-HUN AN: Well, the whole day I just kept making pars, and Jason missed some good birdies.  And just what happened to me yesterday, exactly.  I was 3-up and a lot of holes to go and I made some good pars and some good saves here and there.  The last four shots on the last four holes.
Q. Do you like this format?
BYEONG-HUN AN: Yeah, I think so.  It's fun.  If you have some bad days you can still win.  You can play well but still lose.  I always play my own game.  If he plays well, then he deserves to win.  I'm happy with it.
Q. You've got Rickie tomorrow.  Are you looking forward to that match?
BYEONG-HUN AN: Yeah, it will be fun.  A lot of people are going to watch.  I'm looking forward to playing with him.
