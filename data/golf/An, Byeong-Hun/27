Q. Talk about how good a 65 is around a pretty long and tough track.
BYEONG HUN AN: It was tough.  The ball didn't fly very far, I think, for me and the playing partners the ball didn't fly very far, and the greens are quite nice I think to play, pretty wet.  Some spike marks but they rolled pretty nicely.  The round is just really good.  I think I hit 17 or 18 greens today, so quite happy with that.
Q. That's nice, isn't it, and consistent and giving yourself plenty of opportunities as a result.
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, every hole, I would say most, at least 12 or 13 holes, they were all in birdie range of say 20 feet, and hit it really well today.  The shots I missed, I made good 2-putts from everywhere.  Otherwise, it was a good round overall.
Q. Your playing partner, Victor Dubuisson, comes off that victory, but he was saying that when he's playing at this kind of level, while you have to work at it, at the same time it comes naturally.  Are you finding that at the moment at your level?
BYEONG HUN AN: I've been playing well the last two weeks.  So I'm not sure if I have -- I probably have a comfort but I'm hitting it well.  It's what it is what it is; if I play well, if I make a good score, it's good, and if not I've just got to take it.
Q. I know everybody is looking to get better regardless of how well they are playing but do you find that you have to work on it a lot or just free-wheel a little bit?
BYEONG HUN AN: I definitely have to work it.  Nothing is really easy and if I don't practise -- if I can win, that's almost impossible, because there are so many good players out here, and trying to win and compete.  So I definitely need to work.
Q. Are you looking at The Race to Dubai and the rankings for that?
BYEONG HUN AN: Try to not look at it because we've still got two more events and this week is big, and especially next week.  So just trying my best.
