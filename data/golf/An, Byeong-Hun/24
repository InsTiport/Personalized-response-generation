 Q.  Awesome how close you\'ve come.  
BYEONG HUN AN: It was so close today.  Well, missed a couple birdie putts I think, and well, as I say, it wasn\'t a poor effort.  I gave everything.  Would have been nice if I dropped more putts.  But made a couple other par putts.  So it equals out I think.   
 Q.  Did you feel good throughout the day, because it seemed like a late run to have that birdie at the penultimate hole to give yourself a chance.  
BYEONG HUN AN: It was kind of a shaky start.  The front nine, I didn\'t get anything going.  Made a great par on 10.  Thought that was going to be the booster.  But yeah, made a nice birdie on 17 just to have a chance going to 18.  Had a great chance but misread it a bit.  It was a great putt.  Miss-read it.  It happens.   
 Q.  It\'s a long wait, as well, wasn\'t it?  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yes, it was.  Definitely gave me time to read my putt.  It was close.  It was a great putt.  Just didn\'t drop at the end.   
 Q.  Overall, very positive into Dubai, given the finishes that you\'ve had of late.  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yes, yes.  I\'ve been playing well.  It feels like today wasn\'t my best day, and hopefully next week I\'ll have more best days.  I think I\'ll be in contention again.
