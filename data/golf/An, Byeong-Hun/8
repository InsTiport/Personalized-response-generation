 Q.  How pleased are you with that 67?  
BYEONG HUN AN: I'm pleased, except the last hole.  It wasn't an easy 2-putt from the front of the green, but other than that, I think I putted great.  My putting speed was good.  I hit some good shots, and when I hit some bad shots, I got a nice up-and-down.   
Overall, I thought I drove it better than the last two days and hopefully I'll drive it better tomorrow.   
 Q.  The putt on 18?  
BYEONG HUN AN: It's front edge.  I think the greens got really grainy this year compared to the last two years.  I had a tough time reading the putts, especially short ones.   
I had good speed just right of the hole about six feet.  We thought it was going to break like right edge, and it broke more at the start.  Just went left and missed it left.  I think it was a good roll.  I just misread it.  As long as I put a good roll; I'm not happy that I missed, but okay with it.   
 Q.  How important was a quick start in terms of momentum of the round?  
BYEONG HUN AN: I had some good first couple holes the last three days.  I've made some good birdies on 3 and 4 today.   
Bogey-free is always good.  I bogeyed No. 5 twice already and said, okay, let's just try to make par.  I've been driving it off-line the last few days, and it makes it so much harder when you're in the rough.  The wind direction changed a little bit, makes it easier.  I drove it better and that's why the scores were lower.   
 Q.  11-under, where do you think that will be and how much are you looking forward to tomorrow?  
BYEONG HUN AN: I think probably the last three holes are easy today.   It's playing mostly downwind and pins are accessible, especially the last hole.   
I don't know.  All depends how they play.  Hopefully, I think I'll be in the Top-10, that's for sure.  11-under is not too bad, and we have one more day.
