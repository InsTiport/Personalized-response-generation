Q. You'll be first off tomorrow, I'm sure pretty excited and important to get the first point for Team Asia?
BYEONGHUN AN: I'm second off I think.
Q. With Thongchai, second match.  Important to get the first few points for Team Asia?
BYEONGHUN AN: Definitely, it's good to have a good start.  It's like a momentum thing, you get a good start and see what happens.  I'm really excited to play with Thongchai, which is a great player with good experience.  I have to do my part first and I'm sure he'll do his.  I'm trusting his game and we will see what happens.  I'm sure we'll play well.
Q. This is the first time you're playing together with Thongchai, especially in a match-play event.  How important is it to calm your nerves down?
BYEONGHUN AN: I played with him a couple times last season in The Race to Dubai.  I think I know his game and he knows my game and we can take care of each other.  Not really nervous because I'm playing with someone I know already.  So it makes me really comfortable and Jeev wants us to feel comfortable.  It's good to have a little bonding between the teammates, so I think that's the key.  So I'm really excited to play with him.
Q. Your thoughts on Danny and Matthew?
BYEONGHUN AN: Definitely good players.  I don't know, I haven't seen them for like a month so I don't know how they are playing.  But I'm sure they are great players and it's going to be tough tomorrow.  But I think we've got a good chance.
