Q. Thoughts on our play across the course of this week?
BYEONGHUN AN: Well, we definitely had a positive feelings.  Doesn't matter if you're down, we just definitely had hopes of beating them, because we saw two years ago from 5-0 to tie the match.  After our first round, it was a better start than two years ago.  But unfortunately yesterday, we didn't play great.   Singles is definitely not easy matches.  There are a lot of big names.  It was a bit of struggle for me, as well, but overall it was a great experience for me.
Q. It is a young European Team, but you still recognise there's that experience that perhaps was the telling factor?
BYEONGHUN AN: Yes, definitely.  You see those names, Poults, Westy, they have played many Ryder Cup events and have plenty of experience.  You can see by the records they had this week.  Doesn't mean they are a bad player because they are young.  They are all experienced and they did great, successful seasons.  They are great golfers.  It's a pretty good team.
Q. Do you take anything away from this personally, as a positive ahead of the year?
BYEONGHUN ANN: Yeah, personally, I played pretty well this week I think and missed a couple shots but overall I think I'm ready for the season and just didn't putt well.  Need some birdies in match play but didn't do that today.
Overall, I played great.  So I'm looking forward to next week.
