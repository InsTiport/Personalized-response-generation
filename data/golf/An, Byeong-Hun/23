 Q.  Your thoughts how it's panned out across the course of this week.  
BYEONG HUN AN: Well, those two guys ran away.  I didn't have my best day.  It was obviously a struggle, seemed like on the fairways, green, 2-putt.  Made some great par saves, too.  It was all right.  Tied fourth is pretty good.   
 Q.  And it looked like it was going to be an exceptional day, and the way you holed the putt at the very first hole and a few gains after that.  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yeah, definitely.  It was still a bit windy out there and a bit tricky to judge the distance and everything.  Yeah, I've done quite well today to hold on.   
 Q.  Is that a nice relief and you can let those shoulders drop and relax and reflect on it all?  
BYEONG HUN AN: Yes, I'll have a week off and it will be like heaven.  I think I've done pretty well this season and now I can rest without the pressure.   
 Q.  What did you expect going into 2015 and how much have you exceeded those expectations?  
BYEONG HUN AN: Definitely exceeded.  It just seems I'm Top-10 in The Race to Dubai right now and never thought about it -- even Top 60.  It definitely was a great season for me.
