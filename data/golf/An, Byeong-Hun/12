 Q.  How would you describe the day?  
BYEONG-HUH AN: Well, it was a bit down at the start.  I was 3-down after 7, I think.  I had a chance to close out 17, but it wasn't an easy putt, I left the door open for Rickie.  It was a nice birdie to finish the hole.   
 Q.  Now you move into the ultimate knockout round.  Does it change your mindset at all?  
BYEONG-HUH AN: Not really.  I'm looking forward to it.
