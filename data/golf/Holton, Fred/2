 Q. How do you hit it round went today? How are the conditions out there? I saw you birdied four and that was --
 FRED HOLTON: I didn't get much out of it today. I probably hit two shots all day, maybe, that weren't like I wanted them to be, and to shoot 4-over par, I just don't feel like I got much out of it. 
 I hit a couple of balls that ran into the rough that I thought were going to be in the fairway. 
 On 7 there, you know, I just finished bad on both nines. I bogeyed 17, 3-putted 18 to shoot 2-over that nine. 
 And drove it about that far (Indicating) into the normal rough on 7 and couldn't get it on the green and pushed it a little short and missed it. 
 And then 8 I'm about probably another few feet from the ball bouncing up pretty close. It rolled back down the hill and I got a hard pitch and then I just didn't hit a good pitch and knocked it past the hole and then I lipped that one out. 
 And hit a really good shot on 9 and lipped that out too. Just I haven't figured the greens out. I played, counting two practice rounds and today, I haven't figured it out.

 Q. Are they playing quick?
 FRED HOLTON: I don't know. It's like every uphill putt I leave it short and all the downhill putts are probably a little faster than they look to me. 

 Q. What do you learn from today going into tomorrow to try to better the score?
 FRED HOLTON: Well, come back and see, considering this is my first round in a Major I don't feel particularly bad, but I just don't feel like I got a lot out of it. I just need to putt a little better. 
 I hit some really good golf shots today, I just haven't made a putt and as I said, in three rounds around the golf course. But there's nothing tricky about it, you just got to be in the right spot on the greens and just make a few putts. That's it.
