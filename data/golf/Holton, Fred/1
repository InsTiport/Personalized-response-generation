 Q. What was some of the highlights of round two for you today?
 FRED HOLTON: Oh, I birdied two of the last three holes. 

 Q. What can you take away from this experience here at Colorado Golf Club?
 FRED HOLTON: Oh, I made a few too many mistakes and I had four 3-putts, a penalty shot, doubled number 18 twice. I mean if I take away all those mistakes I would probably be playing the weekend, probably.

 Q. Did the elevation affect you?
 FRED HOLTON: It did. I think yesterday I ran out of steam a little bit. I slept a little better last night, so I think I didn't actually run out of gas quite as bad today. 
 But I'm used to the heat and the humidity, not the altitude. And it was a little better today. Great golf course though.
