Q. You're in good position after two rounds. 
C.T. PAN: Yeah, I definitely feel about how I played. Felt really good about my scoring. Actually my putting was amazing today. I made a lot of par putts on the tough holes, and that was great. Just kept my momentum going.

Q. So it was saving par that kept you going only. 
C.T. PAN: Yeah, obviously, today was tough conditions, and especially from 11 through 14, those were the toughest holes. I hit 3‑iron every single hole and it was pouring rain a lot of the time. Making pars like that, definitely.

Q. Was it quite good that Grégory Bourdy was playing well, as well, and it kind of lifts the whole group when two people are playing good golf? 
C.T. PAN: Yeah, he's great. He's a good player. He got a lot of fans. Yeah, it was good. He played well and we enjoyed it.

Q. How would you describe the experience this week? 
C.T. PAN: It's been awesome. I just got here on Tuesday, because I missed my flight on Sunday night.

Q. What happened? 
C.T. PAN: Because my first flight got delayed. 

Q. So you missed the connection?
C.T. PAN: Yeah, missed the connection. I kind of wish I was here earlier, so I get to spend more time on the village and the course. I wish I could get to meet a lot of great athletes out there. But the whole experience, it's truly amazing. 

Q. How many practice rounds did you have? 
C.T. PAN: I played nine holes on Tuesday. 

Q. That's not really enough, is it. 
C.T. PAN: Usually I try to get in two, at least. Big tournaments like this, great course like this, tough course, definitely need to spend more time than that.

Q. Are you staying in the village?
C.T. PAN: Yes.

Q. Has that lived up to expectations, seeing so many other athletes from all countries?
C.T. PAN: It's great. I haven't get to meet a lot of athletes from different countries, but the whole experience is cool. I've done this a couple times. I've played the Asian Games, like the Olympic Games for Asia. 

Q. What year was that? 
C.T. PAN: 2014. 

Q. Did you win any medals?
C.T. PAN: I won both gold. 

Q. So you know what it's like? 
C.T. PAN: Yeah, I know what the village like is life for athletes. I mean, everything is great, yeah. 

Q. So for the weekend now, just more of the same? 
C.T. PAN: Make as many putts as I can. Just enjoy it. I'm just trying to enjoy the week here. It's truly amazing being one of the participants.

Q. You're now an Olympian and no one can ever change that.
C.T. PAN: Yeah, that's all I need.
