Q. The start was amazing. You fought back and then he charged ahead again. But these first seven holes were incredible?
C.T. PAN: Yeah, he made every putt and he definitely outplayed me in the first seven holes. I mean, I followed my plan really well. Just couldn't make the putts. He was 6-under through seven holes, something like that. He played great. It was a fun match for me.
Q. You fought back and won three holes in a row. You must have felt you were back in it?
C.T. PAN: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do today. You know, I was way down there, and I kept -- actually my nose was bleeding mid round. I told myself, I need to fight here a little bit. That's the mind-set I have just towards the whole match.
Q. How has your week been overall?
C.T. PAN: It's been great. As a rookie I'm trying to observe and listen and learning. We had a great team bonding. I mean, I just can't ask anything better than this.
