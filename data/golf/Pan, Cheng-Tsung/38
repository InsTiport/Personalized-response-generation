Q.   How do you feel about the way this golf course is playing?   A lot of people felt it was going to be easy with the soft conditions?
CHENG‑TSUNG PAN:   Yeah, definitely it's easier when it's soft.   Your iron shot you can attack the pins.   It's easier when it's soft from rain.   But you still have to hit fairway.   You've got to hit a really good shot always.

Q.   Could you comment in Mandarin on the way you played today?
CHENG‑TSUNG PAN:   (Speaking in Mandarin.)

Q.   Are you happy with your position?
