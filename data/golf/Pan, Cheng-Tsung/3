Q. C.T., so the first question, you had to wait 571 days from the time you qualified to play your first round. Was it worth the wait? 
C.T. PAN: It was definitely worth the wait, and it was a long, long wait, trust me. I've been imagining this day since I was 5. So that has been a long wait, and I'm just happy today is my birthday, and I played solid too. So first round at Augusta, I posted a low number. So that's good.

Q. Happy birthday to you. With it being your birthday today, how was your round? 
C.T. PAN: Good. They went well. I played solid. I hit all the fairways solid and hit a lot of greens. Had a lot of birdie opportunities. I hit it good, just the putt didn't drop unfortunately on some of them. But I shot 2 under, and I was really happy with that.

Q. Do you think the wait this morning affected you in any way, the threeâhour wait this morning? 
C.T. PAN: No, not much. The greens are playing a bit softer in the morning. I don't think the wait really hurt me there. I don't think so. If you look at my round, I played solidly all day.
