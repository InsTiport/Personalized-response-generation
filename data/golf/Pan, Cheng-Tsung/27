 Q.  How pleased are you with that, after conditions got windy and it got tougher out there?  
CT PAN: Yeah, it was tougher.  It was totally different conditions than the practice rounds.  Really happy -- inaudible -- very pleased.   
 Q.  Indifferent 2017, couple missed cuts, then a great finish at the Farmers's then a couple missed cuts.  What has it been like trying to get a little more consistent?  
CT PAN: Yeah, the key word, consistent.  I've been working at that and you know, I'm just trying to be more mature and probably be -- so just feel comfortable out here.  I feel like a big stage for me and it's like a dream come true for me.   
I hit a lot of fairways, that helped me put myself in a really good position to get to the green and putting was good.   
 Q.  You're Top-10 so far in strokes gained off the tee.  Is that common for your game?  
CT PAN: I mean, as you can see -- yeah, that's good news, so hopefully I'll keep it going.   
 Q.  Was there much wind out there that bothered you?  
CT PAN: It was different wind, so totally different from practice round.  It took me awhile to adjust to it and greens were soft.  So took me awhile to feel comfortable out there.   
 Q.  Do you like bermudagreens?  
CT PAN: I do, it's hit and miss, trying to get my hands better.
