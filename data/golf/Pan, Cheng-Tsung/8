 Q.  Two matches with Hideki; two wins.  
C.T. PAN: He's a great teammate to have. He's super solid. He hits pretty much every right shot and he made some crucial putt on 13, and that's big. He's just someone I feel very comfortable to play with, and he helped me to play great golf, definitely.   
 Q.  You got out of the gate really quick. You birdied the first and he birdied the second. Were you pretty much in control the whole match?  
C.T. PAN: Absolutely. And it has to be our goal for our team. We want to start fast. First six holes are kind of gettable, especially today. We did well today and that really helps.   
 Q.  What's the secret to your partnership with Hideki?  
C.T. PAN: Just communications, a little combination of body language and English. I just feel we have a chemistry. It's hard to explain. Our game fits each other and that really helps.   
 Q.  Internationals, so far, so good for you guys. What has been the mood on the team and what as Ernie been doing to keep you guys on the up and up?  
C.T. PAN: Ernie -- Louis, I want to say he's our goofball and he definitely keeps the vibe up for sure for the whole team, the bus ride coming back here, you always make it fun and that helps the rookies because that really relaxes my mind-set and my tension. Anyway, just a lot of the co-captains, they help in every way they can.   
 Q.  How important is the foursomes this afternoon?  
C.T. PAN: You know, every match out here, every point is as important as the others, so we will definitely give it our best. Captain Els, he has a system and it's been working well, so we will follow through.
