 Q.  Thoughts on your round today?  
C.T. PAN: Played solid all day long.  You know, I hit a lot of good shots off the tee but somehow my ball just managed to be off the fairway couple times and give myself a really tough lie.  So it's hard to attack the pins out there.   
The wind, it's always windy.  It's kind of crazy.  I think it's crazier today.  But I only birdie two birdies, the first and last, so it wasn't my best, but I somehow manage to minimize my damage.   
I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  What about your thoughts on the week as a whole tournament out here going 8-under?  
C.T. PAN: Good.  I mean, I finished tied for third or something like that.  Good.  I mean, always top 10 is always been my goal, so I'm happy with the way I play.  Just can't wait for two weeks off and get ready for the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  You're projected to go inside the top 30 now for the FedExCup.  
C.T. PAN: Yes.   
 Q.  What does that mean for your season moving forward?  
C.T. PAN: It means a lot.  It's been my goal for the past three years on the tour.  It's all I'm trying to do, get into the TOUR Championship.  I've been knocking the door a couple times but never finish well.   
Hopefully this year will be the year.   
 Q.  What are the goals for the Presidents Cup?  
C.T. PAN: You know, just trying to prepare myself and get myself ready and hopefully play the best for the team and hopefully we can get a W.
