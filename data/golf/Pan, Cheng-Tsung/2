Q. You looked really comfortable out there. Explain how you feel so comfortable. 
C.T. PAN: Honestly, I didn't feel comfortable until I made eagle. We started onââ I mean, I started on No.10. That's a tough tee shot, and I didn't hit a great tee shot, and I still had 210 yards in, and I was able to convert a 15âfooter for par. That was a big par. I want to say that par was mentally it definitely gave me a lot of confidence. 
But, you know, I feel I kind of struggled in the beginning of the round, just trying to make a lot ofââ trying to give myself a lot of birdie chances butââ well, I tried, but it didn't quite work out the way I wanted until 15. I hit a great second shot with 5 wood, 7 wood, to like three feet for eagle. So that was definitely a booster there.

Q. Was it good that you still feel like you haven't played your best but you're playingââ you got good results today? 
C.T. PAN: Absolutely. I love the way I scored these couple days. I mean, last night I go back to my stats. I hit a lot of greens. I gave myself a lot of birdie chances within 20 feet, 15 feet. So it wasââ I actually feel that I left a lot of birdie chances out there, which means that I feel my game is good. I've just got to keep working on the things I've been working on, which helped me to get here.

Q. Have you hit your tee shot on 8 yet? 
C.T. PAN: I did. Yeah, I'm on my third shot, about to hit my third shot.

Q. So you're trying to make birdie? 
C.T. PAN: Yes.
