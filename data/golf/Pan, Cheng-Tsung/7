 Q.  What can you take away from this experience?  
C.T. PAN: The team bonding is good. The result is not what we wanted.   
 Q.  What was pleasing for you to be part of this team? What stood out for you? What was the experience like?  
C.T. PAN: Just the whole team experience, being part of the team activities, it's something I've never experienced. In college, you have experience, but we only have five, six people at one tournament, but this time we have 12. I just feel that the effect is like three, four times more.   
 Q.  You've been in this once now; 2021 in Charlotte, North Carolina. That will be your goal to get back to the team?  
C.T. PAN: Yes.
