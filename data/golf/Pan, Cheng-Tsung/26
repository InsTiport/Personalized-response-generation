Q. 2-under for the day, feeling pretty good heading into the weekend at 6-under?
CT PAN: Yeah, it's great.  Definitely put myself in good position.  The last five events, I've missed the cut four times.  I've been trying to improve my consistency and mentality.  So it's good.  It feels good to play on the weekend.
Q. Obviously showed you can contend at Torrey.  What did you take away from there and what do you take going into the weekend from that experience?
CT PAN: You know, that experience proved me that I can play in tough conditions, and also in the final stretch of the tournament.  So I know I can do it and hopefully I can do it again next couple days.
Q. Run us through 18.  What happened?  I think you accidentally hit a guy?
CT PAN: I hit 3-wood, trying to go for the green, and then I pulled it.  Hit a guy in the head.  His name is Mike.  I'm so sorry, Mike.  I hope you get better.  Yeah, I'm still in shock.  I'm sorry.
Q. You still made birdie, though.
CT PAN: Yeah, I chip-in for birdie.  I was -- my brain was blank, so I didn't know what happened.
