Q. You seemed to be inspired by playing in the team tournament in Japan.  Did that give you like a boost?
NURIA ITURRIOS: Yeah, because when you play a match, you want to make a lot of birdies.  I think that this is much better.
Q. So you're feeling better about your game now for this tournament?
NURIA ITURRIOS: Yes, of course.  I feel good now.  But 36 holes more, and just play and enjoy the place.
Q. What's the objective here?
NURIA ITURRIOS: No, I don't want objective, just enjoy and play my best.
Q. Now that Aditi has kind of won the Rookie of the Year, do you feel less pressure?
NURIA ITURRIOS: No, she plays really good, and she's having a good year.  So enjoy.  I'm happy with my game.
Q. First time here?
NURIA ITURRIOS: Yes.
Q. Enjoying the golf course?
