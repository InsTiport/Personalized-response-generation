Q. Talk about the last hole and what you hit in there.ELIZABETH WANG: Like the third shot?Q. Uh-huh.ELIZABETH WANG: So after I laid up, then it was 192 to the pin, so I was thinking of hitting the front edge and letting it roll up, so I hit a 4 hybrid but then hit it short, and yeah, so I guess I wasn't in the best of spirits by that time.  And then I used a 60 and chipped it to I don't know how far, but close enough for Mariah to give it to me.Q. What happened on 17?ELIZABETH WANG: 17, I guess we both hit, I guess, decent shots.  We were both on the green.  Mariah putted short about I think another four feet, and I had about 15 to 20 feet.  I guess it just went in.  I don't know.Q. You think it was like 20 feet?ELIZABETH WANG: I think it was.  I mean, for me, I sometimes like when my dad and I talk about the putts, I sometimes elongate the whole thing.Q. What part of your game were you most satisfied with overall today?ELIZABETH WANG: I kind of liked most of -- I mean, my driver finally started cooperating again, you know, so at least I hit most of the fairways.  My iron shots were all right.  They were good enough, you know.  I guess I can't complain.  It could have been worse.  And then I made some really good putts today.  I was pretty happy with my putting.Q. How much did the big win here recently -- didn't you win the Junior PGA?ELIZABETH WANG: Uh-huh.Q. How much did that boost your confidence coming into this week?ELIZABETH WANG: Well, yeah, I mean, I had kind of like a crummy summer until that tournament, so when I won it, yeah, it was a great -- for me it felt like a great comeback.  It felt like I could actually play well again.Q. What was kind of off earlier in the summer?ELIZABETH WANG: My driver was just off, and then I think early on in the fall last year, I kind of lost my putting and haven't gotten it back.  It's kind of hard to --Q. Is it back now?ELIZABETH WANG: I think so.  Hopefully it doesn't go away again because it's kind of hard to score when your driver is crummy and your putter is crummy.Q. Is your dad your instructor?ELIZABETH WANG: I have a lot of coaches.  I guess he's just the all-over-the-place kind of thing, lecture kind of person.Q. Who are your instructors?ELIZABETH WANG: I have a lot of them.  I can't really --Q. When you say a lot --ELIZABETH WANG: I have a swing instructor, short game instructor, fitness instructor, yeah, it's a lot of people.Q. Anybody you've been with the longest?ELIZABETH WANG: Not really.Q. So you have an entourage?ELIZABETH WANG: Yeah, it's like a group of people, and if I try naming them all, you'd probably use up the notebook.Q. Who's here with you this week?ELIZABETH WANG: My dad.Q. Just your dad?ELIZABETH WANG: Yeah.
