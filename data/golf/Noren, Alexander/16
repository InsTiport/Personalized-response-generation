Q.   Must be nice to finish with a birdie there?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, that was good.   It was so easy, I played great on the front nine, played okay on the back, but I just didn't get as close as I did on the front.   It's a little bit tougher on the back, as well. 

Q.   You started on 29, the first birdie, back nine‑‑
ALEXANDER NOREN:   10,11, 12 was quite easy, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, is quite‑‑ a little bit more difficult.   And 18 is a bit easier.   But yeah, it was a fun round.   Nice playing partners.   It helps a lot. 

Q.   Were you hoping that this was the course where you would post another low score? 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I know Carnoustie is not that easy, and you've got to play really well to shoot low there.   So I came back to level par there, which I was happy about, and then I think today, I knew it was easier and you have a lot of‑‑ it's not super easy.   I played probably the best I've played on the front nine today, of the whole year. 

Q.   Of the whole year? 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I played great.   It's easy when you're playing good, but it's not a gimmie. 

Q.   What happened with the eagle on the third? 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Hit a 3‑wood really close to about six feet. 

Q.   That's always nice to start like that.   You've got a local caddie I understand, has he been really helpful for you? 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, he knows the lines, where to come in from.   So he's helped out a lot and gave me some good lines, and he knows all the slopes.   It's nice. 

Q.   He's delighted to see you playing well. 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, he's delighted.

Q.   Tomorrow a bit of work to do to get Grace?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Well, there's always a chance around St. Andrews, you get it going, and we'll see what the weather is like.   Post a strong one on the front nine, you may have a chance, you never know. 

Q.   You might be playing with Fredrik?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I've known him since I got on Tour, really nice guy.   Playing really well.
