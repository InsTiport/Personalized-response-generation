 Q.   Your thoughts on the week, please?   
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Well, it's a tough way to end it.   A lot tougher than I‑‑ well, you know, I saw that he was 20 and I was chasing some birdies.   Didn't really see the leaderboard after that.   It's tough when you see you have a chance.   
   
 Q.   So when you played the 18th, were you unsure what the position was on the board?   
ALEXANDER NOREN:   No, I thought it was 18‑‑ the birdie to tie‑‑ well, to get into kind of a chance for a playoff.   Hit a good putt and just missed the lip, and bad putt after that.   So very disappointing.   
   
 Q.   Is that just one of those things, and is your mind all over the shot?  
ALEXANDER NOREN:   No, I had been putting great all week, and I don't know if I hit it bad or if it didn't go the way I thought it would in the break.   
   
 Q.   You said yesterday about your ability to bounce back, and you've got to.   
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, you've got to in this game.   I'm looking forward to next week and just trying to find a good form for next week.
