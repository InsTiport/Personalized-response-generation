 Q.   Tell us about 8â€‘under par, that's pretty good, isn't it?  
ALEX NOREN:   I putted great and good off the tee, had a lot of chances but putted fantastic.   I hit the pin on 1, and I thought unlucky to get on the green ten meters from the hole instead of stiff, but then I holed it, so the golfing gods were with.   
   
 Q.   Is it easy out here today?   
ALEX NOREN:   I think it's a tricky course, compared to maybe Bro Hof which is longer and more longer irons, and here, it's tricky.   You have got to hit wedges and you've got just over the water or the water behind.   It's good wedge shot to maybe five meters and usually that's not a great wedge shot, but here, you've got to play conservative with some wedges here.   So it's tricky, but it was a great day.   
   
 Q.   Bro Hof you played with all of the attention on you; is it nice to go a little bit under the radar if you like on this one?  
ALEX NOREN:   Usually I am quite a bit under the radar, and Bro Hof is probably an exception in that sense, but yeah, it is nice.   It's great to play here.   I really like this place.   Good tournament, great atmosphere, it's a lot of fun, great weather.   It's hot and tomorrow is cooler maybe, we'll see.
