Q.   Obviously anything can happen in match play and you've had one of the best performances.   How did it go?
ALEX NOREN:   Well, I played great.   I was really happy with my game and hit a lot of greens, made it quite‑‑ felt easier than it can on this course.   It's very tricky.   They put a few tees forward.   But it was a lot of fun.

Q.   What's been going on in your golf game to suggest that golf like this today would have happened?
ALEX NOREN:   I had a chance to win in Qatar, finished fourth, and two like 30th finishes, so I've been playing okay, especially in Qatar.   I've practiced hard and had two weeks off, stayed in Phoenix a few days before this.   I don't know.   And it's really enjoyable to play match play, so I just played today and saw what happened, and it went well.

Q.   So you're a fan of desert golf, I guess?
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah.   The last five weeks I've played in the desert, so it's nice. 

Q.   What's the key to doing well in this event do you think?
ALEX NOREN:   Well, I guess it's putting a little bit of pressure on your opponent, hitting the fairways, hitting the greens, not giving him too much‑‑ well, not confidence, but not giving him too much space to make birdies and to put pressure on you.   And I was hitting first most of the time, playing with Dustin.   So trying to hit the greens, and even if it's 20, 30 feet, it's still on the green, he has to make birdie to beat me.   So that's kind of what was our plan, and it went well.
