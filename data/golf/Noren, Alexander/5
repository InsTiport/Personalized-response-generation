Q.   Round of 65 to finish in wonderful style, must be hugely satisfying. 
ALEX NOREN:   Very.   I played good yesterday, but nothing happened and then played really well today.   I got a few putts in, hit a few close ones, and yeah, it was very much fun.

Q.   And an eagle 2 on the way home. 
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah, I stiffed it there.   I hit it about three feet, so that's good. 

Q.   And that birdie at the last, seemed to do a 360 and then decided it would drop. 
ALEX NOREN:   I've had such a hard time reading the greens and on the last, it's got to be just outside left and then in the end, it turned but it just got the end. 

Q.   What is your gut feeling for where you're going to be finishing?   It's going to be good regardless. 
ALEX NOREN:   I don't really know but it's quite‑‑ a lot of birdie chances on the way in, a lot of maybe players are playing good at the top, so, I don't know.   But I'll take a 65 and I'm very happy.

Q.   I know we touched on this in Abu Dhabi and when you started this week so well; must be good to get the scores so early in the come back. 
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah, it's great, and as I said, it has not felt that good at home practising a little bit before this, so I'm very, very happy, yeah.

Q.   On to Dubai?
ALEX NOREN:   Dubai next and get maybe one or two days off, that will be good.
