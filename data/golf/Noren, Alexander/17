 Q.   Great number out there today in tough conditions.   Can you just talk about that?  
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah.   I couldn't even dream of this at the beginning of the day.   (Indiscernible.) I got into a groove on the back nine, started hitting better drives, a little bit longer, getting it in play.  
   
 Q.   You said you weren't feeling very good before the round.   When did it start to click in?  
ALEX NOREN:   Either on 1 or 2, my 11th hole, really I started playing better and hitting the driver and the 3â€‘wood a little bit better.   
   
 Q.   You're right on the top of the leaderboard.   How do you carry that momentum into tomorrow?   
ALEX NOREN:   Well, I had my best feelings at the British and I was trying to get a feeling, but (inaudible) a lot of times you feel (inaudible).  
   
 Q.   Talk about the eagle you had on 16.   
ALEX NOREN:   Well, 16, just over the hill had a good lie and was able to get an awesome flight and was just off the green and chipped it in from 12 feet.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ALEX NOREN:   It's the best score I've had all season with the wind and the course, but my short game was the best it's been today.   I got my game going on the back nine a lot better from the tee to the green and hit a lot more greens, made it a lot easier.   
   
 Q.   Knowing that the course had a little more teeth this afternoon and you get to go off early tomorrow, what's your mindset going into tomorrow?  
ALEX NOREN:   With how tough the course is, I'm just trying to play the long holes (inaudible) I'm just trying to hit my irons into the greens.   There's a few holes that you can take advantage of.
