Q.   Tell us about your round. 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   It feels great.   I really enjoyed it today again.   Made a lot of birdies out there, an eagle which helps a lot.

Q.   Similar performances from youyesterday and today.   
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Quite similar.   Yesterday I was really pleased with my putting.   Not so pleased with my drives and I tried to correct them today but still, it's a lot better my back nine.   My last nine holes I played really well the whole nine and it felt a lot better coming in with the 66 today than the 66 yesterday. 
Putting was good, and that's what caused me to play good, and I practised a lot around these greens on the practise days and feels a lot more comfortable with the speed of the greens.

Q.   You didn't do so well here last year but did you come into this tournament this time believing that you were in good form?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I played pretty good last week, close to the lead after two rounds and then slipped back a little bit on the weekend.   Played pretty good.   And I knew what I need around here; if you get your putting going and your short game, you get the easy pars on the long holes and then you can attack on the birdies, and that was the plan the whole time.   Give myself a little bit more room on the tough holes and make pars, and I seem to have done that. 

Q.   Do you expect others to shoot as good as you, or better? 
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I think I'm not going to be on top at the end of the day.   There's going to be a lot of low scores again today.   It's perfect weather and I think there are going to be a lot of low scores.
