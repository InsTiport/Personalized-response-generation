Q.   How pleasing after the troubles you had? 
ALEX NOREN:   Very pleasing.   It's of course what I wanted but not what I thought I would do.   So I'm very happy. 

Q.   How long have you been hitting the ball at anchor? 
ALEX NOREN:   I've been pitching a lot, chipping a lot but not hitting too much‑‑ the last month I've been playing off and on trying to see if it works.   The last three weeks, I've been really good.   Maybe the game was really good but the hand was really good.

Q.   Tell us what happened, we only saw you on two occasions last season on The European Tour?
ALEX NOREN:   I had surgery on two planes in my wrist.   Tried to play, as soon as I played, about two weeks, it just got very inflamed and a disk and an inflammation that wouldn't go away.   I had to take injections and tried that, but didn't help and then the only thing was to really rest it. 
After probably a month and a half, two months, it was good again.   And then after that, I didn't get bad inflammation back. 

Q.   You must have been so worried.   Did you feel you would actually play golf again?
ALEX NOREN:   Well, I was worried that every week or two weeks I tried, and nothing got better.   But after all, I tried to change a little 3‑wood, pitching motion, I tried to change a little through the ball and I think that helps a little.   Keep my fingers crossed.

Q.   What have the doctors told you now? 
ALEX NOREN:   It looks good now.   It looks really good now.   Obviously it doesn't look like a wrist I haven't had surgery on it, but it's very playable. 

Q.   Have you been told to take it easy or are you still going to hit as many balls as you used to?
ALEX NOREN:   No, definitely not a good thing now.   I'm taking it easier.
