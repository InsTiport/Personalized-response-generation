  ALEXANDER NOREN:   Well, at the beginning of the week, I would have taken a third‑place finish.   I had a lot of chances on the front nine, a lot, and I was really disappointed on my first seven holes.   I had a chance pretty much every hole it felt like.   And ended up making no birdies and I birdied 8,9, good birdie on 13, and 14.   So really I feel very fortunate to finish third in the end. 
You know, and to win the team prize feels unbelievable.   I know Ernest since a few years ago, he's a great guy and it was a lot of fun.

Q.   What is it about you and Scottish golf, you finish third at The Scottish Open, tied ninth at the British Open, and you got very close today?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   Yeah, I like links golf.   I always like links golf.   I like the turf.   I like‑‑ I don't know, my game always gets a little bit better I think, when the wind, I sharpen up my game; if it's wet, I hit the ball too high I think.   And I need to play a little bit lower. 
My putting was fantastic, and my coach at home, have done a great job, Victor, who is always working on my short game, mostly, and maybe now also my long game.   He's done a great job over the last three years, and my putting is fantastic this week.   That helps. 

Q.   There's still six more tournaments to come.   Expecting any titles?
ALEXANDER NOREN:   I'm hoping for it.   Yeah, I'm trying to get into that Top‑50 in the world, and I need good finishes, and it's‑‑ yeah, it's a fun period coming up, a great tournament next week, and also over in Asia and the Middle East.   I love the fall on The European Tour, it's great.
