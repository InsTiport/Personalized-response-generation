  ALEX NOREN:   It's a good result, very good result, and today, I had a lot of chances, maybe I didn't hit it‑‑ I had a lot of five‑, six‑ seven‑metre putts, and you need to get a little bit closer to get a better score today.   
   
 Q.   Seems like a different course today, and some of those pins are tucked away.   
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah, it's firmer, so it's maybe a little trickier.   But it's still manageable to shoot good scores, and you've probably seen a lot of good scores.   But it's a little bit trickier than yesterday perhaps.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on your position overall to the weekend?   
ALEX NOREN:   It's great.   I'm three back, it's great.   
   
 Q.   Are you ready?   
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Because we haven't seen you right at the top for a little while.   
ALEX NOREN:   Well, I've had my chances, but yeah, you know, I need to putt better and get the wedges closer, then we'll see how it goes.
