 Q.   Your verdict, please?   
ALEX NOREN:   Well, just I don't know, just tough when you want it too much, that's what you start pushing it.   Played pretty good the front nine except a couple of shots but the short game was not very good.   So, yeah, and then I'm 3‑over coming, good finish, good ranking points which is fine, but it's a bit sour.   
   
 Q.   And you still know on the back nine, there are opportunities?  
ALEX NOREN:   Yeah, just still haven't found the re‑I pie, but I guess I'll learn from every time.   
   
 Q.   It is another good finish?  
ALEX NOREN:   I'm happy, I'm really happy, just worked a lot harder this year and now it's paying off.   But then you expect a lot more and you get disappointed.   But it's a great finish, and I feel happy, and having a great season so far.   
   
 Q.   And other big events to come?  
ALEX NOREN:   Oh, it's fantastic, yeah.
