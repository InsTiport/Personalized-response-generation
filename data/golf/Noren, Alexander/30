 Q. Excellent numbers on the scorecard, what's the story behind them?
 ALEXANDER NOREN: Well, last week was really up-and-down, and this week was a lot nicer to play. Hit the greens, hit the fairways and holed some putts. 

 Q. Your approach shot into the last from the waste area, there are no bunkers on this golf course; does that a bit weird?
 ALEXANDER NOREN: Yeah, we were talking about what if the ball plugs in the bunker. But I think everybody's kind of played just like we would normally. I didn't ground the club in the bunker today, even if I could, you know, but it's really weird.

 Q. You mentioned last week a couple of terrific rounds of golf and a couple of not-so-good ones. How do you feel about your game coming into this week? 
 ALEXANDER NOREN: Not great. I was struggling with the driver, struggling with the long irons. I worked a lot on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, to get a shot that I could play. And my normal shot is a draw and now the draw is not a hook, and then you can play. But I met Gary Player on Monday and he was very inspiring, so I've been practising hard after that.

 Q. What sort of things did he say to you?
 ALEXANDER NOREN: He just said, you know, because I think of myself as a practise kind of guy, and I was like, well, I don't get out of it what I really put in right now. And he was like, well, you know, I practised so hard and I did this and this and this, why get much out of my golf. But he's played just unbelievable golf, so just have to stick with it and practise harder and better.
