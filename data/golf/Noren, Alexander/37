   ALEXANDER NOREN: Well, I stood on the tee and the wind is off the right and I thought, well, I'm hitting a draw right now and a 5-iron will go further than a normal 5-iron with the wind drawing. And I thought, this is a 5-iron and my caddie said, yeah, could be a four, but I can see the five, it bouncing up. And just like ate yards short and straight in, it was unbelievable. I couldn't see but the guys by the green, they were shouting. That's a long time ago that I made a hole-in-one, 15 years ago. Then I couldn't stop laughing and made an eagle on the next; this is a joke.   
 Yesterday I was so struggling with my game. I got it around somehow, but struggling, struggling, and still hit a lot of greens and stuff. You know, when you don't have the right feelings and they don't come off in the middle of the clubface, it's nasty, you don't know where the ball is going when you are over it, but today I felt ten times better.   
  
  Q. And the eagle sounds like an albatross; it was that fun.   
 ALEXANDER NOREN: Me and Colin was just laughing. Crazy.   
 I'm going to have a nice afternoon by the pool with my champagne, get a tan, and I'm off tomorrow morning. I don't want to leave this place, it's unbelievable.   
  
  Q. What's next?   
 ALEXANDER NOREN: I've got a week in Monaco just practicing and then after that is hopefully Singapore, if I get in. And then Shanghai and a week off and Dubai.   
 So it's a great two months. It would be nice.
