 Q. I know this is your second U.S. Open. How is it different than the first?
 LINDY DUNCAN: Um, I'm still as nervous I was the first time. But I feel like my game has improved a lot, so I have more confidence in my game.
 I think I had some pretty good preparation this week, and all of this summer, so I feel pretty good about my game.

 Q. Did it make the nerves worse having to wait around for an entire extra day?
 LINDY DUNCAN: No, not really. I just actually enjoyed the rest and just kind of watched some movies and laid around knowing today was gonna be a tough day.

 Q. What do you think is going to be your biggest challenge this afternoon? 36 holes? A short turnaround?
 LINDY DUNCAN: Probably just staying hydrated and focused. Playing 18 holes out here is very mentally draining because you always have to be mentally thinking. It's tough. You have to try your best.

 Q. How does the altitude affect everything just overall game, and I suppose it also makes the air thinner and harder to breathe?
 LINDY DUNCAN: Yeah, just makes the club choice really critical and that much more complicated. You're doing a lot of adding and subtracting. Your ball definitely goes further, because you got to make your distances are dialed in. So it's tough.
