  Q. So you are disappointed at 18, but you have to figure where you are, you're in the U.S. Open and the battling low amateur.   
 LINDY DUNCAN: Yeah. I'm trying to keep perspective. Today/yesterday, second round was kind of a struggle the whole time. It was just a tough day yesterday. It was very long, so I'm just trying to, you know, make sure I keep a good perspective and realize I'm in a great perspective and just keep fight.  
  
  Q. I don't know what the cut is gonna be, but you're in here battling. What does this course do to you?  
 LINDY DUNCAN: You really just gotta hit the ball in the fairway, that's number one. Then once you get on the greens you just gotta be really smart. They're tough to read.   
 The first round I was just happy with a lot of tap-in pars because my putting speed was really good. I need to get back to that a little bit, and, you know, just not get real frustrated with bogeys and be really happy with pars.  
  
  Q. Have you ever played a course like this with the mountains and altitude and break?  
 LINDY DUNCAN: No, never played in Colorado. First time dealing with the mountains. It's been definitely a challenge, but I think I'm slowly getting used to it. Hopefully it will keep going if I make the cut.
