  Q. Do you want to take us through your birdies on 2 and 8?  
 BRAD NUCKOLLS: Sure, let's see. No. 2 I hit a nice 9-iron in there about six feet and finally made a putt.   
 8, I holed one out of the bunker. So those are my two highlights of the round for sure.  
  
  Q. And this is your second Senior PGA Championship?  
 BRAD NUCKOLLS: Yes, it is.   
  
  Q. So how do you like it?  
 BRAD NUCKOLLS: I love it. It's a wonderful experience. You just got to -- it's hard to get ready for the short game stuff that the PGA throws at you. The greens are extremely fast and the rough's tough, so I got to do a better job with that.   
  
  Q. How do you compare this week to your last one?  
 BRAD NUCKOLLS: Well I enjoyed it a little bit more because it wasn't so darn cold. It was just freezing up in New York. And even though the wind blew a lot, I should be used to that, being out of Wichita. But I played a little better this time.
