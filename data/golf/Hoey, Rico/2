 Q.  A 67 and nine shots better than yesterday.  What went well for you?  
RICO HOEY: I drove the ball well, especially my putting today, too.  That really helped me out.  Ball-striking, too, just gave myself chances all day, so I can't complain there.   
 Q.  You're in a position where you're right near the line to make match play.  Did you have a number in mind when you started today?  
RICO HOEY: Kind of.  My coach was caddying for me, so he was saying maybe 3-over, 2-over, so I was actually trying to just get it back to even.  I had a few opportunities, but yeah, left it all out there, so that's all I can do.   
 Q.  Since your putting was better today, were you making them from all different types of lengths?  
RICO HOEY: It was just speed was pretty good, and yeah, some of the putts I hit felt really good.  I had a couple lip-outs, but yeah.   
 Q.  Was there a particular hole that got you going today?  
RICO HOEY: I would say the par-5, No. 16.  Yeah, I knocked it on and almost made my eagle.  But yeah, once I made that birdie, it started rolling.   
 Q.  How far the eagle putt?  
RICO HOEY: About maybe 15 feet.  So yeah.   
 Q.  What do you do now?  I know it's a waiting game, but what do you do now as you wait to find out where you're going to be?  
RICO HOEY: Probably grab some lunch right now, but I mean, probably keep checking.  I hate checking it, but I've got to check it.
