Q. You were 2-down with three to play.  What was going through your mind?
JESSICA PORVASNIK: Just hit solid shots.  I wasn't hitting it solid all day, and I still didn't hit it solid on the par-3, but I ended up making a good up-and-down, and then went into the par-5, birdied that, so it was a good momentum booster.  Then turned -- pars were good.  Pars were good all day.  That was the main thing, so just stuck with it and kept going.
Q. What happened on holes 16 and 17?
JESSICA PORVASNIK: 16 I hit it left of the green and had an awesome chip and one-putted, and then 17, I got on -- my third shot was on and then I made a nice putt for birdie.
Q. Any other turning points in the match earlier?
JESSICA PORVASNIK: No, I just was down, down a lot, and then, I don't know, wasn't hitting it solid.
Q. Do you think it's helpful to start off with one of those, one of these tough ones?
JESSICA PORVASNIK: Yeah.  I mean, she was a really steady player, great player, too.  I think she's young, so she's going to be a phenomenal player.
Q. She was on the winning four-ball team this year.
JESSICA PORVASNIK: Hmm, awesome.
Q. You knocked out a USGA champ there.
JESSICA PORVASNIK: Definitely a good player, steady.
Q. What are your thoughts going forward the rest of the way?
JESSICA PORVASNIK: I need to work on my ball-striking a little, and then I'll be ready.
