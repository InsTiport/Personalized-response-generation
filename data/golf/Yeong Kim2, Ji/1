Q. Tough conditions for everyone yet such a good score.  What was working well?
JI YEONG KIM2:  Because of my later tee time I think better weather conditions compared to the rest of the players and I was able to make up for that.
Q. What needs to happen tomorrow to contend and win?
JI YEONG KIM2:  Definitely I need to be on guard and do more consulting with my caddie and planning for tomorrow's round.
Q. Were you watching the leaderboard at all and did you know how much you had moved up?
JI YEONG KIM2:  In the first half of the round I wasn't keeping up, but later as the day went on I did look and I was surprised to see how far I've come up on the scoreboard.
Q. This is your first Women's Open, what were your expectations coming into the week and how have you found it?
JI YEONG KIM2:  I really didn't expect to be performing so well and I'm just glad to be here.
Q. When did you arrive in the U.S. and how did you prepare for playing over here?
JI YEONG KIM2:  I arrived last Wednesday and it took some time first of all getting used to the time zone and I've been practicing and getting used to the course since then.
