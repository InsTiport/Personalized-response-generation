Q. Talk about your round.
COLT KNOST: Yeah, just pretty excited.  Played well.  I was in a big spot coming into today and being 7 back I didn't really know what kind of chance I had.  But I knew a good finish would go a long way just for the rest of the year for me.
I got off to a good start and then kind of got a bad break on 5 but rebounded great.  Birdied 7, 8, 9.
And at one point I think I was two back and thought, you never know what could happen.  I made a lot of good swings coming in.  Just, it's tough, playing in that situation's, it definitely gets your attention.
And for the most part I felt like I handled it pretty well.  Those last few, they're tough golf holes, no matter where you're at.  But, yeah, I'm relieved it's over, to be honest, but yeah it was a great week.
Q. Mentally draining, but controlling your emotions like that is that what you're most proud of?
COLT KNOST: I hung in there great.  When I made that double on 5 with just a horrible break I could have kind of packed it in.  But I stuffed it the next four holes and had good looks and I just, yeah, I hung in there great.
I just never got ahead of myself, I never got down on myself today, which is a big improvement for me.  It was just a really fun week.
Q. An entire tournament to be proud of, chasing history earlier in the week, a lot of confidence, I would imagine, coming out of this?
COLT KNOST: Yeah, for sure.  Just builds more and more confidence for the rest of the year.  Just look forward to getting back here next year.  I love this golf course, this tournament, it's just one I feel like I should contend at every year.
