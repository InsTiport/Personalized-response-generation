Q. Great round today.  6-under.  Obviously I just want to talk about the last four holes.
COLT KNOST: Yeah.
Q. Heck of a way to finish.
COLT KNOST: Yeah, you know, I mean, both days I felt like I hit it pretty good and just didn't get anything out of it.
I kept telling John, We just got to ay patient, stay patient, and it'll eventually come.
Then I made a bomb on 15 and shipped it in from the front of the green on 16.  Hit two good wedges in the last two and made 'em.
Been preaching to myself for the last six, seven years to stay patient, and that's starting to happen a little bit.  Just got to let it come because I know it's there.
Q. Any mindset change or finally connected with it something?
COLT KNOST: I just got to attack each shot the best I can.  I'm playing great and I know that.  I mean, even if they don't fall early, I just got to be patient because you can have a finish round here like that.
