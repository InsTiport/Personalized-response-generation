 Q.   Colt, thanks.   Things weren't looking too for you there.   What a finish, last two holes.   Made the cut.   Good job.  
COLT KNOST:   Standing on 17, told Jonathan Byrd we both needed a miracle to somehow make the cut.   That was probably the definition of it.  
   
 Q.   You said Pat Perez was giving you a hard time about the tee you used?  
COLT KNOST:   He hit it to five feet and it was an awesome shot.   Giving me a hard time.   I made it on top of him.   There was a little kid inside the ropes, had a broken tee.   I told him I would trade him a full one for the broken one if I can use it this hole.   His dad said, "Only if you hit it close."   Then it went in.   
   
 Q.   Just a couple comments on your day as a whole and make it to the weekend?   
COLT KNOST:   I played really well today.   I hit it great.   I made nothing.   I tried several different putter grips out there, different styles of grips and didn't get anything going.   To have that happen on 17 and then honestly more proud of 18 being able to calm myself down and focus and make a birdie on a really hard hole.  
   
 Q.   Your club and yardage on 17?  
COLT KNOST:   221.   I hit 3-iron.
