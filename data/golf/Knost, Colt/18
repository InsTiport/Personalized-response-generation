Q.   Colt, nice start to the tournament.   Just some comments on your play today.
COLT KNOST:   About time.   (Laughter.)   You know, it's been a rough year, but just kind of taking an attitude these last few weeks to freewheel it and whatever happens, happens.
But I played well really today.   If I had a few putts drop it could have been really well.   But happy with how I played today.   Amazing how well I play when I really don't care that much.
But it was fun.

Q.   In this format you don't see many bogeyâ€‘free rounds.   We had just a handful today, but you did have one today.   Were you still aggressive out there?
COLT KNOST:   Yeah, I fired at everything.   I got jammed up one time and made a nice putt for par. 
Other than that, I was around the hole all day and had a lot of good looks.
