Q.   (Inaudible). 
COLT KNOST:   Crazy fast, but the wind died down, and I was able to birdie 5 coming in.   It was a great finish and one of my favorite golf courses of the year.

Q.   What's it like to play that well in the final group of the day, knowing you're going to have an early tee time tomorrow?
COLT KNOST:   It's good.   It's good to take advantage of ‑‑ it's probably good in this situation.   It's normally a tough tee time to finish so late, and the greens aren't quite as good as they normally are.   I'm excited to go out and have a little better conditions in the morning and get after it.

Q.   What do you expect in the morning?   Have you heard how it played this morning?
COLT KNOST:   I heard it was cold and a little windy this morning.   From what I've seen it's supposed to be a little better tomorrow.   If it is, it is, if not‑‑ but it wasn't calm for us out there today.   Our first 12, 13 holes it was windy and it was swirling around a lot out there.   We got lucky the last few coming in, and I was able to take advantage of it.

Q.   What was working best for you today?
COLT KNOST:   I just did everything really solid.   I drove it really good and hit quite a few greens.   I didn't hit very many starting out, but I think I hit most all of them on the back nine, which was nice.   You have to keep it in front of you and minimize the damage and that's what I did today.

Q.   Have you learned things about this course, playing it over the years?
COLT KNOST:   It's just my kind of golf course.   You have to hit it fairly straight.   Distance isn't that big a deal.   The greens are real small, just give yourself a lot of chances.   That's what I try to do every week.   Driving the golf ball is probably my strength.   If I get my irons going, I feel like I'll have a good week here.
