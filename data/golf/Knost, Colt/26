 Q. Your morning session obviously, again, not the way you wanted it to end.
 COLT KNOST: Yeah. Eighteen is a tough hole and the wind kind of switched into us. It was really long with the tees back. Hit a poor chip on the last. I had to come out this morning and make an 8-footer and missed it. I fought back after that and got myself back in it.

 Q. Speaking of wind, supposed to blow maybe up to 35 miles an hour later on today. You're from Texas. Do you like it when it blows?
 COLT KNOST: I can control my ball in this wind and I'm excited for it. If it blows, it kind of helps me out because -- I'm not going to be scared by the conditions at all. You got to go out and play every shot as you can.

 Q. PGA TOUR, on the leaderboard, so much on the line. Your thoughts heading into the afternoon session. Do you take a break and regroup?
 COLT KNOST: I'm going to sit down for a little bit and get away from it, try to focus up for this afternoon. It's a big round for me this afternoon. It's fun to be here.
