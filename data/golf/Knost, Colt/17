 Q.   Your irons were on fire, you were making every putt, kind of a perfect round, wasn't it?  
COLT KNOST:   Yeah, I played flawlessly all day.   I missed three greens and hit great chip shots when I did.   
But I hit it close all day.   I honestly don't think I made a putt over 15 feet long all day.   But I had so many chances and I was really relaxed out there and I just played great.  
   
 Q.   Nine birdies, hard to imagine, but the look on your face when we saw each other after you played three or four holes and already had a couple of birdies, it looked like you thought you might really go low.   Do you think you might have left something out there today?  
COLT KNOST:   I lipped out a 6â€‘footer on my second for eagle and lipped out on my fourth hole from about 15 feet as well.  
I had a lot of chances today.   I had a lot of fun today.   I carried everything over from yesterday.   I birdied my last three holes yesterday and just kind of kept the momentum going and I couldn't be happier with how I played today.  
   
 Q.   Obviously a lot of golf still to be played, what's your mindset?   What are you doing now?  
COLT KNOST:   I'm out of here.   It's too calm and it's not going to be good enough.   
But it's a great finish, gets me into Phoenix next week, which I'm really pumped about.   That's one of my favorite events of the year, so I'm looking forward to next week.
