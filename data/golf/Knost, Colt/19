Q.   Frustrating finish?
COLT KNOST:   I misread at the scoreboard, and I thought Zach was at 11 and I thought I was two back.   I could have finished second pretty easily, but it happens.   I had a good week.

Q.   When you woke up this morning did you feel confident that yes, this is going to be my day? 
COLT KNOST:   I believe in myself.   I think things are starting to turn for me. 

Q.   Colt, a disappointing finish, obviously to bogey at the last, to finish solid third.   But at the end of the week you have to think, it's a great week?
COLT KNOST:   Yeah.   I played well.   I honestly probably made one bad swing.   I hit it good this weekend, but the one swing got me in trouble; I made 7, and that was kind of it from the start.   I just didn't putt as good today.   I missed some short ones coming in.   And honestly I thought Zach finished at 11â€‘under when I was on 18, so I was trying to make par on the last and get out of there.   And then I got up to the green after I hit it in the bunker, and saw that he was at 9 so that was kind of frustrating.   But it was still a good week.

Q.   After everything that's happened to you, what do you take away from this week?
COLT KNOST:   Yeah, you know, I mean it's a good week.   I locked up my card.

Q.   That's good?
COLT KNOST:   Yeah, I mean that's always good.   You always want to win.   And I gave myself a good chance, but I just didn't get it done.   Carl played great.

Q.   Great to see you in contention, hope it continues for the rest of the PGA TOUR season.
