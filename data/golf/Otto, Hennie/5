  HENNIE OTTO:   The greens are much better this morning.   There's a lot of traffic going through them, so it's an advantage to play in the morning, so the greens run out better in the afternoons.   
Always nice to play in the mornings.   No wind today.   It's picking up a little bit the last couple of holes but I don't think it's going to get any worse.   But there is scoring out there today.   The pins are in pretty decent spots.  
   
 Q.   When you set out knowing you have a good round under your belt, do you aim to push on or just be kind of relaxed and let happen?   
HENNIE OTTO:   I've been playing well the last couple of weeks, so just give it time to go, make putts and just let it keep ticking and that's what I've been doing.  
   
 Q.   I sensed that this is the kind of course where you really should thrive.   
HENNIE OTTO:   Yeah, there's no rough this week.   So you can miss it in a few places where you couldn't before.   It makes it a bit easier to get to the par 5s for two, as well.  
   
 Q.   Kind of a resort course, but one that's got a bit of challenge to it, as well; not just for your everyday hacker.   
HENNIE OTTO:   Definitely not, especially with the back tees.   If the wind does pick up, it's going to be a good test again.  
   
 Q.   Do you have goals or ambitions this time of year?   Clearly you want to win every week but does it go further than that.   
HENNIE OTTO:   No, not really.   It was a couple of tough last four months for me and my family, so yeah, worked a bit hard on it, and it's about time it kicks through.
