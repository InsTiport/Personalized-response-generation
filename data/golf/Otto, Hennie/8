   HENNIE OTTO:  First hole, I had about a 10-foot putt for birdie. 

 Q.  What did you hit in there? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  7-iron.  It was pretty cold this morning. 
 The bogey I made, I 3-putted.  I missed a 3-footer in Hogan's alley. 
 Then I birdied 7.  I hit it to about ten feet and made the putt, 8-iron. 
 On 9, I hit 8-iron just short of the green, it was in the front, it was another 8-footer and I made that. 
 Then I hit a wedge for my second to about six feet and I made that. 
 Then on the par 5, I hit 7-iron in, left of the hole, 2-putt for birdie. 

 Q.  What happened on 11? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  The 11th, I missed a 3-footer again, exactly the same as the previous one, right-to-left. 
 Then the par 5, I hit on in two, 7-iron in there.  Two putts, it was about 20 feet. 
 Then made the best par in my life on 16.  I hit 2-iron -- I duffed it. 
 On 17, I drove a 3-iron to about ten feet and I made a great putt there.  It was a solid round of golf. 

 Q.  You were down there -- 
 HENNIE OTTO:  Yeah, up-and-down -- 

 Q.  Is that the best you've ever played the course? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  No, I've shot 66 before here. 

 Q.  In this tournament? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  2003 or 2004, I'm not sure.  One of those two years. 
 Yeah, it's a good start and the piece is behind us. 

 Q.  Do you feel on a day like this you've got away with it? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  Yeah, we did.  We did.  I mean, the other two courses are pretty fair -- but I'm lucky, I've been playing well for a while.  It's a matter of time to get everything together. 

 Q.  Do you feel ready to win here? 
 HENNIE OTTO:  I'm always ready.  It's just, you know, if I can keep it together.  That's the only thing.  But, we'll see.
