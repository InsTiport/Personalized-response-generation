 Q.   I take it that's a pretty special round, isn't it?   
HENNIE OTTO:   Yeah, definitely.   I mean, like I said, the weather's unbelievable.   You get two days like this in St. Andrews; I don't think so.   
But yeah, I've been playing well the last couple of weeks and I really hit them close today and made some pretty good putts.   
   
 Q.   And you've played well here before.   You tend to relish coming to this part of the world?  
HENNIE OTTO:   Yeah, like I said, a special place.   The golf course we play and the weather we get is unbelievable.   
   
 Q.   Nicely set up for you and your game?   
HENNIE OTTO:   Tomorrow is a test I think for me.   It's Carnoustie tomorrow.   Someone mentioned the sun is going to shine, but we'll see what we get there.   Weather like this, you need to take advantage of these golf courses, and what's that I've done.  
   
 Q.   Was is it a matter of hitting it in the right places, holing some lovely putts; a combination?   
HENNIE OTTO:   Combination.   If I think back, it could have been much lower.   But you have to hit in the right places to be honest.   I've played here a few times, and if the weather is like this, you can go straight at the flags.   The greens are much softer than normal, so it makes a difference.  
   
 Q.   Totally different scenario to playing in Italy but you mentioned the form is good and it's taking that on one week to the next?  
HENNIE OTTO:   Yeah, everyone speaks about, what are you do next week.   Next week is next week.   And if you do play well   ‑‑   I feel comfortable, so that makes it also a bit easier.
