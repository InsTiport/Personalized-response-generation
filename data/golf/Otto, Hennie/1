 Q.  How was that?  
HENNIE OTTO: Yeah, we were fortunate this morning, the wind didn't blow that much.  The wind came up the last couple of holes.  I'm really comfortable this week, I must say.  It's nice to be back after a year of injury.  I'm putting well this week and that helps, as well, and the course is playing shorter than normal.  It's hot and the ball is traveling a little further and the rough is not that thick, so it's a bit forgiving.   
 Q.  Speaking with Jaco yesterday, he said it's similar to a South African field.  Do you find that as well?  
HENNIE OTTO: I think it's the weather.  It's a similar feel to South African courses, public courses, so yeah, there's a little feel there, that you feel comfortable.  But I'm hitting the ball nicely and I'm actually a bit more patient this week.  That always helps.   
 Q.  In the golf game, what's the key going right this week?  
HENNIE OTTO: I would say the putting.  Everyone is going to hit it close this week.  Like I said, the ball is going further so you're hitting shorter irons in.  So if you can hit it close, it makes a difference.   
 Q.  So far so good this week.  
HENNIE OTTO: Yeah, I'll take it.  Two rounds, 7-under, hopefully we'll see you the next two days.
