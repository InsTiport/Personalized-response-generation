Q. How pleased are you with 68 on this golf course?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: Yeah, very pleased.  I didn't play my best but I played good enough to hit a few good shots and make birdies.  I tried to put myself in position.  I didn't hit as many good shots as I wanted to, but the good ones were -- the good ones were putting for birdie and the bad ones, I could up-and-down or two good putts from a long way up.
Yeah, very pleased.  Solid round, five birdies, you know, very pleased.
Q. You played this course for the first time Tuesday and we saw you wrapped up against the weather.  A little bit kinder for you, but what were your first impressions of the golf course?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: The golf course is great.  This morning we played it as easy as it can get.  You know, a little breeze, this kind of breeze, it helps.  It doesn't bother at all.  And you know, soft fairways with the rain earlier on in the week, and the greens are soft, so you can attack it.
If a links course, if you can attack -- links course, no wind and you can attack it like we saw, 8-under, 7-under.  But we are there, 4-under, in any weather, in conditions, any golf course, 4-under is very good on Thursday.
