Q. Strong finish today, but Lydia is just running away it?
SO YEON RYU: She nailed it.
Q. Were you pleased overall with the week and the round?
SO YEON RYU: Oh, yeah, of course.  I haven't got many bogeys this week with the tough conditions, so I'm pretty happy with that.  Especially I struggled with my game the last couple tournaments and it feels really nice to get back from where I was.
My shots were quite awesome.  I would say it could be like one of the best shot conditions since last year I guess.  So I feel pretty comfortable going to play the last two tournaments.
Q. Just putting Lydia's performance in perspective, how dominating is this?
SO YEON RYU: Everyone talks about how young she is, but actually she's not even -- she's still a teenager, so it's really hard to believe how she acts and how she played.  These days, a lot of people start comparing to Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and maybe a bit earlier to compare with those legends, players, but what she achieved is well deserved to compare with someone.
I feel really happy to be playing with someone really special on the Tour.  She's not only a good player but she's a really good person, as well.  You know, if she was not a good person, I might be jealous what she did.  But I totally respect to what she has made and what she is going to do.  I love playing with her on the same tour.
