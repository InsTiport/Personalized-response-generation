   PETE KOWALSKI: Currently 2-under, So Yeon Ryu.   
  
  Q. What's the feeling like knowing going into the morning? I mean, you'll be able to sleep on it and you'll know exactly what you need here the last two holes to pull this off?  
 SO YEON RYU: I think now is really strong breeze, but maybe tomorrow morning is really great weather and the green is a little bit more soft. So I think it is good for me, yeah.   
  
  Q. Do you like where you stand? What's it like to be one shot back here with a chance?  
 SO YEON RYU: I like the 16th hole and hole 17. And lately my iron is really great, so I want to just trust myself.  
  
  Q. Is it a good thing to wait and play those holes tomorrow?  
 SO YEON RYU: Oh, yeah, sure, because now this weather is a little bit strange. Yeah, now I'm a little bit tired because I had 33 holes.  
  
  Q. Have you ever been in this situation before where you know exactly...   
 SO YEON RYU: Oh, yeah. Two years ago I just play one hole playoff on Monday.   
  
  Q. How did you do?  
 SO YEON RYU: Oh, I lose. (Smiling).  
 But tomorrow morning I have three holes, so it is not bad.  
  
  Q. What's been the hardest part with all these delays? I mean, how have you dealt with them?  
 SO YEON RYU: I think I really strong person, and a lot of gallery told me, cheer out, You're the best.   
 And then my parents and my coach all keep talking me, You're the best. Then my caddie is really great, so he help me lot of things, yeah.   
  
  Q. Was it more difficult physically or mentally?  
 SO YEON RYU: Both. But maybe tomorrow more mentally, yeah.
