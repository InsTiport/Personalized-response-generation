 Q.   How difficult was it out there today and the week overall?   
SO YEON RYU:   Well, today's pin location was so tough.   Even, you know, this green is really, really big and levels so different.   So actually I was struggle with my distance control and the green.   But my par putt was pretty well.   So I think today my putt really great, just the middle putt and short putt, just not with long putt.   
The thing is this week my shot was really great, so that's why I finish really well.   So also I really proud of myself, but I think Inbee is just playing another golf course.   I'm pretty sure she's playing the 16th hole or she's playing another hole or whatever.   So I mean, I finish 3rd, it's a really great score and great result, so I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell us the importance or how proud you are that Koreans finished 1, 2, 3 in the U.S. Open?  
SO YEON RYU:   Oh, yeah.   Also when Inbee won the tournament, I was playoff with one of the Korean players.   Also this week we finish first, second, and third as Korean.   
So first of all, I have to really thank Se‑Ri because Se‑Ri opened up the road for us.   That's why Inbee could play really well.   
Also, Se‑Ri is a really great role model to Inbee in every LPGA tournament.   I think this is quite the effect of Se‑Ri Park.   So I really want to say thank you to Se‑Ri.   
   
 Q.   You've won a major before, a USA event.   Inbee has now won three majors in a row on three different courses.   Can you talk about how difficult that is?  
SO YEON RYU:   I heard of it.   She is the first time won three in a row at a major tournament since 1950, a long, long time ago.   I'm pretty sure at that moment was a lot of great player was in the field, but I think pretty much this season has been more‑‑ a lot of players in this field has been more strong, but she won the major tournament three in a row.   
I think that thing with Inbee, she just ready.   You know, after she won the U.S. Open in 2008, she was a bit struggle with her game.   But she never stop it, she never gave up.   So it is right deserve to her.  
   
 Q.   Is it her game, is it her demeanor that just makes her so dominant?  
SO YEON RYU:   The first were her game, I mean the golf skill these days are perfect.   
Well, honestly last year her shot was not really best shot of the Tour, I think.   This year she is bit stronger than last year.   Also her putting was always perfect.   That is why she could play real well.   Also she traveling with her fiancÃ©.   So now she really enjoy her LPGA traveling, and she really enjoy just playing golf.   So I think everything is just happening.   It's just perfect.  
   
 Q.   It was obviously very important for you to be down there to celebrate with her.   Why has that become a tradition with the Koreans?   Where did that start?  
SO YEON RYU:   Well, you know, it's really to hard, on the Tour, the oversees, we are Korean, we live in the state, we speak the different language, different culture.   It's really tough.   We really help each other.   If we know about the really great restaurant, we always going together and have some great time.   
Also, we teach some golf skill to every player.   So it's ‑‑ I think we have to do.   Also, Inbee, you know, last year I was rookie and Inbee gave me a lot of great advice.   Also she helped me like to rent the house, and how can transfer the airport like that.   So also I have to thank a lot to Inbee, so I really want to celebrate Inbee's win.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell us also, you know, if she goes to visit Korea now, what would the treatment be like there after winning three majors in a row?  
SO YEON RYU:   I think now she is already here, but I think it's a bit different than Se‑Ri.   When Se‑Ri won the tournament, Korea was during the IMF season.   It was really tough days.   But also these days the economy is not really well.   But Inbee playing so well.   
Also Inbee have a really a lot of sponsors.   So sponsors really happy with it.   Then I think still golf is a bit like wealthy sport in Korea, so I really wanted to‑‑ want to break that kind of, how can I say, feeling.   So just I want to be Se‑Ri‑‑ I mean, Inbee can be like a hero, like a (indiscernible) Kim.
