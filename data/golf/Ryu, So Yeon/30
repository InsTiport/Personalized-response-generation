 Q.  Great round today.  
SO YEON RYU: Thank you very much.   
 Q.  What was the biggest difference between yesterday and today's round?  
SO YEON RYU: The putting was definitely better than yesterday today.  This morning, I think if somebody tee'd off really early they got like kind of bad draw.   
Afternoon was still windy, but no rain though.  My shots doing really great so I was only really struggle with my putting.  I was able to make a lot of the putt today so, yeah, putting was biggest difference between yesterday and today.   
 Q.  What else changes when the weather gets like that?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, you know, when we have a really strong wind I always try to low as I can.  I been try to working on have a lot ball shape.  I been practicing like low ball and high ball, so I had no problem to control the low one.   
The luckily all shots worked pretty well so I didn't have any like major miss shots.  Everything was just really able to make up, so I happy with my round.  Only one bogey with think weather condition is pretty positive.   
 Q.  Eight wins by Korean players this year; two in a row going into this week, and now three at the top of this leaderboard.  What do you think that says about a nation that so many different golfers...  
SO YEON RYU: You know, definitely feel proud to see like lot of Korean fellow player win lot of tournament.  At the same time could be really great motivate to me.   
Like, Oh, oh, my Korean friend win the tournament.  I want to be one of the Korean champion.  Definitely make me a lot of motivation.
