 Q. Congratulations. 
 SO YEON RYU: Thank you. 

 Q. U.S. Open champion. How does that sound?
 SO YEON RYU: Unbelievable. I thank for the God and then thanks for my sponsor president (indiscernible.) 
 I won the KLPGA tournament six times, but no major. I won the U.S. Women's Open, so I can't believe it. (Laughter.)

 Q. What does it mean to you to have former U.S. Open champion, Se Ri Pak, and Eun-Hee Ji come out and watch you in the playoff? What does that he me.
 An you?
 SO YEON RYU: When I was young Se Ri is my hero. Se Ri 1 is all the Korean golf player hero. 
 And Eun-Hee, I practiced with Eun-Hee in Australia with the training, so I really proud of it, because my hero Se Ri park and Eun-Hee fighting for me, show up for me, so it's really big power. 

 Q. From a golfing standpoint, you played those very same three holes earlier this morning. Do you think that was to your advantage in the playoff?
 SO YEON RYU: Yeah, sure, it was really good for me, because all the people is the same, same team rounds, so same greenscape. So it's really big benefit for me, yeah, huge benefit.
