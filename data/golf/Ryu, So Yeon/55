 Q. Another great tournament here. Tell us about today and the week?  
SO YEON RYU: Actually, I wasn't really having a good start. I started with two over until hole six. But you know, I've been playing this tournament the last three years and this is my fourth year, and then what I have learned the last three years is anything can happen. So I really have to stay patient.   
I'm really proud of myself to stay patient until I made a first birdie. Finally I made a birdie on 7 and another birdie on 8. So that kind of motivated me to, okay, I can do it and let's keep it up. I never gave up. I still enjoy this weather and still enjoy this golf tournament. That's how I finished strong.   
   
 Q. You enjoyed the weather?   
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, like today weather wasn't that bad. And especially I started like four shots back of the leader. And then if the weather is really bad, we have more chance to catch up the leader.   
So I know when the weather is really tough, it's really hard to play. But I do really enjoy it.
