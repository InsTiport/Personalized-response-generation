 Q.   Is there anything you can do to keep cool?   
SO YEON RYU:   Just keep under the shade and keep the umbrella and drinking water.   That's it.   It's just so tough.   
   
 Q.   What will you do now to go cool off?   
SO YEON RYU:   Actually, today, this week I rent a house.   Of course I want to go to it and eat Korean food and then just thinking about my game today, and what's the problem.   But I think it's not a technical problem.   I think it's a mental problem.   I just want to be more focused on the game.   
   
 Q.   And stay out of the heat for a while?  
SO YEON RYU:   Yes, I want to keep cool in my house.
