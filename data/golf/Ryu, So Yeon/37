 Q.  Big win against Lexi today.  What was the key to your strong play out there?  
SO YEON RYU: I know a lot of Lexi's friends were going to come out today, so I just had a mindset, okay, I'm going to play my ball.  Good thing Lexi and I are good friends and Lexi's caddie Benji and my caddie Tom good friends, as well, so we're just having a lot of fun.  Only thing I was thinking about was just winning the match for my country, so I didn't really care about what the spectators were yelling and what kind of name the spectators were yelling.  I really enjoyed it, and I felt like my game has improved after this tournament, so look forward to heading to British.   
 Q.  How much did you enjoy representing Korea in the UL International Crown?  
SO YEON RYU: You know, I've worked really hard to make the Olympic team and I couldn't make it, but I still had a really great chance to represent my country, so I really enjoyed it, and especially Sei Young and I had International Team together, but I never really had a chance to play golf with Amy or In Gee.  This week we played the practice round together and we just sort of talked a lot.  I'm having a lot of fun with my teammates.  Like we couldn't win the tournament, but anyway, we still finished better than last time.  Last time we're third and this year second, so hopefully we can get a crown at 2018.   
 Q.  How excited are you for 2018 when it comes to Korea?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, I was expecting we're going to win the tournament, and I just wanted to bring more excitement to 2018 UL International Crown in Korea, but we couldn't, but I think it's going to feel really awesome to represent my country in my motherland.
