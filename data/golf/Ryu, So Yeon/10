Q. It looked like you struck the ball very well today but just nothing fell.  Is that an accurate representation of the round?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, actually I think I putted overall great except one putt.  But as you said, I couldn't get the right break and all missed.  But like you said, I hit the ball really great.  Yesterday it wasn't but today was better.
Tomorrow I hope I'm going to have a good striking of the ball and putt good.
Q. Right now you're only five shots back, but there are only four players ahead of you.  Is that too big a deficit, or do you feel like you've still got a shot?
SO YEON RYU: Well, I don't think so.  It's a major tournament, and if we don't going to have any more rain, greens are going to firm up, which means it's going to be a lot harder tomorrow.
When golf course is harder, I think more situation can happen.  So I'm just going to do my best tomorrow and then let's see what's going to happen.
Q. Has the golf course gotten progressively more difficult throughout the week?
SO YEON RYU: For sure pin position is getting harder, but just we got so much rain.  So greens a bit softer than like PGA of America expected.  So I think that's why you kind of see a lot of low numbers.  But it looks like we're not going to have anymore rain tomorrow, then for sure tomorrow is going to be tougher condition.
Q. Finishing with nine straight pars, how do you stay patient?
SO YEON RYU: First of all, after I hit a great shot, I missed quite a lot of greens.  And then I had to putt a lot of tough situations, but then I made up-and-down pretty well.  So a lot of credit for myself.
I had a couple of birdie chances but just missed it.  So when it happens, just keep patient because par is still better than bogey.  So I think it's really important to have positive mind.
