Q. So I don't know, world No. 1, first time in Scotland.  I know you might have played a little links golf in the Women's British Open before.  How did you find that?
SO YEON RYU: Well, I'm so glad we play The Scottish Open and the Women's British Open two weeks in a row because links golf is very unique in the US, so I haven't had the time to play links golf.  So sometimes only like a couple days practice round is not enough to get prepared for the Women's British Open.
But right now, we are playing at a links golf here.  It's not just preparing for the Women's British Open, but it's great to get used to the feel of links golf in tournament mode.  So I'm really happy to be in Scotland for two weeks.
Today, the wind was really strong, and I struggled with my putting because the wind was affecting a lot, even on the greens.  Yeah, I think 1-under is really great to start.
Q. Just mentioned it a bit there.  You said your putting was one thing you found difficult in the wind.  Is that literally it; shot-making was all right?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, even with like really strong wind, I always like to come to play links golf.  It's so much fun.  It's definitely different.  Like maybe when we play golf in Scotland, it's better to have the ball on the green instead of flying in the air.  That was a tough part but I think my shot was pretty great, and it was really a matter of putting.
Q. The field, it's a big field, we've got something like 15 of the top 30 in the world and you're obviously coming in here with a lot of confidence, a lot of form.  Would you prefer the conditions to be difficult?  Would that give you an advantage?
SO YEON RYU: Well, hopefully we can have dry weather at least.  But when in Scotland, I'm expecting everything, wind and rain and everything.  If it's going to be tougher condition, it's going to be more fun to play.
