  SO YEON RYU:   The putting was not enough good compared to long game, so I missed quite a lot of eight feet, ten feet putts, disappointing part.   But we still have one more round, so we'll see.  
   
 Q.   Conditions seemed a bit more bearable today and cooler?  
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah, today was a bit cooler.   At the same time, the breeze was a bit strong.   The thing; breeze is not really coming from one side.   The breeze keeps coming around so it's very hard judging where it comes from and how strong it is, so that was the hard part today.   But still, my long game was really great, so I'm really happy.  
   
 Q.   You did very well today and you're a few shots back going into the final round.   Do you still feel like you're in contention?  
SO YEON RYU:   Well, so far, I'm four back from the leader.   Golf, anything can happen, so I want to keep it focused tomorrow.   So you know, I think four shots is not really like big, big.   
I'm going to practice putting a bit more and bring my AGame tomorrow.
