Q. Talked about maybe feeling pressure after the win.  Was it the pressure went away once you got back on the golf course again?
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, actually wasn't really great when you start to concentrated your shot.  You literally just cannot think of any other thing.
So I think that one really helped me to not really think about last week's win, which is really, really good thing.
As soon as I got to the golf course I was feel really comfortable.  Then I real enjoy the play today.  Then I really played well in the front nine, and then just back nine putting really drop down.
So hopefully I am got to drop more putting tomorrow.
Q. How many holes did get through before the delay?
SO YEON RYU: I finish 13.  I just hit the tee shot at 14, so like five more holes to go.
Q. Mess with momentum at all?
SO YEON RYU: No, not really.  Had like a good rest and bit of chat with all the players.  There was a lot of rain.  It was a bit hot, but after that it got really cool down.
To be honest, it was bit tough to judge about the speed, the green speed and everything, but I don't think that was really bothering my play today.
Q. Fun playing with the top three players in the world playing together?
SO YEON RYU: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  No matter who it is, I always enjoy to play with all the LPGA players, but especially May, I mean, Ariya and Lydia is one od the nicest ones on the tour.  So much fun to play with them.
