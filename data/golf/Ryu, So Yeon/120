  Q. Take me through the birdie on 18.   
 SO YEON RYU: Hole 17 I missed a birdie putt, so I'm a little bit upset. So my caddie told me cheer up, so I remind my mind.   
 Then second shot hits really clean and really perfect. My birdie putt a little bit too dangerous, but I made a birdie so I'm happy.   
  
  Q. Based on your play today, this morning, what's your plan going into the final round?   
 SO YEON RYU: Today my tee shot is really great. Just I missed fairways, two or three, and then my putt is really great.   
 So this morning round is really perfect.   
  
  Q. Describe how tough it is mentally to play 18 holes and then to play 18 holes in an hour.   
 SO YEON RYU: Yeah, right, right. You know, maybe Friday I hit 36 holes, and then maybe today I hit again the 36 holes.   
 So a little bit tough, but I just enjoying the round, yeah.
