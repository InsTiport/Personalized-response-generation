Q.   Tough way to finish, but you still gotta be pretty pleased with this week.   Good finish, another good one.
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah.   Well, you know what, thing is these days I'm working on like trusting with my psychologist, and main thing is we just figured out what I can do and which ones I cannot do. 
You know, I can do focus on my ball and I can think about the line and distance and wind kind of thing, but God knows everything, sometimes I cannot handle anything. 
Today I did my best, and I cannot tell which one is really bad, but just last hole is my only bad hole.   So I'm pretty happy with what I'm doing with my psychologist, and actually I do at the golf course.   So I'm pretty happy with my mental thing.

Q.   Gotta feel pretty good about where your game is heading, heading into Evian, last major of the year.   I know that's important to you, winning a major.   You said that was your next goal.
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah, you know what, thing is my shot feels great, my putting feels great.   Maybe only thing is maybe fairway bunker shot is not that great.   Next week I'm going to charge up and be more focused, and I'm pretty sure I can get a good result at Evian.

Q.   Did you know where you stood heading into the 18th hole?   Did you know you needed a par to get into a playoff?
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah.   I knew that.   I supposed to hit it just a little slight draw shot, but I hit a push and unfortunately finished in the bunker.   Also these days I have been struggling with hitting fairway bunker shot.   As you saw, my result was really bad. 
So kind of like the worst scenario.   But yeah, it feels great to be in contention again, and I saw a lot of positive things this week, so honestly, I'm disappointed with my finish, but still happy with my result.
