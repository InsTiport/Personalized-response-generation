Q. Are they just going to go by World Ranking?
SO YEON RYU: By World Ranking, but we cannot play no more than four players at the same country.  And I think right now we are like third, fourth, sixth, seventh, something.  We are so strong.
Q. You just said it was quite an honor to play with Se Ri Pak last round.  What does that mean to you?
SO YEON RYU: Well, I said this a hundred times, but this was the first tournament I ever watch on TV.  And she won the tournament.  So Se Ri and U.S. Women's Open is always really special because of that for me.  And to play golf with her at U.S. Women's Open at her last tournament is such a big deal.  You never really think your idols are going to be like -- going to be gone.  If you think of Superman or Iron Man, you think they're going to be forever really strong.  And it was kind of really hard to see she really struggled with her shoulder, but she really tried to keep -- cheer her up.  And she really tried to keep really smile.
Q. Did you try to help her, too?
SO YEON RYU: Oh, absolutely.  And I can see she wasn't happy with how she played.  But I really can see she really want to keep positive and keep smiling, keep enjoy it.  It was a really weird feeling.  Because to me she was always really strong.
So I think that was the toughest part to play with her.  But at the same time we really enjoyed every moment.  We really talk and really enjoyed all the things.  So it's going to be a really special memory for me.
