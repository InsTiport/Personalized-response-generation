SO YEON RYU: I cannot believe my best friend is going to be a Hall of Famer.  It feels weird.  Because like Hall of Famer for me always feels like someone's like really old people stuff.  Like someone more than 40 years old.  But she became a Famer, it's very hard to believe.  Also I'm very thrilled about that, as well.   
I know she will deserve to become a Famer, and hopefully everybody is going to be impressed to her, and everybody going to feel happy for her.   
 Q.  You know her so well.  What makes her the player that she is?  
SO YEON RYU: I think her attitude.  She's always very positive.  Like, well, you know, like she struggle with her game like 2009 through 2011, pretty much a long time.  Even after that she tried to keep really positive.  And then after having a couple of win after that, you know, she got a lot of confidence.  Then she started to enjoy the life.   
Since then she started to play better.  So for her positive mind, that happy life was the key to her.   
 Q.  She not only played today, but she's even par through 16, playing very well.  Better than many people thought she'd be able to with the injury.  Does that surprise you?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, no.  I always see her really close.  She really struggle with her injury these days.  When you are really famous people start to talk about your everything.  So everything was pretty negative.  That's what I heard.   
But she got through really well.  She know what she want to do.  And she know how she can be happy person.  I think she's going to be really focused on this tournament.  And I don't think she's going to really care about the rest of the things.
