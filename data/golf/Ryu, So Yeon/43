 Q.  How great was it to get the eagle?  
SO YEON RYU: It's really hard to make a birdie, at the same time really hard to make a birdie, but I got an eagle, so it means double happy, double luck.  It was really, really good.  Definitely after I make an eagle, I definitely feel more comfortable to play.  I think it definitely help me through the rest of the holes.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your round and how do you feel about it going into the weekend?  
SO YEON RYU: To be honest, today my tee shot was not really great.  But I handled it pretty well.  Then also my caddie keep told me, just keep calm, don't frustrated.  So I think I really handled it well as mentally.  So I think main key is really keep calm and don't get frustrated on the golf course.   
So first of all I really want to say I really proud of myself to how to handle today.  And then I think my chip shot and my short game was pretty well, as well, so that's how I could make more birdies and more bogeys.  I think main key is just keeping calm for next two days and just have a better tee shot.   
 Q.  Nobody ever really -- with a major it's hard to look at a number -- but even par, given how tough things are, just the state of your game, are you pleased with how it's going?  
SO YEON RYU: Oh, yeah, especially this golf course.  This golf course is so narrow, tee shot is so important.  Greens really hard.  So it's really hard to make a birdie.  So when really tough to make a birdie, even par is still really good score, even par is still happy score to finish at.   
 Q.  On the eagle, how far did you have on your approach shot?  What did you hit?  
SO YEON RYU: It was 152 yards to pin then I hit an 8-iron, and then I pitched the ball 140 and then just rolled it in.
