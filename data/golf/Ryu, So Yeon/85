Q.   Disappointed with that?
SO YEON RYU:   Absolutely disappointed I missed a birdie putt.   But still, I had like quite a rough front nine but I fighting on pretty great the back nine.
Also, you know, also I had a great birdie at 17, but I miss like really important birdie putt at 18.   Sometimes like if I got something lucky, something is unlucky.   So I just accept it and let it go.

Q.   You seem to play well here consistently.   What is it about that? 
SO YEON RYU:   I don't know.   I think this golf course feels more like Korean style golf course, like a lot of trees are around here.   Especially all the crowd is so warm heart, so they give a lot of the energy to me. 
I think that's why I constantly play well in here.

Q.   Any second thoughts about the last putt?   Did you rush it or anything? 
SO YEON RYU:   No, you know what?   I wasn't nervous.   Even I was surprise how I calm myself.   I don't think I miss it because of nerve or something.   I misread the line, so I think that's why I miss it.
I think it's not a big deal. 

Q.   How much were you watching the leaderboard?   It was very tight the whole day.   Looking at it a little bit?
SO YEON RYU:   No, I wasn't really see the leaderboard.   You know, I play on this tour‑‑ this is my third year on the tour.   One thing I learn is don't competing with the other players.   Just focus on my game.
I think that's why I play really great at the back nine.
