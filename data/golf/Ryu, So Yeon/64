Q.   Good round today. 
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah, it was.

Q.   Obviously still in the hunt.   What's the plan for tomorrow?
SO YEON RYU:   Well, you know, seems like Michelle and Lydia is really‑‑ our ranking is pretty similar.   Also now our position is quite similar.
So I really don't want to think about what's going to ranking about it, but I just want to more focus to, you know, how I can go on to make a win this tournament.
If I'm going to win this tournament automatically I can win Race to CME Globe, so I want to focus on this tournament rather than Race to CME Globe.

Q.   I know you're focused on this tournament, but is your team looking at that stuff for you?   Are you getting updates?   Or is it solely this tournament?
SO YEON RYU:   I know every leaderboard is all around the golf course.   I could automatically see what's going to happen and what other players playing right now.
This is my seventh year as professional; also third year on the LPGA.   I really big thing learn about it is if I focus to other thing I always miss the chance.
So I just want to be focused to my game.

Q.   What have been some of the keys to your game this week?
SO YEON RYU:   Well, honestly, it's really hard to predict the green speed.   A little bit of sand on the green and bit of rain and stop rain and stop.
So it's like sand and water mixed and it's really hard to predict it's going to slow or just keep going.   So it's to me green speed control is most biggest thing. 
Then I think this week my shot is pretty good, so I had so many great opportunity to make a birdie.
Thing is about the speed control, just little short, just little short.   So I'm pretty happy with what I'm doing with my long game.   I'm just looking forward making some more birdies with the putting.
