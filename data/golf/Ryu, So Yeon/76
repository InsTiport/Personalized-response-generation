  SO YEON RYU:   The really good thing is I did trust myself.   I was sure I didn't care about anybody, I was really focused on my game, but still, when I hit the great shots, it wasn't that great.   So I thought, oh, it's really hard to make another one, so I would just keep through it, and finally I made it.   16 was really a big hole.   I was sure if I make it, I was going to win, so I just did my best and I really had to try to make it.

Q.   How much did it help playing in threesomes knowing at the start of the day your two closest chasers were right there?
SO YEON RYU:   You know, if we played in twosomes it could be more pay attention to other (inaudible), but playing threesomes still we can talk with each other and it's more healthy to make me feel ease.
