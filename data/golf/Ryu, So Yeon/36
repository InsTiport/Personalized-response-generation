 Q.  What time did you wake up this morning?  
SO YEON RYU: I woke up at 4:30.   
SEI YOUNG KIM: I woke up at 5:20.   
 Q.  Obviously an early night last night then?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, we finished play late.  We were sitting at the locker room for a while, and then I thought we were going to come back to play, so I didn't really have much food, so after that I had to have dinner, then get treatment, so I had to sort of do a lot of things, so I couldn't fall asleep until 11:00 p.m.  Then when you have to wake up early, you just sort of keep thinking, okay, I have to wake up, then just keep really focused on this.  So I couldn't really have much sleep last night.   
 Q.  You guys just feel comfortable playing this early and being able to close out?  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, I think we both really don't care what time we started.  At the regular tournament we had a chance to wake up at 4:00 a.m., especially when I played the British, my tee time was like 6:55, so I had to wake up really early.  I think early or afternoon is not really a big difference for us.   
 Q.  What's the plan the next hour or so?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, actually like England, like America, if someone finished yesterday they had enough sleep, and we're going to go to beat them this afternoon, so we have to have a good rest like they did, and just have a good breakfast and give a lot of chat, like positive chat for each other, then we're ready to go.
