  SO YEON RYU:   Well, today pin position was quite tough.   Obviously my game wasn't really bad.   Just last two hole wasn't really strong finish.   Really bad finish.
17's tee shot was really great shot.   Just unlucky in the water.   Maybe 18 second shot was not bad. 
So it was kind of very unlucky moment.   Still I have one more round for tomorrow.

Q.   How about tomorrow?   Will you change something? 
SO YEON RYU:   No.   Every day is pretty same.   You know, golf is golf and me is me, so every round is same.   I'm going to be playing same.
