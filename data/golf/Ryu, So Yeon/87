Q.   What was it about today? 
SO YEON RYU:   I think today tee shot was pretty great, so I had a lot of great chance to make great iron shot.
I missed couple of birdie putt, but still, at the same time, I made a lot of long birdie putts. 
So I think more about like combination.   I still need to be more working on my iron shot today.

Q.   Having been two years removed from winning this tournament and being set up nicely for the weekend, how much do you love this place now?
SO YEON RYU:   You know, thing is these days I definitely can feel my game is improved, but (indiscernible) not good as that much. 
So I really look forward that this one is going to be next one. 

Q.   You're a seasoned golfer.   What's the goal for you on the second day of the tournament?
SO YEON RYU:   I don't know.   For me every day is just new day.   I'm not really matter if this is final round or first round or second round.   For me, it's same day every day. 

Q.   Any challenges for you on the course today? 
SO YEON RYU:   Yeah, today my putting was not that good as yesterday.   But still, I mean, wasn't really bad.   Just missed couple of par putt and my iron shot wasn't great.
I think my game was quite consistent.

Q.   A lot of people following you as well. 
SO YEON RYU:   It was really great to be playing with the two major champions.   Michelle won the US Open and Mo won the major tournament last week so, which feels always good to playing with major champions.   Always feel I'm one of the other major champion.

Q.   Favorite hole on this course? 
SO YEON RYU:   Actually a lot of favorite hole.   But I think the closing two hole is pretty great.   17 and 18 is parâ€‘5, so still good chance to make a birdie.
