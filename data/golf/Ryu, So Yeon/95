Q.   Just wondering what you thought about that round today. 
SO YEON RYU:   Well, today a lot better than yesterday, but unfortunately my putting wasn't really great so I missed a couple birdie putts.   A little unfortunate.
But after round I got a bit more putting practice, then ready to go low tomorrow. 

Q.   Is it difficult defend a title?
SO YEON RYU:   Absolutely.   Always a little bit of pressure on my shoulder, especially if I'm playing as defending champion.
But this is not a different tournament.   Just regular tournament.   I just want to keep focus on my ball and not think about other people's opinion or the other talking.

Q.   Did you feel a target on your back when you're playing?
SO YEON RYU:   A little bit, but I try to not think about it.   So today I just think about my game.   I didn't think about other thing.
