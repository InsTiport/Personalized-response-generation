 Q.  8-under today.  Great round.  Take us through your day.  
SO YEON RYU: Yeah, actually it was really solid round, but if I have to be picky, I was able to make few more birdie putt.  Maybe last three or four holes I didn't really have a good putting stroke.  Just little disappointed.  But when you shot 64 you cannot complain.   
Yeah, I really liked how I shot right now.  I just want to be putting more.  I'm going to bring my A-Game tomorrow again.   
 Q.  The eagle on 15.  
SO YEON RYU: I hit driver, 3-wood on the green; it was about 30-foot eagle putt, and I finally made it.  That was my longest eagle putt today.   
I missed two really short eagle putt, but I made longest one.   
 Q.  Anna Nordqvist shot a 61 today.  People are going really low.  What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?  
SO YEON RYU: Well, first of all, maybe players' ability is getting better and better and that's why all the girls play really well. Another thing is Arizona is really famous for like dry and firm fairway.  Then when air is really dry ball goes really, really long, so we have more chance to get on for two at the par-5.  That's why you can see a lot of low score   
Yeah, definitely tomorrow it's going to be a lot of birdies coming.  You might can see a lot of eagles as well.  I think main key does pretty much putting, to make a lot of birdie opportunities.
