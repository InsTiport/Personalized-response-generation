Q. Tell me about your round, three back. That's where mow was last year. Do you feel good about that?
SO YEON RYU: Actually four. I think today I was very kind of unfortunate because I thought I hit a really great shot and the ball finished in the rough, so it was really hard to make a lot of birdies. Somehow I made a lot of birdies but at the same time also made a lot of bogeys. 
You know, also today, weather wasn't really great. But I think I fought well. One thing I really like is I was really patient. Then I think my like attitude was really great on the golf course.

Q. What happened on the bogeys and birdies today? Can you take me through those? 
SO YEON RYU: There's so many. Like first hole, I hit driver, second shot, made a birdie, I would say maybe 13 feet.
Then next hole, I did a 3‑putt, bogey. 
Next hole, driver, hit a second, third, and then like ten feet birdie putt. 
The par3, my tee shot finished in the bunker. So bunker shot and then 2‑putt. 
Then 7, I thought I hit a really great driver, but it finished like really harsh right, so I made a bogey there. 
8 was finishing in the bunker, so I had to lay up, bogey. 
My first birdie was I guess the 14th, the par5. I hit the driver, the rough, lay up, rough again and chip out of the rough and had a tap‑in birdie. 
The next, the par3, I had a tap‑in birdie again. 
Then 15, I missed a driver, fell way out. That chip shot was like finish maybe ten feet and missed it again. 
And 17, hit a driver, 3‑wood. I putted off the green and 2‑putt for a birdie. 
The last hole was a 3‑putt, bogey.
