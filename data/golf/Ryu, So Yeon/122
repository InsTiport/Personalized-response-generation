  Q. Nice playing. Really good second round. Could you take me through the second round?  
 SO YEON RYU: Oh, second round shot is really perfect, but in the back nine I couldn't concentration in the ball because I'm really tired.   
 So I a little bit upset, but if I keep going, I can do it. I can do that tomorrow, yeah.   
  
  Q. What's your plan heading into the weekend?   
 SO YEON RYU: I play in KLPGA, but sometimes I play LPGA major tournament. But my best round is 23rd, so I want to play top 10, yeah.   
  
  Q. What part of your game has been good? 2-under today. What was working for you?  
 SO YEON RYU: I think front nine my putting is really good, but back nine my shot is really fantastic but putt a little bit not great.  
 I think tee shot is really important, yeah.  
  
  Q. Can you take me through how a long day like this, how it affects your game?  
 SO YEON RYU: Today I hit 36 hole. It's really tough. But lot of gallery cheer for me, so I could more concentration the ball, yeah.  
  
  Q. When was the last time you played 36 holes?  
 SO YEON RYU: Maybe two years ago. Maybe, yeah.   
  
  Q. Tell me about the conditions of the golf course.   
 SO YEON RYU: Ah, I think the fairway is not too hard, because last year Oakmont is really hard. But the green is really hard, yeah. A lot of break and little mountain break is really hard, yeah.
