Q. Are you happy with the finish?SO YEON RYU: Actually, if I see my score, it wasn't really a bad score, but for me it's most disappointing round, because I had a really great chance at the beginning.  I was in a really great spot, but I pretty much just ruined my kind of like great rhythm with my 3-putt.  So at that point it's really disappointing for me.  But otherwise today the course was set up short but still the hole locations were so hard.  So I'm still happy with what I finished and what my position is at because top-5 finish is still a really great finish. But most important thing is I learned so many things from this golf course and I got more confidence.  I can play well even with these tough conditions.  So this week is not just about like money or rankings.  It's nothing about it, for me, it's about how I realize today me how much I loved to play golf.
Q. As you were saying the other day, you really -- being at the Champion's Dinner and you wanted to see yourself as a multiple winner.  So the performance, obviously you talked about some of the disappointments in today's round, but have you shown yourself that this is something I can win again?SO YEON RYU: Yeah, definitely I could say it.  Today I made really great birdies today and I managed the golf course pretty well.  So I sort of can feel how I'm definitely going to have more chance to make a win at this tough stage.  So this week I definitely got a lot of confidence.
