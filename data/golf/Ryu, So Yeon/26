SO YEON RYU: Yeah, I think maybe today's shot was one of the best shot condition last three days, including today.  So I was able to make some lot of birdie chances.
But putting was not great, you know.  Most important fact is I'm happy with my stroke.  Little missed lie or wind just blew up or something like really tiny thing, so I'm not really worry about that part.
Just going to make sure I'm going to have better speed control tomorrow.
Q. How do you like the position you're in?
SO YEON RYU: You know, I'm in contention.  I'm pretty happy with that.  I think it's feel really great to be in contention the last tournament of the year especially.  This tournament has been having really great winner, so if I can be the last champion of the year that's going to be awesome.
Q. How much affirmation is this for all the hard work you put in this year?
SO YEON RYU: You know what?  So far I think I'm really happy with my tournament.  Last tournament of the year I really want to finish strong.  If I able to finish strong, no matter what I'm going to win or not, I think I'm still going to be really happy to close my season.
I saw so many positive thing through last few tournaments including this one.  I think I got a lot of confidence to prepare the next season to be a consistent winner.
