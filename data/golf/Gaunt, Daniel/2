 Q. So not a bad start to the tournament, 10-under, two shots off the lead. How is it going? 
 DANIEL GAUNT: Yeah, it's good to be in contention again. I haven't really had it since The Challenge Tour last year. I've had a few changes over the last few weeks with the new caddie and a few things freed up on the family side of things and management. 
 So my head is in a clear spot where I can just go out and concentrate on playing good golf.

 Q. Have you got much experience on links golf?
 DANIEL GAUNT: Yeah, a little bit. I've played The Open at Turnberry and stuff like that. It's a game that I love it sort of brings back a lot of feel for me. So it's good to play, and especially in conditions like this, it can't get any better.

 Q. Have you played at St. Andrews before? 
 DANIEL GAUNT: First time.

 Q. And here? 
 DANIEL GAUNT: I played it last year in The Open qualifying and Carnoustie was first in practise last week, as well.

 Q. I guess it's a bit easy at the moment with weather like this?
 DANIEL GAUNT: Yeah, it's good. You still have to hit good shots and you'll still get penalised for bad ones, even though the weather is good, you still have to putt a score together, and I suppose everyone else is doing it, so might as well do it. 

 Q. When you see the names on the leaderboard or in the field, is it daunting? 
 DANIEL GAUNT: It is a little bit. But I've played a little bit with Louis, and everyone out here is pretty much a great guy. We are all out here to do a job and if I can do a job as good as them, I'll be pretty happy.
