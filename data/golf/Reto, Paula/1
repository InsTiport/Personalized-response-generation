 Q.  Had a great round today.  Nice little neat 30 there on the back nine.  Seemed to come alive.  
PAULA RETO: Yeah, you know, on the front I was like, Oh, when are they going to drop?  When are they going to drop?   
Was an easy par-5 on the 9th and didn't drop.  I was like, You know what?  Just keep going.  And then once I hit the eagle on 12, I was like, Oh, that's nice.  It kind of kept me a little relaxed.  Then the next one fell and the next one fell.   
Just keep going and see how many I can get in one nine.   
 Q.  Good feeling.  Tell us about that eagle.  What happened there?  
PAULA RETO: You know, I eagled yesterday, too.  I hit a good drive.  I think I just set myself up with a good drive.  Then I hit 4-iron in and I had about a 15-footer.  Just told myself, Get it to the hole and if it goes in, it does.   
So it was really nice.  Gave me a little bit of momentum.   
 Q.  Where does this rate in terms of your career rounds?  
PAULA RETO: Yeah, well -- yeah.  It's maybe -- I think I had a 7-under before, but this is good.  6-under, I'll take it any day.   
It's been a struggle year so far, so let's see how we can do from here on out.   
 Q.  The wind seems to be starting to pick up a little bit now.  Are you kind of happy you got out in the morning and got it out of the way?  
PAULA RETO: Yeah.  You know what?  It's one of those things.  You either get the morning or the afternoon, and depending on what the wind does for you.  Maybe I got the good draw.  I'm just happy I can play my own game, and see how it goes from there.   
These girls are good, so they'll figure out a way to play in the wind.  (Laughter.)
