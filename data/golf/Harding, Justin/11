 Q.  Tell us about that.  That was an interesting match, wasn't it?  
JUSTIN HARDING: I definitely feel as though I stole it.  I, like Matty, didn't really get too much going.  I battled with the club selection pretty much the entire day.  I hung in there, missed a couple of putts I probably would otherwise like to have not missed.  But I guess the up-and-down on 17 was quite special.  I certainly didn't see that one coming.   
 Q.  It's kind of a massive experience, compared to where you've come from over the years.  How are you enjoying this WGC Dell World Match Play?  
JUSTIN HARDING: It's fantastic.  It's an unbelievable tournament.  It's run very, very well.  And I kind of feel as though it's my second home, I suppose.  I spent four years down in Texas, as well.  I'm just trying to make the most of it, seeing if I can post a few results.  And I feel lucky today, didn't really feel like I won it, but I'll take it.   
 Q.  You need to take some momentum, don't you?  You have another match tomorrow that will be just as tough.  
JUSTIN HARDING: Yeah, I think I'm going to have to improve a little bit to take him on.  Rory's been playing great over the last couple of weeks.  It will be a nice opportunity for me to see how it's done inside the ropes, and maybe learn a little bit as well, and give the boy a little bit of a challenge.
