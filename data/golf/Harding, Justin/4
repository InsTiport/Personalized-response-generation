Q. 65. Out in 29 on the front nine, how was that?
JUSTIN HARDING: Is that was pretty good. The rest of it was a bit of a struggle to be fair. Rolled in a couple putts. Haven't really made a whole lot this week to be fair. It was one of those where I'm just trying to find the greens and the green speeds.
But bogey on 10, kind of lost my head and lost a bit of momentum. Kicking on to the back nine, gave myself a few chances and happy to make a five on the last. Put myself out of position on the tee and grinded my way in. Looking good for the weekend at least.
Q. Positives for the first two rounds?
JUSTIN HARDING: Swinging it better, I really am. Not quite in as many overly punishing golf shots. Feel as though I'm keeping it on the golf course better and managing my game ever so slightly. I like to roll in a couple putts and I missed a few I would otherwise not liked to have done, but then I made a couple, as well, on the front, which kick started me.
That's how golf goes. You wish you could keep momentum through the entire round. I think it's key for success, but today I obviously lost a little bit but hung in there.
Q. Being one off the lead and annoyed with certain putts, you must be pleased you're one shot off the lead?
JUSTIN HARDING: I am. You can see the scores today. Everyone seemed to be going quite deep. It's a matter of me being frustrated that I didn't kick on from the front nine. I'm happy. Going to hit a couple balls and relax and start again tomorrow.
