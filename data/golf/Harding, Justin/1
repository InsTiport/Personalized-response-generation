Q Justin, 8-under for two days work here in Dubai, how would you assess how things have gone so far?
JUSTIN HARDING:   Yeah, pretty good.  It was a weird day today.  I really hit it quite good and gave myself a bunch of chances.  Couldn't seem to make a putt.  The speed and I suppose they are a little tricky in the afternoon, they get a bit crusty, but yeah, couldn't seem to catch an edge.
But I'm happy with the way played.  I was pretty good from tee-to-green.  I had good control distance-wise and yeah, kind of keep giving yourself chance after chance.
Q Probably left a few out there on 17 and the third seemed to be really good chances.
JUSTIN HARDING:   Yeah, they were tiny.  They probably shouldn't have been missed.  Neither was the one on 4 to be fair.  I played good.  It was obviously frustrating, but at the same time I was quite pleased with continually plodding along and giving myself a chance on the next hole.
Yeah, go and see if we can iron out the kinks and focus on the weekend.
Q You're in a really good position now heading into this weekend.  What's the mindset now going into a crucial moving day tomorrow?
JUSTIN HARDING:   Yeah, kind of hang in there.  The course can be a bit challenging, especially in the afternoon.  Greens get firm.
So I'll have to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully roll in a few more putts and keep the bogs off the card and see what that brings tomorrow Sunday.
