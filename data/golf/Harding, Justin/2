  Q A round of 66, but you bogeyed the first.  What happened?
 JUSTIN HARDING:   Missed the fairway.  I played nicely.  I really did.  I managed my game quite well.  When I got myself out of position, I played middle of green, which I suppose hasn't been happening a whole lot lately.  Yeah, the course is be strong par 4s and if you miss the fairway, it certainly is a bit challenging.  But you've just got to try and take advantage of a couple of par 5s out there and see what happens.
 Q How important for you guys, as each season comes around to get off to a good start to try to build momentum for a season?
 JUSTIN HARDING:   I think it's critical.  Obviously having played a long season and taken a break and had some time-outs, you've obviously got a few goals set at the beginning of the year.  I mean, I think everyone here would say that they would love to start well.  It's a little bit of peace of mind, so to speak, if you do get off to a nice enough start and post a couple good results.
 Q A lot of folks at home suffering and lockdowns with everything going on at the moment.  How appreciative are you to be able to travel around with The European Tour?
 JUSTIN HARDING:   Hugely appreciate it.  Look, The European Tour and Keith and his team and everyone involved and back in the U.K. and all the medical staff here or wherever we play, look, none of that's possible without any of them.
 So yeah, it's a privilege to be able to come out and play and do what we love, and make some money, hopefully, at the same time.  Obviously provide a bit of entertainment for those back home.
