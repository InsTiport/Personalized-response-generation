Q.  Talk about this afternoon here.
DOUG TEWELL:  Well, it did, but I didn't play well.  So I can't really say that the golf course eight me up.  I ate myself up.

With a lot of poor shots and a lot of poor positions.  So I got some bad breaks today.  I found a few guys that were out ahead of me and I got in their divots.
Q.  Unlucky then?
DOUG TEWELL:  A little bit unlucky today, but, you know, I got to be realistic right now, I shouldn't even be playing with the elbow the way it is, but I took pain killers to play today and I thought it would help, but I think it masked the problem too much.  But it is okay.  You know, I have had a good 26 years and if this is the last year, then so be it.
Q.  You obviously got some room, some work to do if you want to get back up towards the top, but obviously just playing the weekend.  Talk a little bit about that?
DOUG TEWELL:  Well, right now I'm going to go to the range and work on some stuff with my son, Jay, and see if we can't find something that will just work a little bit better than what I'm trying to do.  I'm going to retire the putter.  This is a putter that I thought was going to work, but the greens just haven't gotten to where I thought they would.  And I just, I got to figure something out.  You know, my goal right now is just to get it in the red on the weekend and smile and be glad that this was a great event for our community.
