  THE MODERATOR:   Decent round, three shots back right now.   Tell us about your day.   
NA YEON CHOI:   I mean, my shot, my putter wasn't great like yesterday.   I guess I dropped too much yesterday.   But I think I'm still in a good position, and I have good patience.   So hopefully a couple more drop tomorrow and Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Was it frustrating today to not be able to make as many birdies?   
NA YEON CHOI:   No, I mean this course I thought was going to be difficult for everybody, and I was surprised Chella Choi shot 8‑under par today.   
But I think today the pin position was more difficult than yesterday.   And my shot, obviously, my shot wasn't great, so I couldn't get many chances for birdie.   So I finished at even par today, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I did today.  
   
 Q.   You saw a 64, 8‑under posted today.   Do you think you have a 64 in you this weekend?   
NA YEON CHOI:   I'm not going to try.   I'm just going to play one shot at a time, especially this golf course.   I think I have to keep the fairway first, and then keep the green and some holes I have to stay below the hole.   I think that is the key to playing well on this course.  
   
 Q.   Do you know Chella?   
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, I know Chella.   She's a little younger than me, and I think I met her when she was 13 or 14.   We had the same winter training in Thailand.  
   
 Q.   She birdied 8 out of 10 holes.   That was pretty amazing.   
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, I saw.   She had birdie on 7 or 8, and then she had, yeah.   I mean, I know her father too.   He really worked hard, and I think they deserve to score today.  
   
 Q.   Is that a very common name, Choi?   
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, in Korea.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   So you're chasing Chella and also Lydia coincidentally who is 15 years old?  
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, she's an amateur.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, she's an amateur.   Do you remember being 15 and where you were in your golf career?   
NA YEON CHOI:   I think I was playing on the Korean National Team.   But when I heard like she's 15 years old, it really surprised me.   I know she won the U.S. Women's Amateur, so I think she had a good ability to play well.   
We have a good match here on Saturday and Sunday, so I think tomorrow just a couple more drop for putting, and I think I'll be okay.
