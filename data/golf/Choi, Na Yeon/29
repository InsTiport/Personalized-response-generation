 Q.   Birdied 8 and 9.   Finished even par, good finish.   Tell me about it.   
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, I tried to just finish it strong.   I mean, today was the hardest day, I think.   A lot of wind out there.   
They moved the tee boxes to the back, so I hit a lot of rescue and 3‑wood for second shot on par‑4.   They play really long.   
But you know what, like five, six weeks ago I came here with bad weather.   At the moment I play really long, and I think that might help today.   And just stay positive and finish strong tomorrow too.  
   
 Q.   Is Inbee too far ahead to catch, you think?   
NA YEON CHOI:   I haven't think about winning today.   Today I didn't have any pressure.   I just tried to fun out there.   
I think I put too much pressure first two rounds, yesterday and on Thursday.   I think I try harder to focus on my game.   I learn.   I realize I needed to focus my game, not other stuff.   So I learn many things this week.   And I have to go one more day, so I do my best and finish better position.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about Inbee's performance?  
NA YEON CHOI:   She is great.   I think she is amazingly sound.   I mean, if someone asked me what is her weakness in her game, I don't think there is nothing for weakness part.   So she is pretty good with everything, even mental.   I think she's great.  
   
 Q.   I hope you can catch her.   
NA YEON CHOI:   I will do my best.
