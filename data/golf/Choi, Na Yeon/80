   MODERATOR: Na Yeon, welcome back. 
 NA YEON CHOI: Thank you.
 MODERATOR: Tell us a little bit about the rounds today.
 NA YEON CHOI: Was not bad out there. I made four birdie, but just couple miss putts. I think just I feel good about my swing and putter, and I have still confidence.
 So looking forward for tomorrow.
 MODERATOR: Do you watch the leaderboards? Did you see how Cristie was doing? 
 NA YEON CHOI: I saw her double bogey. I don't know what happened, but I saw score.
 MODERATOR: When she was at 20, did you see that? 
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah.
 MODERATOR: Does that make you feel like, Wow, I've got to make a whole a lot of birdies? 
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, like amazing score. She didn't finish 54-hole yet, but already 20-under par is amazing score. 
 A bit of a scared. 
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Just the way you was playing, you were talking about how well you were playing, but just needed a couple more birdie putts here and there. Does that give you encouragement that you can catch Cristie tomorrow? 
 MODERATOR: Sort of knowing that you can go low if you just make a few more birdie putts, does that give you confidence that you can make the putts? 
 NA YEON CHOI: That I can make the putts? Yeah, when I miss couple birdie putt I felt maybe -- I feel I lose confidence. 
 But, you know, I think about I have one more day for tomorrow, so I just try never gave up. And then just looking forward for tomorrow. 

 Q. I know you generally approach pretty much every round the same. Is it the same thing for tomorrow?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I just try play a little more aggressive, and then I need more trust myself. That's the key. 

 Q. You mentioned that you were a little scared when you saw that Cristie had gone to 20. When you saw that she had come back to 18, does that boost your confidence a little bit? Hey, I still can go out and get her? 
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah. When she come down to 18, I felt, yeah, just three stroke behind -- is big different five stroke than three stroke behind.
 So I say to caddie, We can do it. We have almost like maybe 22 hole left, so we can keep it up. 

 Q. What was the difference between today and yesterday? What can you do from yesterday tomorrow to win? 
 NA YEON CHOI: I don't know. I was good trust myself yesterday on back nine, and then today I missed couple putt, and then I lose feel of the ball a little, like hook line putt. 
 So I need to be more trust hook line putt. Actually, I had four birdie on front nine. Or slice putt. Then I miss couple hook line putt and then I lose confidence.
 I think tomorrow I need to be more practice hook line in my warm up and then trust that line, target. 
 MODERATOR: Thank you.
