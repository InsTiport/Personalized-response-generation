  MIKE SCANLAN: We would like to welcome Na Yeon Choi, NYC into the interview room. A very good day, 3-under par 69, and you are in second place. How did you play?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think I had a pretty good round, and I had a couple bogeys out there, but I kept trying to keep my composure and I played with Yani and Christie Kerr and I think it was fun to play with them.   
 Yeah, that's why I played well today.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: How good is Yani playing right now?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I mean, I can tell she's playing more aggressive and very powerful and yeah, looks really confident.   
  
  Q. Inaudible.  
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I think I have a good feel about my game. But Yani looks great. I think I learned from Yani today; I mean, she putts, her ball is just over the cup, every putt, like plays really aggressively. So I think kind of have to learn to be like that, be confident. She was very good.  
  
  Q. Were the conditions tough out there with the wind --  
 NA YEON CHOI: Well, I got some bogeys, too, but I know I can't control about the score, so I just keep doing, just try my game or play my game. I did my best. Yeah, I think not -- it doesn't bother me.  
  
  Q. The top five players in the world --  

NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I'm very honest. I enjoyed playing with them. I think they are the best players in the world. Yeah, it's just really surprised me, playing with them or like in ads for tournament. To play with them, I'm really honoured.   
  
  Q. Are you surprised that you, Yani, Cristie, Suzann, are not leading right now after the first round?  
 NA YEON CHOI: No, I think we just played the first round and then we still have to play three more days. So you never know in the first round.   
  
  Q. Is there anything that you would change --  
 NA YEON CHOI: With the English? (Laughter) I think really I had a great year last year. I think I will never forget 2010. It really surprised me.  
 Yeah, I'm really happy to play the LPGA Tour and coming to like Asia or Singapore or Thailand, yeah, I'm really happy right now.   
  
  Q. So last year was the first time for many women --  
 NA YEON CHOI: Two years ago I won two times, 2009, and then 2010.   
  
  Q. The course, how tough it is playing --  
 NA YEON CHOI: Some holes it's very difficult to read the greens, but I try to accept the course conditions. So I think for everybody it is the same.   
  
  Q. What do you think from last year is the difference of the course?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I think the greens are softer than last year, and then everything is the same.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you so much.
