 Q. So you are officially the 2010 Money List leader. You've won the title. How does that feel?
 NA YEON CHOI: That means I got a lot of money this year, right? (Laughter).
 Well, any field, any category, if I Top-10, top one, would be very happy and very honored, any field, right. So I'm very happy right now. 
 You know, I just play one more day tomorrow and then done this year, and I will have to make another -- one more goal for next year. That's very important.

 Q. Was the Money List title one of your goals this year?
 NA YEON CHOI: Well, actually, when I started this year, my goal was like in Top-5 Money List. But it was better than my goal, so really good this year.

 Q. Was it Top-5 because you finished sixth last year? 
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, every year, my goal is better than last year. So next year will be my goal, so it would be Money List No. 1, and then the other goal. 
 But that's only result goal, but I have like small, simple goals, so I'm going to keep my goal.
