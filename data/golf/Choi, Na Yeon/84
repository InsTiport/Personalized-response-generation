 Q. Can you just talk about that awesome front nine? You made that look so easy.
 NA YEON CHOI: I don't know. I had perfect today. I was comfortable with this course and the weather was good and I got good advice from caddie, so that's make me like before.

 Q. The eagle at 9, was that the highlight?
 NA YEON CHOI: (Through translation.) Yeah, that was the best shot today. 
 I got 4-iron for second shot; was close to the -- like carried to the trap, to the bunker. You know, I just hit it with confidence and made like eagle.

 Q. When you did that, are you thinking, I can shoot a really low score, or did you just try to take it one shot at a time?
 NA YEON CHOI: Actually, I just play one shot at a time. Play -- you know, play with fun, with the caddie.

 Q. What happened on the last putt? You didn't get it to the hole. You didn't play the line maybe you wanted to play. What happened on that?
 NA YEON CHOI: I think I forgot some speed to the cup. I just too much think about like the line, because that wasn't really tough lie. So that was like my course.
