  Q. Tell us about your round, obviously you had it really going there for a while?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I think I had a pretty good round, just unlucky on the 18th hole. I tried and hit it from there, but I think I got it wrong. Just one shot mistake, the last hole, and then without that, I think very satisfying today.  
  
  Q. That was your only mistake of the day?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think so, yeah.  
  
  Q. The weather was still quite tough and windy, and it's quite hot; what was your secret?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think actually windy is a little less than yesterday. And then I think for everybody, it's the same. So I just try to accept the weather. I can't control about weather, so I just keep positive.   
  
  Q. Some of the players said they think maybe the holes were a little easier today. Did you find it a bit easier to attack today compared to yesterday?  
 NA YEON CHOI: You mean today is more easy?   
  
  Q. Yeah, the pin positions.   
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I think they have a lot of long par 4s, but they put front pins today, so I think that made it more easier than yesterday.  
  
  Q. And you are now, what, 4-under, so six behind. But there's only I think ten players under par, something like that. Confident heading into the weekend?   
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I think with two more days, and then I'll just play my best and then still have a good feeling about my game. So, yeah, I have confidence.  
  
  Q. This tournament always seems to have the top players, top of the Rolex Rankings do well or very well; what do you think is the reason for that?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I think the course is not easy. The course is difficult and weather; the weather is hot and windy.   
 I don't know, just every good player wins. I think every time it's different. Maybe this year, I don't know.
