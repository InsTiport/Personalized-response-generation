  NA YEON CHOI:   You know, I‑‑ I think I can't believe this.   But maybe tomorrow I can feel it, after‑‑ when I get to Korea.   But you know, I think I did a really good job today.   I had really good patience, and I was very calm.   So I think I I'm very happy and I'm very satisfied now. 

Q.   So you knew about Se Ri's victory in '98.   You knew about Blackwolf Run coming into it.   What does that do to your expectations and your preparation? 
NA YEON CHOI:   Actually, this course wasn't very difficult, I think.   I'm not sure how was it 14 years ago, but I just remember when she hit from the water on 18.   But actually, this week played really hard, and like played very long.   So I think I just trusted when my caddie gave me a number, I just trusted it and trusted my swing and hit it my best and I got some good results. 

Q.   You had a big lead heading into today.   Did that change your preparation? 
NA YEON CHOI:   I wasn't nervous at all.   I mean, I was very calm on Front 9.   But I had one missed shot on 10 tee box and I got triple bogey.   But I bounced back on 11 and I had a good par on 12, and I got luck‑‑ you know, big luck on 13 tee shot. 
So I can't control about that.   I think everything is really helped me this week, and I really appreciate it. 

Q.   What does this do for your future, now that you can say you're a U.S. Women's Open championship? 
NA YEON CHOI:   Like‑‑ you know what, like 14 years ago, Se Ri won, and I watched it.   And then I said I called her legend.   And she inspired all the Korean players.   I want to be like that.   I want to be like Se Ri Pak. 

Q.   Thank you. 
NA YEON CHOI:   Thank you.
