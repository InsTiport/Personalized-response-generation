  Q. Pretty good round, huh?  
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah.  
  
  Q. How did you play today?   
 NA YEON CHOI: Today was perfect day. Actually, I got one bogey, but I had one eagle and seven birdies.   
 Yeah, I had great day. Just, yeah.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about starting your day with four straight birdies. How did that feel?  
 NA YEON CHOI: Actually, I played this morning only last two hole. I mean, I finished the second round bogey and bogey last two hole, and then I feel like not happy starting -- when I starting tee up.  
 But I make birdie, and that make me happy more and easy. And then, I don't know, I'm just trying just one goal today. Like just watching, you know, look at target. Just that's it, yeah.   
  
  Q. What club did you hit on No. 9, the shot you made from the fairway?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I hit rescue, 19 degree.  
  
  Q. What was the yardage?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think 175 to the pin and then into the wind, so 185 shot.  
  
  Q. Did it go straight in or did it bounce?  
 NA YEON CHOI: Bounce. I think two, three bounce.  
  
  Q. Putting-wise, was the putter hot today, or were you hitting it close?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I think both. (Laughter.) Perfect shot and perfect fairway, perfect iron. Everything I think was good.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like you still had a chance to win starting the third round, or just gonna go out there and shoot what I can shoot and see what happens?  
 NA YEON CHOI: I'm just trying my game. Just I didn't think about score. Just try my goal and my game.   
  
  Q. When you made the turn, did you look at the leaderboard and see that you were in the lead?  
 NA YEON CHOI: Actually, I was look leaderboard No. 13. Yeah. I didn't know that I'm leading, but I think after that, I got one bogey, No. 14, yeah.   
 But after bogey, I was just talk with the caddie and like just play my game. Don't look at leaderboard like that.   
  
  Q. Right. So you got a little nervous there? A little excited?  
 NA YEON CHOI: No, just exciting, yeah.
