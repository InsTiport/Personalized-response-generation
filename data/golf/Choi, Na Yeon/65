  Q. Can you talk me through the round, especially with all of the delays?   
 NA YEON CHOI: It was a pretty long day today. Mostly we wait like two and a half hours, three hours. It was a long day but the main thing is we finished it today. I'm very happy.   
 And then I can take more sleep tomorrow, so I mean, very hot right now, humid and I need to take rest for tomorrow.   
 Actually today, I played without a bogey, another round. So I have to be happy with that and no mistakes, just a couple putts, missed a birdie chance, that's it. So I think I'm still doing okay.   
  
  Q. You've been consistent last week, this week; do you feel pretty comfortable putting together these type of rounds?  
 NA YEON CHOI: The last two months, I played very consistently, like I feel like back on practice. So I'm very happy like what I played late lay.   
  
  Q. The big thing for you, you've been putting yourself in contention to win it seems like over the past two months, is that a good feeling again to be up there with the opportunities?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think so. Everybody has ability to win every week, and then even me, I'm just keep going every week, do my best and then I mean, like some people think that if you only win, won something or get something, but I don't think so.   
 Like if I don't win or didn't win, it doesn't the matter. Just every day I learn something, get something. So just keep doing the same thing every day.   
  
  Q. Anything in particular that you feel like over the next couple of days, if you can improve, that might make the difference?   
 NA YEON CHOI: I think just try to do the same thing what I do the last two days, and then really, I have to drink a lot of water, because so hot out there, so I have to take good rest, like after the round, and then eat good food, healthy food and just the same thing.
