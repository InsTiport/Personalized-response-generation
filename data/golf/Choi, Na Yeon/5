Q. Tell me what you did right today.NA YEON CHOI: I think everything was great, especially my putting.  I saved a lot of par. Like today, we just came back this morning and I had a first bogey on 7 today, but I finished strong, so the last one I got birdie.  I feel great and looking forward to the next three days.Q. The fact that you were past champion, does that help you endure everything that happened with all the waiting and all that?NA YEON CHOI: I have a lot of experience with rain delays, so it was no problem.  When I had a champion before at U.S. Open, so I feel great when I come back at U.S. Open.  I love to play some difficult courses, like challenging myself.  So I love to play.Q. The fact that you finished so strong and you get to go back out again, that's probably an advantage, right?NA YEON CHOI: I think so.  I already have one birdie out there.  A little bit of rest and then just go with the good feeling.
