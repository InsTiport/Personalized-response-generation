  THE MODERATOR:   Solid round. 
NA YEON CHOI:   She play well.   She was nervous last couple holes.   She play well today.   She was 6â€‘under I think during the round. 
So, I mean, I couldn't play my game, I think.   But I have next week.   I go to Korea tonight and take a good rest, because I have a good feeling about my game still.   I want to play well next week, too. 
THE MODERATOR:   What about the trouble you had on the back nine? 
NA YEON CHOI:   I think I had bad luck, you know.   On 17, my ball (indiscernible), I couldn't hit it from there.   I really like to thank Inbee, my friend.   I could see she was really nervous.   She's usually not nervous at all.   She was nervous today. 
I'm very happy my friend win this week. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Was the turning point for you on the back nine?
NA YEON CHOI:   I played well front nine, but I had one bogey on No.9.   I mean, I wasn't mad after that bogey, but I think if I made par from there, maybe I could play more better than now, I think.
