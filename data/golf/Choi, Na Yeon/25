Q.   You started out with the lead in round three, how do you look back on that round today?
NA YEON CHOI:   I shoot 3â€‘over today.   I mean, last two days, I didn't hit any bunkers out there, but I got a lot of bunkers out there.   It was kind of nightmare.   I mean, every bunker was not a good lie, so I had to just lay up. 
I mean, when the wind is strong, it wasn't easy out there but I still have to go one more round, so I'll do my best this afternoon. 

Q.   You're only two shots back and there's a lot of possible ties for a lot of the field, what do you think need to improve for your game?
NA YEON CHOI:   I think first of all, I have to hit the fairways first, and then like from like 12, 13, from that, I think are really difficult out there, so I need to trust myself and also sometimes bogey is good, so I have to accept all the situations.

Q.   I know that your coach, Robin Symes, is here this week; what do you think he'll have to say before this final round to you? 
NA YEON CHOI:   I'm pretty sure he'll say you're in good position, trust yourself.   So I just a little bit maybe get pep talk from him and then just enjoy with the weather.
