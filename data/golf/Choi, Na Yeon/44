  THE MODERATOR:   Talk about your day.   4‑under today.   Comfortable with your cushion? 
NA YEON CHOI:   Yeah, I think I so.   I think I had a pretty good round today.   I got two bogey, but I think I'm still in pretty good position. 
I really like to play this golf course.   I have a lot of confidence.   This day I hit a lot of good shot with my iron.   I really looking forward to this week, to get good results like last year. 
THE MODERATOR:   Talk about the two bogeys. 
NA YEON CHOI:   You know, like I told you, my strategy is to keep the fairway first.   But I missed the fairway on 11th hole, so that's why I had bogey on 11. 
Then the other bogey is on 17.   I hit it okay from tee shot, but I had to 3‑putt. 
But, you know, I think it's still good position.   I had six birdies today.   I really like satisfied how I played today. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Do you think you're running away with it already? 
NA YEON CHOI:   I don't know.   I mean, we still have to play two more rounds.   You know, a lot of people, all the players, can play like 6‑, 7‑under par a day.   Nobody knows. 
I still think I'm good position.   I will keep trying hard and make some good results. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
