Q.   For a while you had to sit there and wait and wait and wait to see what would happen.   Then you got in the playoff.   Just take me through the last hour or so and kind of your emotions. 
NA YEON CHOI:   I mean after play I didn't expect like playoff, actually.   I mean but my caddie said, just wait.   In golf nobody knows. 
So I was waiting, and then I think this is a great chance to win playoff, but well, I don't have any regrets really.   I mean I never think of this situation.   So if I win this tournament, that would be great means to me, but I think another time it will come.
