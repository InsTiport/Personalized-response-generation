 Q. Congratulations. You fought very hard. How does it feel to be a rookie and take on someone like Helen? 
 NA YEON CHOI: Right now I don't feel. I cannot think of anything. I feel a little disappointed that I was very nervous. I always thought that I could do it. 

 Q. It hasn't sunk in and do you realize you're one of the best rookies out there. Helen has already won this place, so what did you feel good about? 
 NA YEON CHOI: I tried to focus on my game, but it was difficult at times because of the atmosphere. I just tried to say to myself, "Keep your head up." In the end, it wasn't enough.

 Q. What is your best part of the game right now? What is your favorite part of this course? Why were you doing so well today? You made a big jump. 
 NA YEON CHOI: She was asking for the qualifying rounds, but (Indiscernible).

 Q. Looking forward, next week is going to be your first British Open. Are you looking forward to it? What are you looking forward to? Do you think you'll maybe win there? 
 NA YEON CHOI: I will try.

 Q. What is the best part of your game right now? 
 NA YEON CHOI: My shots and my putts. I feel comfortable. But as it got to the 15 and 16th hole, I made bogey. 
 Until then, with the crowd and everything, I got a little nervous. I guess that's why I missed those shots on those two holes.
