 Q. Tell me about your round today. Happy?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, I got a couple bogeys, and my putting speed was not good on the front nine but I got an eagle, very lucky, and I think pretty good round. I never gave up. 

 Q. Tell me about the eagle on 13?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, on 13, I hit driver and I hit 3-wood for second shot and my ball finished pin-high right side and I chipped it in, maybe 25 yards to the pin. 

 Q. Could you see it go in? 
 NA YEON CHOI: No, no. I just tried to -- just landing area and just try to hit the ball and then it was landing perfect, and, yeah, it was amazing.

 Q. Could you see it go in the hole?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah. 

 Q. And what about your week so far, I think you're probably tied fourth or fifth. Happy with your week?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, well, I'm happy but I have to play one more day. I can't remember but I played in Singapore, I've never played in the Top-10.
 So I want to play well tomorrow and then finish in the Top-10 or Top-5. That's my goal tomorrow.

 Q. It's windy and harder again today?
 NA YEON CHOI: Today is hardest because a lot of wind out there and a lot of switch, so sometimes a lot, sometimes less. So that was I think hard. 

 Q. Sort of game plan tomorrow? Make a few birdies I guess?
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, just keep playing aggressive and then I will do my best. I can't control about score or result. Just play my best.
