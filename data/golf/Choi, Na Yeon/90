 Q. Can you talk about the first two holes?
 NA YEON CHOI: (Through translation.) You know, I had an early tee time today, and I think I was a little nervous coming in as the leader. I think I placed a lot of pressure on myself. 
 The first two holes, I started -- I didn't start very well. It was difficult. But I think after that, I sort of played it out okay. 

 Q. Did you find the course setup today more difficult than yesterday?
 NA YEON CHOI: (Through translation.) Yeah, I think the pin locations were a little bit trickier today than it was yesterday. Hard to say, but, you know, it was more difficult for sure. 
 But yesterday, you know, everything was working for me so well so I was able to score much better, but today was difficult.

 Q. What was it like playing in your group with Lindsey Wright and Suzann Pettersen? Did you enjoy that? Was it challenging?
 NA YEON CHOI: (Through translation.) Yeah, I mean, you know, it's no different than any other weeks, but, you know, this course being so difficult, I had to fully concentrate my mind to the golf course and the game, so we didn't carry too many conversations throughout the round. But, you know, I had fun with Suzann and Lindsey.
