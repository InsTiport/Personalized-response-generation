Q.   First of all, tell us about you day. 
NA YEON CHOI:   I didn't have any birdie today, you know, it was tough.   I mean, yesterday was tough, too, but I got four birdies out there yesterday. 
But I think I putt 19 on back nine for my putt.   I men, my birdie never did go in.   So I mean, I did my best until the last hole and just my putt didn't work well, so now I know what I have to do for practice.   So just prepare for the next tournament.

Q.   Talk about being the‑‑ enjoying a year as the U.S. Women's Open champion.   Did you have fun?
NA YEON CHOI:   Last four days, four rounds, every first hole I heard the announcement I won, you know, 2012 U.S. Women's Open champion.   I feel great. 
I mean, like if I compare this year and last year, I mean, the result is a big different still I'm very proud of myself playing in this tournament. 
The course was very tough, but I love to play this golf course.   I think all the players learn a lot, and I think this is good golf.
