   NA YEON CHOI: First of all, congratulations to Suzann. She played so well today. I shot 2-over par, and it's not a great score, but she played so well. She did a really good job.   
 Like in the playoff, I just hit it and missed the shot, and it's my fault. I think I got still great experience. Like if I have next time like same situation I'll be better than the other player, right? So I got some here.   
 So just not disappointed and I keep trusting myself, and I'm doing great. So we'll see like next week.  
  
  Q. I was going to say, you can take a lot out of this week just how well you played.   
 NA YEON CHOI: Yeah, thank you.
