  Q. Assess your round if you could, please.
 ANDREW PUTNAM:   Yeah, I played really well.  Just had one hole where I made a double on 9 and it was actually playing pretty easy in a downwind, just kind of got it in the trees and tall rough.  But overall I played great golf.  It was a tough course out there.
 Q. How tough was it, especially early this morning, the wind was up and the temperatures were a little chilly?
 ANDREW PUTNAM:   Yeah, from the first hole that we started on I hit driver, 3-iron and it flew like 190 in the air with my 3-iron.  And after seeing that, I knew it was going to be a tough morning.  If you get in the rough it was so wet it was just hard to get out and get on the green.
 Q. When did it kind of maybe change?  When the sun kind of came up, the weather got a little warmer, did it make it a little bit easier, even though the course was playing tough?
 ANDREW PUTNAM:   Yeah, once the rough dried out it made it playable.  But before that it was just like hack out and you were just praying for a par.
 Q. Is that what you expect coming here to Bay Hill, a stern test of golf?
 ANDREW PUTNAM:   Yeah, this is only my second time playing it, so last year it got really windy and played really tough.  So, I mean, this year and last year it's like a U.S. Open out here.
