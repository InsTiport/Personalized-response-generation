THE MODERATOR: Here with Andrew Putnam, runner up at the 2019 Sony Open in Hawaii.  Andrew, wasn't the result you were looking for today, but I'm sure you can take a lot of positives out of this week; career best score.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I am feeling a little letdown right now.  I am sure when I think about it, reflect positive week and a lot of good things have happened.
THE MODERATOR: Take some questions out here.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, that shot on 14, you know, it was the biggest draw I hit all week.  A little surprising that it went that far left.  Thought I hit a perfect shot.
Yeah, just needed to make some better swings.  Kuch was making birdies and played great coming down the stretch.  I just couldn't keep up with him.
Q. What club?
ANDREW PUTNAM: 9-iron, yeah.
Q. You've been in this situation before.  You've won on the PGA Tour.  Was there something about the way he finished up that particularly impressed you?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, you could tell the momentum flipped a little bit when I made that bogey.  He just played some great shots and a little bit safe; still close to the hole and just rolled it in.
Really capitalized on the shots.
Q. And as far as your came goes, something particularly you were comfortable with?
ANDREW PUTNAM: I just felt like I was seeing the line and speed really well.  I usually die my putts in and play a lot of break.  On these greens that's what you got to do.  I felt like I was rolling it right on my line and felt really comfortable on the greens.
My long game, you know, honestly didn't feel that great.  Driver, broke a driver right before I came out to Kapalua.  Trying to figure that out a little bit.  Felt like he was kind of had my B Game with the driving.  Still hit a lot of fairways.  I was impressed with myself for doing that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Somewhat.  Not solid on it.  We'll see.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, it was bad timing, happened right after Christmas.  Pretty much all the companies were away, you know, so hard to get much equipment and test much in that stretch.  Only had a couple days before I went to Kapalua.  What I got is (indiscernible), but just didn't felt 100%.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I felt comfortable today.  I had a great time out there.  I really enjoyed battling with Kuch.  Felt look I hung in there pretty well and still played a great round.  Tricky course.  You can make a lot of bogeys.  I think I just had that one bogey, so overall still really happy with how I did.  Just know that I got to be a little more aggressive.  It takes a lot to win on the PGA TOUR.  Just didn't quite have it towards the end.
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Andrew?
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: I'm playing Palm Springs next week then taking off Torrey and I'll be planning on playing the next three probably.  I'll be done for a few weeks probably before we give birth to our firstborn.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Size of a pineapple.  That's pretty fitting for being in Hawaii.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: She's due the week of Honda.  Yeah, the week of Honda.  I missed the cut there a couple times, so I'm okay with -- I was going to take it off anyway.  Great planning by us.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Most of my family is up in Washington.  Her family is in Minnesota and North Dakota.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yep.  We had all our family out last week.  There were 29 of us in Maui.  We all got to hang out.  It was pretty cool.  My parents have a condo on Maui; my aunt and uncle do, too.  They brought all the cousins and nephews and we had a great time.  29 of us, yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: We went to a luau all together.  That counts as dinner.  No, we never went to a restaurant.  That would've been too crazy.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: I got tickets for most of them, yeah.  I think probably at least 25 of them came out the first day.  It was pretty fun.
Q. (No microphone.)
ANDREW PUTNAM: Probably.  Yeah.  I mean, you got to.
THE MODERATOR: We appreciate the time.  Best of luck next week and beyond.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Thank you.
