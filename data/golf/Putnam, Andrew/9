 Q.  Well, Andrew, not as easy as the first two days, but I thought you kept it together quite nicely; do you agree?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, didn't feel as easy as the first two days, like you said.  Still played a good round.  Still got a chance.   
 Q.  You do have a chance.  You're only two shots back.:  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: You know, Kuch is playing well, so I feel like I've got to get out there and make some birdies if it's not too windy.   
If it's like today it's going to be scorable; have to to stay aggressive.   
 Q.  You kept the putter going out there today.  Was that something that maybe made up for not the ball striking that you wanted?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I just didn't hit the ball as well as I did the first two days.  Still hit a lot of good shots.  Tough pins out there for me to get to, so glad the putter was still going pretty good.   
 Q.  Heading into tomorrow, you got an eight-time PGA TOUR champion you're chasing.  What mentality or attitude do you bring to the final?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: I mean, Kuch is a good dude.  We had a great time today.  He's pretty easygoing.  Just going to try to stay aggressive.  A lot of the birdies out there.  See what happens.
