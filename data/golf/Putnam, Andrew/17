Q. Found a lot of birdies out there today.  Eight of them.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I had a bunch in a row going on this backside.  It was nice.
Q. You started out your inward nine birdies at 10, 11, and 12.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah.  I had an 8-iron on I think like five of the nine holes on my back nine.  I hit them all inside like five, six, ten feet, so it was nice.
Kind of got into a little groove and had a good timeout there.
Q. These numbers change as the round progresses, and the day progresses.  Right now you lead in strokes gained approach to the green and third in strokes gained putting.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, like I said, I had 8-iron probably seen or eight of my 18 holes today.  That makes it a little easier just to dial it in.  It seemed to be working.  I hit one bad one coming in, but still caught the green so it was acceptable.
Q. Help me out here.  Score is really good because we have little wind and the greens appear to be receptive?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, just a light breeze and the greens are soft.  When you have that on the PGA, you're going to have low scores.
Q. You've had a solid, probably not spectacular year:  108 in FedExCup points.  How do you look at the remainder of the season since we're past the halfway mark of the FedExCup race?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, feel like I just got to get in contention.  Been playing good.  Just need to put it all together one of those weeks and see what happens.
