 Q.  A 64, what are your reflections on your round today?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I played really, really great.  Didn't have a bogey, I don't think.  Just pretty much did everything right.  Could have been a little bit lower, too.  So happy with how I played.   
 Q.  You were bogey-free, and you got a lot of birdies.  In pact, the par 3s were your friends today, wouldn't you say?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, they were.  I played the par 3s well.  The par 5s are playing into the wind, so they were playing a little longer, a little tougher.  But the par 3s, you can get them, and yeah, I capitalised on those.   
 Q.  Now we're at the end of the week.  How do you view your time here at The Scottish Open?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: It's been great.  Love coming here.  My family is here with me.  My little daughter is four months old and she's adjusting to the time zone and sleeping.  It's been a great time.  Love the people here and the fans are great.   
 Q.  How is your confidence then going forward now?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I have a lot of confidence.  Been playing well for a while and I think it was a good move to come here early and get used to the time zone and the grass and feel like I have a better chance next week.
