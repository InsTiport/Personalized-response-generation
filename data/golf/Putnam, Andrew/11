Q. Nice way to end the week with a birdie on 18?
ANDREW PUTNAM: It was, yeah.  It was a tough day for me.  I woke up feeling sick.  I had a fever and I didn't know if I was going to make it, so all in all, pretty good.
Q. A T-4 in a World Golf Championship, that must be a good feeling.
ANDREW PUTNAM: Well, I was feeling pretty bad and could hardly swallow this morning.  Got some antibiotics from the doctor and just toughed it out.
Q. Did you consider quitting before the start of the round or any time during the round?
ANDREW PUTNAM: I mean, I've never quit before, so I knew I was going to try to tough it out but it was tough.  I was pretty light-headed.  Just didn't feel like myself.
Q. Considering the circumstances, a good result this week for the new season?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I'm very pleased with starting the day.  I had no idea what to expect.  Just trying to survive.
Q. I think this is your best WGC performance?
ANDREW PUTNAM: My first one, yes.
Q. How do you take the positives from this week to go into the new season, just barely into the new season?
ANDREW PUTNAM: I think this is good.  Playing against the best players in the world, and seeing how your game can match up, it's a confidence builder.
Q. What's after this week?
ANDREW PUTNAM: I'm planning on playing Vegas if I feel better and then taking a week off, and then going to play in Japan for the Dunlop Phoenix Open.
Q. Nice to get some FedExCup points?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, it is.  I'm pleased.
