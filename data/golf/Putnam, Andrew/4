Q. We were just joking before you came on, when is the last time you played match play, you said probably the U.S. Am, maybe 7, 8, maybe 9 years ago.  So what was different about playing today versus the rest of your career on the PGA Tour, in this is your first ever match play?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Definitely more pressure.  First round you're typically not feeling the nerves.  But out here you're ready to go, you're turned on.  And every shot counts and every shot is important.  Yeah, it's exciting.
Q. Patrick Reed is known as a guy who in this format in particular is just really difficult to beat.  So how much did you have to buckle down more, even when you got the lead knowing that he's someone who never quits?
ANDREW PUTNAM: Yeah, I pretty much expected him to make everything coming in and I feel like that's the mentality in match play, you always have to expect your player to do well.  And especially Patrick, he's killed it on the Ryder Cup and I've watched him on TV plenty.
Fun to come out here and play a good round of golf.
