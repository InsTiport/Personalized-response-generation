   TOM KITE: Played good steady round today. Today was certainly quite improved over yesterday, I played pretty well yesterday but I just went brain dead on the back side. Once we got downwind I had more trouble than when I was going into the wind. Today was a little bit of an up and down day; lot of birdies and a lot of bogeys, but all and all, I felt I played pretty well.
 Predicting what's going to happen when you've got this much golf left to play who knows, but so far no one has been able to separate themselves too much from the field. You know if a couple under par or three or four under par ends up leading after two days I've got myself in position where I can do some stuff if I can play really well on the weekend.
 Conditions were 180 degrees different than what we saw in the practice rounds. Yesterday was a little bit of a guessing game for those of us who don't have a lot of local knowledge. It was a struggle for everybody. That's what links is all about. It's tough stuff.
