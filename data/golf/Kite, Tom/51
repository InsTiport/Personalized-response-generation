TOM KITE:  We got a real break with the weather today because it was so horrendous this morning. Hard to believe we could play in shirtsleeves or light sweaters this afternoon, but it certainly gave for a very exciting finish and a lot more people under par. I think there were six people under par. It's really been an exciting event and an exciting week. A really neat tournament.

I played really well today. A really good round. I got real aggressive on a first putt on No. 14 which I thought I could make and I zipped it right on by. I missed the one coming back to make bogey. That hurt me, but other than that and a bad swing on the 13th hole I played a very, very good round of golf. I have trouble complaining about a round of three-under-par today.
Q.  What was your shot on No. 2?
TOM KITE:  Hit a 5-iron about 30 feet and made that for an eagle.

Birdie on No. 9.  Hit it just off the green in two and chipped up and made it from about five feet and made it. A good little pitch shot there.

Birdie on No. 10.  Missed green left and chipped up to about 10 feet.

I also had a good save at No.13. I hit it left which is death and it rolled down to the left of the bunker and I tried to play a run-up shot and I didn't get it up there so I was still in a very deep bunker to the left of 13 and made a great up and down there. Made about a 10-footer for a bogey which really helped. I three-putted No. 14. Hit a pretty good first putt which had a pretty good chance of going in and it rolled about six-feet by and I missed it coming back.

Had a good birdie at 17. Drove it in left rough and hit a nice iron out and hit it to about eight feet for my last birdie.
