Q.   With Tom Kite.   Three birdies on the day today.   Could you walk us through your round a little bit, please. 
TOM KITE:   I had a good day.   I played a good, solid round of golf.   Didn't quite get as much out of it as I was hoping to.   These are tricky, tricky greens, and I kept leaving putts on the edge. 
But it was a little trickier with the wind out there today.   As you can see, some high scores.   But if you're playing well, you can still shoot a good number out there.   There will be some good ones, but there will be some higher scores today.

Q.   Didn't see much wind here the four days you competed.   Today it made it a little bit different golf course. 
TOM KITE:   Yeah, it was a much better test today with the wind.   They didn't have to do anything tricky to the golf course, just let it stand on its own and let the conditions take care of themselves.

Q.   Overall, how would you characterize your four days here at the Championship?   Obviously, a great start. 
TOM KITE:   It's a disappointing finish.   I got myself in a good position to challenge for the win and possibly win the tournament, and I'm playing well.

Q.   Yes. 
TOM KITE:   I just putted very poorly in the third round, missed six putts eight feet and under, and you can't do that when you're trying to win a tournament. 
Today it was a good solid day, but just didn't quite get as much out of it as I should have.   So the first two days were very good and a disappointing weekend. 
But I'm playing well right now, and I'm very encouraged with what's going on in my game.   So looking forward to the rest of the year.

Q.   That's great.   Thank you very much. 
TOM KITE:   Thank you.
