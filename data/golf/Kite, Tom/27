 Q. How do you feel about the round?
 TOM KITE: Well, I hung in there pretty good. I'm not playing particularly well from tee to green, but I'm battling like crazy right now. I'm making some good putts. Even though I missed a couple on the front nine today. 
 So, kind of got myself into position to do something unless somebody -- I think Langer and Sluman are about to go to even, so I'm still a good ways back. But at least I'm within shouting distance. 

 Q. How do you approach tomorrow?
 TOM KITE: Got to go low somehow. And on this golf course it's not giving up many low scores, but somehow I need to battle and see if I can come up with a 65 or 66 or 67, something in that neighborhood to even have a chance. 

 Q. Are you going to make any changes between now and then to do that?
 TOM KITE: Well, no, I mean I got what I got. I'm just going to have to do it better.
