 Q.   alk a little bit about your round today.   I know at one point you made 14 straight pars.   
TOM KITE:   Yeah, it was kind of one of those good rounds, but disappointing rounds.   I really played well and I was not able to get any putts in.   I only made two birdies all day, on 2 and 17.   And both of those were inside four feet.   
Really hit some nice iron shots out there and it's kind of hard to complain with an under par score, but it could have been a low one today.   
   
 Q.   What effect did this rain kind of have on the golf course?  
TOM KITE:   Not much.   It's a hair softer, but not much at all.   It didn't rain that hard or it certainly didn't rain that long.  
   
 Q.   Did you notice catching any mud balls out there?  
TOM KITE:   I didn't, no.   No, I hit ‑‑ we played three holes and I didn't have any mud on the ball at all.
