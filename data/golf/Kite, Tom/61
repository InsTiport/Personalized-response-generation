 Q.  You looked like you were handling the back 9 well?
TOM KITE:  I'm not in good shape on 17.  I've got a difficult up-and-down coming ahead of me tomorrow morning.  But I'm playing well right now.  I'm just really only hit one bad shot and that was the drive on 17.

Q.  It's a tough one to sleep on.  Would you rather have thought that you should have finished or would you like to be safe the way you are?
TOM KITE:  They're looking at the weather, I've got to go with their choices on that thing.  If they think it's dangerous to have us out there, we have to go with their decision.

Q.  When I looked at everything, it looked like you were driving the ball great until the last hole, but the putting, looks like maybe no 3-putts, but not quite enough 1 putts?
TOM KITE:  I'm putting very well.  I'm very pleased with everything.  3-under par is a very good score out here.
