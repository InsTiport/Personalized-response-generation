 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 TOM KITE:  Well, both.  The golf course was so tough.  It's just such a wonderful golf course.  But it is brutally difficult.  And apart from about three or four guys, the golf course got the better end of most of us.  I played well on the weekend, I didn't play well on Thursday and Friday, and so I'm encourage with the last couple rounds. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 TOM KITE:  It's definitely not unfair.  But it is hard.  Unbelievably hard.  Every time you hit a good shot it generally turns out good.  Every time you hit a poor shot, you just get hammered. 

 Q.  What are some of the things that they're going to have to do by the time the 2012 PGA Championship comes here?  Do they need to change anything? 
 TOM KITE:  I don't think so.  I think the course is pretty good.  The wind's going to blow.  We got a couple of days of it.  Didn't have all four, but we had a couple of days.  And they will obviously set it up stronger for the PGA than they do for the Senior PGA Championship.  But the golf course is pretty good.  They don't have to do much.
