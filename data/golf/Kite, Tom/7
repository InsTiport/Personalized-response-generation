TOM KITE:   Just exactly like I started out today.   Just a nice consistent round, right?


TOM KITE:   It's that type of golf course.   There are some opportunities out there to take advantage of the golf course, if you drive it in the fairway.   If you drive it in the rough like I did on my last nine holes, the front nine, you're going to pay the price.
It is a hard‑working golf course.   Tom Watson earlier this week said, if you don't drive it on the fairway, you're going to be going home Friday night.   Fortunately, I drove it on the fairway for nine holes and took advantage of good shots and good putts and got myself in good position.
And then a couple of errant swings jumped up and bit me.


TOM KITE:   Pretty good guess I might be going there.


TOM KITE:   I've been working on a couple of things on my swings, trying to stay over the ball a little bit better and not move off it so much.   I was pretty good today on the front nine, and the back nine, I just lost it a little bit until those last three holes.   On 7, 8 and 9, I really made some good shots.   Bogey on 9, very disappointing because that was such a terrific iron shot off the tee.   So that's a little frustrating.
But there was a six‑hole stretch there where I just got off, out of sorts, and try to get back to doing what I've been doing.


TOM KITE:   Thank you.   I appreciate it.
