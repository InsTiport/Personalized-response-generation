Q.  How do you think you played today?
TOM KITE:  I played very poorly today.  73.  I really struggled out there.  Didn't hit the ball very well.  Got to do a little better the next couple of days.
Q.  What do you have in mind for making a better round tomorrow?
TOM KITE:  Hopefully hitting the ball better.  Got to figure out a way to get the driver in the fairway.  It was not very good.
