 Q. You're tied for fourth going into the weekend, how do you feel --
 TOM KITE: Well, we don't know that yet. 

 Q. Well, what's your game plan for the weekend?
 TOM KITE: We have no clue how we're going to finish up, but I think that they will shoot some low scores this afternoon. 
 But I played really well, I didn't get, didn't finish as well as I would have liked, but I went bogey, bogey on the last two holes, but.

 Q. Do you think you'll have a different game plan for the weekend?
 TOM KITE: No, I just play the golf course. Just play the golf course, that's all you can do. But I was just pleased with the way I played, and apart from the finish, really pleased. But it's a tricky little golf course, it's not going to give up many low scores.

 Q. Did the greens play differently today?
 TOM KITE: Oh, yeah. If you had a totally late tee time, you probably, I would say it's 45 or 50 percent different. That's a bad deal if you went late/early, because the greens are a lot softer and they're not drying out. There's no wind. 
 Yeah, they played a lot differently today. They watered a lot. As a matter of fact, they watered them so much that they had casual water in front of the 18th green when we got there. 
 I hit a low 3-iron in there and it backed up. It landed four feet short of the green and ended up six feet short of the green. They kind of tricked us there. I played okay.
