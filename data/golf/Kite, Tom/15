  Q. What were the highlights for you today?  
 TOM KITE: Oh, well it was a pretty steady round. I got off to a bad start with a bogey on the very first hole, but then played really well from that point on. I made four birdies and the rest pars and it was a pretty steady round.   
 Kind of scrambled a little bit in a couple places and got some pretty good breaks, but all in all a pretty good round.   
  
  Q. Holes 15 and 16 had back-to-back birdies. How were you feeling at the time? Just in the zone or what was clicking at the right time?  
 TOM KITE: Well I hit, knocked it on both those par-5s in two. And that always helps when you do that. And I was able to 2-putt.   
  
  Q. Same plan of attack for tomorrow?  
 TOM KITE: Hopefully the weather will be a little calmer and I'll play a little better.
