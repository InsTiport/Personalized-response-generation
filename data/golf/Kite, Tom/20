  Q. Just your thoughts on your round?   
 TOM KITE: Yeah, I played well today. Went the whole round without making any bogeys. I think I only missed one green in regulation -- no. I missed two greens in regulation.   
 That was a solid round, one of those, had the putter been a little bit hotter, it could have been a really nice round. But good position. The golf course, it looks easy, but it doesn't give up many good scores.   
  
  Q. This is obviously different from being on a links course. Do you enjoy that different challenge today?  
 TOM KITE: Sure, the golf course still compared to the American golf courses, still plays a little bit like a links, for us. We know it's not as bouncy as a traditional links, but still the ball bounces nicely and has similar characteristics.   
 So we have to adjust it a little bit because it's a little bit firmer and bouncier than the traditional courses in the States.   
  
  Q. How has your game been this year so far?  
 TOM KITE: Started off very poorly. The first couple of months were very poor, and then the last couple of months have been very good. Haven't popped through with a win yet, but I've had quite a few Top-10 finishes in a row, so I'm very pleased.
