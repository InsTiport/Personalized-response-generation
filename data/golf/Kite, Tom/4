 Q.   Could you talk a little bit about your round today.   
TOM KITE:   Well, it was a little inconsistent.   I did some really nice things and seemed like when I hit some good shots I wasn't able to capitalize on the putts.   And then I hit a couple of crummy shots and so it was kind of a little up‑and‑down round.   
But even par is not a terrible score on this golf course.   It's, there's some good scores out there, but not many of them.   And I'm not too dissatisfied with even par today, but one of those that I feel like probably could have been a little better.   
   
 Q.   How was the course playing today in comparison to yesterday?  
TOM KITE:   Well it was a perfect day and no wind, so a little bit easier today, even though for some reason the scores are a little higher.   I guess that they moved the tees back to where we were expecting them to be, yesterday with the high winds they moved a few of them up.   So I think that the golf course had a little more teeth today, even though the weather was perfect.
