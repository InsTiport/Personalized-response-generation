TOM KITE:  Obviously, I'm hugely disappointed, played great the entire week.

I felt like I was in control of my ball-striking for 67 holes.  I don't think I got tired out there, made some bad swings down the stretch, but I don't think I got tired because I'm not tired now.

Crowds this week were tremendous here in St. Louis.  They were really pulling us on.

I got a bad break at 18 on the drive.  The ball flew the bunker and then came back, then bounced back in and actually buried slightly in its own pitch mark.  I knew Peter was 12-under at the time, so bogey wouldn't do me any good, and I had to give the shot a try.

I thought I had a chance actually to get the ball over the lip.  With a decent lie, there was no problem getting it over the lip.  I tried to pick the ball from the lie I had.
