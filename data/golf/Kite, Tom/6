 Q.   Obviously not the day you wanted.   
TOM KITE:   Yeah, it was‑‑ you know, I played so well the first two days and especially putted well.   Today, I missed six putts that I've been making, and that really was the difference.   I started off missing a couple of makable putts early on and just never got my rhythm on the greens.   
The greens‑‑ I played yesterday afternoon and the greens were firmer and much, much faster.   Today, they had watered them quite a bit, as evidenced by the good scores, and I just never got the speed of them.   They were, I would say, a foot to a foot and a half slower reading on the stimpmeter today than they were yesterday afternoon, at least, and I just never got it.  
To go the whole day and not make a birdie, and I had some opportunities out there, but I had my first three‑putt on 15, hit a nice little 5 wood into the green, three‑putted the green just to kind of top off the day.   So it was a struggle on the greens for me.  
   
 Q.   Did the frustration on the greens lead to pressing more and trying to do more with the irons and the woods?   
TOM KITE:   Yeah, I needed to try to get some birdies going, especially with the low scores that were being shot out there.   Yeah, I hit some errant shots coming down the stretch as a result of that.  
   
 Q.   All right.   Well, thanks.   
TOM KITE:   Thank you, appreciate it.
