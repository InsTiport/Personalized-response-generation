Q.   Do you want to talk a little bit about your front nine today.   Your birdies on 4, 7 and 8. 
TOM KITE:   Yeah, it was very up‑and‑down all day today.   A lot of birdies and a lot of bogeys.   Ended up shooting even par and not very consistent golf.   I've been playing much better than I did today and it was disappointing to struggle as much as I did out there. 
Some good shots every now and then, but way too many bogeys out there to say the least.

Q.   Enjoy playing 18 with Peter today?
TOM KITE:   Yeah, oh, Pete's always fun to play with.   We always have a good time.   And he didn't play much better than I did.   We both struggled out there.   And it's always fun to be with him, but it's surely a lot more fun when you're both hitting on all cylinders.

Q.   How was the experience this week at this Major?
TOM KITE:   It was good.   The golf course is good.   It's certainly different than it was at the Senior Open a few years ago in 2004.   They changed the golf course a lot and I guess there's some opinions as to whether it's good or bad.   The greens are certainly a lot more undulating and penal than they used to be.
