  TOM KITE:   Yeah that was a tough shot, no question about it.  To have a 5 wood into that green going back to that pin was pretty dangerous.  Coming way with birdie was a lot of fun.  That's an exciting hole.  There's a lot of neat things that can happen on that hole.  You can make 3, you can make a 7.  It's a fun hole to watch.
