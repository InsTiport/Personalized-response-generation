TOM KITE:  I'm a little disappointed because I had been playing well the last couple of days. I played well until I made a bonehead play at No. 17. I went brain dead and tried to hit a 5-wood from a poor lie. I had driven into the rough and thought my lie was a little better than it was. It was disappointing to make a bogey on a par 5.
Q.  What were the conditions like? They appeared to be very difficult.
TOM KITE:  It was a very tough day to play because of the wind. It is a really good course and the made it a difficult, tricky day. It kept you guessing at times. The last few holes the wind really seemed to pick up and it was tough to get it close to the hole.

I like the position I'm in, though. I don't think too many people finished under par today. The course is difficult and it's not going to give up too many low scores.
