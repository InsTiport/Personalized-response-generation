Q.  How was your round today?
TOM KITE:  I didn't play very well.  I shot 3 over today.  I need to play well tomorrow.
Q.  Off of the golf subject, I hear you're a big Longhorn fan?
TOM KITE:  Um hum.
Q.  What do you think about their football team next season?
TOM KITE:  I think they're going to be very good.  I think we got some big shoes to fill with Vince Young leaving, but everybody else is coming back, so we should be pretty good.
Q.  Did you go to the championship game last year?
TOM KITE:  I did.  It was great to watch.
