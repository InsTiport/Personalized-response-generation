TOM KITE:  What a day. It's a difficult course most times but it was even more so today with those conditions.

I putted poorly today, but I'm still in the tournament. It was especially frustrating especially after playing so well yesterday. The wind has changed direction every day and today was probably the most difficult we've seen the course this week. It was quite a battle out there.

I love the position I'm in. Looks like I'll only be two shots behind when we start tomorrow.

Birdies, No. 1 -- PW, 15-foot putt.

No. 2 -- Hit 6-iron over green, chip, made 5-foot putt.

No. 10 -- wedge, 10-foot putt.

Bogeys, No. 4 -- chip, 15-feet past and missed putt.

No. 5 -- 3-putt from 40 feet, 4-foot miss.

No. 6 -- chip, hit poor putt.

No. 7 -- missed left, missed 8-foot putt.

No. 17 -- poor 8-iron on third shot, bunker, missed up and down.
