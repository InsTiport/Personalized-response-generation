Q. You guys probably came to the course thinking hopefully it's a long day, right?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Exactly.
Q. What time did you guys get up this morning?
FRANKIE CAPAN: 4:30.
Q. You were here by?
FRANKIE CAPAN: What, 5:30?
SHUAI MING WONG: 5:30.  Yeah, here by 5:30.
Q. Up by 7:00, played one hole.  How long did you have to sit around after you got through that?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Let's see, we got down at 7:45?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah.
FRANKIE CAPAN: Had to wait until our 10:36 tee time.
Q. So what did you guys do?
SHUAI MING WONG: Watched some Netflix.
FRANKIE CAPAN: FaceTimed with some friends.
Q. No snooze?
SHUAI MING WONG: No.  Went to the fitness center here for a little bit, just trying to kill time.  We were thinking about heading back, but it's like a 20-25 minute drive, and by the time we get there, we'd only have half an hour and we'd have to come right back, so it's not really worth it.
Q. You're staying in a hotel?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, Homewood.  So we decided to stay here and hang out.  It worked out well.
Q. You took out a team that's been hot in stroke play?
SHUAI MING WONG: Uh-huh.
Q. How much with your experience last year?
FRANKIE CAPAN: In match play we know anything can happen, and we both know we can play match play well as a team, so we knew it was really just important to get to match play.  We have faith.  Like I have faith and trust in Ben's game.  We knew that as long as we got into match play that we would have a solid chance.
Q. It looked like it was a grind though?
FRANKIE CAPAN: It was.  It didn't start out too well, but we were able to turn it around.  After the rain delay, especially.
Q. Did the rain delay just give you a chance to recharge?
SHUAI MING WONG: I mean, yeah.  We went in, but, yeah, the rain delay we went in, just had some lunch.  We were actually kind of like at the point where we needed some fuel.  So went in there and got a good meal in.  Frankie got a little nap in, I saw that.
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, I passed out.
SHUAI MING WONG: So, I guess we did do a little recharge there and a little reset.
Q. How many holes did you play?
SHUAI MING WONG: Five.
FRANKIE CAPAN: We were on 6, the fairway green.
Q. What was the status of your match at that point?
SHUAI MING WONG: We were 1-down.  And dude, that power nap helped.  They're underrated.  I was on the greenside bunker and they were all kind of in not so good spots, so I knew that a par would likely win.  I was able to hit a nice bunker shot out there and just tap-in distance.
Q. That was on 6?
FRANKIE CAPAN: That was 6.  Got it back to what?
SHUAI MING WONG: Got it back to all square.  Then he hit a really -- we halved 8 or 7 and 8, and he hit a really nice 6-iron in on 9 to two and a half feet, and it was nice heading to the back nine up.
Q. Then 15, 16, you were square going into 15, you made birdie-birdie?
FRANKIE CAPAN: They chipped in on 14.
Q. They did?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, they chipped in on 14.
FRANKIE CAPAN: They had the tees up on 15.  They both hit good tee shots and he stepped up there and hit it 20 yards off the green.
Q. Driver?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, just to the right.  The way that hole works, he was pin high just right, and once he was in good position I took it right at the pin and had 30 feet for eagle.  Then he hit his chip up to, what?  Two inches.
Q. To concede a birdie?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah.
Q. And then 16?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, 16, we all just hit pretty solid tee shots down there.  I think Frankie flagged it, and I hit it to about 8 to 10 feet.  They both hit good shots 8 to 12 feet.  I hit the birdie putt there, I was pretty confident.  They both missed.  I thought we were planning for them to make one of them.  Fortunately, for us, they missed both of them, so we went up two.
Q. 2-up after 16.  Then you went to 17.
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, yeah.
FRANKIE CAPAN: It was a conceded birdie.
SHUAI MING WONG: They both kind of struggled a little bit.
Q. Nice to have a match under your belt?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, exactly.  Especially taking on a No. 2 seed, feel pretty good about ourselves.
SHUAI MING WONG: Scores don't matter now.
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
Q. You guys know that from last year.  You were alternates and got to the finals last year, so you never know?
FRANKIE CAPAN: What were we 7 seed last year?  So we did fairly well.
Q. 31 seed this year.  So doesn't matter.
