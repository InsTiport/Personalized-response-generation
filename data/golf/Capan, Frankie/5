Q. You go by Ben even though your formal name is Shuai.  How long have you been in the States for?
SHUAI MING WONG: I've been living in the United States for about three years.
Q. That was quite a match.  You guys were down a good percentage of that back nine.  Where'd you square the match at, what hole?
SHUAI MING WONG: We squared at 16.
Q. Birdie, par?
SHUAI MING WONG: Par.
FRANKIE CAPAN: 16 is a tough hole.  45 into the wind, and so we squared it with a par on 16.
Q. What did you stuff in to 18?
SHUAI MING WONG: I hit into a pitching wedge.
Q. How far?
SHUAI MING WONG: 133 into the wind uphill.  I was a little juiced up, and I had to hit it 145, hit it perfect, a little short and left myself a great opportunity.
Q. About ten feet?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, it was about ten feet.
Q. What were your thoughts as you stepped over that?  I'm sure you've hit a lot of ten-footers in your life?
SHUAI MING WONG: With Frankie, with securing par, I was actually really confident over the putt.  I didn't want to brag, but I really wasn't nervous at all.  I could feel the adrenaline in my hands, but it was not really pressure.  Just excitement for the ball to get in the hole.
Q. Is this the farthest you've gone in a USGA event?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, yeah.  I made it to round of 16 at US Junior.  Did you?
SHUAI MING WONG: No, I didn't.  I made it to the round of 32 at the USGA.
Q. You guys played last year.  Where did you get beat?
SHUAI MING WONG: Round of 16.
Q. In your experience, is that a difference when you come to something like that?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah.  I would say matured a little bit and learned how to close it out a little bit earlier.
CHIP BROOKE: Our first couple matches we had them down, and just kind of never let them have a chance to come back.  I think last year we may have eased off the accelerator coming down the stretch when we were up in our match, and we just kind of learned from that.  But it was a really solid match this afternoon.  William and David played great.
Q. They've got a lot of experience out here.
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, they do.
Q. David won a North and South Junior?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, yes.
Q. Well, the rest of the teams left they're all Mid Am guys.  We've never had a junior team win this.  We've had a Mid-Am team and college team.
FRANKIE CAPAN: We could be the first.
Q. A couple of your brethren were knocked out.
FRANKIE CAPAN: I know, we were hoping to play them this afternoon, but I heard William and David played very solid.
Q. Yeah, they did.  They made five birdies.  You guys are both going to be high school seniors?
SHUAI MING WONG: High school seniors.
Q. You're going to?
FRANKIE CAPAN: I'm going to SMU.
SHUAI MING WONG: Alabama.
FRANKIE CAPAN: They're both my teammates.
Q. The following year, they're going in this year; correct?
FRANKIE CAPAN: They're going in this year, yeah.
Q. So you'll see them in '18.  You speak pretty good English.  Did you grow up speaking English?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, yeah, I did.
Q. In Hong Kong, that's English speaking?  What made you come over here?
SHUAI MING WONG: I guess like the golf here, the junior golf is unbelievable here.  Just the history of golf kind of helps juniors develop a lot more.  My parents and I, our family, just really saw the opportunity for me to come.  I was excited to be with my buddies like this guy right here.
Q. How does a guy from Minnesota end up with a guy from Hong Kong?  I mean, are you making any trips to the far east?
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah.
SHUAI MING WONG: So you go.
FRANKIE CAPAN: So we played in this event ten years ago in Florida called The Pars.
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah, pars.
FRANKIE CAPAN: Yeah, just pars.  It was in port St. Lucie, and it was funny because until a couple years ago we both had our record rounds.  I shot 64, he shot 66, until like two years ago.  So we met and played together then.  He beat me.
Q. Okay, so you struck up a friendship?
SHUAI MING WONG: Yeah.
FRANKIE CAPAN: I kept seeing him.  You didn't move until freshman year, right?
SHUAI MING WONG: No.
FRANKIE CAPAN: And I would see him all summer at events, and we became close buddies.  I ended up caddying for him at the U.S. junior, and that's how our friendship grew.
Q. Why not.  You guys are going to different schools though.  You're going to be rivals in college?
SHUAI MING WONG: We're kind of bummed.  But we're still going to be super close.
FRANKIE CAPAN: It's like a four-hour drive.
