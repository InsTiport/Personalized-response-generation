 Q. You had a great day today. 1-over. 
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah. I did.

 Q. Fantastic. Three birdies?
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah. I birdied them hard holes. I birdied holes like 12 and 7 and those are hard holes. 

 Q. Did the course play like you expected?
 JOHN AUBREY: Well, it's hard and fast and it's to my liking now, you know. I don't like them soft and muddy. 

 Q. Last year you had a great year at this event as well, oh, I mean the Professional National Championship. You came in second. 
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah, I did.

 Q. It looks like you maybe had some time off for a couple years. 
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah, I did. I was with my kids, spending some time with the family and I have a couple businesses, a golf course and I'm busy doing that. And, no, there's more in life than golf.

 Q. You got the bug back?
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah.

 Q. And last year was a good year for you?
 JOHN AUBREY: Yeah.

 Q. It's like how many tournaments you played this year?
 JOHN AUBREY: This is the first. A couple of little ones in our section, but other than that, nothing. 

 Q. How did the greens play today?
 JOHN AUBREY: They played very good. Real tough. The whole golf course is tough, it's good, but it's tough. What else can you say? It's hard.
