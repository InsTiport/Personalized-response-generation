 Q. I want to get some highlights of your round so far and how the course conditions are playing out there. 
 RON VLOSICH: Highlights today, there wasn't too many. I birdied 15 and 16 was really kind of the highlights. And the course played relatively tame compared to what it's been. The winds were light and just it was out there today for sure, the course was playing well, very nice.

 Q. How is the gallery support and that? Did that prove to be a lot of extra motivation for you?
 RON VLOSICH: It was great. I saw a lot of people I haven't seen in a long time and a lot of my friends from the country club at Green Gables, so, yeah, it was good, it was really nice to see all those people.
