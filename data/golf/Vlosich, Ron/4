  Q. This was your debut in the Senior PGA Championship. How was the overall experience?  
 RON VLOSICH: It was great. Yeah, the course was fabulous, I really liked it. And the people were wonderful. And it was well run. And it was just a real pleasure to play in the PGA seniors.  
  
  Q. Did you find there was a crowd rooting for you out there?  
 RON VLOSICH: Ever once in a while. I didn't make enough birdies or enough good shots to really get too many people excited. But, no, I had a really nice experience.  
  
  Q. Your game today was a lot, you scored a lot better than yesterday. And you played in the morning yesterday.   
 RON VLOSICH: Yeah, I played pretty good today. I just didn't get it in the hole. I shot 2-over and I hit a lot of good shots, but just couldn't really score. Had some 3-putts and got in some awkward spots out here.   
 It doesn't take too much, it's pretty much a fine edge between some really good scoring and some mediocre scoring, you know, if you're just a little off.   
  
  Q. What's the next event you're looking forward to?  
 RON VLOSICH: For me I'm going to go back and just play in some events around the Denver area and try to qualify for the U. S. Senior Open June 29th or something. Try to get in that. So hopefully I can do that.
