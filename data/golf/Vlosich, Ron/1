 Q. How did your last round go today?
 RON VLOSICH: It was pretty windy, so I was pretty happy with the score. I missed quite a few putts. But hit the ball a little bit better today and felt a little bit better about my game. But didn't get as much out of it as I hoped.

 Q. What does it mean to you to be playing in your home state and in the Senior PGA Championship?
 RON VLOSICH: Very exciting, any time you play in a championship like this, but being at home and playing with my kids got to watch me today for all 18 holes, and a lot of friends and stuff. 
 So it's just a great experience. 

 Q. Did you have fun?
 RON VLOSICH: I did. I had a good time.
