  Q. What were some of the highlights of your round today?  
 RON VLOSICH: Just getting finished. I started off poorly, bogeyed the first three holes and was really struggling, so I played even par the last 15, so I was happy that I was able to hang in there on a day like today.   
  
  Q. How special is this place in term of playing in your home state?  
 RON VLOSICH: It's very special to play it in a Senior PGA Championship in your home state. The support from all the section guys and my family that's out watching and stuff, it's huge. I wish I would have played a little better today, but it's really nice to be at home.   
  
  Q. Overall great feeling?  
 RON VLOSICH: Oh, great. Golf course is fantastic and everybody's done a great job. I am really enjoying the experience.  
  
  Q. Talk about the wind.   
 RON VLOSICH: The wind is substantial. It's 20 miles, 25 miles. Maybe gusting a little higher. It's a factor, especially when you're trying to putt. It's pretty hard to stay stable and stuff. So it's definitely a factor. But it's getting a little dry out there this afternoon.
