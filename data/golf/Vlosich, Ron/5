  Q. So how was your first Senior PGA event here?  
 RON VLOSICH: Awesome.   
  
  Q. Did you like the course?  
 RON VLOSICH: Yes, I love the golf course. A little bit too difficult for me, but I love playing here. As a matter of fact, I used to work in Cleveland 23 years ago, so this is like home coming.   
  
  Q. Now I saw that holes 12 and 15 were pretty good for you.   
 RON VLOSICH: 12 and 15? I birdied -- I got to think back, I don't remember.   
 12 was, I played a good tee shot, hit a 6-iron in there about 20 feet and made the putt.   
 Then on the par-5, 15, made two good shots just short of the green, pitched up, got it up on the upper shelf and then made about an eight foot putt for birdie.
