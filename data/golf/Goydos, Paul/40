  Q. Paul, first of all, what a round you've got going today, but I gotta ask you about that birdie you had at 16. Just as you planned it. Right?  
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. It's a 7-iron and 30-footer, you know. (Laughs). Yeah. We were just trying to get it -- I would have taken probably 10 feet from there, and the gods were smiling on me today.   
  
  Q. They seemed to be smiling on you all day, right? Tell us about this round you're authoring.   
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. It's been good. I played real solid. I made one three-putt bogey and I made, I don't know, eight birdies or so, especially on the Back 9.   
 Yeah, played good. I really played well all week, right from the start. I'm pretty happy with my game.   
  
  Q. When we spoke after your first round, you told me that you just feel relaxed out here this week, and it seems -- is it continuing?  
 PAUL GOYDOS: It's easier to be a little more relaxed when you're playing well. Stress tends to come from when you're struggling and faking it, for lack of a better word, and so far this week things are going well.   
  
  Q. Very well done. We wish you the best.   
 PAUL GOYDOS: Thanks.
