 Q. Paul, 68 today. Just comment on your final round.
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah, I played pretty good. I just didn't do anything. I got off to a good start, made a bunch of birdies early on the part of the golf course that I wanted to. 
 But just wasn't as sharp today as I was the previous three days.

 Q. T3, though. Good week overall. Just comment on that.
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. Couldn't catch Watney and Na. I needed to play better to catch them. They're going to make somewhere 23 or 24-under par, something crazy. A good week. I really haven't played well since Colonial, quite frankly.
 This is the first week I've played pretty well. I cracked my rib there and kind of set me back a little bit. At least that's my excuse. And maybe this will be the start of something good.

 Q. And you're playing the rest of the fall?
 PAUL GOYDOS: I am.
