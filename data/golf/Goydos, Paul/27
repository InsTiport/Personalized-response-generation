  Q. Paul, 1-under par today. You birdied 17 for the third straight time. Just comment on the round.   
 PAUL GOYDOS: You know, it played tougher today. The greens were starting to dry out. My game wasn't as good as yesterday, but it wasn't horrible. I was fortunate enough to birdie 17 for the third day in a row. I think I actually hit the flagstick or hit the flag, one of the two.   
 Yeah, I was able to call it in. Try to make it four in a row tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You've had a lot of different results at this tournament, missed the cut I think as many times as you haven't. You also finished second two years ago. What are you aiming for this year?   
 PAUL GOYDOS: Just to go out and do the best I can. I think it looks like Lee -- what, he's 13 or 14-under right now and might get to 15 or 16 by the end of the day. It's going to take somewhere in the high teens to win the golf tournament unless something funny happens tomorrow.   
 I like playing the golf course. It's fun to play. It's in good shape. It's drying out a bit, but it's in good shape. It's playing golf for a living.  
  
  Q. How does it feel different this year than in 2008?   
 PAUL GOYDOS: The golf course is playing on -- I think, in '08 only four of us broke par for 72 holes, and we have a chance for 60 people to break par this week. But the fans have been loud and boisterous, and I think a few of them have been drinking. I'm not sure.   
 But it's been fun. I played good. I just haven't played as well as the guys that played at the top.  
  
  Q. Do you like that this tournament is loud and boisterous?   
 PAUL GOYDOS: I don't think I have a lot of say in the matter, but it beats the alternative for sure.
