   PAUL GOYDOS: For 70 holes I did really good. Didn't hit a good putt on 17 and didn't hit a good second shot on 18.   
 And guys who play like that will do it.  
  
  Q. What did you see from Zach?  
 PAUL GOYDOS: He hung in there. That course played tough, he just kind of kept grinding and grinding and grinding and grinding, and he's got himself tied for first.
