 Q. 2-under par 70, two bogeys, bounced back with four birdies on the front side?
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. Increased a lot. I'm not too happy about it. It's not unexpected. It's not the first time I've done it. Hit some good shots and a couple good putts. 

 Q. A little bit of excitement when the ball is at the water head, people saying yeah because there was a little competition before you got there?
 PAUL GOYDOS: Certainly didn't get it into the water. Definitely the ball didn't go -- hit a break right there. And hit a nice par. When the ball's in the water I'm looking and going wow. Definitely one stroke up. Hit a ball. Could have been two strokes.

 Q. Do you see the greens firming up as the round continued?
 PAUL GOYDOS: I think it's firming up in spots. It's certainly firming up in spots. I think it's going to continue to do so at the end of the day. 

 Q. What did you hit on 16?
 PAUL GOYDOS: 144, 9-iron. I wasn't trying to fly the ball and bring it back. It worked out.
