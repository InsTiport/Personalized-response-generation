 Q.  Birdie at 11, but then birdie at 13, now 14.  
PAUL GOYDOS: You're up here and you're not sure it's going far enough and it stays in the air and it was on a good line, obviously.  I was very happy it landed on top and then there's the bonus right there.   
 Q.  The bonus?  
PAUL GOYDOS: Well, I'm kind of slipping, I birdied --   
 Q.  No, this is the bonus.  This is the best thing we have seen all day, folks?  
PAUL GOYDOS: Andrade.  That's right.  Billy is a passionate person.   
 Q.  Another birdie at 15.  And then what looked like it would be another one at 18?  
PAUL GOYDOS: How about this putt?  Are you kidding?  The reality is I got lucky to hole it on 14 and I guess I have to accept that that didn't work out.  I hit it too hard, I guess.   
 Q.  Do you think it's karma?  
PAUL GOYDOS: No, no, I just think it's -- I have no idea why.  I was very happy with the round.  We're not going to dwell on the fact that that didn't work out.  I could have shot 75 today.   
 Q.  Absolutely.  
PAUL GOYDOS: I was going the wrong way into the really hard stretch of holes.  And so, yeah, I'm ecstatic.   
 Q.  You tee off late tomorrow, will you watch the morning rounds?  
PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah, absolutely.  I love watching golf.
