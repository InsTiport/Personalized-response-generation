   PAUL GOYDOS: Had good play and it worked out.

 Q. Did you find the course any different when you went back out this morning than it was when you left it yesterday? 
 PAUL GOYDOS: None other than the greens were mowed. Not a lot. No. They've done -- 40 days and 40 nights of rain up here, they've done an incredible job of having the golf course in really good shape. 
 This place must drain very well and the staff must be working very hard. It really rained hard there for a while and you really wouldn't have known it walking out there today compared to when we finished yesterday.

 Q. What do you do between now and obviously you're going to have one of the later tee times. What are you going to do? Try to get something to eat?
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. Relax and eat. And I think I'm going to have maybe three hours. I don't even know what time it is, to be honest with you. 
 Yeah, I could even go back to my hotel if I wanted to. I'm just going to see what happens? 

 Q. It's nice, but it's just a start. There's still a lot more golf. 
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. We're halfway through. No more pace cars. 

 Q. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good luck.
