 Q.  Four birdies and four bogeys, probably looking more like a U.S. Open course than the one you saw the first three days?  
PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah, starting to firm up a little bit.  It's not the kind of course where they're going to get the greens really fast because there's a lot of movement in them, but the golf course is firming up.  I think they've had ark-building type rain here the last two months.  Regardless of three days of rain, I don't think it's going to dry out.  But the ball is bouncing today, and that makes it more difficult for sure.   
 Q.  Despite the fact that Steve has got so much space between him and the rest of the field, you're in a top-10 position, you've got to be pleased with that?  
PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah, the course did what I think -- ultimately the course did what you want it to.  It really separated the field out.  When you have a possible maybe 15-shot difference between 1st and 10th, and the course separated the guys who are playing great from good -- or very good to good.  And that's really what you want a course to do.  Sometimes we get caught up too much in the actual score.  To me a good golf course is one that separates the field, and this one has done that.   
 Q.  And what's your thoughts about the way Steve is playing?  
PAUL GOYDOS: I'm just glad I haven't had to play with him.  It's probably pretty demoralizing.  You know, he's just -- he's probably the best player over 50, and he's a great putter and he has a lot of length and he does all -- he hasn't really changed.  He's probably playing as well now as he's ever played.  I'm not surprised he's playing well out here, and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a chance to win a few times out on the regular Tour, too.
