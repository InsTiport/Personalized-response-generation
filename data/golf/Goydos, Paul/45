   PAUL GOYDOS: I'm generally troubled in the morning. Most players have a better scoring average in the morning than the afternoon. I think I'm the other way around. 
 I made a couple of putts, which is nice. I got to play some of the holes with this wind, which again, will help me a little bit this afternoon, too. 

 Q. What will it be like obviously being back in the final mix and being with Zach who will be turning around as well?
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah. You got two major champions in the last group. Justin played phenomenally well and nothing good happened. He could have shot 62 or 3 today also. There were a lot of putts at the edge that did not go in. 
 That's probably as high as he could have shot. I probably shot as low as I could have shot. If those two guys are putting good and they play good for a while, they're going to be problematic.
