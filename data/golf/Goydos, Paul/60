  Q. Obviously when the day started, didn't look like there were going to be a lot of low scores in the afternoon but a lot of players played well under some tough conditions.   
 PAUL GOYDOS: Yeah, I'm happy shooting 1-under. If you would have told me I was going to shoot under par and I didn't have to play, I wouldn't have played. The golf course was very difficult. We're all going to make mistakes, and I made a few, but I kind of hung in there and kept grinding it out and made a few putts here and there, and very happy shooting 1-under par.  
  
  Q. How nice is it to see your name up top there going into the weekend?  
 PAUL GOYDOS: That's the goal. Basically right now we're still just pace cars. We're going to wait and see what happens on the weekend when the racing starts. But it's a good place to start the weekend off. If nothing else, you get to sleep in.  
  
  Q. Have you ever thrown a putter as far as Charley did?  
 PAUL GOYDOS: I didn't notice Charley throwing a putter, but I'm sure I have.
