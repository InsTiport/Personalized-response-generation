 Q.  You had a shot at the tie for the lead and that putt just didn't seem like it was going to stop. 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I think that putt is not best. 

 Q.  How was your round today? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I think it's good, but sometimes mis-hit. 

 Q.  Was that because of the wind? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I played pretty good. 

 Q.  What were some of your good holes? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  No. 10, I hit third shot and then I make long putt. 

 Q.  Was that one of your better rounds on Tour out there? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  Yeah. 

 Q.  How far was your putt on 10? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  12 feet. 

 Q.  What do you want to do tomorrow?  Do you think you can shoot a 67 again? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I hope so (laughing).
