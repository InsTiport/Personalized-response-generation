   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thanks for joining us today.  You shot a 6-under, 66.  One eagle, 5 birdies in your round.  Want to go ahead and talk about how you played a little bit.   
 SHI HYUN AHN:  Had a rough start.  It was -- I made a very good long putt on the first hole, which was 10th hole.  Made a long putt from the fringe, and then on the 13th hole I was trying to make the shot but I hit it thick and made a bogey.   
 So overall I play well.  I like the course and I think the course likes me.  It kind of fits my course, so I think we played well.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 SHI HYUN AHN:  She had a bogey on the front 13.  163 yards, 6-iron -- excuse me, 7-iron.  I'm sorry -- from the green, 12 feet away from the hole.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 SHI HYUN AHN:  Well, even though I play well, but the thing that I want is win.   
 So I'm not really that happy that I wasn't able to get the win out of -- through six tournament that I play.  And since I play well today, I really want to have a win this week.   
  
  Q.  The last win was in 2003, I think.   
 SHI HYUN AHN:  Yeah, 2003 in South Korea.   
  
  Q.  So you think you can regain that form that you had?   
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I'm always ready.  Always prepared.
