   THE MODERATOR:  Thank you all for coming in.  I believe you are the leader.  You just had your first hole-in-one of the year on 16 today.  Did that kind of get you going today to move up the leaderboard and stay up there? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I just try to every shot, and then I -- first one of the year.  That is really, really good and comfortable shot. 

 Q.  Can you just talk about your round today? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  Everything is good.  Everything is good, shots good, putting good, everything is good. 

 Q.  The sand shot on 17 I think it was, was that the one shot you would want back today if you could take one back?  It would have been 8, the 17th hole of the day. 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  First time over the green, first sand shot there, so I'm a little nervous.  Hard lie, so I try little shot. 

 Q.  Could you talk about the hole-in-one, what club you used, how it looked to you?  Did you think it was going in, how you felt after? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  That's 158 yards into the wind like hurting.  I hit a 6-iron, high draw shot, and then went in. 

 Q.  Did it hit the front and then bounce in, one bounce? 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I couldn't see it.  I couldn't tell you if it bounced or not. 
 I felt great.  Whenever I picked up the ball I was so excited, and then I tried to prepare for the next hole. 

 Q.  Looking at the leaderboard, you see yourself up there with Inkster, Ochoa, Diaz.  How do you feel about where you are at the halfway mark, excited, nervous, confident?  Just tell us how you feel. 
 SHI HYUN AHN:  I'm a little nervous, but I don't care leaderboard, leaders.  I played comfortable. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Thank you for coming in.  Great job.  Congratulations on your hole-in-one, and good luck tomorrow.
