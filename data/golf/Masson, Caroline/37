 Q.   Obviously very solid.   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Really solid.   Front nine was actually really good.   I could have made a few more putts if the putter was really hot but obviously 4‑under on the front was really good.   And then on the back, I still hit good shots but on this course, you just miss some greens because of the slopes and stuff.   You get a bad bounce or whatever.   
And missed a few greens and hit really good chip shots.   Just didn't make a bogey, which is nice.   The few times I was in trouble, I could just get it up‑and‑down or like make eight, nine feet or something.   It was good.   It was fun out there.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on the course?   Greens are tricky but slow?  
CAROLINE MASSON:   They are really grainy.   So yeah, they are pretty slow.   You can be aggressive with the chip shots if you miss greens, which is nice.   But I mean, you've got to pay attention and you've got to pay attention to the grain and the wind now that it got a little windier.   
It's not easy to putt on them.   You shouldn't really make any 3‑putts if you hit it in the right section.   But you can't expect to make every putt so got to pay a lot of attention to the grain and wind.   
   
 Q.   Coming into the Asian Swing, your second time around coming into the final stretch.   Do you regroup, think of goals you wanted to set?  
CAROLINE MASSON:   I thought it was a little easier coming back for the second time.   Last year obviously was my rookie year, didn't know what to expect.   It's good to know‑‑ it's going to be really hot in Malaysia.   It's going to be windy in Korea or whatever.   Just really not kill myself on the range after the rounds and that kind of stuff.   
I knew I was going to play five in a row so that's a long stretch.   I'm playing really well and at the same time, I'm trying not to overdo it and not to get too greedy and stuff.   So it works out really nicely for me this time I guess.  
Taking off Japan and go to MÃ©xico, CME and my last event will be Dubai on the LET.   It's a long year but I think it's nice to learn from the past and just take it easy.   
   
 Q.   Just the setting here, I have to ask the players, it's overwhelmingly nice and beautiful.   You like doing the tropical relaxing settings or is it hard to concentrate and go play golf?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   It's all right.   It's not too bad.   I guess we are used to it a little bit now.   It's pretty similar to Orlando.   It's nice.   The hotel is great obviously and the views are great.   
I guess if it gets windy it can be a hard week on the golf course.   If not, it's playing a little easier but overall it's just kind of a little bit of, not a vacation week, but you can spend some time on the pool and that kind of stuff.   So it's nice to get away from golf a little bit in that nice hotel actually.
