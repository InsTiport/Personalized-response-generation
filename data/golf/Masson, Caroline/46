Q.   You played fabulously well together.   How do you feel about that? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I think we're just playing really solid.   Obviously the Americans played really well as well, but it's been a great day and I enjoyed playing with Caroline.

Q.   Caroline, you've been waiting all day to make your rookie debut and I know how much you've been looking forward to this.   You putted great and these greens are really difficult.   You must be feeling great. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Caroline and I, I think we just worked really well together, dropped a few good putts, which is always good. 
That's just what you got to do in match play, I think.   And it was a lot of fun and I can't wait for tomorrow.

Q.   And everybody says the Europeans are great at foursomes and not so good at fourâ€‘ball, better ball, any idea why that is? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   I think we proved it different.   We played really well, and Suzann and Carlota just won their point, so I think we're doing pretty good.

Q.   So basically you don't believe that then. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   No.
