 Q.   Disappointed, your form, too late to catch up with Leeâ€‘Anne Pace?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   I mean, no, because we were out there battling and I tried everything I could.   You know, I'm happy with that finish and that was all I could do.   So, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Game plan when you woke up this morning?   Were you just like, all right, let's get it finished or make a charge?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Obviously I wanted to play.   I was in a good position and wanted to play.   I knew we were going to play and we probably were going to play in any condition.   So I think it's hard to have a good attitude, you know, but just once you get out there, do that, and I fought hard.   I had a bad first tee shot when we got back out and saved my par.   
So, yeah, you know, that gave me a little bit of confidence.
