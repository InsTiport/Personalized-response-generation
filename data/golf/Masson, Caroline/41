 Q.   Is this your first time playing in Malaysia?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   First time in Malaysia?   No, I've been playing in Malaysia a few times.  
   
 Q.   How do you like it, two rounds of golf?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, it's great.   I mean, it's pretty warm.   We're not really used to that, but the golf course is awesome this week and the hotel is great.   So I think every player loves this tournament, and I do too.   I'm just glad I could play all right so far.  
   
 Q.   You started off pretty well?  
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, I pretty much hit one bad shot today, and that kind of resulted in a double bogey.   So just the wrong shot at the wrong time, but it happens.   Yeah, there are plenty of great chances out there so I can make it through.  
   
 Q.   What is the plan tomorrow?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Plan tomorrow just go out and stay patient, try to hit fairways and get it close, make some putts.   I felt like I played decent today except for that one shot.   So there are good scores for me out there, so I'm just going to try to go low.  
   
 Q.   Are you happy with the season so far?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, it can always go better, but it was good to play out here in Asia, to make it into these events.   I think I've had a good year so far.   I still have a good chance to win the Rookie of the Year.   So I'm not complaining.   I'm pretty happy with it so far.  
   
 Q.   What other tournaments are you going for?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, I'm going to Korea next week and then Taiwan, and then take a week off and then Japan after that, so all the Asian events.   I mean, I've never been here, so I just want to try.  
   
 Q.   It's a whole Asian flavor then?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, six weeks.   It's good.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the food then?   
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yes, I do.   I mean, it depends.   But I haven't had a problem with Malaysian food yet.   But I'm definitely going to because I heard it's very spicy.   I like spicy, but not too much.
