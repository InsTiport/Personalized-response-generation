Q.   Good start with 67.   Run us through it. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, it was fun.   It was a good round.   I started off with a bogey on the 2nd hole, which was a bit unnecessary, but it was nice to birdie the next hole and come back and make some more putts, play pretty solid, and overall a really good first round.

Q.   How were the conditions out there?
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, it's good.   This morning it was pretty wet, a little damp.   It seemed like the ball didn't fly very far and we had to adjust a little bit.   But overall it's great.   The greens are rolling good and stopping, so yeah, it's a great golf course. 

Q.   Are you expecting to see a lot of low scores this week with the way the course is playing right now?
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, I mean, we didn't have much wind.   It played a little easier than I thought, maybe a little shorter than I thought, but I think it's a really cool course.   You really have to hit the fairways and hit good shots into the greens to have birdie chances, but I think they could make it a little harder with tougher pins if they wanted to.   It'll be interesting how the next few days play, but today was definitely scorable, but you had to hit good shots for sure.

Q.   What's your strategy going into tomorrow?
CAROLINE MASSON:   Just about the same.   I mean, just try to make more birdies, try to not make too many mistakes because I think you've got to play this course smart.   Sometimes you can't attack the pins and you just have to take the middle of the green.   I think that's going to be the plan.
