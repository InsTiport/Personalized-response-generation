Q.   How do you think it went?   Happy with it? 
CAROLINE MASSON:     Yeah, happy with it.   4‑under is a good score, I'm just a couple behind I think.   Played well, made just one stupid mistake today, hit it in the water on 9 and made a few birdies and hit a few good shots so quite happy with that. 
It's just about not getting too far behind I think, and then, I don't know, when I get used to the time and everything, I feel like I maybe might feel a little more like comfortable on the course, and so that was a great start, yeah. 

Q.   The Money List coming into your mind?
CAROLINE MASSON:     Not really, just out there and trying your best.   I think it's about, you try to whip this tournament, and everything else, you can't really‑‑ I mean, you don't know what's going to happen, how the others play.   So it's just about my game and playing well and just try to finish up and see what happens.   I'm the one who has to shoot low and finish well, so it's really just about my game this week.
