Q. So far have you fought back really hard to get to where you were going into 15, I think it was.  And then kind of the momentum shifted a little bit.  But what did you feel overall as a team today?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I mean, it's tough.  When you play your first foursome, it's tough to get into the rhythm.  We didn't play great.  We didn't play bad.  I mean, they make really good putts.  It's just golf.
They won on the last hole.  There's lots of matches left.  We're going to go out there, keep fighting.  (Indiscernible)  I think we're all good.
Q. Caroline, what is the game plan to adjust after a match like that?
CAROLINE MASSON: Well, I mean, obviously, it's totally different playing four-ball.  I haven't even seen who we are playing yet.  So really, really don't know.  Just go out, be aggressive, make a lot of birdies.
And it's tough out there.  The greens are fast.  It's hard to make birdies, and I feel like if we can play solid, yeah, definitely we'll have a good afternoon.
