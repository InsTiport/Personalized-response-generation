Q.   Congratulations on a positive week overall, but I guess looking at you there's a sense of disappointment today?
CAROLINE MASSON:   I'm sure there is.   I think I've played really well, I was trying to go low today.   I had it in my hands today, and did pretty well on the front nine and just got a little unlucky there.   Yeah, that's what happens sometimes. 

Q.   But another good week overall, you must be able to look at the positives overall and another good end to a great season. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Difficult right now right after the round but I think in a few days, sure. 

Q.   Seem like you have a good relationship with Carlota, so I guess if there's anyone who could take it away from you, you would wish her well and congratulate her I guess. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, definitely.   She's a great player.   She showed that all year.   She won twice.   Yeah, I'm happy for her.   You know, right now, disappointed of course, but she's a great player. 

Q.   If you look back at the season, when you look back at this year, what will be the high point and good days out there? 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Oh, definitely my win.   I mean, last week was a great week, as well.   Yeah, if I could finish it off today, it would have been a perfect year, but it's fine this way.   I mean, I should be happy.
