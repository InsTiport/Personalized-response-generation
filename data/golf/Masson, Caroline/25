 Q.  You had some pretty good holes in some pretty bad conditions yesterday.  How does it feel?  
CAROLINE MASSON: Actually I think most of the front nine that we played, it was okay.  It was getting obviously windier hole by hole, but overall it was still fair until the last hole.  Yeah, I think it was a good call, definitely, because it was getting unplayable and a little dangerous, but I think overall, yeah, it was a little tougher maybe than in the morning, but still okay.   
 Q.  It was nice to roll in a couple extra this morning; did the conditions have any kind of an impact this morning?  
CAROLINE MASSON: Not really.  I mean, there was, I guess, a lot of debris out there.  They cleaned up most of it.  I guess the greens -- the greens are still pretty good.  Maybe not as fast as in the beginning of the week.  But kind of receptive.  We don't have a lot of wind out there now, so it's almost perfect conditions.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be near the top or at the top?  
CAROLINE MASSON: Yeah, it's great.  Obviously it's only one round, so it is what it is, but I love this place.  I love the golf course, and I was really looking forward to coming here the last few weeks.  My game is in a good place, too, so I'm just excited for the next three rounds.
