Q.   Caroline, just a general assessment, first of all, how did that compare to the last two days? 
CAROLINE MASSON:   I think I didn't play as good as the last two days.   I struggled a bit, especially towards the end, maybe just got a little tired.   The swing doesn't feel as good anymore, but like overall, I think 3‑under is a pretty good score for that.   I was lucky a few times.   I made two really good putts on 14 and 15.   But overall, I think I can be really happy with that round today. 

Q.   And great to finish on a positive note, I would imagine in? 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, it's nice.   I birdied like all three days, not going for it, which is quite nice so I hope I can do that again tomorrow.

Q.   How much is the Order of Merit on your mind, was that in your head today?
CAROLINE MASSON:   Even less today I guess because I have not played with Carlota today.   So I have no idea how she did today and I didn't think about it at all.   I want to finish this tournament as good as possible, hopefully top three, to at least have a chance to past her, but just playing‑‑ especially when you're struggling, you have to focus even more, and I was doing that.   I didn't think about anything else.

Q.   I notice you have a bit of strapping; is that bothering you? 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Not at all.   I had a pain in my foot yesterday but not when I'm swinging, just walking.   It's better now.   We just got it taped to take the stress off the muscle and it's fine.   No problem now.
