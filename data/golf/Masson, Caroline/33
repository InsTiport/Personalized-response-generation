Q. Caroline and Sandra, how does it feel to get a half after that?
SANDRA GAL: I still can't breathe.  It was just unbelievable level of playing.  Gerina made such good 2-putts on those tough holes, and then this hole -- it's just the most rewarding feeling when you hit the shots you need to, and I think we both did at the right moments this entire match.  We worked really well together.
Q. How difficult is it to come back after yesterday in these conditions and try to get something out of the match?
CAROLINE MASSON: I felt good.  Obviously, with Carlota making that shot yesterday right before we stopped playing was great momentum for us.  We went out and I think we played all right.  They made two great birdies, and Sandra kept us in with that wonderful shot on 18, here, and halved the match for us, and that was just amazing.
Q. Two Germans playing together in Germany, just how special has it been to play in front of all these fans?
SANDRA GAL: It's unbelievable.  I think we're enjoying and soaking up every single minute.  There's always someone you know walking up the fairway and friends and family.  It's so, so special.
