 Q.  What was this experience like for you?  
GAVEN LANE: The experience was good.  Learned a lot.  Just learned a lot.  I know I didn't play my best, but hopefully I do better in the future with the things I learned.   
 Q.  What's one or two things that you learned that you didn't know?  
GAVEN LANE: Just to let my attitude like determine how I play instead of like how I play determine my attitude.  Just to carry myself better.   
 Q.  Something you kind of struggle with?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah, definitely has been.   
 Q.  You're only 14 years old though.  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Kind of hard, right?  
GAVEN LANE: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What was different about playing in this as opposed to the matches you would play in on a regular basis?  
GAVEN LANE: Not much difference.  Just a lot harder of a golf course.  Longer.  Just kind of different than the golf I'm used to in Texas.   
 Q.  A little bit, right?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.   
 Q.  You ever played on poa before?  
GAVEN LANE: A few times, like in Arizona or something.   
 Q.  Do you like it?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.  It's nice.   
 Q.  Tough to make those five-footers, right?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Obviously you've seen Pebble Beach on TV.  What was it like when you were standing on, say, the 7th tee getting ready to hit your tee shot?  Were you thinking, Wow, I'm here?  I must be dreaming?  
GAVEN LANE: A little bit, yeah.  I don't know if I was fully focused on my actual shot.  Kind of chunk hooked it left, but it was cool.   
 Q.  Yeah.  What were some of the other holes that you said, Wow, this is something?  
GAVEN LANE: 18 was cool at Pebble, and then I really liked hole, is it 4, the really narrow green?   
 Q.  The short par-4?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.  It's a cool hole.   
 Q.  When you go back to school and everyone does their, What I did this summer, could this be part of your class project, what you did this summer?  
GAVEN LANE: Probably could be for sure, yeah.   
 Q.  What would you tell your class?  
GAVEN LANE: I don't really know.   
 Q.  You're starting high school this year, right?  
GAVEN LANE: No.  Going into eighth grade.   
 Q.  Not even in high school yet.  So obviously you're committed to Oklahoma State, right?  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.   
 Q.  You probably have heard the Brad Dalke story.  
GAVEN LANE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is that a career trajectory?  I know it's kind of a rival school, but is that kind of a career trajectory or kind of a role model you're going to look up to as you...  
GAVEN LANE: I mean, I never really thought of it but, yeah, it's kind of the same deal.   
 Q.  What went behind the decision to commit so early?  
GAVEN LANE: Just, I mean, LSU is a really good golf school.  Good history.  I like how it's closer to home.  I mean, just really couldn't go wrong with it.   
 Q.  When you go back home, what are the one or two things you would work on that you learned from playing here this week?  
GAVEN LANE: Nothing much.  Felt like I hit the ball good.  Did everything well.   
Just got to continue forward and not get down on myself.
