Q. Comments about today's round?
KELLY SU: It was really back and forth all day today. I started out hot. I was 2-up after three holes and my putter was working well, but later in the match, I hit some bad drives and hit some into the hazard. I recovered and ended up squaring the match on No. 17. I came back after a few holes to win the match with a par.  I'm happy with how I played, but I'm going back out to the range to work on my driver.
Q. Was it the driver that let you down today?
KELLY SU: Yes, it was, but I know what I'm doing wrong and I'm confident I can fix it by tonight and be back out there tomorrow.
Q. Even after 22 holes, you're going back to the range to work on your driver?
KELLY SU: I am. I have to.
Q. How happy are you to win this match after all of that and so many holes to advance into Thursday?
KELLY SU: It was a really, really exciting moment for me because I've played in this tournament for the last three years and I've only made it to match-play once. In my first year, I ended up losing in my first match, so this year, I knew I wanted to keep my head in the game, stay focused, remember that every shot counts and just play my game.
Q. What do you have to do to have a better day on Thursday?
KELLY SU: I think I'm going to get some rest, sleep in a little bit and come back fresh and ready for my match.
