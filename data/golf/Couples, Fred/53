  FRED COUPLES:   Played great yesterday, but I knew to have any kind of shot of doing anything this week I had to do well today.   There's no saying you're going to shoot 60 on Sunday.   
So I worked my way back up the leaderboard, and I think I'm in great shape.   Obviously there are several guys playing well, too, but I can't stop them, and it was a really good round.  
   
 Q.   How was the course playing?   It seems like a lot of lower scores today.   
FRED COUPLES:   Well, we got to play lift, clean and place, which you wouldn't think it's that many shots easier, but at the same time I think some of the pins were easier today.   
If you went around and looked yesterday, I thought they set the course up ‑‑ I mean when we played four or five holes yesterday, I told my caddy, no matter what, shooting 70 is going to be a good score, and as it turned out, we're just a couple guys or a few guys at 3‑under.   So you can predict a lot of this.   
And then today, moving the ball, and the pins are a little more accessible, you're going to get good scores.   The greens are perfect.   And tomorrow I don't think you'll see this kind of scoring, but obviously I heard the wind is going to blow, but they'll have the pins better.  
   
 Q.   Was there any point in the round where you really felt like you got it going?  
FRED COUPLES:   No.   I birdied the first two holes and then didn't make another birdie until No. 10.   
You know, I just felt like I was driving it well.   I didn't hit a lot of really great irons, but I did hit a few and made birdies.   But it's the same old thing.   Anything when I'm away from the ball with a longer club, I actually hit some beautiful shots.   And then the last hole, I really was just skulled at, I skulled ‑‑ half a skulled one on the tenth hole.   I hit the pin, stopped by the hole, about a 3‑iron or 4‑iron or a driver feels pretty good.   But anything hunched over I'm pretty sore, and on the last hole, to hit a shot like that ‑‑  
   
 Q.   What was the distance on that?  
FRED COUPLES:   I think it was 118 yards.  
   
 Q.   Between gaps or?  
FRED COUPLES:   Yeah.   I just tried to hit it hard, and I mean I didn't skull it skulled, but I hit it thin.   I was lucky to two‑putt.  
   
 Q.   Tomorrow, that would be great for lift and clean.   
FRED COUPLES:   Well, I was one foot from the hole.   I saw the dot.   I'll know how to do it tomorrow.   If I can hit my drive there, I'll just skull a sand wedge and have it roll down to a foot.
