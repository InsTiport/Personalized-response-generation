FRED COUPLES: All pars and a birdie.   
 Q.  That's a heck of a birdie, though.  
FRED COUPLES: Yeah, but the pars on 18 and 15 were even better.  But it played hard.  I don't know what -- from the guys that were 4 or 5 under, if there were any really good scores, but it played really, really hard.   
By it raining, it made the course play to where the scores were like that, and the two guys that are battling are playing a very good last round.  I know Kirk's made a couple too many bogeys, but looks like Kenny is going to win, but he still fought hard and played well every single round.   
For me, today was -- I just couldn't make any putts.  I couldn't hit it really close.  When I did have a really, really easy second shot to some of these short holes, it was an odd number, like 112, 115 yards, where I can't hit my sand wedge that far and a pitching wedge is too easy.   
They just put the pins right on the front knob so I'm 20, 30 feet past every hole.  And the only bad thing was the guy who is going to come down here hit like an 8 iron into a par 5, and I hit my worst drive of the week, and it was the easiest hole.  So I didn't make a birdie there, but I made a bomb for a par on the next hole.   
And that's about it.
