 Q. More difficult today?
 FRED COUPLES: Just didn't finish. I played pretty well and I bogeyed the last three holes. 
 I'm going to say it's tougher, it was cold and windy, but there are some good scores. Kind of not a whole lot of fun at the moment. But that's the way it is. 

 Q. It play a lot different then?
 FRED COUPLES: No. Yesterday was a great day, today was not too good. 75's a very mediocre score. 
 But I'm done and I didn't feel great today, but I got it around. 
 I birdied 15 and I 3-putted 16 and I 3-putted 17 and, I don't know, misclubbed on 18. 

 Q. You had some good birdie putts on 11, 12, 13 maybe even. 
 FRED COUPLES: No, I had birdie putts, but I didn't make any of them. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 FRED COUPLES: You don't make them every 20-footer, 15-footer you look at. But the one on 11 was very simple. 
 12 was not a very hard putt. 
 And I just couldn't make any of them. 
 Then 16 was a very tough 2-putt. And I hit a good first putt and it went by about six feet. 
 And then 17 I just had an easy birdie putt and rolled it five feet by and hit a bad putt. 
 But as soon as I get home and lay down I'll be fine, but right now I'm tired and pissed off, to be honest with you. 

 Q. Was the back bothering you a lot today?
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah. For a while I felt like I could go from first to last. But I kind of loosened up and I got it around. 
 But the shot on 9 really killed me. It was a downhill lie and those don't feel good on regular days. And today that kind of threw me for a loop, but it's okay.
