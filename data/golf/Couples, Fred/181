   FRED COUPLES:  This round didn't encourage me to play more.  Even if I wanted to I couldn't play next week.  I think I'll play the TPC then wait and come back.  There's a lot of pressure on these guys.  It's not playing that hard.  When you play in the wind like this, it's uncontrollable.  The pins are more doable.  Not easy by any means.   

 The pins are the only thing that could help anyone.  It's windy.  You don't want to go over any greens.  The golf course is playable.  You are over par and you are trying to make birdies.  They are tough shots.  I feel okay.  7th or 8th didn't feel so good.  I started massaging it around and got looser.   

 I plan to go home and start to work with this guy and try to get stronger.
