  Q.  Talking about his streak of 23 consecutive cuts at the Masters.   

 FRED COUPLES:  It's windy and long.  Greens are hard as concrete.  Last year was nothing's like this.  If it stays like this, there won't be any scores under par.  If you get a guy who is 5- or 6-over and shoot 3- or 4-under, they will have a good shot on Sunday.   

 The way I played I was a little sloppy.  I could have been better.  It's a hard course.  It's not a back issue.  Experience helps.  Last year it certainly helped me.  Bogeys aren't going to kill everyone.  Decided to play two week ago.  I had shin splints, believe it or not (it was fun).  I look forward to playing tomorrow.   

 When you get weather like this, you're going to get some weird rounds.  To make the cut is great.  I've played two rounds of golf this year.   

 This is probably the only tournament I'll play in (my back feels terrible.)  It's driving me crazy.
