 Q.   Opening round 74, talk about the difference between playing at Muirfield at The Open Championship last week and coming here today.   
FRED COUPLES:   Well, they are both great courses.   Last week, you watched every day, it was firm and fast, and just a little different colour.   
Today, there's a few more drivers it out here, a few more 3‑woods.   I actually drove it okay.   I just didn't hit many good iron shots.   It's hard, last week any hit many close, and hit some solid ones, and today, I couldn't get anything going.   When we were on the range, I should have bent my putter maybe.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you might do that after this round?  
FRED COUPLES:   Well, I already sent Casey over there to see if they are still there, because the TaylorMade trucks are gone.   Every time I go to a tournament, it seems like it's bent somehow and be I just didn't‑‑ the speed of the greens, I just didn't putt very well.   I just was a little bit off.   This kind of course, come out in the morning, I have to shoot something in the 60s.
