   FRED COUPLES: I got it around, got a few good bounces. Once I hit some good drives I made a couple putts and birdied 17, 18, No. 1 to get to 2-under, then birdied No. 8, hit a good iron in there, and the rest of it was -- I had a lot of chances. 
 But I just -- tomorrow is going to be a rough round. Not that it's late, but getting up at 5:30 and trying to get on the range at 6:15 will be tough. So today was a good day for that. I have no excuses, but 7:20 is a rough time. 

 Q. I know you hate talking about your back, but any issues this week, any treatment?
 FRED COUPLES: No, I'm going to maybe do some things after this tournament. To be quite honest I went to Phoenix because I had some Jaguar stuff to do, and this week I'm playing because it's my favorite course. But I would rather -- when I feel like playing out here rather than go on the Champions Tour, and even though I played well at Phoenix and played well here, you have to take -- I've played this tournament, this is my 30th year, so I kind of feel like I can get the ball around. 
 On the Champions Tour I felt like I was at non-factor at Hualalai, and in my mind I don't really want to go out there and be a non-factor until I feel better, and I don't know when that'll be. Hopefully it'll be the next month or so. I'm looking forward to getting some treatment on Monday. 

 Q. The last three holes you looked like you were having trouble. 
 FRED COUPLES: Well, yes and no. I hit the drive on 18. Bubba is not that feeling well, but he carried over the bunker and it's 285 over that. I can drive it. It's the shorter clubs that kill me. I hit a few 7-irons because I'm just hitting fairway woods and a few drivers, and I don't want to bend over much until I get on the course. But at the same time I've laid up perfect and had 85 yards on the first hole and hit it about 70 and buried it in the bunker. You know, I think that's from not being ready to play the round. 
 But at the end of the day I played 18 holes and had a great round. So I look at it as I have to get started a certain way, and once I get rolling -- I played 33 holes in Phoenix. The last four or five holes were brutal. But 28 or 29 holes, I got it around with not really a problem. 

 Q. When you say you're going to do something Monday, is it something special other than what you might otherwise be doing?
 FRED COUPLES: I'm going to go get an MRI and then they're going to tell me, and there's a couple little things that may happen.

 Q. Do you have a suspicion? 
 FRED COUPLES: No, but it's pretty drastic. It'll be fun for me to do it. It'll be different. I'm not even going to tell you because I'd have to take a drug test after I do it. 

 Q. You're hurting worse than --
 FRED COUPLES: Well, I can't stand. I can swing a club, but I just can't sleep, and it's like the biggest toothache ever all day long, and I've had enough to be quite honest, so I'm going to go see if I can do a couple things to take the pain away so my back actually feels okay.

 Q. Are you getting radiation down your legs like sciatica?
 FRED COUPLES: No, thank God. No, nothing, it's just right here.

 Q. Would that put the Masters in jeopardy?
 FRED COUPLES: No, this is an okay thing to do.

 Q. Is the treatment evasive or non-evasive?
 FRED COUPLES: I would say it's non-evasive. I would say it's -- I can't answer it. Who did I just see that I wasn't answering? Oh, Albert Pujols was just telling everyone. For 300 I'll tell you whatever you want to hear. But it'll be fun. It'll be fun. 
 What's Corey doing? He's 5-under, 6-under? 

 Q. Do you have a home nearby?
 FRED COUPLES: I'm staying with some friends on the 4th hole. 

 Q. Playing with the younger guys, does that pique your interest at all when you have a pairing like that?
 FRED COUPLES: I've never played with Bubba, and I think he's just withdrawing. He's got some groin problem. And then Anthony Kim is a member of the club where I play in Palm Springs, so I see him a lot. But yeah, it was very fun. It was very fun to play with those guys. It was a good pairing.
