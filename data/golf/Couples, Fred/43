  MODERATOR:   71 today, Fred Couples.  
   
 Q.   One birdie, Fred.   Did you feel like you were spinning your wheels, not getting anything going today?   
FRED COUPLES:   Yeah, I didn't get much going.   The first few holes, I had it close for birdie and didn't make any.   I never had the pace of the greens.   I left a lot of putts short.   It was a hard day.   
One birdie on a hole, I hit a decent drive and had a 9 iron.   So the rest of it was pretty good golf, but I never made a putt.   I made a couple of nice little par putts and drove it well.   The only really mediocre drive I hit was on 17, which was a drive and a chip shot.   I bogeyed that hole.   I figured I could birdie there and make a 5.  
I play early tomorrow.   It's kind of hard for me, a lot of times, to finish like this and wake up the next day and play, but I feel pretty good so I look forward to seeing what I can shoot tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Fred, do you think the afternoon is different from this morning?   
FRED COUPLES:   Well, yeah.   I mean, the greens, they get a little firmer, but they're pretty crusty.   It's hard to make putts, but they're good greens.   But they're a little bit spiked up.   So tomorrow morning, I have to hit the ball better.   But the greens will be better.   They'll be more receptive, and the guys that played this morning will go out and give it their best shot tomorrow afternoon.   
Anytime you play in the morning, the greens are going to be better.   The course may be a little bit different, but the greens will be better.   That's what I didn't do well today.   I didn't putt very well.   No one in our group made any putts.  
   
 Q.   Freddy, with so many uphill approaches, is it hard to get close to the pin?   
FRED COUPLES:   It's a great little golf course.   I mean, little meaning there's a handful of holes that are really ball busters, but the rest of them are holes where, to answer your question, it's hard to get the ball close.   And as they get firmer, it's going to be a lot harder to get it close.  
But the key is, if I play like I did today and don't feel like I did that well and shoot 1 over, I'll be fine.   I do need to have a nice stretch of holes.   You can't make one birdie out there and expect to do well.   That certainly is not what I'm looking forward to is making one birdie a round out there.   All right?   Thank you.
