  Q. Just missing birdie on 18. Bogey-free.  
 FRED COUPLES: I did almost make that long putt. I was hoping to make par there. You know, played very well. I didn't sleep -- my whole body was exhausted. I didn't really sleep much. I'm going to go lay down for an hour and come back out and try my best to keep hitting the ball solid and make a few putts.  
  
  Q. Was the magic here at the 2003 at the Shell Houston Open, do you feel you're still in there?  
 FRED COUPLES: Everything has been a long time ago. Anything I've ever done was a long time ago. In L.A. I battled Phil pretty well, and really my goal is to go aggressive putting. I was not today, and I don't know if they did not cut the greens or whatever, but we were all leaving them short.   
 If I can make a few, I'll be fine. If not, it will be the same old story where I got to hit the ball better than everybody else.
