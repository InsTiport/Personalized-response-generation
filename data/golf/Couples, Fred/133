  Q. Sounds like you played maybe better today?  
 FRED COUPLES: No. I hit the ball solid. The score is, you know -- could I have been better? Okay. I didn't make any putts that were kind of weird that went in.   
 I 3-putted three times, but they were from long distances, and I didn't have many real, real birdie chances. I 3-putted my second to last hole after knocking it on the par 5. But other than that, you know, I was a long way from the hole. I lag putted pretty well. When I didn't, I 3-putted. That was kind of the whole round.   
 When you're trying to maneuver a ball in 15 to 25-mile an hour winds, you'll take solid shots. I did that, but, you know, I needed to shoot another 70, 71 and I would be great right now. I didn't. I'll come out tomorrow and try again.
