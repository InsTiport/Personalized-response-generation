FRED COUPLES:  Yeah, making double bogey on number 4, I just kind of said let's just finish up and get out of here. As it turned out, now I am kind of anxious to see where I finish.  It was a lot of fun.  Every putt I hit was going right at the hole.  Couple of them didn't go in, but the rest of them did.  Just a good way to finish up. 
 

Q.   Did you ever have any realistic thought of overtaking them?
 
FRED COUPLES:  No.  At one time I was 4, 5 under and looked up and Larry was 3-under par after 6 or 7 holes.  That is unbelievable playing.  Sure, the rough is not as high and the wind isn't blowing, but the fact is that I am 8 under and second; right now 9 strokes behind it. That is hilarious.  I think this guy is - those were great rounds; it is great playing.  So realistically, no; I mean, starting the day I thought I could finish third or fourth, you know, with a three or four under par.  As it turns out, if I can tie for second or finish second, that would be, you know, pretty lucky. 
 

Q.   You were, I think, 7 shots out of second?
 
FRED COUPLES:  Yeah, so I wasn't shooting for second either.  I thought if I got to 4 under, that would be third or fourth place.  You got to look at it one way, you go out and try and shoot a-- score every time you go, you try and shoot as low as you can.  I was just thinking if I could shoot 67, that certainly isn't going to give me a chance to win, so the next spot would be third or fourth place. 
 

Q.   Fred, you and Bermuda greens, have you ever had a string like this on Bermuda or a feel like this on Bermuda grass?
 
FRED COUPLES:  Well -- 
 
FRED COUPLES:  Not making putts like that.  But they were fairly easy putts, except for the one I had at number8, little down hill and across, I thought I made it.  It was going right in the middle of the hole and just spun out.  The rest of them were uphill which certainly helps.  I just think when you are playing Bermuda greens, you just-- you have to assure yourself that you get the speed of the greens.  Today, really didn't matter.  I mean, I was pounding them if they were going to go by the hole, doesn't matter.  If you are in the lead or near the lead you will see a lot of guys come up short or long, that is being a bit tentative which is only natural.  Throughout the week you want to get the speed and when you start making them most -- I just watched Nick Faldo make them on 18.  It was straight up the hill.  Looked good the whole way.  When you get the down hill ones, they are a little tougher.
