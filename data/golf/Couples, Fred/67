Q.   Tell us about how you played today and how you felt you hit it?
FRED COUPLES:   Well, I shot 77 and I didn't really play all that well.   So come out tomorrow in the afternoon and slash it around and try and play a little better.   But I had a good time playing with Jeff Sluman and Kenny Perry, but I was not very good.

Q.   Was with the wind blowing the way it is, is it a tough course, tougher maybe than you thought it would be?
FRED COUPLES:   I think any golf course plays harder when the wind blows and this golf course plays a shot or two harder.   But that has really not much to do with it.   I was 3‑over par after four and played okay for a while and double bogeyed a par‑5, I don't remember what, 13 or 14, and I finished with a 77. 
But I don't think the wind made it unplayable out there.   I mean, if it was Sunday and it kept getting dryer and dryer it would be a little different.   But there's some good scores.   Anything under par is a good score.   And there was nothing else.

Q.   Is there anything that you can do to work on the game?
FRED COUPLES:   No, I'm going back, going to have lunch and get ready for the Miami heat game.   No, I'm past worrying about it.   It's just another round of golf. 
I'm 52 years old, if I'm worried what I shot every single round, then that's a problem.   If I could go hit balls and felt good, I would go hit balls.   But it's just, it's just hard to go bang balls after I play.   So I'll come out tomorrow and try to see what happens.
