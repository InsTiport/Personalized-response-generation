 Q.   Going into this round what adjustments did you make to play like you did today?  
FRED COUPLES:   Well adjustments, I just tried to get off to a little better start, which I really didn't.   I missed a couple of tap‑ins on 10 and 11.   
And then I just played much better and made a few putts and I kept the ball in play.   I just ended up having a much better round.   
   
 Q.   Did the elements help your play?  
FRED COUPLES:   Well it wasn't nearly as windy.   So I think a really good score today was probably what I shot.   And there's a lot of guys shooting 70 and 69.   And I think that's, I think that would be a good score.   
Whereas, yesterday 71 was a great score.   And I was nowhere near that.   
So again, the wind dictates a lot on this course.   Some courses the wind makes them play one or two shots harder.   A course like this will make it play two or three shots harder.   And if you looked at the scores I think 1‑under was in the top‑10 and then today if you look at the board there's guys 4‑under, 5‑under, 6‑under.   They're playing really, really good golf.   And they will be the ones to obviously for me to catch.   
So it's nice to make the cut, because the way I was‑‑ I've been off so many weeks ‑‑ and after shooting 76 yesterday I knew I had to shoot at least par today or 1‑under and I want to play the next couple days just to get some rounds in.
