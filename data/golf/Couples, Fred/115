  Q. You got it in?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah. You know, I actually drove it very well today. I hit some wicked 4- and 5-irons out there, I just don't feel like I can swing that hard and hit the ground. And even No. 13, is that a par-3? It was 150 yards and literally shanked an 8-iron into the bunker and made bogey there.  
 But I made enough birdies to keep this thing going, where I'm hanging in good. Like I said yesterday, I was lucky to shoot 70. Today was a pretty good round, but I'm not hitting any irons really, really good, I will say that.   
 But it's a tough course. And there's a lot of funny shots where you're trying to do not unbelievable things, just different things, and I need to just start hitting the ball solid and get it on the green. Until I get that settled --  
  
  Q. The second hole --  
 FRED COUPLES: I hit a 4-iron, and I was just actually trying to hit it hard and hit it straight, and if it went over the green to the right I thought that was better. And as it turned out, the way the pin was, that wouldn't have been any good, either. But I pull-hooked it trying to get it back to the pin and made a mess of it to make six. I wish I would have missed the fairway, I would have had a 5-foot birdie putt, because the pin was in an easy spot. But I drove it well. I'll have to do that tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What was the opening like you had behind those trees?  
 FRED COUPLES: I just ripped it through all of them. And if I really got nuts and hit it hard, it would have gone through there and into the water on the other side. I couldn't have got it in a better spot. That was perfect. I had a very delicate pitch shot. But I would have dropped it there a hundred times out of a hundred times. That was pretty lucky to get it there. I hit it through the trees and I went through there and ended up okay.  
  
  Q. 26,000 people today. It looked like a regular major out there?  
 FRED COUPLES: Again, majors aren't in town, and people love golf in the Northwest, and they're coming out and supporting the tournament, which is great for me, because maybe some day before I finish it will come back to the Northwest and we'll have another Senior Open. I don't think they can get a better one than this.   
 I didn't realize last year that they shot so many under, wherever they played. But I think that kind of killed us here because there may not be anyone under par when the tournament is over; it's that hard. And I think the fog and the moisture helped our tee time today, because it got -- if you walk around it's baked out and we've got two rounds to go. And for me personally, I'm going to have to start playing a heck of a lot better to shoot under par. But I keep 70 in mind and I'll take it any time. But it's just very hard. It's a hard course anyway, and the greens are rock hard.  
  
  Q. Did you end up setting foot at Jefferson yesterday?  
 FRED COUPLES: I drove up there, yeah. I didn't get out, a lot of people there, and looked at the course. It looked pretty nice. I drove around the back and showed everybody where I grew up playing and we went to Alkai and walked around the beach and then came home. So it was fun.  
  
  Q. You didn't sneak on?  
 FRED COUPLES: I didn't sneak on, nor did I get out of the car. Although people saw the logos on the car and figured something out. We were on a tight schedule so I didn't want to get out for an hour and start talking to everyone. But I have all day Monday to hang around town. I'm going to Overlake to do an outing, so I'll see a lot of people Monday.  
  
  Q. When was the last time you were back in town?  
 FRED COUPLES: In Seattle? Well, I flew in here, going up to play the Vancouver Skins game, I stayed a couple of hours, caught a connection.  
  
  Q. That doesn't count.   
 FRED COUPLES: No, I know. Last June, actually. I wasn't in the U.S. Open and I -- wow, maybe two Junes ago, maybe it wasn't last June, maybe two years ago. A long time ago. They all come to see me, actually, get out of the good weather and come down to Palm Springs.  
  
  Q. You were giving the tour yesterday to your girlfriend and mother?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah, and Tony, a good friend from ESPN. We all jumped in the car and drove around. The traffic was pretty good so we did okay. We moved around all right.
