 Q. Fred, eight birdies, 4-under par, you have to feel good about that?
 FRED COUPLES: I did not know that. I figured it could be a little bit of a boost. I made a lot of putts, but missed a couple short ones. Hit the ball solid; I'll take 4 under any day.

 Q. What is it about this golf course that makes you feel so good?
 FRED COUPLES: First, the people. My first few years on TOUR, it reminded me a lot of Seattle, small greens. We don't have many courses like this in Seattle, but small, teeny greens, which is what I grew up on. Hitting a lot of greens is one of my strengths, and I've always played well here, whether it was an 8th-place finish or a 20th-place finish, won a couple of times. 
 I just think I feel good on the course, even I'm 49 years old, I feel like I can go out and play it well every single time. It doesn't mean I'm going to shoot 67. 

 Q. 49 is not all that old. 
 FRED COUPLES: It's old for this place. Everywhere I look, there are people I just played with Nick Watney and he won. I just played with Dustin Johnson and he goes and wins. These guys are great, great players, and young and [] fun to be around. As you know, I've got six more months left of this, so I'd better enjoy it. 
 I'll take eight birdies the next two days, maybe.
