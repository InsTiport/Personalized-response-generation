  Q.  Talking about his day.   

 FRED COUPLES:  Back held up good.  If it stays like this I don't think anyone will be under par.  It's just hard.  You almost feel lucky if you make birdies.  This course is hard enough as it is.   

 Don't know what my plans are for after the Masters.  There are so many people out here, no matter who they are, to follow you.  They like so many of us out here.  It's a great spot.   

 You don't expect to play in 50 mile and hour winds at Augusta, but you do what you can do.  Some guys can hit a 4-iron on No. 1.  You better hit a good shot to have a putt that you are going to like.  I can't imagine the course being like this at 3:00 p.m.  They put some water on the greens.   

 It's nice to be here.  It is my favorite course.  This year it was very satisfying to make the cut.  Today was sloppy and difficult.   

 There's fun if you hit a good shot.  It's a nice feeling when you hit a good shot.  If you can make birdies, that's a key.  It's about putting.   
  
  Q.  About Jim Nantz.   

 FRED COUPLES:  He can make anything sound good.  He made the cut sound like winning a gold medal at the 1980 (hockey) at the Olympics.
