   FRED COUPLES: I wanted to get off to good start just like every other guy in the field and I did that. I birdied the first two holes and the wind was howling out there and the course was playing hard. 
 I made a miraculous par on 10 from the left shrubs and then from that point on I hit beautiful shots and made I guess four more birdies. So it was a great day. 

 Q. How thrilled are you to shoot that kind of score in these conditions? 
 FRED COUPLES: No, it was very hard. It is my lowest score ever at Augusta. Previously I had had a couple 67s and besides really the shot I hit on 10, I didn't mishit many. 
 So I'm ecstatic about the round, but really just the golf course is very hard today. There are some good scores out there, and there are a couple coming in, I know Tiger, Poulter, Scott. But the wind's kind of died down, although it's picking up a little now. But probably from 2 through 12 or 13 it was a very tough course.
