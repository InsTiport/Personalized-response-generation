 Q. Fred, a great birdie on 18. Let's begin with that as you finish with 66. 
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah, I hit a good -- it's a scary little hole. I hit a 3-wood up the right side and 9-iron to about 12 feet and made it to top off a good day. 

 Q. How special is it to play in this event because it honors Byron Nelson?
 FRED COUPLES: Well, I played for a long time and then went away from it for a while just because of the scheduling conflict, and now I'm back. I think the course changes have been great, and Byron Nelson was -- Davis Love and I went to his house two or three times during this week, so he took care of us. We had a good time seeing him, and I think the tournament has been around forever, but without him here, a few people can skip it. I was one of them. But when he was here he got everyone to come and play.

 Q. Do you feel good about your position now, 5-under?
 FRED COUPLES: Well, I feel better than I did yesterday afternoon before I teed off. I wasn't expecting to be 5-under, but I can still play when I do well, and tomorrow will be a nice day to go out. I've got not many worries. If I get going well, hopefully I can keep it going. This is the fifth cut I've made, as my caddie just told me, and I've had two really good weeks and a lot of bad ones, so this is a really good week so far.
