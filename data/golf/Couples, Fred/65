Q.   Several players have talked how it's been a tale of three courses.   Do you feel that way?
FRED COUPLES:   Three courses? 

Q.   A tale of three courses. 
FRED COUPLES:   I don't know, that's, you know, it was a good day and the course is nice.   Obviously it rained, so it softened up a little bit.   But it is what it is, I guess.   I don't really know what to tell you. 

Q.   Not sure what to ask then. 
FRED COUPLES:   Right, well I shot a 70, I played pretty well.   I putt like he does and if you don't putt well, you don't shoot a very good score.   But I had a good time. 

Q.   Can you compare the greens to any other course you've seen?
FRED COUPLES:   No, they're pretty unique.   I don't know if people are ripping them, they're good greens.   There's a couple that are a little rolly polly, but, no, they're not like ‑‑ they're not like anything.   Augusta's greens roll at like 15.   If these rolled at 15 we would still be on Thursday's round. 
So they have them at a nice pace and they're doing a nice job with them.   But no, I think they're kind of one of a kind, but that's not a bad thing.
