 Q.   It looks like you kind of figured this golf course out today.   Can you take us through that a little bit and how do you feel about it?  
FRED COUPLES:   To be honest with you, they set it up pretty nice.   There's some really good scores, but Kenny Perry's capable of shooting anything.   And Calc.   But to be honest with you, even the first day I played pretty good golf and shot 76, which is highly disappointing.   And the last three days I played better and had a couple good rounds.   But it was fun.   
It's always nice to play well and get out of here, but I actually, you know, it was good to make the cut.   I know that sounds stupid to make the cut at a Senior PGA, but after 76, I needed to play Saturday and Sunday to get some feel.   I'm going to play in Jack's tournament next week, so I needed some more rounds.   
I'll take tomorrow off, probably Tuesday, and then play Wednesday and start Thursday.   But as far as here, I don't think I figured the course out, I hit the ball well and I made a few putts.   And the front side actually I played, I got in my way to shoot 2‑under.   I was 3‑under and then I hit a 5‑iron to the next hole, the par‑5 and made par.   
And then a wedge to number 7 from the middle of the fairway and hit it over the green and made bogey.   
When you're trying hard to birdie every hole and then you get in your own way‑‑ but it was fun and I'm happy for Roger Chapman, it looks like he's going to close it out.   He's played a long, long, long time and this will be a nice win.   
   
 Q.   The eagle on 10.   
FRED COUPLES:   Well somehow the drive hit hard and I had 8‑iron in there and I didn't hit a great shot, I got it on the green about 30, 40 feet and I made it.
