  Q. Freddie, you weren't sure if you'd get through today. You got through pretty good?  
 FRED COUPLES: I did alright. We only went nine more. For some reason I thought we'd tee off earlier and get 15, 16 holes. But I'm dead, and the last couple holes actually hit great shots on 9 and 10. And I'm glad we stopped right there and come out tomorrow. And it's a good thing because we're going to play a lot of holes. If I play well, that will be a good thing.  
  
  Q. You're just one off the lead and gave yourself a lot of birdie opportunities today.  
 FRED COUPLES: I did. You know, I can't complain. I'm at least putting better, but this morning, you know, I left a few 4- and 5-footers out there, which is normal, and this afternoon in nine holes I played very solid and birdied both par-5s and ended up birdieing the 10th hole.  
  
  Q. Final thing, talk about going into tomorrow with a chance here.  
 FRED COUPLES: Well, you know, when I won in 2003 I hadn't won in a while, but just with the people yelling, Houston Cougar this and Cougar that, and today even 7:30 at night there's still a lot of people. Tomorrow will be lot of fun. I seem to be playing better. It's not an easy course, so I've got to go out and be sharp.  
  
  Q. Thank you.  
 FRED COUPLES: Alright.
