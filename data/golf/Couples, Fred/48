Q.   Tough finish today.   How bad does that hurt?
FRED COUPLES:   Well, how bad does it hurt?   The odds are I had a pretty ‑‑ I wouldn't say it was the hardest shot in the world, the gap was, it was a pretty good gap, and I just tried to hit an 8‑iron a little too hard and I didn't cut it, I just hit it straight and I didn't think I hit any of those limps, but I did, and then it was just a comedy of bad shots. 
But I would think that put me out of any running for anything tomorrow. 
The rest of the holes weren't all that great either.   I was very mediocre.   I made a lot of pars, but I had just some mediocre swings.   I wasn't all over the place. 
I feel bad for Jason because he was, he waited for me forever on the 17th and then I finally thought to myself, I'm not going to make him wait, and I said, why don't you go.   And then he hit and he 3‑putted.   His 3‑putt on 18 was all on his own, but 17 I felt like I was killing him there.   It took me forever to figure out how to make a 7.

Q.   You had a couple of good birdie opportunities early, first three holes, didn't make them.   Did that set the tone?
FRED COUPLES:   Well, the greens were really fast.   They got hard and crusty, but for me personally, I enjoy that. 
So even though at 4 and on 5 I had a good chance, it's just this tee ball on 7, I smoked it up the left side and instead of trickling a little right, it stayed in that first cut of rough.   And I hit a flier into the back bunker and I made six from 145 yards.   And I wasn't expecting that.   But I did hit the ball okay. 
Really the 15th hole was a gaff.   After watching everyone hit it from the right side yesterday, I laid it up on Friday to the left and I tried to get it over there to the left and I didn't hit a very good shot, I hit the tree and kicked it right.
