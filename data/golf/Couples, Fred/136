   FRED COUPLES: I actually putted very well, but to finish today like that, a lot of luck involved. I played very well, and 67 is a lot better than 68 at this time.  
  
  Q. A little wind this afternoon, you hit 14 greens. Pretty good ball-striking?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah, I missed a couple -- the last three out of five. I didn't get tired, they were just hard shots and I didn't hit the shots. It was a tough tee shot on 5 and I drove it in the bunker and I didn't have much, and I whip hooked an iron on No. 7, but I hit a nice iron on 8 and then settled down again, and then on No. 9 just caught a little jumper out of the rough.  
  
  Q. Did you go to the belly putter because of mechanical issues because of your stroke or because of back issues?  
 FRED COUPLES: You know, I think it's been about eight years now. To be honest with you, at first I used to jam it way in there for a little pressure, and then I started putting well with it. So it's a little bit of both. But I do not practice putt. I've probably putted -- I'm not happy to say it, probably 20 minutes a month practice putt. Most of it is running around before I tee off.   
 But I do it because it helps my back. It actually keeps me a little taller, and when I hinge a little more than I should, that's when I have all kinds of back problems, so it keeps me from doing that.
