Q.   Something very special is happening in New York City, I'm sure you wish you're going to be there. 
FRED COUPLES:   I bought these tickets a long time ago.   I knew I was coming here, too, but on the idea of maybe not playing well or whatever, and I birdied the last two holes yesterday and on Thursday and Friday I didn't play well.   Excited to see the Seahawks and I'll be right here at 3:30 in the morning waiting. 
I grew up in Seattle and I'm a season ticketholder, so I fly up there on the Saturday nights and watch them play on Sunday.   I'm a big believer.   Seems to me, I don't know any of the players, any of the coaches, but I've been to a couple practices and they all like to be around each other. 
There's a couple guys that seem like they handle the offense and there's a couple that handle the defense, so that's a pretty good mix.   But we do hold teams in Seattle pretty tight and this is a whole new ballgame, obviously no home team but obviously I like our chances. 

Q.   Do you think the reaction was a bit over the top last time out?
FRED COUPLES:   Sure, you get guys that win anything, and four seconds later, a lot of guys run to the locker room and something like that, they are handing you tee shirts that say Super Bowl and they are handing you hats.   I've seen him on TV in Seattle and he represents a few car dealerships and does a lot for charity. 
In that instance, if you want to pick on him, maybe he should have left Crabtree alone but it was all fun for me.   I still think if he would have lost, he would have held his head lie and got out there are and still been the same Richard Sherman.

Q.   Talk about Peyton Manning's class on the opposing side?
FRED COUPLES:   He's a golfer, he's fun to be around.   I've never played with him but played behind him at Pebble Beach one year.   If we can slow him down we have a chance. 
I don't need to say anything, it's our No. 1 defense against the No. 1 offense.   That's a great thing; I'm a student of the game and I like to watch and I do like to watch our defense play a lot when I'm up there watching these games, but Peyton Manning is a different bird.   He's phenomenal, can take you right up‑and‑down the field.   If we can hold them to six field goals, we'll do all right. 

Q.   You came here in the early days and were victorious, what was it like to come this far to play a golf tournament? 
FRED COUPLES:   I remember getting an invite here and being like everybody else, being very excited to come and now when I come back, the golf course is phenomenal.   Now that I come back, it's like how many more building have they put up and hotels and resorts and all that.   It's very interesting.   We'll get around a little bit today, I'll go walk around.   The first couple days it was hard but the infrastructure here is amazing. 
A golf course is a golf course and if a player says it's great, it's great, and I believe this is a great course, but the rest of the stuff, in 25 years, you can't believe there can be that many buildings built.
