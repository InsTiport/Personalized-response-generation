  Q. This is your 27th Masters, is it still as much fun as year one?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah. No, it's a lot of fun. I've never really been asked that question. So, yeah, they're all fun.   
 They're all, if you look at the leaderboard, there's a lot of stuff going on, I played with a guy who made a late run, which was fun. I didn't play particularly well today but it was fun to watch him play the back nine and give it a go.   
  
  Q. Did you just kind of run out of gas today?  
 FRED COUPLES: You know, I'm just a little out of it. Taking so much stuff that I just, I hit some pulls, hit some push, I feel light headed, but I made it and I think this stuff, no excuse, it's wearing off, but I did as well as I could.   
 And I'm very happy to have played with Geoff. I love Geoff Ogilvy. And he was trying to root me on to play a little better. But it was pretty solid, but I got it around, I didn't, I whiffed a shot on the second hole, which was very, very interesting.   
  
  Q. Was it out of trouble or?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah, it was down, I took it to the left of the hazard and my ball was sitting there, I got it out on my second one, out in the fairway fine, and I made a good bogey there.   
 And then I guess the par-3 downhill, I mean it was the easiest shot of the week and I pulled it left of the green and on No. 6 and made bogey there.   
 I think I parred every hole and made one more -- I birdied 16. So that's, you know, it's not like I was knocking down the flag. I had a lot of good up-and-downs for pars.   
  
  Q. What's ahead the next few weeks?  
 FRED COUPLES: Well I'm going to go back to Texas and see these guys that were working on me and try and have a game plan, but I think I'm going to be off for at least a month just to get a way and see if it will thaw out.   
 It's been the same since October and those shots were pretty fun, but I can't live on those, so I got to figure out what to do and see what happens.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 FRED COUPLES: Well I took all of December off and then and first day I went back out and hitting it felt horrible but that night it was the same way, so I have had not a million, but a thousand different people tell me they could fix it and I've yet to find someone who can so far, but I'll keep trying and see what happens.   
  
  Q. Will we see you at the Senior PGA in late May?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah. I'm shooting for the Senior PGA, yeah. Or one of those. During Wachovia there's --  
  
  Q. Tradition?  
 FRED COUPLES: Is that what it's called? Yeah. That's what I'm shooting to play in.   
  
  Q. To play at the Tradition?  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah.
