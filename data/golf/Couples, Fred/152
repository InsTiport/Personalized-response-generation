  Q. What was your reaction to the day?   
 FRED COUPLES: It was good. It was a beautiful day. We were all expecting wind and didn't get a whole lot of it, but I hit the ball pretty well. Made a few putts, and ended up -- and a couple bogeys, but made my share of nice little 8- and 10-footers to keep the round going. Bogeyed the last, but it's a hard hole.   
 So I have to just come out tomorrow at 7.00 and try to get it going again.  
  
  Q. Hoping for the same conditions early?   
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah, we all do, it's not much fun to play in 20-, 30-mile-an-hour winds. Scoring is good.   
 I think we had good afternoon times. I don't know what it's supposed to be like tomorrow, but hopefully in the morning, it will be semi-calm so we can come out and enjoy another day. But if not, you just do whatever you can, and hopefully I just need to -- if it blows like hell, I need to putt pretty well, otherwise, I'll struggle. You're not going to hit every shot perfect out there.  
  
  Q. How were the fans today? Did you have a nice gallery?  
 FRED COUPLES: We had a few starting out and they dropped back to Ernie. We couldn't contain our guys. But there were quite a few people out there roaming around, it was good, all good.
