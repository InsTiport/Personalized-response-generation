  Q. (No microphone.)   
 FRED COUPLES: The third shot was the best shot I hit all day. I wanted to get it down and hold that hole for par.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FRED COUPLES: For sure. The first day I shot 70 and I wasn't playing -- I don't want to make it sound like I wasn't playing great.   
 Today getting it around was much better.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FRED COUPLES: Besides the PGA here, that was the last time I played in Seattle and tomorrow I have a good shot.   
  
  Q. Butterflies tomorrow morning?   
 FRED COUPLES: There is butterflies every time I play because you never know what to expect. Tomorrow -- for some reason today it kinda went the other way, where I said to heck with it. I'm playing in front of the fans and whatever happens, happens, and tomorrow I have a great shot at winning. Now I'm going to go give the real one.
