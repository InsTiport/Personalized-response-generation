 FRED COUPLES: Well, it was a good day. You want birdies? Birdie on the 1st hole, hit an iron on the  tee and hit a sand wedge to about three feet.  
 Pulled an iron on 3 left of the  green, putt from 10 feet, 12 feet off the green and left it short, missed a  15-footer for par and made bogey.   
 On the 5th hole, par 5, I hit it on  in two and two-putted for birdie.  
 11, driver and a 3-iron and  two-putted for birdie.  
 Bogey 12, par 3, I hit a bad iron in  the right bunker and blasted out and two-putted from quite a ways.   
 Next hole, hit it on the green and  two-putted.  
 Then 16, pulled a driver left and  got lucky, stayed on a little piece of grass by the hazard, wedged out and hit  a sand wedge to about 10, 12 feet, made it for birdie.   
  
  Q.  What do you think about these days?  Do you think about '07 Ryder Cup, anything like that?  
 FRED COUPLES: I have right now been working on my game, and  I feel pretty good. I certainly don't  feel as good as I did a couple weeks ago.  My little plan is to see Tom again more often, which is the back guy,  and play quite a bit at the beginning of next year. That's my plan.   
 Right now I'm trying to tighten my  swing up, and I'm kind of figuring out that when my back actually starts to go  bad, I can't do it, so my swing gets longer to protect my back, and I just kind  of figured that out in the last three or four weeks by practicing and feeling  good. Tom couldn't come here but he's  going to come after Christmas and get me ready for next year, and I'll see him about  every three tournaments I play and hopefully that will work.  
 I could sit in here from the time I  was 40, 41, 42 up until right now and tell you -- like last year I had a great  shot at winning LA and certainly had a great shot at winning Augusta, and those are my goals. I love the West Coast, and after that it was  pretty much downhill.   
  
  Q.  Could you explain the FedEx Cup?  
 FRED COUPLES: No, I don't know anything about it. You know, I don't really know. I mean, next year if I'm really killing  myself playing well at the beginning of next year, then I'll worry about  it. But right now I figure if I'm 40th  on the Money List or 80th on the Money List or 144th on the Money List, I get  to play in the first FedEx Cup. Whoop-di-doo.   
 I mean, we'll see. I'm not knocking it, it's a nice thing, but  I'm more interested in playing well and not really -- I think it's a nice  thing, I think it's great. I'd rather  see someone on the PGA TOUR play incredible golf and win $10 million in a  tournament by winning the tournament on a really, really good course, and if we  couldn't get a 9 rating for that, then we need to look around and see what  we're doing.   
 But as far as playing and doing all  that, I'm not knocking it, I'm just saying I haven't even looked at it. I don't even know -- for a million dollars I  couldn't tell you what tournaments are in the FedEx Cup. But I can tell you where I'm going to play  next year, the Bob Hope and San Diego and LA. Those are important things to me.   
 In May I may turn it around and  start to really worry about it. Again,  that's not being a slight. I think the  Tour needs a little boost in something, and hopefully the FedEx Cup will be it.   
  
  Q.  You're starting at the Hope?  
 FRED COUPLES: I'm not going to go to Hawaii, yeah, so the Hope.  
  
  Q.  You spoke about happy memories of Riviera and then Augusta, coming close to winning both, and  then you said the rest of the year was pretty much downhill. Was that largely back related or a few other  factors?  
 FRED COUPLES: You know, I went to Wimbledon for eight days  and had the greatest time ever, and after that I went to the Scottish Open, and  after that my back went out, I don't know when that was, maybe early July. From that point on, I tried to -- I mean, I  was close in Ryder Cup points so I kept playing and I couldn't get my back  loose and I couldn't really do anything.  So it was pretty much -- I know, it was not a very good stretch. I just couldn't ever feel good.   
  
  Q.  Do you ever ask yourself "what if" with this back issue? For those of us who have written golf for a  long time, seems like we've been writing about your back since God knows  when. It's been your whole career.   
 FRED COUPLES: If I was on steroids in '92 we'd be talking  about that for the last 15 years. You  know, I don't have a problem with it. I  don't walk around saying my back hurts and doing this, but there are times --  certainly I wouldn't be playing great golf every week if my back didn't hurt. I wouldn't be able to play golf if my back really,  really hurt, and I don't. So therefore I  try and play.   
 But there are a lot of tournaments  contractually that I need to play golf to represent Cadillac and Bridgestone  and all these companies, so I do my best to play as many as I can, and when I really  feel well, I try and play maybe 20 or 21 tournaments.  
 But getting those extra three or  four when you don't feel good are extremely hard because there are tournaments  throughout the year that you really want to play in, and if you overdo it and  hurt yourself and miss Augusta, then you've made a huge mistake, or the British  Open or any of those.   
 You know, I don't look back -- I  could be worse, I could have a wrist problem, and that would be a heck of a lot  worse trying to play golf with a wrist problem or some other things. You know, I'm able to play. I've learned how to play with a sore back or  a bad back, and sometimes I do really, really well. But it's hard to stand up there and really  perform when you do well and play with Furyks and Ogilvys and Tigers when you  don't feel great.   
 But I can still get it around. I'm 47, had a back problem for 15 years, and  it just keeps getting worse, and the guy that works on me thinks I'm a freak  that I'm able to continue to play. You  know, I owe a lot to him, and he makes it kind of possible. I've tried a lot of stuff, and nobody can get  it to where it feels like I can go two months and feel really, really good.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel like a freak?  
 FRED COUPLES: Do I feel like a freak? No, I feel like a normal -- Tiger Woods is a  freak, LeBron James is a freak.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)  
 FRED COUPLES: You know, I don't look at it. I like to play, I really do. I mean, I wish -- if you look back, I don't  think besides my first or second year, I ever played too many tournaments. Would I have been better off to play 23  events every single year? Of  course. Would it feel as fun golf-wise  if I had played another 100 events in the last 25 or 26 years, I don't think  so. I think I would be more than I  already am.   
 But I pace myself at an incredible  pace. Sometimes I don't play well  because of it.   
 When I go to tournaments, I try and  prepare myself where I can function and hit the ball, and I don't play great --  I don't play that well a lot of times, but when I start really embarrassing  myself, then I will certainly quit. But  I don't see that time coming too soon.   
  
  Q.  Back to the FedEx Cup, are guys talking about it at all? Is there any buzz? Do you think guys are as clueless --  
 FRED COUPLES: I'm not dodging it. I got sick at the World Series, so I haven't  been on Tour September and October. That's  when things were changed, I know. I know  they're going to cut guys back. I know a  little bit about it. I don't even know  when the tournaments are.   
 You know, I don't know why anyone  would be excited about it. It's going to  be the TOUR Championship, and if Tiger Woods doesn't win, it'll be because he  doesn't play enough. You know, if Tiger  Woods wanted to win any of this stuff, he would figure out how to do it. But I don't see him playing, I don't know,  six or seven or eight weeks to win the FedEx Cup.   
 I can guarantee you one thing, he'll  be ready to win the U.S. Open and the British Open and Augusta and the  PGA. I think that's great.   
 Now, I'm not speaking for him, but  when he plays and he gets in position, I'm pretty sure when the FedEx things  comes around, he's going to be the one to beat, and Phil Mickelson and Jim  Furyk and Vijay because maybe he plays a little more. But to me those are the same guys that have  been around for the last ten years.   
 So if the FedEx Cup -- I'd like to  see match play events the last six weeks where guys are beating each other up  and there's great matches. I mean, that  would be truly effective. But 72-hole events,  I'm probably going to get pummeled for this, but I'm also 47, not 30, and I  don't really have a shot at winning $10 million and I can sit here and downplay  it. Do I want to be in it? Yeah, because that will mean I've had a good  year. I'm not going to win the FedEx  Cup, but I still think I can win Augusta, and if I do that, then that will  be a heck of a lot better than winning the FedEx Cup.   
  
  Q.  But you've already got a green jacket.   
 FRED COUPLES: I am really looking forward to the FedEx Cup,  though, I really am. Where are the four  tournaments or five? Where are they so I  can leave here and tell my friends? Where  are they?   
  
  Q.  Westchester, Boston, Chicago and Atlanta.   
 FRED COUPLES: So the TOUR Championship is the FedEx  Cup? I thought the TOUR Championship was  like the TOUR Championship.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)  
 FRED COUPLES: No, he just signed for six more years, and  they're getting rid of the basketball in NBA?  We're getting the FedEx Cup.  Things are shaping up (laughter).  Things are shaping up.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)  
 FRED COUPLES: I'm not going to East Lake.  You've got to be in the Top 30, right, to go to East Lake, or have they changed that? So they dwindle down. That's a good system. The winner wins a million and a half?   
  
  Q.  $12.   
 FRED COUPLES: Wow, that's a lot of money. But is it like poker where it's all cash  laying on the 18th green?   
  
  Q.  Aside from the FedEx Cup, all the medical treatments that you've had, is  there any doctor or group of people that have said, Fred, someday medical  science will be able to correct the problems that you have for other people?  
 FRED COUPLES: No.  You know, I've seen maybe six or eight really, really top guys from San Francisco and New York and Chicago and Seattle and everywhere else, and a couple  of them don't really know much about it.  They just look at stuff.  
 One guy asked me if I walked when I  played golf, you know, and he had no idea that I could walk 18 holes and  play. The guy that works on it is  convinced that -- we talk about it all the time. I don't want to be 55 and not be able to do  anything, and as long as I can stay pretty straight, I'm actually doing  okay. So all these exercises that I do,  I go back and I try not to get the necktie look where you're hunched over. But I'm fairly sound.   
 I drove it with Davis, I'm driving it close to Daly at  The Skins Game. It's just that I get  really excited and then I kind of get away for a while because I physically  don't feel that well. I've been doing it  so long that I'm used to it. Again, when  you're a lot younger and in your prime it becomes a nuisance. Now I go home and oh, well, try and pick  tournaments. But I can't surgically  doing anything. I just have to kind of  pace myself.   
  
  Q.  I saw you on the driving range sort of drawing your wedges and stuff and  then sort of fading your longer clubs. Was  that on purpose and is that sort of the back coming at all?  
 FRED COUPLES: I warm up a lot longer and I hit a lot of  wedges, and I try to get my body just to get moving, and I hit soft draws, and  as I get more and more of them, I hit it a little harder. That is correct, then I start to hit cut  shots. When I swing well, it's okay to  do. When I'm really flipping at it and I  go on the course and I start aiming left and I cut it and I pull draw it,  that's not a good position to be in. But  yeah, that's correct.
