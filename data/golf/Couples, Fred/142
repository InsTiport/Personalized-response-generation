 Q. Didn't look like it was going to be a win for a long time but a comfortable 3 & 2 victory thanks to Anthony Kim and Phil Mickelson?
 FRED COUPLES: They are a heck of a team and there are some guys you don't have any worries about. It doesn't mean they are going to win the match but when they go out and play, they know what they are doing. I like the fight and I like the way Anthony Kim plays. Obviously everyone in the world knows Phil Mickelson is a world beater. But what a huge win to get us going.

 Q. It's been an up-and-down day both for the International Team and for the Americans. Right now you have the better of it but a lot of matches still in progress. 
 FRED COUPLES: Well, yeah, you can sit here and go over every match every 15 minutes and get worried about it or get excited about it and just like Tim Clark, if this match would have been even, he just hit one of the best shots he's probably ever hit but Phil with the drive Anthony hit, hit a wedge in there and they made birdie to close the match out. 
 But I'm tired and I've been out here four hours and it's mentally exhausting. I look at the scoreboard every PGA TOUR event in my life and now I come here and I have nothing to do with the score and I'm not going to look. It's the weirdest thing ever. That's my feel for it and I'm very excited with how we started.
