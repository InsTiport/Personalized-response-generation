Q. Before we talk about your golf this week, let's just get a health check from you.  You've been out a lot this year with recurring back issues, only played a handful of tournaments.  How does it feel this week?FRED COUPLES: Well, it feels good.  I played at Augusta and then that's the last time I played, and I went to Chicago for the Encompass to kind of get my feet wet.  And I wouldn't miss this for the word.  I love the old Open and playing in that, and the Senior Open, it's always been fun.  I was lucky enough to win at Turnberry, so I had planned on coming. I feel pretty good.  Today will be a test but I think I have maybe three hours before I'll play again.  So I'm going to go and rest.  But to play maybe 30 holes is going to be a lot for me.  But I'm looking forward to it.  I love Sunningdale and it's nice to be here.Q. What's been the strength of your game so far over these two rounds?FRED COUPLES: Well, I think we had a great pairing.  Those guys were birdieing every hole and I caught up to them a little bit.  And then unfortunately they made a couple bogeys coming in, and I made a couple of nice pars.  It was playing pretty hard out there.  But a great pairing with Miguel and Bernhard trying to figure out the course.  I only had really one round on this.  But I hit the ball really well off the tee, and that's the key out there.  I kept it out of the bunkers and everything, and made my share of putts.  But the holes that are drivable are the ones that I played very, very well on the par 5s.  The rest of the course I need to play a little better, but the shorter holes, I've done fine.
