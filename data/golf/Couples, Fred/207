Q.
Your reaction?
FRED COUPLES:  Pretty good.
Q.  The weather?
FRED COUPLES:  You certainly would rather have it be the same.  It was too much bad luck on these guys.  They deserve to be playing like yesterday.

But I hit the ball really well.  It was a lot of fun.  I have not played any golf the last three months really and just came over to play this week and next week.

Today was a nice day.  I didn't expect to shoot that in that weather.  I hit the ball solid.
Q.  Can you take us through your birdies?
FRED COUPLES:  Sure.  I birdied the 3rd, made about a 30-footer.
Q.  What did you hit in?
FRED COUPLES:  6-iron.

Then the par 5, hit it just short in two, chipped it up to about ten feet, made it.

Then the 8th hole, par 5, I hit a 5-iron for my third to about three feet and made it.

10, knocked it on and two-putted for birdie.

11, par 3, hit an 8-iron probably 15 feet, made it.

17, I hit a couple good woods in front of the green and hit a great chip to about two feet.

18, hit it by and missed it coming back.
Q.  Did you have to make any adjustments to rhythm or did you find your rhythm?
FRED COUPLES:  It was cold, windy and wet just like you guys saw it wherever you were sitting (laughter).  No, I didn't really want to be out there once we started going, and actually Stephen played well, too, but those are days I think you know you're going to get over here, but now it's beautiful.  I'll go home and watch these guys.  Maybe it'll blow, I don't know, but it's awfully nice out there now.  That's just the way it goes.
Q.  (Inaudible).
FRED COUPLES:  You know, it's tight.  After I've been home since the U.S. Open, I've only played the World Series and I went to Hartford.  Then I went home and rested.  After today I need to go relax because it's too tough to play when it's that cold and slap it all over the place.

It's okay.  I have no idea how Tiger -- when I get like that, there's no reason to play golf.  I don't know how he's doing today, but I'm also used to it so I know what the feeling is going to be like when your back is spasming or get stiff.  To watch him -- you don't ever want anybody to feel that, especially the best player in the world.  I don't know what he's doing today, but yesterday it was brutal for me to watch that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
FRED COUPLES:  Well, I don't know.  You know, I'm used to it now.  A lot of times for me, I go play when I shouldn't.  For him, he doesn't know if he's going to hurt it or not hurt it.  You know, he knows what he's doing, and I'm sure it's just a striking pain and he's not going to hurt himself.  He'll get over it after this week if he can get through it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
FRED COUPLES:  I don't know.  You know, I have no idea.  He's a pretty bright guy.  He's not going to be out there and make one swing and never play again.  I can't imagine it's going to get any worse because it's just muscle.  For me it's all bone and a lot of garbage.  I hope he continues to play.  Again, I've got to go see it because I only saw some highlights.  I don't know how he played.  If he's out there playing in that rain and that wind and just trying to make contact, it wouldn't be much fun.
