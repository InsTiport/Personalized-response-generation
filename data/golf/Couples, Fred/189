FRED COUPLES:  I played very well all day but I gave away a few in the middle. Nice to finish with a 6-iron and 3-foot putt for eagle. I shot 7-under and that's my goal again tomorrow. If I can do that, I think I will have a shot at winning.

The course is difficult if you don't hit the ball in the right spot. I had a mediocre first day but it didn't help to go out having seen seven and eight under-par scores being posted. I didn't see any scores on the second day and shot 5-under. If you go out and try to birdie every hole you can make mistakes and today I drove really well and had only one sloppy shot on the 15th which cost me a bogey. Seven under with a couple of eagles was good - but it was the worst I could have shot in the circumstances.
