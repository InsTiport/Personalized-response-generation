   FRED COUPLES: I misclubbed a lot of shots, and they were hard shots. I didn't hit very good ones, and I didn't make many putts, so when you do that, it kind of adds up to 76, which is very mediocre. 

 Q. You came in obviously playing well off of Houston. I'm sure you're disappointed.
 FRED COUPLES: I just was a little bit off, so tomorrow I'll play in the afternoon, go get some rest, and I hope I'm not back on the same drag where I don't feel good. 
 But I hit the ball well. It wasn't like I embarrassed myself. You've got to make birdies. If I could have made a couple more birdies and hung in there, maybe I wouldn't have tried a couple shots that I put myself in horrible places by trying to get a little greedy. If you're even par or even 3- or 4-over, you make a couple bad swings, next thing you know you get to a spot where there's no way you can get out of it.
