 Q.   How did you enjoy your round today?   You are close to the lead.   
FRED COUPLES:   I'm close to the lead?   
   
 Q.   Think so.   I think Phil came in at 4‑under?  
FRED COUPLES:   Yeah, yeah, I was close.   
   
 Q.   Would you rather be close and not win?   
FRED COUPLES:     It's a jinx thing?   
   
 Q.   You don't have to answer that.   
FRED COUPLES:     The jinx thing is okay.   I wouldn't mind winning this one.   I've never been close.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever had a hole‑in‑one in a practice round?   Bubba had one today.   
FRED COUPLES:   They were right in front of us.   Here?   No, I've never had a hole‑in‑one.   I had a hole‑in‑one on this little thing, but not on the course.  
   
 Q.   You heard the noise on‑‑  
FRED COUPLES:   Oh, yeah.   Any time you get a hole‑in‑one, it's awesome.   I mean, everyone is going to say he should have saved it.   But, you know, he's practicing, hits a good shot, it went in, I think that's well worth it.
