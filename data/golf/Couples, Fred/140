  Q. Aside from keeping Stricker and Woods together, any thoughts, basically, about what you're doing this afternoon?   
 FRED COUPLES: Well, our bet is that I don't know the pairings right now, he just did them. I don't want to embarrass myself.   
 But we've got guys playing really, really well. We are going to sit Hunter and Kenny. Kenny asked to be sat down so he could get some rest and get ready for tomorrow. But basically the guys are playing so well. They are a great team and they are tough. I know all of them. We tried our best in the pairings this afternoon to get out there.   
  
  Q. Sean O'Hair and Phil gelled well together this morning.   
 FRED COUPLES: Well, they are having a ball together the whole week. Phil and AK have latched on, and now we are going to put AK with Jimmy this afternoon, Jim Furyk. But Phil and Sean out of the box today to win that match was huge. Even though we are down a couple in two or three matches, it's still nice to get that point that quick.
