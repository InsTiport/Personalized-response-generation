  Q. Long day today, got another long day tomorrow.  
 FRED COUPLES: I feel good right now. It was a long day. Everyone is doing it and lot of people are out there until the rain came. Tomorrow should be exciting today for me.   
 I really don't -- 12-under, I know where I am. I didn't really see a leaderboard the last couple holes but you got to keep making birdies and get 25 holes tomorrow.   
 I don't think that will be a problem but there's a lot of guys fighting for this and I'm one of them, which is big.  
  
  Q. Stopping and starting for somebody like you. You spent a lot of time out there keeping warm.  
 FRED COUPLES: Yeah. There was a lot of stopping and starting for everybody. It's a good little golf course and I was done yesterday so I just came out for whatever we played, 7 holes, and then the rain. Then we went out and played a handful. It was okay. Tomorrow will be another day.
