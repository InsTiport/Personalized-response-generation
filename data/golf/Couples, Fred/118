  Q. That last shot on 18 --  
 FRED COUPLES: You know, it was just a perfect club, and I hit a good, hard 9-iron and thought it was close enough to make. I played okay today, and today I didn't putt very well. But Larry played an unbelievable round, and you know, when you put pressure on the guys, you've got to keep making them, and I couldn't do it.  
 He just kept going and going and going, so that was nice to see. As far as my game, I hit the ball well enough to shoot much better than that, but I just didn't make enough putts, or any putts.   
  
  Q. Is it fair to say that it took you quite a while to get going?  
 FRED COUPLES: Well, I birdied the first hole.   
  
  Q. After the 7th.   
 FRED COUPLES: Well, I had a 5-iron to the one par 5, No. 7 and made par, and then I knocked it on the other one which is kind of unreachable -- or not on, but on the green and pretty easy chip and I didn't make birdie there; that, you can't do.   
 What I've been doing all year is playing the par 5s well, and today, I birdied both on the back nine it, but the front, you know, I was right there to do much better and didn't. Like I said, when you get behind, you know you have to keep making birdies, and sometimes that's just not easy to do.
