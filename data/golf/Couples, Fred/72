  FRED COUPLES:       I went to school here and I played a lot of years.   Obviously I skipped it, I guess, a few times.   I just like the course.   I did win on the other one (members course), I think.   I think it's kind of an exciting time before Augusta.   I can try and get the juices up.   The problem is we're going to see what happens this afternoon, when I'm trying to play 33 holes.   The first 18 I played very, very well, made a few putts coming in (including the birdie at 18).   I drove the ball very well.   I did drive it to the right on 18, which is kind of understandable with the ocean to the left.   But I hit most of the fairways and made some putts.   I birdied four of the last five holes.

Q.   Are you worried at all about the fitness and longevity of this day?
FRED COUPLES:   Of course I am.   Last week at Mississippi (on The Champions Tour) I one-handed that.   Out here you can't really do that.   You've got to drive it in play.   It's a long course.   So we'll see what happens.
