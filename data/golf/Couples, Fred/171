  Q. Walk me through No. 7.   
 FRED COUPLES: I think it was 102 yards. I hit a sand wedge and you try and hit it to the right of the hole and if doesn't go in, it's going to be ten feet but hit the pin and went in. So it was a good shot, and I don't know, I may have made a hole-in-one, but I think it's my first, possibly second.   
  
  Q. Were the roars different from a regular round?   
 FRED COUPLES: Is there a word roary? It's pretty roary out there, not Rory Sabbatini but roaring. It's a great event, it's fun. It's going to be on TV and I think people are going to make a little more noise, but it was loud.
