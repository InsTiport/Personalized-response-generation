 Q.   Minus two today.   Happy with that?   
JENNIFER ROSALES:   Very happy.   Actually, I was expecting‑‑ today was different from the practice round.   Some holes they moved the tee backs, so it got shorter.   So, yeah.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JENNIFER ROSALES:   Yes, it just plays with our head.   We didn't know what to use.   It just took some time to figure out if you were going to hit a driver or 3‑wood off the tee.  
   
 Q.   What part of the game was best for you today?   
JENNIFER ROSALES:   My irons were good today and my drives, putting really good.   Just everything went well for me.  
   
 Q.   If someone tells you you are going to shoot two under at the U.S. Open first round‑‑  
JENNIFER ROSALES:   I'm pretty happy.   The way it was setup on the practice round, I thought, oh, my God, it's going to be a fun week.   I'll take 2‑under.   Any under at the Open, I'll take it.   
   
 Q.   You've got a lot of experience in the women's golf.   You've contended.   That probably has to play into how you played today, I'm sure?  
JENNIFER ROSALES:   Yeah, I know how it is to play in the U.S. Open.   I've been there.   It's just nice to be the position I'm in.  
   
 Q.   What about tomorrow?   What are you going to try to do?  
JENNIFER ROSALES:   It's not going to be the same thing tomorrow.   It's going to be tougher.   They are probably going to move the tees back.   So look forward to the challenge.   We'll see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   Did you leave any birdies out there that you wish you had?   
JENNIFER ROSALES:   Yes, some of the par‑5s.   Just hit a good shot just stupid mistakes, so you learn from it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JENNIFER ROSALES:   Yeah, I had a lot of lip‑outs today.   So that's golf.   It's the Open.
