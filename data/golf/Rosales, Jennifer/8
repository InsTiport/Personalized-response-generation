CRAIG SMITH:  Jennifer Rosales, 4 under for the day and 5 under for the two days of the championship.  Jennifer.
Q.  You really had it going today, a great round, understand there were a couple of birdies where, birdie opportunities where you came close and maybe didn't quite make them.  Did you feel you left a couple strokes out there on the course?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  Well, I made a lot.  I made some.  I'm just happy with the way I played today.  I'm kind of excited to go into the weekend.  Looking forward to it.
Q.  You had how many birdies today?  6 birdies.  That's a lot.  A third of the holes.  We'll go over that when we go down to the media room.  But overall what was the strength of your game today?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  Today I hit a lot of fairways compared to yesterday and a made a few putts in the beginning and kind of start rolling and just felt confident all day.
Q.  When you make a putt like you did on the last hole, what does that do for you going into tomorrow?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  It's just so nice to finish with a birdie on the hole today.  And just something to look forward to tomorrow.
Q.  How did the weather last night affect you?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  Actually it's about the same.  The greens are still soft and the fairways, they're still soft too.  So you could attack the hole.  That's what I did today.
Q.  You started with three consecutive birdies today?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  That's correct.
Q.  Just that kind of a start, how does that set you up for the rest of the round?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  Well, the first hole I hit it really good and just made that putt and I told myself that if I made this putt, it's going to keep going until the end.  That's how I started my round on the first hole.
Q.  Then 2 more.  You followed with a birdie on No. 11 and No. 12.  So you had a lot of confidence.
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  I did.  A lot.  I was hitting it where I want to hit it and just made the putts.
Q.  What are your thoughts when you see your name atop the leaderboard?
 JENNIFER ROSALES:  Nothing, really.  It doesn't matter until the weekend, until the last day.
