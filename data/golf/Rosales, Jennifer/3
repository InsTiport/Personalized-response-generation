DANA VON LOUDA:  Three birdies today, zero bogeys.  Third round and you are entering answering into the final round at 9 under par.  You must be very happy with those three days and good position going into tomorrow.
JENNIFER ROSALES:  Thank you.  I'm just happy to be here.  I almost pulled out of the first round because I slipped in the bathroom that night and hurt my ribs.  So I woke up that morning, and I couldn't move.  So Jim worked on me, Christina's friend, he was a chiropractor.  So he tried to massage and loosen it up a little bit.  I'm happy it's holding.

Q
Any pain today?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  No, if you're playing good, there's he's no pain.

Q
Go through your birdies.
JENNIFER ROSALES:  The first birdie was on 6.  I had about 40 yards away from the hole.  I hit a 60 to about two feet.

7, I hit an 8 iron about six feet.

14, I hit a wedge about four feet.  That's it.

Q
Birdie putts and they looked like they were in?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  It's been like that all week.  I think I only made 10 birdies last week.  My putter, I couldn't read the greens last week.  I made some putts today, short ones actually for birdie, and hopefully it's going to go in for me tomorrow.

Q
Your first win this year, you're right there at the Women's Open.  Here you are again.  What does that tell you about your year and how far you've come?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  Well, my year so far has been pretty good.  I just had a couple of injuries and had to pull out from a tournament.  On the off season I'll spend it on my body and do more Pilates and play more events next year.

Q
Confidence wise, it's your first win and all of a sudden you seem to be a regular fixture in the bigger tournaments.  This must do wonders for a sense of what you're doing out here?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  My first win, I'm happy that's over with, and I'm looking for my next win, when it's going to come, and at the Open, Meg played an awesome round.  I couldn't do anything about it.  Hopefully it's going to go my way tomorrow.  I'll play my best and see what happens.

Q
Are you going home to Manila now?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  Yes, I can't wait.

Q
First time since your win?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  First time.  I haven't been home in nine months and my mom wants me to go back right after this event.  I'm not going to fly right away, give me a couple of days to rest and I'll fly the next day.

Q
What have they got arranged for you?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I told my mom not to tell anyone I'm coming to home, but she's not going to do it.  She said it's going to be a big welcome or whatever, but I don't want to deal with that.  It's been a long year and I just want to spend time with my family and my friends, not dealing with press    no offense, guys    but just relaxing.

Q
As well as Annika has done this year, it must be somewhat of an intimidating presence when she's up there, but when he has the lead and she's lost it, does it make it seem even more wide open than it normally would?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  You know, I'm not going to think about that tomorrow.  I just have to play my game and how am I going to deal with it and just be with my caddie and hang in there until the last hole.  I'm not going to think who's behind me.  I know Annika is always going to be there.  I'm just going to play my game.

Q
(No microphone.)
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I was so close to pulling out.  And I told myself, I'm not going to sit out for this.  I love this tournament.  I love this course.  It fits my game.  And I just toughed it out and here I am in a good position to win it.  So I'm glad I didn't pull out.

Q
Did you have to make any adjustments to your swing or play any shots differently?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I was so loose, actually, after what happened to me, and I was hitting the ball good, hitting a lot of fairways and greens.  So hopefully it's going to stay that way through tomorrow.

Q
Where were you?  It happened Wednesday night in a hotel?  You slipped in the shower?  Can go through a exactly what happened?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I was in the bathtub.  It wasn't a good picture, but I fell.  I had my leg over the other one, and instead of trying to hold my right because of my wrist, I did my left side, kind of fell on my left.  I hit the edge right here, hit the edge of the bathtub.  It's kind of embarrassing.  I just said I pulled a muscle when I was swinging (laughter).  Finally I told my sister.  I said I fell out of the bathtub.  And my mom was so worried.  It was a painful shower.
