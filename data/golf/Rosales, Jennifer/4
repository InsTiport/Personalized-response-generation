PAUL ROVNAK:  Jennifer, thanks for joining us.  The good news is you're right there in the thick of things.  Tell us about the day and we'll take questions from there.
JENNIFER ROSALES: I couldn't make anything on the back and on 18 it started falling for me and it went all the way to the last hole when I made a double.
Q.  Jennifer, what happened?  I wasn't there on the last hole.  What happened?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I missed my drive on the right and it went into the bunker.  I had a shot into the hole.  It hit the lip of the bunker and came back and I had to hit it out, advance it to about 100 yards and made double from there.
Q.  Everything seemed to be going so smoothly for you.  It's only day one.
JENNIFER ROSALES: I played good overall, just the last hole.  I'm pretty happy with the way I ended up playing today.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow's round.
Q.  Overall, Jennifer, do you feel you're playing well?  You played well at the Open and carrying it through to today?
JENNIFER ROSALES: It's still in the back of my head what happened last week, but I'm trying to    it will take time for me to forget about it.  I'll take that experience and try to move on and play good.
Q.  What happened there?  Does that drive you a little bit this week, knowing you were so close?  Do you come in with more focus this week?
JENNIFER ROSALES: Like today, it was a mental thing on the 9th hole.  I missed my drive on the right, which has so much room on the left and I kind of pushed it.  I want to play golf, which I'm there for 18 holes and we waited a little bit on the 9th and I kind of lost my momentum after making two birdies in a row and didn't quite pull it off on the last hole.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
JENNIFER ROSALES: Well, the Open.  I was up there with the top players and I'm pretty happy with the way I played.  I have no regrets.
Q.  What's your impression of the golf course?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  It's wide open.  You can even miss your drive and still end up in the fairway, but the greens are really tough.  It's very undulated, very slopey, and the pin placement today was very rude.  I made birdies,  I put myself in a good spot to putt and I made six birdies, I'm happy with that.
Q.  You said it was still in the back of your mind.  How much wasn't in the back of your mind through 17 holes?  It looks like you went a long way to erasing what happened last week on 17.
JENNIFER ROSALES: Say that again.
Q.  You said Sunday was still in the back of your mind.  How far did you think    how much did you forget about it through 17, because the way you played through 17 certainly erased any memories of what happened on Sunday?
JENNIFER ROSALES: In a good run it just happens.  You make birdies, you don't even try, and that's what happened today.  Actually, I was attacking the hole and I said to myself, Jenny, you have to put the past behind you and move on.  There are so many more tournaments to come and you're young and you have so many more chances at the Open.  And that's what I tell myself every day.  It's tough to take, but you have to move on.
Q.  That 30 foot putt on 3, was that your best putt?
JENNIFER ROSALES: Yes, because last week, the longest putt I ever made was about 13 feet.  That was it the whole week.  When I made that putt on 3, it just felt so good.  I could make those putts.  After that they just started falling in for me.
Q.  I know you mentioned this a little bit, but Lorena was in the same bunker and she decided to lay up.  Was your lie that much differently that you were confident you could go for the pin?
JENNIFER ROSALES: I was closer than her.  She was really close to the lip of the bunker, and I had so much room.  But I was greedy, I was trying to get close to the hole and make par.  I got too aggressive there and paid for it.
Q.  You shot I think 5 under on 1 through 9.  A couple of people shot 5 under on the other side.  Is there a way someone could put it together and shoot a 62 or 63?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  It's tough, because I told you about the greens.  If you're in the wrong spot, you're dead.  On the other side I had problems putting because I was on the wrong side of the hole all the time on the back side, but I changed a little bit on the front side and went to where I could go for the hole.
Q.  You got quite an individual personality in your apparel and so forth.  Do you think you're the kind of person the LPGA needs to attract more young players into the game?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  I don't know.  I just want to be myself out here.  I don't want to change for anybody.  I try to express myself with the way I dress, and I like being like that.  It won't hurt people trying to dress up like me, it's good for the Tour too.  It doesn't mean if the other players don't dress like me it's bad.  That's just the way it is for a long time.  I'm trying to make a statement for myself not for
Q.  Will you be put on a calendar any time soon?
JENNIFER ROSALES:  There is a thought, but I don't think so.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Jennifer, take us over your score card.  Start with the birdie on 18.
JENNIFER ROSALES:  18, my putt or shot?
PAUL ROVNAK:  The shot and how far the putt was.

JENNIFER ROSALES:  It was about 12 feet uphill.  I had an 8 iron.

PAUL ROVNAK:  What did you hit?
