 LAURA NEAL:  Great playing, Jenny.  Your personal best, tied the women's course record here at Turnberry.  Been playing well this week.  Did you kind of expect a round like this at all or are you surprised.
JENNY ROSALES: I am really surprised, but I felt really good this week hitting my drives in the fairways where I want to be and hit as much green as I have to. 

Q.  Was that the secret today?  Fairways and greens?
JENNY ROSALES: Actually, yes what I can today, I tried to make some putts which I did. 

Q.  Were you in any bunkers at all?
JENNY ROSALES: Today, no.  Yesterday I did on the first hole, but that's about it for three days.  That was my first goal, avoid bunkers (laughter) I did pretty good so far. 

Q.  Do you like this type of course?
JENNY ROSALES: Actually, yeah.  You got to hit a lot of shots.  You have got to have a lot of shots here and which is I really like especially yesterday morning the course played so tough on the front side and I mean, it just played so long I used my 3-wood on the par 3s.  A lot of woods there.

Q.  Are you nervous at all?
JENNY ROSALES: Actually no, I am more excited.  Not nervous, though.  I am looking forward and get experience tomorrow and we'll see what happens. 

Q.  How long have you lived in the States?
JENNY ROSALES: Probably five years now.  But I go home during the holidays. 

Q.  Who introduced you to the game?
JENNY ROSALES: My dad used to play.  I start when I was 12 and my brother got me into it too. 

Q.  Have you been to Britain before?
JENNY ROSALES: Was here last year, but that's it.  My second time. 

Q.  How quickly was it before you became good enough to beat your brother?
JENNY ROSALES: Took me a while, actually.  Because he's a really good player too.  And it took me a while. 

Q.  Who were your mentors or heroes growing up?
JENNY ROSALES: Actually my hero is my brother.  He taught me a lot.  Gerald.  He played in the Asian Tour. 

Q.  Is he caddying for you this weekend?
JENNY ROSALES: No.  He caddied for me in the Open.  Three weeks he caddied for me. 

Q.  How is he doing?
JENNY ROSALES: I haven't talked to him for a while. 

Q.  You can't check his results on the Asian Tour Web site?
JENNY ROSALES: Right now they are off for two months.  I don't know when they are going to start, probably sometime this week or next week. 

Q.  You've never led a tournament before.  How will you handle it tomorrow?
JENNY ROSALES: I just got to, I guess, focus and talk to my caddie more.  And just got to play and see what happens. 

Q.  Does women's golf get a lot of attention in the Philippines? 
 JENNY ROSALES: Probably for right now it will be.  But yeah, there has been a lot of -- golf is getting big in the Philippines now, so, if I do well this week, you never know.  (Laughs). 

Q.  Do they field a team for the World Amateur and events like that?
JENNY ROSALES: Yeah, they do that every year, every two years. 

Q.  Did you compete on the team?
JENNY ROSALES:  I played the one in '96 and '98.  I played it twice. 

Q.  You won the NCAA while at USC, right?
JENNY ROSALES: Yeah, I won my freshman year.  I didn't graduate, yeah, I stopped my junior year and turned pro. 

Q.  What did you study?
JENNY ROSALES: Went to USC.  I was studying  -- didn't have the time to declare my major.  I left before I did.  (Laughs).  There you go, golf. 

LAURA NEAL:  Are there any other men pros from the Philippines that have won a tournament or  --
JENNY ROSALES: Yeah, in Asia, yeah.  But I think.
LAURA NEAL: Not on the PGA TOUR?
JENNY ROSALES: No.  

Q.  How long are you off the tee?
JENNY ROSALES: People ask me that but I can't answer that.  Probably average, you mean or  --

Q.  Like if you hit it out of your socks, how far?
JENNY ROSALES: The wind is helping.  (Laughs).  Probably I could hit it  -- hold on.  How far is the last hole?  I was 100 yards away.  275, 280, the last hole, yeah, about.  Little old me, yeah.  I could kill the ball once in a while. 
LAURA NEAL:  Great job.  Have a good night tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.
