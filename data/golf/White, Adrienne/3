  Q. Obviously coming out as a Monday qualifier, having got in through a playoff in the Monday qualifier, coming out and shooting a 68 the first time around has got to feel good.   
 ADRIENNE WHITE: 67.   
  
  Q. 67, that's right. Got to feel good.   
 ADRIENNE WHITE: Feels great, yeah. I've been hitting the ball well. With my situation that I'm in with my status, you know, I have to fight every week to get into the tournament.   
 Luckily, you know, I've been patient. This week it's paid off. I just, you know, got a chance to get in, and I knew I was hitting it well, so I just kept everything going that I had going.  
  
  Q. That's great. Like you said, it's a little more taxing because you have to fight to get into the tournament. Mentally does that wear you down a little bit more?  
 ADRIENNE WHITE: No, not really. I kind of think of it as a glorified practice round. I get out here before everybody else and I get to play a competitive round early in the week.   
 So I know how the course is reacting. I know where to miss it and where not to. I just try and take all the positive I can from it.
