Q.   Talk about your play today.   5‑under on the back.   What a back nine. 
JIM RUTLEDGE:   Yeah, it had been sluggish for the first 27 holes, never gave myself any chances, made a few mistakes, and then the back nine just sort of melded together.   I made some good tee shots, some good iron shots, and then some good putts. 
And a great 3‑wood at number 17 gave me an eagle chance from a couple feet there.   That was a bonus.

Q.   Let's talk about 17.   250, 260 out on that 3‑wood?
JIM RUTLEDGE:   Yeah, it was, well the wind had just died and the Boonchu was back from me and he hit it on the front fringe, so I figured we could get home.   And the way that pin is set there, if you hit it in the middle of the green it should feed into the middle of the hole.   And it did. 

Q.   How do you feel going into the weekend?
JIM RUTLEDGE:   Good.   Just glad to be here because after nine holes today I figured that we might not be.
