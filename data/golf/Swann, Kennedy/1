  Q. Talk us through the ebbs and flows of the match?
 KENNEDY SWANN:   It was definitely I think this was my most difficult match because she wasn't really giving me anything, and I was 2-down through two, but my thought process with every match has just been to try to stay upbeat and stay positive and just be grateful that I'm here in the first place, and so she won 1 and 2, and then I made a really good birdie putt on 3, made a really solid birdie putt on 5 and got back to all-square and I think the hardest thing for me is to try to get up in a match, and once I'm up, I'm a little bit more comfortable.
 So I won 9 to go 1-up, and so it was a little bit more comfortable, and if your opponent makes birdies, there's not real anything you can do about it, so I just try to make a lot of pars, and if she made a birdie, then good job for her.
 Q. You're a quarterfinalist, what will that do for your confidence?
 KENNEDY SWANN:   I haven't really processed it.  I had a little freak out when I realized I made it to the quarters in the first place and it kind of hit me.  But I think I have a lot of confidence going into quarters, but again I'm just trying to stay solid.  I haven't had a three-putt all week, and that's been my goal.
 So if I can just keep up with the no 3-putts -- I think it's pretty cool I was an alternate to get in.  So I think it's pretty cool to be an alternate going into the quarters.
