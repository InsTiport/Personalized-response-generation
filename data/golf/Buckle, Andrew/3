   ANDREW BUCKLE:  You know, I was playing really well the first 11 holes and just trying to stay focused.  And then it was kind of funny because the crowd loves Brandt, they were all over him out there and fair enough.  It was a lot of fun.  I was having a laugh with him about that today. 
 Then the 12th hole, I hit it a little bit right and it would have been nice if I would have got it into a bunker or something then I could get it up to the green.  Anyway, I had a putt for bogey there and I kind of missed that bogey putt and the momentum went the other way.  I lost a bit of rhythm and was all over the place toward the end.  Thought I was going to kill someone out there.  Kind of nice to be finished. 

 Q.  Learning experience, do you think coming down the stretch?  Was it a pressure situation for you? 
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Not really.  Go home tonight and think about what I did, you know, try and figure it out.  But definitely a great learning experience.  The crowds out there were phenomenal.  It was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll learn a lot from it.
