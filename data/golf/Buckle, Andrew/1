   JOE CHEMYCZ:  Through 15 so far.  Difference between yesterday and today is what?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  No wind.  Short game kept me in there yesterday and the same again today, I just holed some putts.  It was good.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Five of 12 from off the tee but looks like iron play as well and like you say, you're putting very well.   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Yeah.  I'm not -- you know, my irons were pretty good, striking my irons nicely and trying to get that driver under control and I'll be playing alright.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  How hard is it, what's the problem with the driver?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  I don't know, really.  It's more just about standing up there and trusting it and -- I don't know, really.  I don't think it's that bad.  The fairways I missed today, they weren't far off, so sometimes stats can be a bit misleading.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  After the rain, is it a different golf course?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Definitely, completely.  We wake up this morning and it was, you know, it was still blowing like yesterday, it seemed to be.  I don't know how tough it was but, yeah, this afternoon, you know, we had no wind and soft greens and the greens were pure so, yeah.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Did it change your approach at all?  Could you attack flags this afternoon?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Oh, definitely, yeah, because it was so much softer and from the fairway you could, you know -- there were some tough pins out there but you could hit your yardage and wouldn't be far away.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Good golf course for you?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Yes, I think so, if I'm playing well.  Yeah.  Like I said, the greens are nice and got a good feel on the greens and yes, you got to drive it pretty straight.  The rough is not too severe.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Talk a little bit about just your rookie season so far.  Some pretty good things happened, especially early on in San Diego.   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  The start of the year was nice.  Even after that it's been a bit downhill, but I think maybe I lost a bit of patience or something and then -- it's nice to be back playing well.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Anything particular happen or just --   
ANDREW BUCKLE:  More settling down, you know, having a better attitude and just trying to relax and enjoy it and learn instead of, you know, being hard on myself.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Were you overanxious at the beginning to do well?  I mean you put some pressure on yourself.   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Not really, but I think after -- I think it was kind of the opposite, you know, and then all of a sudden I had a good week and thought maybe I can go out here, and I think after that I got hard on myself and just lost a lot of patience.  I'm trying to get back to that and just going out there and playing golf and enjoying it.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  You're not enjoying your feet this week.  What's going on?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  I played 36 on Monday with new shoes which wasn't smart, so got a pretty bad blister.  So, hopefully, get that fixed.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Is it a problem?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  Not really, no.  I got some Band-Aids and stuff on it.  You can feel it.  It doesn't bother me, really.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  What did you learn from San Diego that will help you this weekend?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  I don't know.  Just kind of keep playing shot by shot and keep playing 18 holes and 72 hole tournament, and not 54 or 36.  Just got to -- never give up until the end.  Keep plugging away.   
 JOE CHEMYCZ:  Did you look at the leaderboard today at all?  Do you care?   
 ANDREW BUCKLE:  It's hard not to.  It's cool to look at it and see that they got going on up there with all the vision, pretty cool stuff, yeah, always in front of you.  You see them but you're not really worried about it.
