THE MODERATOR: Good morning and welcome to the presentation of the 2016 Jack Nicklaus National Player of the Year Awards presented by Barbasol.
I'd like to start out by recognizing our recipients.  Our first recipient from Division I, Jon Rahm of Arizona State, a senior from Barrika, Spain.  Rahm won four times this season.  He became the second player in Arizona State history, and the first since 1997, to record a top 10 finish in every outing, doing so in all 13 tournaments.  Rahm's nation's best 69.41 stroke average is seventh best in state history.  He posted nine top 5 finishes, and in 41 rounds shot par or better 35 times, including 22 rounds in the 60s.
Not only did he lead the nation in scoring average, but he is also the nation's leading scorer in versus par, par 4 scoring, and birdies.  Rahm was previously named the recipient of the Ben Hogan Award, becoming the honor's first two-time recipient.
Although not a criteria for this award, in 2014 for the Eisenhower Trophy, Jon also broke Mr. Nicklaus' scoring record in that event.

THE MODERATOR: Thank you, John.  And now I'd like to invite Mr. Nicklaus to the podium for some comments.
JACK NICKLAUS: Well, first of all, congratulations, guys.  You know, collegiate golf was, to me, the way that I propelled myself into the TOUR and having a life of golf.  Back in those days -- oh, I guess I can tell the story because it doesn't happen today, but my sophomore year, freshmen couldn't play back then.
My sophomore year, I made the Walker Cup team, and I was -- I guess when I was selected, I was 18 years old and 19 when I was going to play.  At that time, the Walker Cup team made the -- got an exemption from the Masters.  So I went back, and my golf coach was Bob Kepler at Ohio State, and Kep said, congratulations.  He says, great going.  Boy, are you going to have a great year.  And I said, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.  Kep says, boy, I can't wait to start playing collegiate golf.  He said, oh, you're not playing collegiate golf.  He said, you're not going to go to school this spring.  I said, what are you talking about?  He said, you're going to go play the Masters, you're going to play the North-South, you're going to play the Walker Cup matches, the British Amateur.  You've got plenty of golf to play next year.
How about you guys?  Did you guys do that this year?  I never heard of a collegiate golf coach that would have done that years ago.
Anyway, what he did for me was he gave me the opportunity to learn, play, use the skills that I had at an early age and to develop.  So when I came back, I came back the next year -- actually, I didn't win the Big Ten.  I finished second.  But the year after that, I won the Big Ten and the NCAA.  Had a great collegiate career, had a golf coach that I loved forever, and he got me started in many ways towards my career in golf.
So you guys have all got your coaches here.  You've all got -- they all teach you different ways to do different things and give you guidance on how you go in life.  Listen to them.  One of them might send you out to the Walker Cup match.  They might send you off to the NCAA too or whatever.  It's great to have these young men here.
Earlier, Doug had gotten things started, and he designed the trophy.  Anyway, it's a real privilege for me to have the opportunity to be here at Muirfield and be part of these awards.
Barbasol, thank you so much.  Not Barbasol, but -- Barbasol, yes, thank you for supporting it.  Thank you all for being here.  We appreciate it very much.  Thank you.  (Applause)
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll open up the floor for questions.
Q. I'm just curious for Jon, (inaudible) the U.S. Open, by playing the Barbasol, which I think is the same week as the British (inaudible), did you get any consideration to waiting one extra year?
JON RAHM: No, I did think about it, but I felt like waiting too long would give me, I think it was two or three less starts on the PGA Tour, and I wanted to get my pro start as early as possible.  Just in case I can get all six and I happen to play great, maybe get the PGA Tour card or maybe be able to make it to the Web.com finals.
Q. I wanted to ask Addison, I was curious about your career in the military and the detail with Mr. Obama, and how you were able to maintain somewhat of a good golf game while you're doing all that.
ADDISON LAMBETH: Right.  Well, I was on the helicopter squadron, Marine One, with President Obama.  So I was just on the security detail for that and traveled around the world with him.
As far as golf goes, we only played like a month out of the year.  So I didn't have a lot of opportunity.  It's just really, I guess, natural ability to where I was able to keep it up, I guess.  But not a lot of time to practice and stuff, obviously, in the Marine Corps.  The job is number one.
Q. What did you do for that month?
ADDISON LAMBETH: So that month you play All Marine competition, and then you move on to the All Armed Forces competition.  And then from that, it's the CISM, which is all the armed forces in the world compete against each other.  So each step takes about a week.  That's what that month consists of.
Q. That's a good month.
ADDISON LAMBETH: It's a pretty good month.
Q. Addison, what was your plan when you first entered college at Appalachian State?  When did your stint with the Marines come into view?  How did that work out?
ADDISON LAMBETH: Well, I had a good time in college, a little bit too much fun my first go-round.  So I dropped out, and then I didn't really -- I was just kind of -- I didn't really know what I wanted to do or anything.  I was kind of lost.  So I just -- the Marine Corps was a good option.  So I found myself and want to finish school now.
Q. We tend to ask this every year, but I'd still be curious to do it again.  The most meaningful shot they hit all season.  We can go down the line.
JOHN COULTAS: So my most memorable shot of the season was probably the second tournament I won, I was in a playoff, and I was hitting my driver into the fairway bunker.  I did it in regulation as well.  But in the playoff, hitting the fairway bunker, and had about 185 yards in, and I was able to hit a 6 iron to about 12 feet and ended up making the birdie putt to win the playoff.  Probably the most meaningful shot.
Q. Which course was that?
JOHN COULTAS: That was at Kinderlou.
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else ready?
JON RAHM: I'll go ahead.  I would say the most memorable one was kind of the one that got this year started for me.  It was my first win this year at Isleworth.  It's a pretty big hole.  It was kind of windy.  It's a big green, the slope is left to right, the ball is below your feet, and it was blowing wind really hard left to right.  I think at that point I was only leading by one.  I had no idea because there were groups behind me.  And I was able to hit this like high cut 7 iron that landed about three feet from the pin and rolled to like ten feet.  So I got the two-putt because that pin was not able to hit close to and being able to two-putt.  So being able to hit it that close in that situation, I would say the driver, hitting it as close as I did, was just as important with that shot, but I would say being able to hit it close to win the tournament.
PETER FRENCH: So my most memorable shot was at the 2016 Sun Conference Championship.  It was just kind of one that stands out, me and my coach were walking up the 18th.  It was only the second round, but I was playing solid.  And we had a little bit of a weird lie, and he said to me -- I had to go up over this big tree and hit a high cut towards the green and pretty much just -- he's like, well, maybe it's 2 iron.  I said, no, the thing is going to go right in the middle of that tree.
So I ended up taking a little bit more of a risk, hit a 3 iron, I mean, just absolutely perfect, up over the tree, high cut, to about 20 feet and made eagle to shoot 68 second round, which was nice.  So that one just kind of stuck out because it was a little bit of a banter between me and my coach.
ADDISON LAMBETH: I don't really remember any good one that was very memorable for me.  For me, my memorable shot was the 71st hole of the NCAA Tournament, hit it in the bunker, and I had a horrible drive.  And then all I had to do was hit like a pitching wedge out of the bunker, and I hit it then, hit right in the lip, and it came right back to my feet.  That lost me the NCAA Tournament pretty much.  So got in the playoff because I bogeyed that par 5 and then lost in playoff.  So that's my most memorable shot.
KERRY SWEENEY: Well, I don't know how to approach that, but I think my most memorable shot was my final round of junior college.  I was five shots off the lead, and going into my final round, it was in my hometown where the Nationals were, and I just -- I wanted to have just a really fun day and go out there because this was my last year as a junior college player under Coach Howell and for my university -- or state college.
So going out and shooting the number I did and the score I did, that first tee ball was just really emotional and really -- a fuzzy feeling for me.  That was, for me, the most special shot I probably hit all year.
Q. Jack, what's the most emotional shot you've ever hit when you had a hard time seeing the ball?
JACK NICKLAUS: In college?
Q. Anywhere.
JACK NICKLAUS: Don't ask me to go back there.  The most what?  Emotional shot?
Q. What's the most emotional shot you ever hit?  Where you had a hard time gathering yourself to hit.  Let's make it a tee shot.
JACK NICKLAUS: Well, let me think about it because you haven't asked me that question in any one of these years before.
I've said many times probably the most important shot I made was probably 1959, and I had the 36th hole of a 36-hole match with Charlie Coe in The Finals for the U.S. Amateur at Broadmoor.  I hit it about eight feet, and Coe almost chipped it in.  Here I am with a chance to win my first U.S. national amateur, and I knocked it in.  To me that was so important because that gave me the confidence and the belief that I could do that under the right circumstances and the pressure that was put on me.
So from then on, all those eight-footers were easy, Doug (laughter).  Easier, I should say.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, everyone, for attending this year's presentation, and congratulations again to the recipients of the 2016 Jack Nicklaus National Player of the Year Awards presented by Barbasol.  (Applause)
