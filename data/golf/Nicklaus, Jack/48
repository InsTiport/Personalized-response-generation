 Q.   What was your first shot at your first Masters?   
JACK NICKLAUS:   Probably hooked it off the first tee.   There wasn't any trees in the left and probably played it from somewhere between 1 and 9 because that was the easiest place to play from.   That's probably what I did.   I don't remember, but I think I probably did that.  
   
 Q.   How was today?   
JACK NICKLAUS:   I knocked it on the green, probably 8‑putted.   I don't know.  
   
 Q.   How special was today?   
JACK NICKLAUS:   We had a good time.   We didn't do anything that was special for that other than having one of your grandkids caddie for you.   That's fun.   Good day.   
   
 Q.   Are you maybe having a meeting with the youngster from China at some point?   
JACK NICKLAUS:   I've already done that.  
   
 Q.   How did it go for your guys?   
JACK NICKLAUS:   Fine, fine.   It was nice meeting him.   Nice young men.  
   
 Q.   A lot of knowledge imparted in that meeting?  
JACK NICKLAUS:   Well, it was about life.   Life and education and how to help him with his life and where he's going forward.  
   
 Q.   Some clear‑cut advice‑‑  
JACK NICKLAUS:   I didn't think it was my position to do that.   His parents are with him and his parents do that.   All he did was ask me questions and I ask answered him.   
   
 Q.   Was there anything specific about the course that you were able to impart to him?  
JACK NICKLAUS:   We didn't talk about it.   Going to take him some time to learn the golf course.
