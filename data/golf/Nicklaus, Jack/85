 Q.  It doesn't look like there's going to be a lot of room to spare, does it? 
 JACK NICKLAUS:  When I saw the pairings last night, I said, you know, I didn't do the pairings on the basis of trying to put strong guys out first and get the lead and get it over with.  I really put it out how I thought the players should play against each other.  We put Tiger and Mike; if it were a tight match, I probably wouldn't do that and put Tiger in that position.  I just said, "I hope I'm not doing the wrong thing."  You know, we put Mickelson and Vijay together, so you know, we had some really good matches. 
 And as it turned out, the International Team is probably -- it might be about 8-4 today or something like that, which is just one more than we needed.  So we've squeezed it out but the guys played well.  I mean, Scott Verplank was my rock.  He won four matches during the match, and of course Phil played great and Stewart Cink played great.  That's what we needed.
