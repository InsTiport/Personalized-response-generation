Q. Mr. Nicklaus, another successful Memorial Tournament in the books.  If we can, just get a few thoughts on the week.
JACK NICKLAUS:   Well, I thought it was a very challenging week.  We had wind on Thursday, calm on Friday, hot on Saturday, windy, rainy, calm.  On Sunday we had everything that you could have.  The golf course was stressed out pretty well, so it was tough.
The guys had to -- addressed a bunch of different conditions, and Jon Rahm played beautifully.  He leaked a little oil at the start of the back nine, but he played so well, so much better than anybody else was this week, with staying with it, with staying with the conditions, so forth and so on.
I'm very happy for him.  I think he's a great winner.
