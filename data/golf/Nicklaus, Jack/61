 Q. Can you just talk about your round and how good it feels to be out here as always? Is it still competitive between all three of you after all these years?
 JACK NICKLAUS: It wasn't much competition today, because none of us played very well. 
 But we always have a good time kidding each other about it.

 Q. Was anything riding on it today?
 JACK NICKLAUS: Was anything riding? No. That's not what we do. 

 Q. Talk about the fans a little bit. 
 JACK NICKLAUS: Oh, they were neat, everybody enjoyed today. They enjoy the par-3, they have a great time. We have a good time too.
