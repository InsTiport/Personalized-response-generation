GRED PADILLA:  Than Witch? 
 
GRED PADILLA:  I played Witch yesterday in the morning and the greens were firm.  But they rolled a lot better.  There's a couple of greens in the Ghost that spiked up.  And they have old grass that's all torn up on them.  I think it's playing a little easier, still, because the greens aren't as fast. 
 
GRED PADILLA:  Yeah.  I feel great about that.  I played here last year in the Preview, and the greens weren't near as fast.  I just wanted to come out and shoot even or better in the afternoon. 
 
GRED PADILLA:  Yes. 
 
GRED PADILLA:  I've putted as good as I ever have, I think.  I played great all day.  I hit it pretty close.  I missed some putts.  I didn't have any 3-putts.  I made a putt off the green on par 3 in the third hole.  And coming in the last three holes, it was a real struggle.  I parred them all.  I had to get up-and-down on No. 7, my 16th hole from about 15 yards.  I had to get up-and-down on 8 for about 30 yards.  I had to get up-and-down on 9 for about 40 yards for par.  So I was groaning coming home.  Other than that all day it was pretty good.  I was getting tired, though. 
 
GRED PADILLA:  It was a big step coming out of high school.  I played some national tournaments and I won the Ping Phoenix.  But playing at ASU you're with a group of golfers that are just the best.  They won the national title. I didn't even get to play on the team.  They had five guys ahead of me.  And I think playing there this year really got me ready for taking it up another level.  And also I want to put a word in for my coach, Dean Ryemuth (ph.), Phil Mickelson's coach.  I've been working all summer long, just fine-tuning everything, getting everything ready.
