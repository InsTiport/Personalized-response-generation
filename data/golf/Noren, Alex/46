 Q.  66 today, how would you reflect on that?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it was pretty good golf today.  Very happy.  There's no wind and the greens are soft, so you see a lot of birdies out there.  But it's still nice to get 5-under.   
I saved a good par on 13, and that helps a lot.   
 Q.  What particularly please you about your play today?  
ALEX NOREN: A little bit better off the tee.  I changed my driver a little bit, the settings, a little bit straighter.  I missed every drive to the right the first two days, and so that helps a lot, getting in the fairway, not hitting from the rough all the time.   
So that was a lot better.  Didn't get as close as I wanted sometimes but it was better putting.   
 Q.  How are conditions?  
ALEX NOREN: It's perfect conditions.  No wind.  Playing the ball up and you've got soft greens, and the greens are rolling nice, especially in the morning.  You'll see a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  Where do you think the lead will be today?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I saw the guys starting off pretty well.  I mean, I'm going to be at the best six, seven back.  I mean, there's always another day tomorrow.  We'll see what happens.   
But I'm happy about two good rounds and one maybe not so good round.  But it feels a lot better playing again and hitting some good shots.   
 Q.  Can you pull your performance at Wentworth?  
ALEX NOREN: We'll see.  Those don't come as often as you want, but we'll see what happens.
