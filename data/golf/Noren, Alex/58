 Q.  Alex, first time at THE PLAYERS and you shoot 4-under the first day; that's got to feel really good.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it feels really good.  Tricky golf course, pretty firm greens, and probably one of the best rounds I've played actually, so I feel good.   
 Q.  Can you elaborate on why it was one of the better rounds, tough golf course?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, well, it's a tricky golf course.  You need to hit different shapes off the tees and quite tricky coming into the greens.  We ended up having pretty good weather, not too much wind, but it's a nice golf course to play, and yeah, it was -- nice place here.   
 Q.  I think it's the only bogey-free round so far of the morning wave.  You must be pleased.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it felt nice.  We tried to play really strategic around here, just to hit the right shots and maybe not go for too many pins with the longer irons.   
 Q.  Is it hard to dial it back, or is that something you enjoy doing?  
ALEX NOREN: Well, I enjoy it because then you get a lot of shots that you can take on.  Half the shots we went pretty aggressively, and half the shots probably quite conservatively, yeah.   
 Q.  Are there any guys you relied on for info on the course?  
ALEX NOREN: Not really.  I mean, we're just trying to get here and see what it looks like and not have too many things to think about, because they probably put their own rounds in their head and tell us, oh, this hole is really tough.  So it's nice to see it fresh and not have too many opinions about it.   
 Q.  Did you do better than your expectation, right on your expectation?  
ALEX NOREN: No, better.  I would have taken 4-under coming out this morning.  But I mean, the game feels pretty good.  But 4-under is definitely better than I thought.
