Q. 64, course record, silly question, but must have played very well?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I putted great and then yeah, got it going.  It was tough conditions but probably one of the best rounds I've played, so I'm very happy right now.
Q. Stunning score.  How did you find the course?
ALEX NOREN: Perfect.  The course, all three courses, are in probably the best shape I've ever seen them.  The greens are running great.  It's in great shape.
Q. How many years have you been coming?
ALEX NOREN: A long time.  Maybe my eighth time, seventh time or something like that, yeah.
Q. Of course Carnoustie is your favourite course, isn't it?
ALEX NOREN: Well, I like it but I've never shot lower than maybe 71 here.  I didn't expect much but it went better than I expected.
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, how are you feeling going into your next round?
ALEX NOREN: I feel like most of the times, you're happy with this but then you try to play another good one tomorrow.  And I don't have that high expectations for tomorrow.  It's just trying to get the practice in and work on the stuff I've been working on all year.  And another day, a day off, as they say.
Q. Playing with amateurs, does it relax you?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it's a little lighter format and especially play playing with Ernesto, who I've played with a lot of times and a nice friend and then playing with Hugh Grant, who you've watched all the movies with him and he's pretty much like in the movies.  Yes, it's relaxing.
Q. And the joint course record you were chasing.  How did that feel?  What was going well for you today?
ALEX NOREN: The putting was very good.  I played pretty steady all day.  Made my pars where I needed to and I was never in really bad trouble, and then the putter worked fantastic.
