Q. Even par round.  Was it a little frustrating day out there today?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I would be happy with 2- or 3-under.  Two three-putts, finished kind of with an outside green three-putt.  And just a little frustrating.
I thought I played pretty good.
Q. Was it tricky in those conditions?
ALEX NOREN: Well, it was a lot better than I thought when I was teeing off.  I thought we were going to have a bad day and it ended up being pretty nice.  It's just, you know, windy conditions are a little bit easier than this.  And you see the guys on the leaderboard 10-under for Lowry, and you just want to make those birdies.
So it was a little frustrating when you make an easy bogey or something.
Q. Do you feel like you're still in it with a good round tomorrow?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it's going to be fun tomorrow.  I'm going to be playing like I did today, pretty aggressively, and just try to make as many birdies as I can.
