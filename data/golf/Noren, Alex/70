Q. Thoughts on an excellent second day.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it was a little bit more up-and-down today.  A little bit more maybe solid yesterday.  I made a lot of birdies on the back nine after that rain delay, which was great fun.  I holed a chip.  It was a good nine.
Q. Sounds like there was a little frustration in there but satisfaction at the end.
ALEX NOREN: No, I'm very pleased how I kept it together, because it is a tough golf course.  A little bit of a wayward shot, and you can be in some difficult positions.  Yeah, I managed to chip-in, which always helps.  And then make a birdie on 17, which is quite a tricky hole today.  Overall, I'm very pleased, yeah.
Q. Does it matter to you that you're leading at halfway?
ALEX NOREN: Well, it's just I've got to putt two great rounds in to beat the other guys.  I'm rather ahead than behind, yeah.
Q. Given the season you're having with the three victories already, have you been stepping up thinking, new targets, new aims, new ambitions?
ALEX NOREN: Not really.  I'm just trying to, I know how tricky this game is, and I'm just trying to improve every day, every week, and this week, you've got to work on some different stuff, tricky grass around the greens.  So it's too much to focus on than just to focus on new targets, new goals and stuff.
Q. You look as relaxed and assured as you have done since the victories.
ALEX NOREN: Well, it obviously helps.  You gain more confidence in yourself and your ability, but there's so many good players out here.  So you've got to be on your toes, so that's why maybe I'm not looking too cheerful, yeah.
