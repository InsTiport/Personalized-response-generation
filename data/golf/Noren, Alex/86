Q. What do you reckon a wonderful day's golf in awful conditions?
ALEX NOREN: The front nine was all right but the back nine it got pretty bad.  Managed to stay patient and I'm really happy coming down with a decent score.
Q. You say stayed patient; there was a lot of waiting around.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it was not really bad but just bad enough so you couldn't get it going.  Maybe helped a little to get some time to clean the clubs and clean the grip and stuff.  But it was a tough day.
Q. You got your reward, because that's a beautiful finish, to birdie on the way home like that.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, and especially 17 was a close iron shot and 18 maybe the wrong club, second shot, but managed to make birdie.  It was really satisfying.
Q. What are your thoughts into the final round when you hold on advantage like this?
ALEX NOREN: Well, it's going to be a fun day.  I'm trying not to get ahead of myself.  It's all about who shots a good round tomorrow.  Even those 8-under guys can shoot a good round and it's going to be tough.
