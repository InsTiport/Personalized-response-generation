 Q.  66 today, last year in your first year you finished 10th.  Today you've given yourself at another top-10 here possibly.  What is it about TPC Sawgrass?  
ALEX NOREN: Well I think it's a fun course.  I like this when it's very difficult.  You hit all kinds of clubs off the tees, tiny areas to hit on the greens, and then it's not overly long, you hit a lot of wedges in.  Last week at Wells Fargo you hit a lot of 6-, 7-, 8-irons into firm greens and this week it's a pretty trickier, but shorter.  It's fun.   
 Q.  You had a great season so far.  Three top 3s, two runner-ups.  What are your plans the rest of the season and your goals?  
ALEX NOREN: Well my goals are to kind of improve my game.  Last few weeks it hasn't been that great and yesterday 5-over.  But I bounced back today, which was nice.  Just to kind of get those bad rounds out of me and be a little bit steadier, tee to green.  The putting was a lot better this week, but usually my putting and chipping are the best parts, so I need to just improve kind of my bad shots off the tees and into greens.
