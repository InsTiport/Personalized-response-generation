Q. What's the verdict on a tough day out there?
ALEX NOREN: It's tricky, very tricky.  It's firming up and it's very windy, and the wind is switching a little bit.  I mean, I thought it was a fun day anyway.  I mean, every shot becomes so much more important.  That's why you want to play in these events and under these conditions.  But then you've got to handle it.
I didn't really play that good today.  Played quite good in the middle of the round and then a few bogeys here and there.
Q. Do you take some pride for hanging around because you are still in a nice place?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I mean, the only thing you can't do in these conditions is go for all the pins if you are struggling in the beginning because the pins are tough.  If you have wedges you can go for them, I think, but a few of these are pretty tough.  I just hung in there and made a lot of pars in the middle and I was quite pleased.  Then obviously one or two shots better would have felt better.
Q. Can you believe that the leader shot a 64?
ALEX NOREN: It's probably one of best rounds I've heard of, yeah.  It's so tricky and obviously it's warm and sunny and stuff, but it's bouncing and tricky.  It's a fantastic round, yeah.
Q. Do you still fancy a 64 yourself tomorrow?
ALEX NOREN: I have got to find some serious magic for that, yeah.
