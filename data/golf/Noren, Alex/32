 Q. Talk about how disappointed you are to not be able to play the weekend?  
ALEX NOREN: Well, I'm disappointed, of course. I thought I had it going today. I played a lot better, had a lot of chances. There is still so much slope on the greens, didn't make the birdies. And you start forcing. When I got out of position on 10, I hit a bad tee shot. And I should have just probably dink it down the fairway, went for it and made a triple, but instead of probably a bogey. And that takes so much‑‑ took a lot of energy out of me. I shouldn't probably do it, but it's tough not to. It felt like I had a good run. But coming in with a run like today it's not very nice.  
   
 Q. This being your second Masters, did you learn anything new this year?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, you've got to hit proper shots. As soon as you get out of position, play your way back in. There's so many holes, like 7, 17, they're quite narrow off the tee, you've got to just be a little bit smarter about it. It played like a real major, and sometimes you see this place, with no rough around it, you can hit it, here you feel like you get some chances, even if you miss the greens but it's even worse they're. It's tough.   
   
 Q. With so many of the top players in the world on the leaderboard right now, does that make it hurt even more?  
ALEX NOREN: No, I know where I stand. I haven't done great in this or the U.S. Open before. And I played better in the British Open. I don't look too much where my ranking position is. I look more how my game is, and my game wasn't up to the level I wanted. That's just how it is.  
   
 Q. Any thoughts on the weekend?  
ALEX NOREN: About the guys?   
   
 Q. Yes.   
ALEX NOREN: I don't know. We'll see.
