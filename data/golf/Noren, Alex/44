 Q.  How do you feel about a steady start?  Obviously a dropped shot on 17 but other than that it was a pretty solid opening to your defence today?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I played probably the best I played for a long time.  Very steady, a little better off the tee, which makes it a lot easier from there on.   
Yeah, I'm very pleased.   
 Q.  Early birdie got you off to a good start but you had to stay quite patient till the eagle came along?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, and then I hit a way-too-firm chip, but it caught the flag and I was lucky to make that eagle.  Yeah, I played steady otherwise, yeah.   
 Q.  Lovely approach into 18 set up another birdie chance which rolled just wide and that would have been a nice way to finish after dropping one on 17?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, 4-under would have been great but I'm happy with three, and nobody's kind of running away.  It wasn't that easy today, I don't think, and you know, they tucked away some pins.  From the start, 1 was so tight to the edge, and that's how they kept it going.   
 Q.  Only one player has gone around bogey-free today.  Does that show you how tough this golf course is?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, but it's tricky.  Like the greens, it's tough to hit all the greens.  You kind of hit over some and short some.  They have got all these kind of edges to them.  It's tough.  But you can make the birdies out there because the greens are good.  Everything, the whole course, is in perfect shape.
