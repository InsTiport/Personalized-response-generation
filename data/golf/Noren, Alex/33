Q. How tough is that for you?
ALEX NOREN: It's terrible.  I had so many chances, especially from 9 forward.  But it's tricky with the putting here, it slopes a lot.  That's it.
Q. There were chances to get away, but it didn't seem to work.  You were so happy with your putting all week.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I felt pretty good, but tough to read the lines right and you start to doubt the lines.  I had a good opportunity on the last, 18, but it slipped away.  That's how it goes sometimes.
