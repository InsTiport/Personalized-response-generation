Q. Nothing happened in your round until you got to 12 and from there it was quite eventful?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, very eventful.  I was playing well today, hitting most fairways and most greens, up until 14, really.  Was very, very happy, felt very calm out there.  It was so different from yesterday.  Yesterday I holed all the putts, and now I didn't hole that many.  Yeah, then it got eventful.
Q. Nice to finish by die, birdie.  The two par 5s are good chances and having dropped shots coming in, as well.  That must have been a nice boost at the end,
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I hit some wayward shots on 15, 16 and 17, I got quite lucky getting a shot from the right rough or just behind the trees.  But that's how golf is.  If I would spread out those bad shots, you know, I thought it was a good round.  It's tricky today, very windy.  Just happy to have a chance.
Q. Four shots going into Sunday and this time last year, you were six shots back.  Shouldn't be a problem.
ALEX NOREN: Well, there are very good players at the top.  You know, if I get my tee shots better throughout the whole round, that should give me some more opportunities.  You never know.  But it's golf.  Anything can happen, but I need to really play well.
Q. Just finally, how enjoyable has this week been for you, all the things that go with a defending champion and we've had good crowds all week.  How have you enjoyed it so far?
ALEX NOREN: It's fantastic.  It was a great pairing the first two days with Rory and Lee Westwood and like you said, the crowd are amazing.  They cheer you on.  They are huge crowds and they know golf, and this course is always nice to play.  So it's a great week.
