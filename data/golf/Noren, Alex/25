 Q.  You saved the best till last, a 67.  How pleased are you with this week?  
ALEX NOREN: I'm very pleased.  Made my way around, maybe not hit all perfect shots out there but I played so much better the last two days than I did the first two rounds.  So I'm very pleased about that and then, you know, very happy to make the putt on the last.  You know, it's a lot of points to play for.   
 Q.  Obviously Francesco had a cushion at the top of the leaderboard.  Were you aware of that and did that change anything for you?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I tried all I had.  I had chances on 17 and 18 and also 12.  You know, I was -- I thought I had a chance.  I had a 6-iron into 12, front pin.   
I'm very happy in the end.  I tried my hardest to get that win.   
 Q.  First of the Rolex Series, some big points on the board.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, we're all playing for a lot of points here, and especially going into the Ryder Cup and the rest of the season.  Yeah, you know, that's all you're looking for, but also, you're trying to get that win, and obviously I'm happy with the finish, but it's so much fun on the back nine when you've got a chance.
