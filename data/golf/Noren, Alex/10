 Q.  How tough were the conditions out there?  
ALEX NOREN: It was tricky in the beginning, but the first maybe six, seven holes are not that tough, and then it gets tough.  So 1 played tougher than it used to.  After 7 it gets pretty tough.  8, 9, 10, 11.  11 played unbelievably tough today.  The guys got a big rainstorm on the 11 tee.   
Then it got so windy in the end.  After the rain we got -- after the rain on 13, after that the wind just started blowing like crazy.   
 Q.  And how would you summarize your championship?  
ALEX NOREN: I'm pretty happy.  A lot better than earlier this year.  I wanted a little bit better finish than this.  But it's on the way upwards and I'm looking forward to next week.
