 Q.  Wednesday and Thursday, two wins notched out.  You are in the driving seat.  
ALEX NOREN: It feels nice.  Very windy conditions.  I played pretty good and putted better than yesterday, so that helps a lot in match play.  Especially when it's windy, you got a lot of longer putts for par.  It's tough to hit the chips close and the long putts close.  It's tricky conditions.   
 Q.  You are a very good bunker player.  Sometimes you get a bit of late back spin.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, this ball came out weird.  It's very hard, no spin at all.  Then that hole stopped me yesterday and it was good today to me as well.  Very lucky there.   
 Q.  I noticed you had a wristband on there.  How is it?  
ALEX NOREN: It's getting better.  Like you said, I probably hit too many balls.  We're working on it.  It's fine.  I can play.  It's nothing problematic.   
 Q.  I know how hard it is for you to not go out there and spend all afternoon bashing balls?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, with the windy condition like this.
