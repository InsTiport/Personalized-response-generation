Q. Sergio, well played, that must have been some feeling ?
SERGIO GARCÃA: I've always said it, Ryder Cup, there's nothing like it.  You know, I've got an amazing partner.  He played amazing.  I think the front nine we played in foursomes on this course with the wind that was blowing was spectacular.  It was something that I will never forget and I'm sure Alex won't, either.
ALEX NOREN: I've never been this nervous throughout the round.  You know, it's so special.  I didn't know how special it was going to be until you step on the first tee, and you've got to pull off the shots.  It's like -- it's something special.
You know, it was really nice to get paired with Sergio.  We played great.  We didn't miss many shots on the front nine, and I missed one on 10 and he missed one and that's it.  So it was a great day.
So I'm very, very happy to get the point.
Q. And Sergio, with all of your experience in this event, how does it feel to be part again of an old-fashioned European come back in the sunshine?
SERGIO GARCÃA: It is good.  Obviously I felt like we played well this morning.  You know, just a couple little breaks here and there that they got, we didn't, and unfortunately, you know, you're looking at 2-2 or something like that, but other than that, I thought that the team fought really, really hard this morning.  Obviously fighting hard this afternoon, and let's see how it finishes.
