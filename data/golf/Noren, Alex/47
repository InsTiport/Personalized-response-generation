 Q.  Alex, 5-under 66.  How would you assess your first round of The Italian Open?  
ALEX NOREN: I'm very happy.  Played pretty well, not great off the tee maybe but good with the putter.  Got up-and-down a few times; that helps.  The putter was the best it's been for a while.  That was the main reason.   
 Q.  You've been working hard on that?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it's been so up-and-down this year.  I had some great moments and bad moments with the putter.  Tried to work a little more, and especially like with the greens -- these are similar greens to what I have at home, and easier.  So I've been working on that.   
Just haven't played as much -- many tournaments lately and just trying to get into it.  Now I'm playing a lot more at the end of the season.  I'm trying to get into it, yeah.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the golf course and the conditions?  
ALEX NOREN: I like tree-lined golf courses, and I think it played a bit tough, longer, than I thought.  When I played yesterday, I didn't think it was playing as long as it did today.  You have a lot of mid-irons into par 4s and stuff, especially if you miss the fairways, it's some pretty tough shots.   
But the greens are quite soft and quite -- you can go for the pins and it's quite nice with the wedges because they don't spin back, so you can quite a aggressive.   
If your iron game is on, you can score really well.   
 Q.  That round restore a bit of confidence that you might have lost over the past few weeks?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I played well in Switzerland but after that, not very good in England and then yeah, so it's very nice for the confidence to get off to a good start.  I haven't got off to a 5-under start for a long time, so it feels good.
