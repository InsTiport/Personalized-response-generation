Q. How satisfying is it to get the job done in good fashion like that, a good score?
ALEX NOREN: It was really nice.  I didn't play so good last week at the PGA.  Kind of made the cut and just hang in there.  Didn't feel that great, and then found something on the range yesterday and then worked some this morning.  Then I felt so much better off the tee, and around here, I mean, if you don't hit the tee shot good, it's not that easy.  But you get a lot of chances from the fairway.  So I was very pleased.
Q. And did you feel in control of that match early on?
ALEX NOREN: I was 2-up after two, and he started playing better after that.  But I kept playing good.  And then 3-up after ten, anything can happen.  You start losing a few holes and anything can happen.
I did well there to make a birdie on 13, and then it felt like I had a great chance to win.
Q. Sounds like you like match play.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it's nice.  It's different.  It's nice when it's head-to-head.  It's a little bit more, maybe even more focused in the here and now and not so much on the whole score maybe.
Q. And while you say you had to do some work after the U.S. PGA, do you still feel very buoyant and confident?
ALEX NOREN: Yes and no, because I know how delicate golf is, and you've got to stay on top of things.  I didn't have the same kind of feel over there in America as I did in Scotland; and in British Open I played okay.  It's always something with the swing or the chipping or the putting.  I'm pleased to show a good result today.
