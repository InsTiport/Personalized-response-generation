 Q.  How thrilled are you with that performance?  
ALEX NOREN: It was fantastic, especially the front nine.  Yeah, one of those days, everything goes your way.  I'm very happy.   
 Q.  Can you quite believe that you were actually 7-under through the first six holes with those birdies and an eagle?  
ALEX NOREN: You have got two short par 5s, but I managed to hit some draws with the wedges, and I've always hit this fade.  Didn't really get close before.  Now I got close, and it's a nice feeling.   
The only thing he probably didn't do as well as the other part of his game was his putting.  Great off the tee.  Every shot was perfect off the tee.  It's kind of tough, if I lost a few, he kept hitting great tee shots.  He played nice, maybe didn't roll it as good as he wanted to.   
 Q.  A little bit weary yesterday evening, but is the energy back and adrenaline fired up?  
ALEX NOREN: It's great.  And a day like this, three quite calm days, it's amazing to get that in Scotland.  I love this course.  It's great.  The turf we play on is fantastic, so I'm enjoying it.
