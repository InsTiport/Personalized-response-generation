 Q.  You played a near perfect approach into 18 today and almost holed the second shot.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it was a long day, waiting for the thunder and then finally get out there and the wind stopped, and it was a little bit easier without that wind, yeah.   
 Q.  For the second day running, it's the 12th hole that stands out on your card because you eagled yesterday and today.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I chipped in yesterday.  Chipped in today.  Yeah, I haven't made that many birdies but kept the bogeys out of the card for most of the time, and two eagles help out very much.   
 Q.  Almost a pity conditions weren't like this earlier on.  It's very still now.  How difficult was the golf course today with that wind earlier on?  
ALEX NOREN: It's just difficult because it swirls a little bit and then a lot lot of angles and you don't see the other holes.  Usually when you see the holes, you can know exactly what direction you are playing.  But here, tree-lined, and you can't see the other holes.   
It's tough.  It gets quite bouncy out of the fairways.  The fairways are quite soft but outside it gets bouncy, and you have to hit some really good shots all the time.  It's tricky, tricky more than very tough.   
 Q.  In terms of a defence of a title, it's not going too badly.  You're at the right end of the leaderboard?  
ALEX NOREN: There's one guy four ahead of me, but anything can happen.  If it's as windy as it was today, anybody can win.  But it's nice to be 3-under I think after today.
