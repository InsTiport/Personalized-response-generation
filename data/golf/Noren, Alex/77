 Q.  I guess it was always going to be tough to follow up yesterday's round, so are you still a happy man?  
ALEX NOREN: I'm happy.  I played decent, and maybe a few 3-putts, long putts, and not as much going as yesterday.  But I'm pleased.   
 Q.  What happened with the double?  
ALEX NOREN: Just hit a drive right.  Couldn't find it.  Doubled there, and then hit a nice pitch -- it looked good all the way and it finally got in, yeah.   
 Q.  Conditions seemed a bit colder than yesterday.  Was the ball not flying quite as far?  
ALEX NOREN: Just similar conditions.  I think it's just that you've got to hit proper shots, especially into the wind, 18 played pretty tough.  It's tough.  Have to work on that, because I know it's similar conditions probably tomorrow and similar winds.  I mean, yesterday, looking back at it, I hit a lot of fairways and that makes it easier and today wasn't as good off the tee.  It's tougher.   
 Q.  St. Andrews, always a pleasure to play there?  
ALEX NOREN: I love it.  It grows on me every time.  I like the challenge of how big it is, you know, but you still have to hit good shots.  The first few times I was there, I thought it was crazy.  I couldn't focus.   
 Q.  Pretty special season for you, two victories already.  You must feel very happen by life.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I mean, since we had our baby, I've looked at golf a little bit not as serious as before.  And it's helped me.  I mean, I made a double today and it doesn't feel -- it doesn't hurt as much as it did perhaps last year.  I think that's the biggest change for me.  So I feel like you know, my score is not as much my feelings in the evenings anymore.  That helps I think.   
 Q.  Is it a boy or girl?  
ALEX NOREN: A girl, Iris.
