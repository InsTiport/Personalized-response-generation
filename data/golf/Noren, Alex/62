Q. 3 and 2 sounds quite easy, but it's never easy, is it?
ALEX NOREN: It's never easy.  I got off to a good start, which is nice.  Then I had some trouble around the greens.  Pretty tricky around here because the fringes are quite thick and the greens are rolling quite fast.  I was very lucky on 12, par-5.  I hit the hardest putt I ever hit that went in the hole, jumped up in the air.  Probably would have been a hard two-putt.  Won that hole.  It's nice to finish it off.
Q. So it's good to get momentum, isn't it?  The first win is really important moving into the next two.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, very important.  It's nice you've got three matches.  It's not as much gamble on the first match as usual.  It's like you say, you need that first win and see what happens from now on.
Q. You seem like a very calm character.  Match play, you enjoy it?  You enjoy the pressure?  You can deal with you all that?
ALEX NOREN: It's something I enjoy more with match play than more normal.  You are so into the shots.  You play against your opponent.  Maybe the pressure of making double or triple or quad goes out the window.  So you kind of just looking forward to do what you want to do instead of what you don't want to do.  So I think that's why we make more birdies and stuff in match play than normal.
