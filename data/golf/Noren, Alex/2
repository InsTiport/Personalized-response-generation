  Q. Alex, how would you assess your round?
 ALEX NOREN:   I mean, it's tricky out there.  I started -- I played pretty good on my first nine, the back nine.  Hit it pretty close there for a while, got some chances, and then just didn't drive it as good on the front nine, and it's so tricky.  Like coming up, especially like 8, 7, 9, like same with 18.  The bogeys I made, it's error from the tee.  It's tricky when you don't get into position.
 Q. Did it feel a little bit like a U.S. Open out there?
 ALEX NOREN:   Yeah, it's a lot -- it's the firmest and fastest I've ever played it, I think, yeah.  I mean, it's fun.  It's good.  It's just you've got to just hit the fairways, hit the greens, otherwise it's tricky.  But I mean, I'm all for it.  It's just -- it was 3, 4, 5 was crazy firm.  I don't know what's out there but it's drier than the rest almost.
