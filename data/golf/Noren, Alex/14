 Q.  Talk to us about the victory.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, happy to have a victory.  I played pretty bad yesterday and my only chance it to win the next two.  And I played a lot better today.   
 Q.  What is it about this golf course?  You always seem to play pretty well here.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I played it in college and I thought it was tricky then, and it's still tricky.  But I like the whole setting and I like the greens.  Yeah, it's a beautiful, fun golf course.   
 Q.  What did you play in college?  
ALEX NOREN: We played like two events here, I think.   
 Q.  When did you play it in college?  How did you do?  
ALEX NOREN: Two tournaments, I think.  And I didn't play great.  I thought it was tricky in stroke play.  You had to be a little bit more careful sometimes on the front nine, especially.  And so I don't think I had great results.   
 Q.  What did you find out there today that was different than yesterday?  
ALEX NOREN: Just maybe had a little different feel hitting the golf ball.  I tried to do a certain thing yesterday and didn't really work.  And went back to something I knew today and maybe work on a little bit straighter shots.
