Q. 68, that's a popular score today.  How pleased are you with the opening round?
ALEX NOREN: I'm pretty pleased.  I think the bunkers are shallower, but it's pretty tricky still.  You know, I played pretty well, a little bit of problems with my driver in the beginning, but overall, I'm very pleased with 4-under, yeah.
Q. A couple of stand out birdies on the back nine.  The 12th was particularly good and that chip-in on the bunker on 15, you must be pleased with those.
ALEX NOREN: The bunker on 15 came out perfect, and I was just -- it was not a very difficult bunker shot and one that all of a sudden, you get a feeling that you're going to do something good, and then it ended up that way.  So very happy with that, yeah.
Q. Has practice been a little more important this week with the fact the greens have changed completely since last year?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I came here on Monday, which I usually come here from Monday night and -- we've played it so many times.  You're so used to a course in one way, and they change it, it throws you off a little bit.  And shots that you normally wouldn't go for, you can go for now and vice versa.  So you need to spend a bit of time, yeah.
Q. First event on the new Rolex Series; it would be nice to do well in these events this year?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I think they are great.  We play great golf courses against great players.  It's good for the Tour, and we're definitely challenging over there and it's great.  I hope it's going as well as we hope, yeah.
