Q. There must be delight in the way you not only played but the way you finished.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I struggled off the tee.  I was always in the crowd, but I thought to myself, if I get it around, keep the putter good and there's a chance for tomorrow.  Obviously on 18, it was an amazing feeling because I thought it was a tough putt, and you can easily 3-putt that and come off with a sour taste in your mouth.  Now it feels great.  I've 3-putted those a lot of times, so sometimes you've got to get lucky.
Q. And you deserve the luck, because there was an awful lot of good, resilient play as well as the birdies today, wasn't there?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, resilient is a tough word.  What does that mean actually?
Q. That means that you dug deep from awkward situations, and that one where you're right on the edge of the bunker and still managed to find the green.
ALEX NOREN: When you're a little bit off here, it's like the crowd, you're among the crowd and this and this happens, and the first hole, had a ruling and it just felt like, yeah, a tough day.
And then the result doesn't really show the fighting that went on, and then yeah, got kind of a weird break on, what was it, the 12th hole by the bunker.  Managed to pull off a shot there.  If you f you've been in enough bunkers, you kind of know what to do in certain situations, and it went well, yeah.
Q. Looking at the leaderboard, it's easy to look to tomorrow?
ALEX NOREN: Well, it's not easy, but hopefully the weather stays all right and not too much rain.  But I know from experience, that it's not that easy to hold leads.  Anybody can come from behind and shoot 8-under.  You never know.  I'm just trying to work on the things I work on with my coach and with my caddie and if I manage to pull it off, I do, but otherwise, you know, you go on.
