 Q.  Happy with that, 4-under par?  
ALEX NOREN: Quite pleased.  We had a fun round out there and got some birdies in the end.  So yeah, good day.   
 Q.  What's happened with the game, is it a case of practice makes perfect?  
ALEX NOREN: I said last week, I changed home courses.  I'm not done with my home course but I changed to one without a driving range, so I played a lot more rounds and I tried to get a score out of a not-so-perfect swing maybe, and just trying to get it around with a decent score, and that's kind of what golf is about.   
I didn't really treat my golf like that before.  I was stuck on the driving range for hours and hours and forgot about the putting and the chipping and the scoring.   
So I've played a lot more rounds.  Maybe that helps, I don't know.  But obviously with one win, you get a lot more confidence.  I feel a lot more confident now than before this summer.   
 Q.  Do you feel you can win any week now on The European Tour, or in the world?  
ALEX NOREN: Well, I mean, I have a lot more confidence and I still think I need a few shots here and there that I'm not as good as some other players, and I'm working on that.  But a lot more confidence, and especially going into a week like this, I feel different than I did last time I was here, yeah.   
 Q.  What are those shots?  
ALEX NOREN: Today I tried to hit it longer and a little bit higher.  I've been hitting too low and try to get it in play.  It hasn't felt great with the driver.  The rest of the game is good but today I hit the driver a little longer and you can compete on really strong courses where you need a lot of drives, long courses.
