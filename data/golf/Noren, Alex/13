ALEX NOREN: It was a pretty good day, actually.  I played good.  Felt like it would be a low score.  Very tricky conditions.  I'm very pleased.  It's been a tough week so far, over the last few weeks.  And it's nice to get a good win.   
 Q.  Yeah, some birdies there.  You got off to a great start?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I was probably 6-under through the whole day, which I'm pleased with, especially when yesterday was rough and it feels better, even though maybe whatever happens, happens.  But I've got a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  Tell us about tomorrow.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I played Brooks two years ago and managed to win.  I know I can beat him, but he's a great player.  So I'm going to try my hardest.
