Q. You walked off with a 69.  Just give us your thoughts?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I'm happy about 69.  I struggled a little in the beginning.  I had some good chances and holed a few putts, but it's just overall decent, pretty good iron play.  Really happy about that, and better putting.
I just worked on my few missed tee shots -- it's pretty tricky around here, you have to hook it around those trees, and I got fortunate, stayed in-bounds, but there's pretty tricky shots around here with a lot of undulations.
Q. Another dropped shot on 17 but a perfect way to bounce back on 18, a great birdie opportunity to finish on this golf course?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I had a good lie in the rough sitting up, and I thought probably had a flyer, trying to hit over the grown and stayed on the green.  The greens are a little soft after the rain, so yeah, feels good.  Try to work on the long game a little bit.
Q. We spoke in the week obviously about winning this massive tournament last year.  How much pressure did you feel on that first tee today coming here as a defending champion?
ALEX NOREN: Not much pressure.  More excited to get a good round going, playing with two great players, a little bit more crowd.  It's just nice, and then maybe you try a little bit too hard on the game -- it was such a nice time last year, you just want to get somewhat close to that.
Q. With Rory and Lee in the group, must have been a fantastic atmosphere with the big galleries?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, and they are two such nice guys.  You can talk the whole way around and still be able to play.  It's nice, yeah.
