Q. You're the BMW PGA Champion 2017.
ALEX NOREN: Thank you very much.  It feels great to hear that.  It was a long wait, and I didn't believe it when I came off the course that it would stand, but it did, and very happy with that, yeah.
Q. You turned over a six-shot deficit I think at the Nedbank, a seven-shot here and your fifth win inside two years.  Things just going in the right direction.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, you get a lot of confidence from a win and you try to feed off that.  Today was my best putting day ever.  Maybe like the Nedbank last round.  Just happy it went my way.
Q. What was the highlight of the round for you today?  I'm guessing you're probably going to say 18.
ALEX NOREN: Well, the up-and-down on 15 helped a lot.  That was a tough one.  And then pulling off that eagle on 18, especially when I had trouble yesterday, it felt like I gave away two shots.  Today I started with birdie, birdie, and I thought, okay, I'm level now; I probably wouldn't have started birdie.
I'm so lucky to get those kind of breaks with the putts.  It not all skill.  It's a lot of luck.
Q. And this win leaves you in the Top-10 in the world, as well.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I feel like my game is going in the right direction the last two months, and had a little bit better results coming into this week.  That gives a lot of hope when you tee off in the mornings.  It was a very nice round today, yeah.
