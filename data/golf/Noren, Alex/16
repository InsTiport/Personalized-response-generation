Q. Only one way to finish a day like that.  Describe it for us.
ALEX NOREN: It's always easier to play when you don't -- when the guys have already done the job.  I mean, I was just trying to finish it off in a good way and we played good all day.
You know, Bryson played good all day.  I'm very happy.  I'm very happy about all the guys played and I'm very happy to be on this unbelievable team.
Q. As a rookie, your first Ryder Cup, describe the experience because watching from the outside it's incredible.  What's it like to be in there?
ALEX NOREN: It's hard to describe.  It's nothing like any other tournament.  I don't know what to say.  I mean, I almost cried after my win on the first day, and there's so many -- you want to perform for your teammates, everybody around you, and then just to get that first point on Friday was, you know, so pleasing and it was more pleasing than happiness.
