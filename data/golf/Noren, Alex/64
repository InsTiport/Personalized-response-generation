Q. 4-under, give us your thoughts on that round today?
ALEX NOREN: Well, I didn't really play that well on the front nine, and then I started to hit some better shots on the back nine, getting a little bit closer.  Ernie played really well the front and I was trying to keep up with him.  You know, really happy with the back nine.  Good chance, yeah.
Q. A little bit like that, a tail of two nines, the back nine is more forgiving than the front nine, isn't it?
ALEX NOREN: The front nine played a little easier today maybe with a different wind than usually.  And you have got holes like 3, a little bit easier.  You know, the tough ones, 5, 6 there is easier, and the back nine, like you said.
But then all of a sudden, you've got 15 playing really tough today.  I managed to play a lot better on the back nine, not just easier holes.
Q. What's it like when you come to the golf course and you know the golf course is vulnerable, and you've seen some low scores there in the morning.  How do you deal with that in the afternoon?
ALEX NOREN: Well, the rough I think is easier this year.  It's a little bit more trickier, but you've got a shot.  You can kind of muscle it out on towards the green, and before, you could get really screwed.
So I think when you have the rough a little bit easier, your mind-set is that you don't have to hit perfect drives.  You don't have to hit every fairway.  You still hit the greens, but it's really tricky to get close from the rough.
So you need to play well to shoot a low score, but it helps when you know that you don't have to play perfect, so you know to shoot maybe around par.
Q. Plan for tomorrow?
ALEX NOREN: Just keep like I did the back nine.  A little better drives, longer drives, so you're not too far behind Ernie or something.
