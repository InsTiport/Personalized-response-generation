Q. Talk about your round today.
ALEX NOREN: Pretty good off the tee and into the greens and just trying to hole a few more putts, but very happy overall.
Q. How did you find conditions in the afternoon?
ALEX NOREN: Well, pretty tricky, a little bit of wind there.  Off the tee a few tee shots get a lot harder, a few gets easier.  But when you play in the trees, the ball doesn't move as much when you have those approach shots, it's more off the tee that was more challenging.
Q. Can you feel the golf course getting a little firmer as the day goes along?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, yeah, definitely if you miss the fairway here and there it's very tough to get close from the rough, it's very bouncy when it lands, so you need to be on the fairway.  The fairways are getting a little firm as well, so you can club down on a few holes when it's downwind and but it plays very nice.
