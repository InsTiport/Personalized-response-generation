Q. Another week being defending champion.  How does it feel?
ALEX NOREN: It's great.  It's nice to be back at this competition.  But new course, and I'm going to play it later this afternoon and obviously the Pro-Am tomorrow.
Q. What's it mean to have your name on the list of champions this tournament has?
ALEX NOREN: It's wonderful to win any where but this tournament last year, you know, it was huge for me.  It was a very big win, and you know, it's always nice playing in Britain.  I've always loved it, even if it's in Scotland or England or Ireland, it's beautiful.  The crowd is nice and the fields are great.  It's great to be on that trophy, yeah.
Q. A good defence in Switzerland.  How does the game feel coming into this week?
ALEX NOREN: It feels good.  I had two weeks off.  I practiced quite hard for those two weeks and tried to get this end of the season, to end it well.  Yeah, so it's been good practice.  The weather has been all right back home, and we'll see how it goes.
Q. I know you haven't seen the course that much, but have you heard much about it?
ALEX NOREN: Having a look, I saw a few holes coming in, and it looks like fairways are quite wide, maybe not so wide over there but that looks really wide.  And the greens look pretty tricky, a lot of run-offs.  Yeah, I've heard so much.  I know it's hilly but I'm going to have a good look at it.
Q. All in all, looking forward to the week?
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, very much, and hope the weather is going to be nice.  Yeah, like I said, the crowds are always great.
