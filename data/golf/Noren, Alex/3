  Q. You started the week outside the Top-70 and moved your way in.  How proud are you of what you've done?
 ALEX NOREN:   I'm very proud.  Like I said, I hit enough good shots and I hit some bad shots, but that's what golf is all about, and I worked really hard on trying to forget the bad things and tried to kind of, you know, get a whole week together.  It was fun out there.  It's a little bit trickier today but got it together.
 Q. As you move on to Chicago, what is clicking so well in your game right now?
 ALEX NOREN:   I mean, I've been putting better.  I've been hitting, this week, the iron shots a little closer.  I've tried to work on -- get back on my fade.  I tried to hit it both ways the last couple years.  The draw has gotten better but the fade has gotten worse, so I seem to miss a few more greens every round, especially the long irons, 6-, 5-, 4-irons on the par 3s, especially.  I hit a lot more greens on the longer holes, and that makes the whole round so much easier than having to chip a couple extra times.
