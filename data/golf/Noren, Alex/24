ALEX NOREN: I started good and then it's tough.  I had a few kind of stupid bogeys up the middle.  Then I played very solid coming in.  I had a few more chances.  As soon as you get a chance, you think it's a miracle.  You are putting from so far all the time.  You are missing greens with wedges.  They put the pins so tricky here on 11.  It's a tough hole already, and then it's -- they put it -- it's so tough.  You just have to stay patient.   
I talked to some of the other guys, it's a mix between joy and fear.  And it's a tough one out there.   
 Q.  Some of the top players in the world have put up big numbers today.  To see that you were able to get through this test at 2 over par, that must feel good?  
ALEX NOREN: It feels good.  It doesn't sound very good, 2-over.  But on today I think I'm lying 13th.  With this much wind, a lot of shots get tougher.  It's hard on 7, 12, 11; it's just hard to hit the greens.   
We played yesterday but it was a little bit rainy and softer, and then all of a sudden if you hit good shots you can get close to pins.  Today it is totally different.
