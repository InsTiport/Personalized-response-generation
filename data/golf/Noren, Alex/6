 Q.  67 today. You had the only eagle on 18 so far today. Just one of two all week. How did you execute that?  
ALEX NOREN: Hit a good drive and then 4-iron into the middle of the green and then I hit a putt that would have run off the green if it didn't hit the hole. So a little bit lucky there but two good shots and a very hard putt, but it went in.   
 Q.  Coming off a good finish last week at the Waste Management Phoenix Open --  
ALEX NOREN: I didn't play last week.   
 Q.  You didn't play last week? Sorry about that.  
ALEX NOREN: The only thing you got wrong.   
 Q.  You had some hot play recently. What's been leading to that for you?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, a little bit iffy year last year and then maybe do things a little easier this year, a little bit less trying out new stuff and just trying to see what works on the course and go back to what worked, maybe, you know, the previous years. And kind of work on my whole game a little bit more, try to play a little bit more on the golf course and kind of making me relax a little bit. So I hope it continues and it feels pretty good, yeah.   
 Q.  You can relax here at Pebble Beach, right?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it's beautiful here. All three courses. First time I played the event.
