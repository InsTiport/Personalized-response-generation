 Q.  First thing's first.  You weren't feeling particularly well before you teed off.  
ALEX NOREN: I was just more low on energy than anything else.  Last night was not pretty in my bathroom, but then when I woke up, I felt better, but just couldn't eat anything.  It didn't really affect.  I am pretty happy with 2-under.  I wouldn't say it affected me that much, but it's just boring not being able to eat and you feel a bit low, yeah.   
 Q.  You say you're pretty happy with the 69.  How did you feel you played overall?  
ALEX NOREN: I think somewhat steady, a few bogeys in the end, but putted a little bit better.  Chipped very good a few times.  It's tough being out with Pieters.  He hits it -- I don't know how far he hits it, and stepping up after him, it's tough.  But I mean, I played okay, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow and the weekend.  So we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  You've been over in America playing on a lot of new venues.  Is it nice to be back on familiar territory?  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, and it plays very similar, except the rough is down on a few places.  So you could take maybe a little bit more aggressive lines off the tees and not worrying about the really heavy stuff.  It's still a tough golf course, don't get me wrong, but I think it plays very good now.  Because if you're in the rough and trying to hit the greens, it's tough to hit the greens from the rough.  At least you get a chance from just off the fairway.  Before it was pretty tough.
