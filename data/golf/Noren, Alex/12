 Q.  What are your thoughts about the crowds out there and the course in general?  
ALEX NOREN: It's beautiful, one of the most beautiful courses I've ever seen.  Tricky, fun, fun to watch for them.  Fun to play for us.  And the Irish crowd and Northern Irish crowd has always been good to me and they know what they're doing.   
 Q.  Obviously you were off quite early.  What do you do to prepare?  
ALEX NOREN: I just go through a few of the shots that I was struggling with today.  And just do my normal stuff, just trying to get a good feel for tomorrow.   
 Q.  It was a good, solid round.  Talk about 17 and 18.  
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, I mean, 18 is such a long putt.  17 I had a good look, misread that one.  18 I can't say much.  I'm happy with a 4 from outside of the green there.  But it would be nice, obviously.
