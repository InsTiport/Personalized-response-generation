Q. What a feeling it's gotta be for you to get into the semis.
PATRICIA SCHREMMER: Yeah.  Shock it is.  So I'm so tickled.
Q. So you were down early, then you fought back.  Tell us about these last few holes where you pulled ahead.
PATRICIA SCHREMMER: You know, I just decided -- all day I went on the first tee, I said, let's just not make mistakes, and I made a couple of putts.  I wasn't really comfortable starting out.  You know, get a little bit of the not-playing jitters.  The front's been a battle for me all week, so I said, if we can get through the front nine, and then yesterday when I came through, I thought of my poor playmate Christina, I'm like, all right, she made three there.  I like the back side.  It's a great match-play side because it's easy to get in trouble.  I was hoping I wouldn't be the one to make a mistake, so it went my way and got a little few good holes.  Started hitting it a little better, got some confidence.  My caddy kept me in the moment.
Q. Is he a local caddy?
PATRICIA SCHREMMER: He is.  Local caddy.
Q. And what's his name?
PATRICIA SCHREMMER: Adam.  Yeah.  And he's a graduate student here, but gosh, he's been like a Godsend, so I'm very lucky.
Q. And then one last question for you.  You're standing over this little chip here on 18.  What are the thoughts running through your head?  It looked kind of difficult.
PATRICIA SCHREMMER: It was.  I just wanted to make sure I got the ball clean through with the putt and didn't try to over-hit it.  Adam gave me a great line and said just think of the distance, hit it 18 feet and got lucky.
