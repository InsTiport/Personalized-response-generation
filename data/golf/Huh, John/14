 Q.   John, just came up a little short today.   Get some comments on your round as a whole.  
JOHN HUH:   Well, started great.   You know, I made the first birdie and come with the bogey on the 2nd but, you know, I told myself there's a little bit of golf left.   I tried to hang in there and I came back pretty good on the back and caught a little flyer on 17.   Put myself in the wrong spot.  
   
 Q.   Kind enough to give us some of your time after four days in Piedmont-Triad.   Tell me about this experience.   I know you're not where you want to be at the end of the tournament but played well this week.  
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, I did.   I played with Patrick the last two days.   I was trying to give a little pressure on the backside and I think I did well.   Little short on the last three holes, I think.  
   
 Q.   So great memories earlier in the week.   On Friday you shoot a 62.   What is it about this course where you're able to put up some good finishes?   You finished in the Top 20 last year as well.  
JOHN HUH:   This golf course requires ball striking and also on top of that you got to club well and I think that's why I put myself in a good spot this week.  
   
 Q.   When you have an event like this what does it do for the confidence and mental attitude moving forward?  
JOHN HUH:   Moving forward I haven't played that great this year so it's my first Top-5.   I'm going to gain a lot of confidence going into The Playoffs. I'll really looking forward to playing in The Playoffs.
