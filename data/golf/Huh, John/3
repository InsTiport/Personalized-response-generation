Q. John, what a terrific round.  5-under par, 66.  It seems it was all about the putter today.  Talk a little bit about that, just 24 putts is what you needed today?
JOHN HUH: Yeah, any time you putt under 30, I think it's a good round.  Especially I did 24 like you mentioned, that's the key that I was able to shoot 5-under par today, and hopefully after the next three days or so.
Q. Yeah, you've missed the last two cuts.  Talk a little bit about your preparation for this week and how you felt like you've turned it around?
JOHN HUH: It was more like the (Indiscernible) wasn't working the last two events I played.  And 24 putts, that really helped, so hopefully I do that again.
Q. Well, we hope you do too.  Terrific start to the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.
JOHN HUH: Thank you very much.
Q. Any specifics on the putting today?  You said it wasn't working the last few weeks?
JOHN HUH: No, it was just the same thing.  I just try to keep the speed right.  My caddie was working on making sure we match everything together.  I think I did pretty well today.
Q. Any sort of sign for you that this could be a good week?
JOHN HUH: It seems like I played pretty good this event every year.  So it's always good to have that kind of feeling going into the week.  I'm glad I started with a good round today.
