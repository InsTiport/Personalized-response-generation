 Q.  Nice start with a 9-under par for you, Jon.  How did it come together?  
JOHN HUH: I guess everything, with the driver from the tee shot to the green, and the plastic, everything was pretty good.  Always nice to have a bogey-free round and with nine birdies, it's always nice bringing.   
 Q.  You see a lot of red numbers out here.  How different is it from your average week on the PGA TOUR with all these low scores at TPC Summerlin?  
JOHN HUH: Well, it seems like if you pin yourself in position, I think you can score low.  If you don't, then you're going to struggle, but I was able to put myself in a good spot, and I just look forward to have a good next three days.   
 Q.  Is this a course that you have to be aggressive out of the gates or you just kind of have to let the round come to you?  
JOHN HUH: I guess a little bit of both.  You just gotta tell yourself when to push yourself and when not to.  I think I did a pretty good job today, and hopefully I can do it the next three days.   
 Q.  Nice round.  
JOHN HUH: Thank you.
