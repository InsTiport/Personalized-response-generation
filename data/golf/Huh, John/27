 Q.   63 on Sunday has gotta feel pretty good.   
JOHN HUH:   Yeah.   I mean I think that's the best score ever I have played on the PGA TOUR, especially on the last day, which is really good.   
No bogeys.   Bogey free, which makes it more greater.   
   
 Q.   What was the wind like out there?   It obviously didn't seem to affect you too much, but what were the conditions like?  
JOHN HUH:   The wind was a little factor, but it wasn't as much of a factor as the last, couple three days.   The winds are still over there, but cannot push.  
   
 Q.   How about 2012?   I mean you've had a pretty good start to your season on TOUR.   Just kind of talk about 2012, and did you feel this 63 coming?  
JOHN HUH:   No, actually I just had a really bad bogeys in the last three rounds.   So I was trying not to make bogey, and if I make bogey, it would be hard bogey.   I mean I'm sorry.   Kind of easy bogey, you know what I mean.   
So I had a couple of them today, but I guess I handled it pretty good to make par.
