 Q.   Probably not the ending you wanted but overall fantastic round.   Conditions were tough out there.   You have to be pleased.   
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, really pleased with the way I finished but not the way I was looking to finish my 18th hole.   But I really liked the way I played today and hopefully I can do this until Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you had an incredible rookie season, Rookie of the Year.   Coming in and seeing this course for the second time, does that help?   
JOHN HUH:   Absolutely.   It's really‑‑ you give yourself more time to spend more time on the greens instead of more laid out.   I think it's a little advantage of having played here last year, and hopefully I can take advantage tomorrow, too.   
   
 Q.   Obviously a great start today, a little bit of a slow start on the West Coast.   Was there any concern that you didn't start like you did last year?   
JOHN HUH:   You know, probably the good excuse would be changing equipment was a little‑‑ it was a hard time for me.   But it wasn't just the driver, it was the shaft, trying to find a good driver for me.   But I found it about Honda, starting that week, and I think that's where I got the game all together now and feel like I'm hitting pretty good shots.  
   
 Q.   How many clubs did you change?   
JOHN HUH:   I changed pretty much every club in my bag except utility club.  
   
 Q.   What worked for you today?   
JOHN HUH:   Well, my short game was pretty good.   I had two chip‑ins, one off the green and one from the bunker, so I was pretty pleased with the way I played today.
