Q.   Bit of a struggle compared to the first two days, wouldn't you say? 
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, obviously today was a little windier than the past two days we played.   It was playing a little tough, I thought, and I feel like it ended pretty good.

Q.   You got a bad break at 16.   I thought it just dropped way down in the rough. 
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, it was one of like the toughest lies you can imagine, and I tried to hit it as hard as I can and came up a little bit short.   But I gave myself a good chance to hit a bunker shot, and I got a good par there.

Q.   You talked about K.J. yesterday.   What about 18?   You came close to birdies on that hole three days in a row?
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, it was a little close, and I was telling my caddy it would be nice to finish with a birdie, but unfortunately, we didn't.

Q.   You are going to be chasing Tiger tomorrow.   You'll probably be in the second to last group.   You're smiling.   Are you excited about tomorrow? 
JOHN HUH:   Yes, I am.   I really like where I'm at.   It's easier for me to chase him.   I think it's easier for me mentally, so I'm going to go have fun out there and play my game.

Q.   Do you have a number you feel you have to shoot tomorrow, maybe 67, 68? 
JOHN HUH:   I guess to shoot 59 (laughing).   But it's not an easy course like that, but I've got to try my best and see what happens.
