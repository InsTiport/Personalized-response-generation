Q. New leader in the clubhouse.  Eight birdies today.  Only 24 putts.  What was going right for you today?
JOHN HUH: Like you mentioned, 24 putts always nice.  That was the key that I was able to -- make a few birdies.  Hopefully I can do it the next three days.
Q. Now you finished in three.  The one time you really played here in the last couple of years.  What is it about this course that you like so much?
JOHN HUH: I like this golf course, good tee shots and good second shots and giving you a good opportunity.  And I did that couple of years ago and I did really well today as well.  Hopefully I can do it the next three.
Q. Anything you're working on after today's round?
JOHN HUH: No, it's been -- I feel like I've been playing pretty good.  I just wasn't able to put everything together.  But today was the day where I was able to put together a good score.
Q. 112 in the FedExCup.  Getting close to the playoffs.  How is your day gearing up to make the playoffs and try to gain momentum in the next couple of weeks?
JOHN HUH: It's important to make the playoffs and be in the spot (indiscernible).  And I'm in a good spot and hopefully do really well next this one and the next upcoming.
Q. Quick turnaround.  Gotta be here tomorrow, relax tonight and put it behind you?
JOHN HUH: I got 7:30 tee time.  It's going to be a short night.  But I'm really looking forward to it and hopefully the weather stays nice and cool and hopefully do the same thing as what I did today.
