 Q.  You had a really good round going there most of the day.  A couple bogies late.  How would you access what happened?  
JOHN HUH: It was the same as the last two days we played.  The wind was a little on and off so it was playing little bit tough but I was able to get 6 birdies or 5 birdies or so so I can put myself in pretty good moving forward.   
 Q.  We're talking about today, about setting themselves up for tomorrow.  How do you feel about your position in trying to make a comeback on Sunday?  
JOHN HUH: Seems like I'm 4 shots back but it could change anytime soon.  You know, certainly I put myself in good position going into tomorrow.  Look forward to it and just got to play my own game and play good and see how it goes.   
 Q.  Is this a golf course that you feel like even if you're trailing by 4 shots you have a solid chance tomorrow, that there might not be that many low scores out there?  
JOHN HUH: I guess yes or no.  I guess if you play, you know -- I mean this is one of the toughest courses I think we're playing on Tour so I guess yes or no.  It's hard to say.  It's good to have a cushion, little more cushion, but the Snake Pit can bite you pretty good.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your chances?  
JOHN HUH: That, I don't know.  If I play like how I played today I think I have a pretty good chance as of now.
