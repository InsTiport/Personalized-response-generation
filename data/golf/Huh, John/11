Q.   John, very nice round of golf today.   Your thoughts on how you played in some pretty tough conditions?
JOHN HUH:   Well, overall I'm pretty pleased with how I played today.   It was pretty much what I did the last two days.   I hit a lot of greens to give myself a chance.   And that's what I did today and posted a good number.

Q.   How tough is the 18th hole?
JOHN HUH:   18th hole was probably one of the toughest holes I think I've ever played this year.   I hit a good tee shot and good second shot, just got a little bad break and kind of ended up in the toughest spot and got a bogey there.

Q.   How often did you check the leaderboard to see that name, John Huh moving up to the top?
JOHN HUH:   Pretty much every time I had a chance. 
I just love to know where I'm at so I can tell myself what I can do.   And that's what I'm going to do tomorrow, also.

Q.   Your thoughts on going into tomorrow.   There's a lot of guys who think they have a chance to win this thing. 
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, you know, I looked at the leaderboard and seems like a lot of good players in the mix.   So I look forward to playing good golf tomorrow.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, you know, as I said, you know, I played really good the first two rounds, and that's what I was trying to do. 
And this is my third round and I think I did pretty good my third round.

Q.   The 18th hole, as you look from the tee box, you see the beautiful lighthouse, it's a gorgeous hole.   But she's got some teeth to it.   Just how difficult is the 18th?
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, it was playing tough.   I hit a good drive.   And I hit about 200 yards and hit my rescue and hit over, missed in the wrong spot, but that's how it is.   I've got a little more ground to go tomorrow.
