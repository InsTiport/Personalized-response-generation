 Q.   You started off as a rookie making it to the TOUR Championship.   You're the only rookie going to East Lake in a couple weeks.   Talk about the year, the week and the fact you're heading to East Lake.   
JOHN HUH:   The fact I'm‑‑ I cannot believe right now since everybody is not in.   Once everybody is finished and I see the number, not the present number but the official number, I would probably say, good to go.   I would love to go there and compete with those 30 guys.   It's an unbelievable feeling right now.  
   
 Q.   How much was it on your mind when you came in this week?  
JOHN HUH:   It was a lot of pressure for me.   I was on the bubble, which is 26, 27, 29.   I know I've got to play decent over here in order to move on to the next tournament.   I think I handled it pretty good so far.  
   
 Q.   How about just the crowds, phenomenal crowds out here?   
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, it's nice to see those young guys, young kids come out and cheering for me or cheering for all the players.   It's nice to see that, and hopefully I can hear that next tournament.   
   
 Q.   Nice, solid round today.   Did you ever feel any pressure out there?   
JOHN HUH:   Definitely I did, yeah.   Yeah, starting the first hole, I was like, I know I've got to shoot under par at least to give myself a chance.   I started good, but made a bogey right after.   But we had a lot of golf left, and I grinded pretty well out there.   
   
 Q.   Did you ever take a peek at where you were?   
JOHN HUH:   Yeah, I did, yeah.   In a way it's better to know where you're at so you can watch yourself, if you can handle the pressure or not.   I think I handled the pressure pretty good.
