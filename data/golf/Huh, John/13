 Q.   Comment, 5‑under, 66, great way to come right out of the gate.   
JOHN HUH:   It's always good when you don't make a bogey, bogey‑free round, and make a clean score.   It was probably‑‑ I'm really pleased.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like the conditions were pretty benign, didn't look like there was a whole lot of wind.   How were the greens?  
JOHN HUH:   Greens were a little soft.   A little softer than last year.   Also you've got to make a putt.   
So I think I was able to do that today.   I'm really looking forward to playing tomorrow and the next few days.
