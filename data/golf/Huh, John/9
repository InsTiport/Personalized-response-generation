 Q.  What do you think that you captured in your game to produce these good numbers?  
JOHN HUH: This golf course requires hitting it in the short grass off the tee, so I think I did really good with that on the first three days.  So, hopefully I can do that the next -- final round.   
 Q.  Tomorrow I'm sure you've seen the forecast, how do you mentally prepare for something like that?  
JOHN HUH: Well, I'm not the only one that's going to play in that bad weather, so we're going to face it all the same circumstance, so hopefully pull a good shot and commit to it and see how it goes at the end.   
 Q.  Is the concentration ramped up even more when you have to battle elements like that?  
JOHN HUH: I think so.  A little bit.  But as I said, I'm not the only one that has to deal with it, so just going to go out and enjoy where I'm at right now.   
 Q.  Final thing, it looks hard enough as it is.  If it gets wet like it's supposed to do tomorrow, how much more difficult is it?  
JOHN HUH: It's going to be difficult.  So my plan A is try and keep it in the short grass.  So, if I can do that, I guess I can hit a good shot towards the pin, so hopefully I'll stick with the plan A.
