DUFFY WALDORF:  It was raining, then it kind of slowed down, then it was blowing again, so you've got to be ready to adjust to the conditions.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DUFFY WALDORF:  It makes them easier.  The greens are getting -- they were pretty tough the first ten holes, before the rain came.  Some were very firm.  Most of them were very fast.

With that warm sun, the good wind, they were getting fast and firm, and they were only going to get harder as the day went on.  I think the rain made the greens easier.  I don't know if it made the course play easier, but definitely the greens are easier.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DUFFY WALDORF:  Well, I think great for my retirement plan.

Tiger Woods, he doesn't worry about the cut, and I think that's one of the reasons he hasn't missed very many -- one, I guess, in his career.  It shows what an incredible talent he is, that his level of play is at such a high point, that a cut only occasionally becomes an issue for him.  A few times a year he's right around a cut, the rest of the time he's right up at the lead.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DUFFY WALDORF:  I feel glad I got through the day.  I feel I left some shots out there, but I'm overall pleased with my game and hope that I play well tomorrow, and Sunday get a little better score.
