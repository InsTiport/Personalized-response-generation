Q.
Duffy, still in the hunt on Sunday, got to be happy about that?
DUFFY WALDORF:  Well, yeah, I mean today was a tough day, as it usually is out here.  The greens showed -- the greens, the browns, whatever they were, were difficult.  There were some birdie opportunities.  I made some birdies.  It's just a matter of surviving some tough breaks and some tough shots, which is always a challenge out here.
Q.  In the beginning of the day did you think 6-under would keep you in the thick of things?
DUFFY WALDORF:  Well, it was hard to tell.  I actually thought I probably needed a better score because there was some good rounds out this morning.

When you get to the course and you see guys shoot 8-under and 6-under and 5-under, you think maybe there's good scores out there.  And I get out there and it's like those guys must have played well because it's playing pretty hard.

But that's kind of the way it is.  The course a lot of times will play a lot harder as the day goes on, and I think that's what happened today.
