DUFFY WALDORF:  Yeah, it was a nice move, and I started the day without doing much, 1-under on the front side and got a birdie on 10 and had a nice run in the middle of the backside, four birdies in a row.  I went from the middle of the pack and moved right into the Top-10, which is a nice way to finish.


Q.  Nice way to walk up 18 and see your name on there?

DUFFY WALDORF:  It's great to hear them on 16, 17 and 18 and be in contention.


Q.  How have the crowds been?

DUFFY WALDORF:  I think they've been a little quiet this year, a little subdued, for here.  I think they've got it just right where they want it.  I think they were overdone a few years ago, but now it's just right.  They calm down when it's time to play.  They yell and scream and give us time to hit our shots.


Q.  (Inaudible)?

DUFFY WALDORF:  It's nice just to play.  I started off slow this week with a 70 and kind of just got better throughout the week.  That's all you can ask for.  You want to keep getting better as the year goes on and each week you'd like to keep getting better, and that's what I did this week.


Q.  Was there any surprise with the good conditions that people weren't going as low?

DUFFY WALDORF:  I think pin placements make a difference.  They're kind of accessible today in the sense that you can kind of get to some of them, but they were tough putting.  I thought they were some of the toughest putting pins all week. 

The two par 3s were playing really tough today, one was 220 yards, the other 237, so there's some bogey holes out there, and that hurts the score card.


Q.  The changes in the course, do you think it had much effect throughout the week?

DUFFY WALDORF:  I think it affected the scores early in the week.  I think you saw the cut, even par, with pretty good conditions.  I think Saturday and Sunday the weather -- the course dried out really, and I think that made the course play kind of like it has, but it definitely played a little bit harder.  I definitely had to hit more club into all those holes.  You think over time that's going to make it play harder.


Q.  (Inaudible). 

DUFFY WALDORF:  The last ball I played with, my inspiration was the 16th hole.  I put a couple greens on there that said 16, and then I wrote down all the things on there that they might say, like, "Knock it in" or "Go Duff."  I put "Boo" on there, too.  I wrote four or five different things that I thought the fans on 16 might come up with.


Q.  Did they have anything for you unique today?

DUFFY WALDORF:  No, they just were nice.  They were chanting my name when I went there.  I had a good round going and got a birdie there.  And thereÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s nothing more exciting than making a birdie there.
