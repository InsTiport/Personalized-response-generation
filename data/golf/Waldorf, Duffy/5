  DUFFY WALDORF: It was a very good day for me, a lot of birdies.  I had a lot of good numbers today, full iron shots, and I was able to take advantage of knocking the ball close.  I didn't have a great putting day, but I had a -- made a good save.  And all in all, just really was good ball striking, and conditions were nice, and I was able to get a lot of short birdie putts, which I converted.Q. How different was the course playing today, as opposed to yesterday?DUFFY WALDORF: I think it's psychological.  It's a little bit different when you start cool and then work your way into the heat.  Felt like I had a lot more energy today.  I thought the course was set up a little harder.  There were a lot more front pins.  If you were not in good position or, God forbid, you were in the rough, it was tough to get the ball close.  It was tough to get the ball close from the fairway on a lot of them. The course was kind of set there for the taking a little bit, but the front pins can really punish you if you're a little off.
