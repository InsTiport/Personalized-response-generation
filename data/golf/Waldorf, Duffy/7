 Q.   1‑under today, how was the round?   Tell me a little bit about it.   
DUFFY WALDORF:   Well, it was an up‑and‑down round.   I got off kind of back and forth.   I bogeyed, I was kind of bogey/birdie kind of rounds.   
I feel like that's the way this course is.   You hit a good shot, you get a good birdie chance, you don't hit a good shot you get in trouble and it's hard to make par.   So for the most part I was on top of it.   I left a few out there, but I was happy with my overall play.   I left a few birdie putts I wish I had made.   I think adjusting to the greens is a real challenge this week.
