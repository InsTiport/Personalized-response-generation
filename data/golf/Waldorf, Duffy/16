  Q.  Two strong rounds to put yourself right at the top of the leaderboard going into the weekend.   
 DUFFY WALDORF:  Yeah, it was a nice day today.  I got off to a little bit of a slow start but I really picked it up on my second nine holes, which was the front side, and got it to 4-under par there, so that was a really nice way to finish and have another good round.   
  
  Q.  You just missed one at the last hole, too.   
 DUFFY WALDORF:  Well, you always want -- that was one of the more makable putts I had.  It's funny, I made a lot of good putts that were tough putts, and that one was probably one of the easiest putts I had.  I hit a good putt, it just didn't go in.   
  
  Q.  You're playing well going into the weekend.  Obviously you have to keep on stacking those birdies together.   
 DUFFY WALDORF:  Yeah, you feel like even though you've had a good start, 9-under par, you've still got to continue on.  You know 10-under par probably isn't going to win.
