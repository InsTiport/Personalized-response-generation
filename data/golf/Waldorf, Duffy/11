Q.   How do you feel about your round today?
DUFFY WALDORF:   My round today was another circus round.   I feel like I should be ‑‑ it might be time to pitch up the tents and move.   Because another four birdie, four bogey performance, after five birdies and six bogeys yesterday.   Showing potential to do great and potential to have disaster.   So I never know where it's going. 
Kind of a little bit the course, but mostly me.   I had a lot of opportunities that I missed and I really need to kind of clean up my act for tomorrow for sure. 

Q.   How did the rain today affect the course conditions out there?
DUFFY WALDORF:   Generally I think it made it a little friendlier.   We had only teed off when the rain came and I think that except for a bit of wind, the course played very nice throughout the day.   I think the rain probably made it a little bit easier.   But conditions were nice.   We had the nice dark sky and good playing conditions.   So I think the rain probably helped the scoring a little bit in the afternoon.

Q.   What do you think you're going to have to do tomorrow to put some pressure on the leaders?
DUFFY WALDORF:   Well, you got to go out and the leaders are a ways in front of me, so they're not too worried about me.   I obviously got to play my game, but to apply pressure I'm going to have to go out and shoot 3‑ or 4‑under par on the front and then see if I can do the same thing on the back.   I may need 3‑ or 4‑under on both sides, so got to be thinking 33s and 32s.
