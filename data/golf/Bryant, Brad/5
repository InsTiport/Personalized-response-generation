  Q. So overall how do you feel about your round today?  
 BRAD BRYANT: Well, right now I'm pretty disappointed because I bogeyed the last hole. But overall I think it was a good round. I played well.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 BRAD BRYANT: Well there weren't very many highlights. I just hit the ball really good, I didn't make a bogey until the last hole and then that bogey was a 3-putt. So I think that just really good steady golf I played today. I hit most of the greens. In this wind that will really be good.   
  
  Q. How do you think this round sets you up for the rest of the week?  
 BRAD BRYANT: I don't know, it's a long way for us old guys. We're used to playing three rounds, so really it's like that Sunday round, everybody's tired and everybody's been here for all week and this is a long week for us old guys.   
  
  Q. What effect did the wind have on you today?  
 BRAD BRYANT: Well, the wind is, managing the wind is the tough thing out there right now. Especially on the greens. The greens are so exposed to the wind that it's difficult to get still and you have three or four foot putts that the wind blows the ball around way too much.
