 Q.  Couple of thoughts on the weekend. 
 BRAD BRYANT:  Almost.  I played pretty good, but I just couldn't seem to putt it in.  And I hit a couple of shots just a little crooked when it really counted.  So but all in all it was a pretty good week. 

 Q.  You ended in the red though? 
 BRAD BRYANT:  Yeah, in the red. 

 Q.  Didn't look like you faced the wind like you faced for the first couple days? 
 BRAD BRYANT:  We had the wind figured out.  Had the wind stayed up high it would have been to my advantage.  But that's okay, it is what it is.
