  Q.  I am with the 2007 U.S. Senior Open champion, Brad Bryant, first thing that pops in your mind?   
 BRAD BRYANT:  Gosh, dreams do come true.  35 years ago standing on a practice putting green I dreamed about hitting that putt and winning the U.S. Open as a kid.   
 All you kids out there putting thinking sometime it might be for the U.S. Open, today it was, and miracles happen.   
  
  Q.  Let's talk about your ball striking.  30 out of 36 greens in phenomenal conditions.  What was the key for you, and talk about the starting first nine today.   
 BRAD BRYANT:  I hit the ball solidly all week, which in the wind is good.  I don't know why today was so different.  I got the ball close to the hole starting out today.  The front nine I think I had six good birdie putts and made four of them so that is just the way -- you get focused and hopefully the ball goes in the hole, and today it just happened to go in the hole.   
  
  Q.  Congratulations.  You are our champion.
