  Q. Is 67 today, what was the difference in your play from yesterday to today?  
 BRAD BRYANT: Everything. Yesterday -- actually I played today just like I played the first day and yesterday I just happened to make two 6s and a 7. I didn't play real badly all day long, I just had four just really horrible holes and that's kind of keeping me out of the lead of the tournament right now.   
  
  Q. What are the highlights of your round today?  
 BRAD BRYANT: I don't know that there were any great highlights, I just played solidly, like I did the first day. I hit some really good shots today. I made a 2 on the second hole. Which is always good. It's nice to get off to a good start.  
  
  Q. How do you make sure tomorrow you play like you did on Thursday and today?  
 BRAD BRYANT: I don't know. If I had that answer I wouldn't have shot 80 yesterday. So hopefully we'll just hit it in the fairways and on the greens.
