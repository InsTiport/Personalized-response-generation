 FULLAUDIOINTERVIEW

  
Q. Brad, now that obviously you won't be the defending champ,  
what's the last year been like being the poster child for this  
tournament?
 BRAD BRYANT: The poster child, that makes it sound like I have a disease or something. Good grief.
  
No, it was a great year, and they just were wonderful to me.  
Pete and his entire staff were just awesome the whole year to work  
with. And you know, there was a lot of sort of responsibility  
that I had with the press and with media, and Pete just -- he walked  
us right through it all. It was really great. 
  
And it's really sad to end on such a lousy note as I had today, but it  
was a great year. 
 
  
Q. What about The Broadmoor and the Colorado Springs embraced  
you? You had instant fan favorites around here. 
 BRAD BRYANT: The Broadmoor was unbelievable. The hospitality we had this week was second-to-none. The golf tournament, the golf course, it was just -- it was an outstanding week all the way around.
 I  
think they did a great job of setting up the golf course. It's  
so nice to walk out of your room and right to the range. It was  
just a spectacular week. Everyone did a wonderful job.
