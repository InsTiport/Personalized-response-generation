 Q.  Tough match just now; talk us through the ending there.  
CLARE CONNOLLY: Wow, the ending it all came down to not getting so -- what's the word?  I wanted to play like smart golf.  I tried to force a lot of things on the front nine, and it just was not working.  So went back to the roots and went back to smart golf.  If you don't have a shot, hit it out, try to get it up and down.  So back to the fundamentals.   
 Q.  You've played this course a number of times this week now; what do you need to succeed here?  
CLARE CONNOLLY: You definitely have to be able to lag putt.  With these several-tiered greens out here, you need to get -- if you're not on the correct tier, you have to be able to get it close.  That's the main thing.  Two-points or one-putts out here can get you a long way.   
 Q.  You're into the quarterfinals, that means you're exempt for next year.  What does all that mean to you at this stage?  
CLARE CONNOLLY: For being my first time here, I'm absolutely thrilled.  After playing in the Am a couple weeks ago and being one of the oldest, it feels good to have the shoe on the other foot, to say the least, so I'm very honored and I'm very excited, so got to keep it going.
