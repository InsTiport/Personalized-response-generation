Q.   Looked like you had a rough start to the round and then finished pretty strong.   Talk about how you did. 
ROB CORCORAN:   Yeah, you know, it's so funny you just get a little bit in this rough and it's almost instant double for me.   I mean, I don't really have the speed to get the club through the rough, and it puts me in an even worse position when I get close to the green.   I was struggling there to start the round but my playing partners were joking because I kind of caught a little fire on the back nine and I started making some good swings and making some birdies coming in.   But it was a terrific week. 

Q.   Talk about the experience.   Was this your first major? 
ROB CORCORAN:   This was my first major.   So first PGA TOUR experience.   It's unbelievable how good these guys are out here.   The golf course was set up so fair and I just‑‑ they are just extremely fun to watch for sure.   It was a great experience for myself just being able to watch them and know what I need to work on; go back and get back to the drawing board and hopefully get back again next year and be able to perform a little bit better.

Q.   You hope to qualify again? 
ROB CORCORAN:   Yeah, fortunately the Top‑20 gets us into the National Club Pro next year.   Give it a go at the Cricket Club and hopefully get in again.

Q.   What do you take from this?
ROB CORCORAN:   It's just a week of a lifetime.   Just to be able to share this with my parents.   There's been so many up‑and‑downs and missed cuts and missed putts over my career; just to be able to kind of reach the pinnacle of golf to come out and perform with these guys, it was just an extraordinary week.   It was a lot of fun.
