 Q. Looks like you're going to make the cut at 4-over. 
 JIM WOODWARD: It looks close, yeah, but this is good.

 Q. And this will be the fourth year in a row that you made the cut in this event. If you would talk about that success in this event and your round today. 
 JIM WOODWARD: It's always nice to make the cut as a club pro, but I wish one time I would play better the first two days than always be right on the border. 
 I guess I could be snake bit and say that and then I might shoot higher. But it's hard to come play a Major for your first tournament of the year. 
 I hit a lot of good shots and I hit some really dumb shots too. And that's just for not playing. But I'm happy. Don't get me wrong. If I get to play the weekend I'll be complete.
