  Q. Just overall your comments on your two days here.   
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, I'm happy with the way I played today, but I gave away way too many shots yesterday. I finished triple, bogey, bogey and shot 80. So I'm hoping the wind blows about 40 this afternoon that might give me a chance.   
  
  Q. Overall what has this experience been like for you?  
 JIM WOODWARD: If you ever get tired of playing Majors, there's something wrong with you. It's always a challenge, it's always hard, but it's always fun. I enjoy it.  
  
  Q. What were some of the highlights of your round today?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Highlights of the round today is I made a birdie on 16 instead of a triple. Enough said.
