  Q. You had a really nice set of holes 8 through 16 with four birdies. Tell us a little bit about that.   
 JIM WOODWARD: Well that was fun. Fun. I started like a dog and finished like a dog, but in the middle I looked like I was okay. So I guess that's all right.  
  
  Q. How does it feel to be playing on the weekend?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, it's always fun. It's always fun. It's always a pleasure to get to play a Major and to make the cut as a club pro is always what we're out here to do. And we want to play better than what I'm doing, but it is what it is.  
  
  Q. Do you think you're going to change anything for tomorrow?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Well, I'm going to try to keep it around par all day long instead of being like a yo-yo, how about that? I would like to be even, 1-under, 2-under all day long instead of 4-over, back to even and then 4-over.
