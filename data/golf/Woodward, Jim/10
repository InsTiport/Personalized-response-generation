  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 JIM WOODWARD: Well, I got off to such a horrendous start, I doubled 3 and doubled 5. So I guess if you're 5-over after five and you shoot 75 it's not too bad.   
 You just can't make bad swings, I'm still making about three or four real bad ones around. And that's killing me.  
  
  Q. How do you approach tomorrow?  
 JIM WOODWARD: With relief. That I'm done with this SOB.   
 (Laughter.)  
 Yeah, really. I mean I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have around where I don't make the mistakes and if not at least I'm finished with this beast.  
  
  Q. Is this the course playing any differently today?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, no, it's just hard. I mean just every shot. You just can't miss a shot. You miss a shot you're going to pay. And I missed too many.
