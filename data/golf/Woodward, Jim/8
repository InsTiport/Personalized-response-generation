 Q. Second PGA Championship, do you feel any more comfortable this time around starting off?
 JIM WOODWARD: Well, I think that's a good question. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. It's the first golf tournament I played this year, so I wouldn't go as far as to say that I feel overly comfortable, but I feel okay. A little anxious maybe. I didn't know where it was going to go. 

 Q. Pretty good round at 2-over?
 JIM WOODWARD: You know, yes, because I didn't hit it worth a lick. I drove it great and then hit my irons absolutely horrible. I don't know how many greens I hit, but it couldn't have been many. I feel good with a 72 today. 
 I hate bogeying 18, that's is stupid, but I was 30, 40, 50 feet from the pin all day long and 2-putted all day long. I'm okay with it. 

 Q. Anything different for tomorrow?
 JIM WOODWARD: I'm going to go to the range right now and try to get control of my irons. If I don't figure that out I don't know what the heck I'll shoot tomorrow.
