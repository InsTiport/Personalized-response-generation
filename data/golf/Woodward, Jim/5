 Q. Some comments on the course today? 
 JIM WOODWARD: How about soggy? I always hate it when we have these conditions, because we need to play the golf tournament and it was hard to find something that wasn't casual water. But everybody has got to play the same golf course. It's all right. 

 Q. Talk about your day a little bit. 
 JIM WOODWARD: Well, it was up-and-down. I had it under par a couple times and just made some stupid shots. I hit a bad shot on 15 in the water and made bogey there. And then I get up on 6 and hit a block right and make double there. 
 I made plenty of birdies, I just made too many other club pro mistakes. How about that answer? I just made some mental errors. I'm happy. I'm done with my round. At least I don't have to get up tomorrow at 6 in the morning.
