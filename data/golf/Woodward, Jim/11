 Q. How did you finish up today?
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, you don't want to go there. I played the ninth hole and I hit two perfect shots and I rolled it off the front of that green. I would like to blow that son of a bitch up back there. 
 How about 8? I birdied 8. I played okay today. I made too many mistakes today. 

 Q. How is the course playing?
 JIM WOODWARD: Hard. Hard. Hard. And I'm getting real tired of it already and I got two more days.

 Q. What do you have to do over the next couple days?
 JIM WOODWARD: Same thing you always do. Patience. You just got to be patient. 
 You're going to make bogeys. You can't help but make some bogeys. So you just got to get a few more birdies. 
 I made two birdies again today. That's all I made. And shoot, it's so hard. You just got to know that you're going to make bogeys.

 Q. How does it feel to make the cut?
 JIM WOODWARD: I came to do well. I wasn't worried about making the cut. To be honest with you I'm a little pissed being 6-over. I think I played better than that. 
 So maybe tomorrow or the next day I'll get back a little bit better. I would like to shoot under par on this son of a buck before I leave. Just once. I got two tries.
