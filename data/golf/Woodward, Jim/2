  Q. Obviously not the way you wanted to finish it off, but what do you take positive from this week?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, you know, I did play one really good solid round -- I played two good rounds, the first and the third.   
 Today was just a hard day, I just didn't get it going. I ran out of gas, I can, to be honest with you, I just got real tired.  
  
  Q. Did the heat or the wind play any factor?  
 JIM WOODWARD: I don't know. I think I just ran -- my legs got tired and I started hooking my driver and it seemed like every time I hit a bad shot it was horrible and when I hit a good shot they didn't turn out good either. It was a hard day.   
  
  Q. Are you going to set your sights on next year and try to get back?  
 JIM WOODWARD: Oh, yeah, we'll try to get back again and see if we can do it again. I don't know why I put myself through hell for four days, but we'll give it our best shot again next time.
