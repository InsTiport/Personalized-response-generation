Q.   Can you just tell me about your round today?
TOM BYRUM:   I played well.   I got off to a nice start, made a couple birdies early and then made a couple bogeys there on I believe 6 and 7 or 5 and 6. 
But rallied back and ended up 3â€‘under for the round. 

Q.   Did the weather delay affect you at all?
TOM BYRUM:   No, actually I played pretty well right after coming right out of the weather delay.   I felt really good. 
I was hitting it well and the greens were nice after the rain delay and just picked up right where we left off.   I was stroking it well all day and it just, I hung in there after the delay even.
