Q.   Your first official round out there.   How much different was the course and everything from when you played?
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   It wasn't too much different.   There was a little more rollout on the fairways and stuff, but otherwise the greens were pretty much the same, a little softer, but. 

Q.   On the front nine it looked like you just got on the wrong side of the hole a couple times. 
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   Yeah, I just had it on top of the hole the whole front nine kind of.   I had a lot of really good putts, they just didn't fall.

Q.   The back nine now, I didn't see 12, what happened there?
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   I hit it over and it plugged in the ‑‑ or I hit it in the ivy over the bunker and I took an unplayable and kind of chipped it out and then hit it on and just missed the putt. 

Q.   13?   I saw on TV you hit it close, but you didn't make it?
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   No, I was‑‑ that's where I was, I had that like, 5‑, 6‑footer for birdie and then I 3‑putted that one. 
I think those three holes in a row, 13, 14, 15, I 3‑putted them.

Q.   How do you feel about the way, obviously the scoring wasn't there and everything, but do you feel good about tomorrow?
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   Yeah, I was talking to my coach and I hit it well today and I found myself on the wrong side of the hole and got a couple bad breaks, but other than that I was pretty close to having a good round.

Q.   Did you notice at all you had people in your gallery you had a lot of people following you?
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE:   Yeah, that was pretty cool out there.
