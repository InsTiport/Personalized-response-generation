 Q.  What was it like playing in a match that went in waves emotionally?  
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE: I just couldn?t get anything going. I played well in the beginning and just left a couple of shots out there. I just gave too many holes away.   
 Q.  Would you do anything differently coming down the stretch?  
JORDAN NIEBRUGGE: On 15 I hit a good shot but it ended up going in the bunker and I just couldn?t get up and down. I missed a couple of putts coming in but it is what it is.
