  DOUG SNOAP:   Out of bounds on 2.   Got in my head apparently bit because I didn't play good the rest of the night.   I played very poorly the rest of the night also.   It was a bad swing.   It was a bad tee shot.   Just everything went bad from there.

Q.   Hit the rough? 
DOUG SNOAP:   Must have.   It shouldn't have been over there in the first place.   It was just a terrible shot.

Q.   You always say I shouldn't be over there, but nevertheless. 
DOUG SNOAP:   Right.

Q.   You were there, and you get a bad break. 
DOUG SNOAP:   Birdie on 18 in front of all those people.   I was hitting par on the front nine.   The back nine was apparently my highlight for today.   That was pretty cool.

Q.   I'll tell you what, you made a great par save at 12. 
DOUG SNOAP:   I did.   I did make a good par save on 12.   Thank you.

Q.   You looked like you were in the water.   You weren't quite there.   You hit it to two feet.   Fred and Tom are struggling to make par, to hit the green. 
DOUG SNOAP:   I hope I didn't get in their way or disturb their game.   I tried to keep pace and not show my anger.   I was trying to behave.

Q.   It's hard to do, isn't it? 
DOUG SNOAP:   It is when you're playing like that.

Q.   Like I said, tale of two nines.   How far was the putt at No.9? 
DOUG SNOAP:   I had about a‑‑ maybe a five‑footer, but it was right on the same line Freddy just made.   He didn't make it, but he rolled it down there so I could tell what the break was.

Q.   And what did you hit in there? 
DOUG SNOAP:   I hit a driver, 7 iron.

Q.   That was pretty good, and you birdied the par 5. 
DOUG SNOAP:   I did.   I hit it in there about a foot with my third shot.   So that was a well‑played hole. 
Yeah, the front nine was fun.   It was good golf.   I hit good shots.   I felt like I belonged.   But the back nine told me I probably don't belong, but I'm here anyway.

Q.   Still a thrill to play with two guys like that. 
DOUG SNOAP:   It was.   It was.   And I'm going to enjoy it tomorrow again no matter what I shoot.   So that's my deal.   I'm here, and you can't kick me out until I'm done.

Q.   You're not done yet.   Maybe if you shoot a decent round tomorrow, I mean, scores are starting to go up. 
DOUG SNOAP:   Are they?   I don't know what the scores are.   I'm in big trouble.

Q.   Yeah, that's true, but I'm sure you had a great time from the start. 
DOUG SNOAP:   I did.   It was excellent.

Q.   I thought it was kind of funny that Tom Watson shook your hand and said, hi, I'm Tom Watson, like you didn't know it was Tom Watson. 
DOUG SNOAP:   He did say it like that.   I said, I know who you are.

Q.   Right.   Who doesn't, right, if you're in golf.   Even people that aren't in golf.   But it was cute because that's the kind of person he is. 
DOUG SNOAP:   Right.

Q.   He's like, I'm just going to introduce myself.   He's certainly not going to introduce himself as somebody else. 
DOUG SNOAP:   They were both very nice, very gracious to play with.   I hope I was for them.

Q.   Thank you very much for your time. 
DOUG SNOAP:   Thank you.
