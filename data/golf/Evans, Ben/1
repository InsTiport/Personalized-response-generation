 Q.  A terrific round of 69 at Carnoustie, with two eagles on the back nine.  
BEN EVANS: I had short irons in and the pins are quite accessible, so gives you a chance of making some.   
 Q.  Two years ago you finished 20th, and 19th the past; you've had decent results.  What is it about this championship that brings some of the best golf out of you?  
BEN EVANS: I grew up on links courses.  My home course is a links course.  Just when I grew up, you kind of naturally learn how to play links and maybe I've got a bit of an advantage over some of the other guys.   
Yeah, I love it.  Links golf, we don't get to do it very often, and it's great.   
 Q.  Third in Denmark six weeks ago and fifth on The Challenge Tour last week.  Has something clicked in the game?  
BEN EVANS: Yeah, I've kind of had some swing changes.  I've changed coach and done a few things, which has made an immediate impact.  I'm playing a lot, lot better.   
 Q.  Your category has meant you've had a split schedule on the main Tour and The Challenge Tour.  Has that been difficult?  
BEN EVANS: It's just been busy the last few weeks.  It's kind of been difficult to obviously play well enough to earn enough money on the main Tour to keep a category out there.  But kind of since Denmark, I've tried to concentrate more on the main tour but then obviously last week, I finished fifth on The Challenge Tour, which played my way into China.  So I'm going to go to China on Monday.   
Doesn't matter where you play; if you play well, it sorts itself out.
