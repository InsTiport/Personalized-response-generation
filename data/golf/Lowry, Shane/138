  SHANE LOWRY:   Disappointing to bogey the last there, and I was thinking probably wanted to make birdie to try to get closer to Ian.   But yeah, I mean, I was 3â€‘over after eight the first day so to be in the position I'm in now quite nice.   
Hoping to get more golf in and we need more rounds; we need another two rounds to try and catch him, so hopefully the weather stays okay.  
   
 Q.   Take me through how you've adapted and how the course has changed since day one in the sunshine and then the wind is picking up, now playing it when it's sodden like this.   
SHANE LOWRY:   The ball is not going quite as far this morning.   The greens are a lot slower and you know, you get used to playing in different conditions now and you just adapt to it fairly quickly.   The main thing is really the ball not going quite as far, which hurt me a bit on the last.  
   
 Q.   A difference on the greens, as well?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Greens are a lot slower than Thursday.   They were quite fast and they are a couple of feet slower now.   They are fine.
