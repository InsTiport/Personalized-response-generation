Q.   Talk us through that finish, because that's lovely, isn't it, to be right at the top of the board?
SHANE LOWRY:   It is, obviously.   It's nice to be‑‑ well, me and Thomas are leading at the minute and to finish birdie, birdie was nice, especially after I played the back nine lovely a sloppy double on 9. 
I was good out there today.   I was mentally there, and, yeah, really enjoyed it.   Enjoyed the golf course.   It was tough, tough for the front nine with the rain and stuff.   But it was a nice back nine, and I managed to take advantage of it.

Q.   Nice to bounce back as soon as you did. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, that's what it's all about.   It's just forgetting about your mistakes and trying to get on with things.   So we did that well today.   I did it well after my mistakes yesterday, as well, so hopefully I can keep it going through the weekend.

Q.   Putter doing a good job? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, done okay.   My two mistakes were two 3‑putts, but other than that, it was pretty good again, and holed a nice one at the last, which it's good to be there and at the top of the leaderboard.

Q.   You've spoken about this before, but to dig it out of the cupboard, having done so well with it in the past, it's like a trusty old friend, isn't it. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Just hope it stays friends with me over the next two days. 

Q.   It's been a little while since you've been in this kind of position?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I just have to go out and keep doing what I'm doing, got my coach with me this week and so he's quite good to getting me ready to play no matter what situation I'm in.   Good out for a game with Thomas tomorrow and see how I get on.
