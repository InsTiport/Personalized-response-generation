Q. How was it?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was good.  I came out of the blocks very good.  I was 4-under through seven, and I missed a couple of chances, as well.  Made a bad bogey on 9, and bad bogey on -- bad 3-putt on 12.  But you know, I rallied back at the end.  I made a nice birdie on the par 5, 13th, and made a nice putt for birdie on 16.
So yeah, I'm pretty happy.  It's very breezy out there this afternoon.  I think we did get the good side of the draw, us lads on this side, because it didn't look too pleasant out there this morning.  But you take them when you get them.
Q. Going back to 16, the funny reaction to your putt, did you not expect that to go in?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, you know, we're up in Newcastle in the end of September, and the course is in fantastic condition, but I mean, it's hard to get the greens perfect.  They were a little bit bumpy this afternoon but you're going to have that when you've got 130 or 140 players and caddies walking around them.  That's just the way golf courses get chewed up.
Yeah, I was just hoping to 2-putt and managed to go in.
Q. Good par at 17.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, good par.  Decided to go for the green.  I thought if I laid up, it would be quite a hard wedge shot.  So I just went with driver, hit a bad drive into the crowd on the left and came out with a pretty poor -- if it had been anywhere else apart from the -- you know, on the wood chips, I think it would have been fine.  But yeah, it was nice to make par after that.
The 18th is a very tough finishing hole.  Great finishing hole with the grandstands.  They have done a great job here.  You know, it should be good fun come the weekend.
Q. Feeling good going into the weekend?
SHANE LOWRY: I feel good, yeah.  I'm playing good.  If the putts start to drop -- I feel like I'm putting quite well but I'm hitting the hole and they are kind of not going in.  I think if they start to drop at the weekend, I could do something.
