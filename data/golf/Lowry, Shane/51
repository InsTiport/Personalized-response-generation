 Q.  How pleasing was that finish at Valderrama, bearing in mind the conditions, and how much confidence do you take into the rest of the season?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, look, obviously it's my best week in a while, so I was very happy.  Disappointed I didn't put more pressure on Sergio coming down the stretch but played great and did all I could.   
Like I said, it was my best week in a while and I'm happy I moved up in The Race to Dubai and made sure I'm in the last three events.  I'm looking forward to the last three events and moving myself further up The Race to Dubai, as well.   
I haven't had that many events in Europe this year, and to be where I am in such a limited number of events I think is pretty good, as well.  I like these three weeks and I think I can make a move.  My golf is good and my confidence is high, so I just need to go out there and do the business.   
 Q.  You had a good week here last year, you went into the final day as joint leader and just didn't quite work out for you on Sunday?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I didn't play great on Sunday.  It was still a good week.  I was quite happy with it.  Obviously had a disappointing Sunday.  I like it around here.  A lovely place to come and play golf and the hotel we are staying in is amazing and everything about the place is perfect.   
 Q.  What is the course like?  
SHANE LOWRY: It's perfect.  It's the same as it was.  You know, as good as you can get, and the weather is perfect and everything about it is good.  I'm sure the scores will be quite low again this year.
