   SHANE LOWRY: I've been playing great all week, so, you know, just went out there and I knew there was a good score in me.   
 You know, I struggled early onto get it going, and I made a couple of bad mistakes early doors again today. Suppose I knew I was playing well enough, and I knew the last few holes were chances for me. Even if I don't hit decent tee shots, they are wedge holes and my wedge game is good enough to give me chances.   
 I played the last three holes absolutely perfect. I got a new 3-wood this week, which made me feel good this week, I hit a great 3-wood off the tee on the last and had a perfect yardage for me, right-to-left wind, it's ideal. I just said to Darren, I might as well go for it. We talked about laying up but it's a tough wedge shot in there, I said just go for it, see what happens.   
 Hit a great shot and managed to hole the putt. I don't think I've ever played as good. Even some people have commented on it, as well, so you know, I think that's definitely my card kept, so that worry is out of the way. So I can play worry-free golf now for the rest of the year and hopefully contend again. We spoke about going down 17 and 18, and I'm definitely a better player than I was 12 months ago, and I feel like if I can become a better player every year, there's only one way and that's up, and hopefully I keep improving. I'll work hard and see what results happen.   
 It's the best week of my career, so far. Definitely in this field and this golf course, I said to myself going out today, if I can finish under par for the tournament, I'll definitely finish in the Top-10 which will give me a nice, healthy cheque.   
 I went out and did that, albeit 4-under for the last three holes, but it was good.
