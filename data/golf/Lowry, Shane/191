 Q. Nice round of 66; happy?
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I am. You know-few sloppy shots towards the ends but a good up-and-down on 17 and a good up-and-down an 18. It's a nice way to finish the day.

 Q. You're just outside the Top-100 in the world so it's important now to start making a move in these big money events?
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm just outside the top hundred and the cutoff for the PGA is soon, as well, I need to get in there. I'm just going every day, taking it as one day, and see what happens. 

 Q. Now, also, you are the leading qualifier for The Open Championship, which is going to be very exciting and you have the defence of the 3 Irish Open coming up as well, so it's a happy period. 
 SHANE LOWRY: It is, I'm probably playing the best golf of my life, as well, which is great, so to be going into The Open to defend the Irish Open, it's going to be an exciting few weeks.

 Q. And your stablemate, Graeme McDowell after winning the U.S. Open, that must be inspirational for you, too?
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is, I know Graeme well, and what a win over there. It's hard to believe at times. I'm absolutely delighted for him.
