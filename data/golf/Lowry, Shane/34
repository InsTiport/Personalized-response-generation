Q. Thoughts on today and the last few days?
SHANE LOWRY: I suppose if you had told me at the start of the week I was going to shoot three rounds under par around here, I would have a chance to win.  Look, I'm obviously very happy with my week.  You know, I was lying probably 14th or 13th after round one.  Birdied 17 to make the cut, hopefully looking like I might have half a chance the way the back nine is playing, to sneak in a Top-10 which would be a great week and a great bit of confidence takeaway for me.
Honestly, I felt like I played great.  I felt like I was so in control the last three days.  Thursday was a bit of a write-off but the last three days have just felt great.
Q. Just in the context of your year, with the win in Abu Dhabi, you had this great chance to win The Heritage when you led from day one, finished top three, and this is kind of a nice fillip to add object to those two really good performances.
SHANE LOWRY: The year has gone along nicely so far.  There's a nice few World Ranking points, FedExCup points, Race to Dubai points there on offer today.  Yeah, it's going along nicely and I just have, like I said yesterday, I feel like I'm doing all the right things and I just keep doing what I'm doing and see where it leaves me in November and December.
Q. I don't think anybody is going to have better than three rounds in the 60s this week.  You've had three rounds in the 60s.  This is a serious test, as well.  You must be looking forward to serious tests like the U.S. Open coming up, which is going to be another difficult one?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I feel like a lot of toying with my equipment this year, I feel like I have my bag set up perfectly now, so I feel like I can just go out and play, and worry about what I'm doing on the golf course and like I drove the ball lovely the last few days, and I'm just looking forward.
To be honest, I haven't been home in Ireland since February, so we are going home next week.  I can't wait to get home.  I'm looking forward to a couple of weeks off, and playing in Canada and the U.S. Open.
Q. Was there anything in particular which flicked a switch after Thursday because clearly one bogey in the third round, one bogey in the second round, one bogey in the final round, that's extraordinary around here.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, to be honest, Friday morning, I was on the range and I was just hitting a few, and I just found a rhythm.  Just found it.  You know, it was great.  It felt good for the last couple of days, and it's funny, you just find something on the range and I just found it.  It was nothing to do with my swing.  It was just a time and a rhythm thing.  Yeah, it felt good.
Q. Can that stay for a while?
SHANE LOWRY: I don't know, if I can bottle it and bring it home -- but we know that won't happen, so we'll see.
Q. All parts of your game are good, and that's a nice spot to be?
SHANE LOWRY: I holed a couple of lovely par saves and to make that up-and-down on the last, but yeah, every part of my game feels really good at the minute.
Q. This all feeds into your confidence in general after what's been a lean couple of years, and that's probably one of the biggest things this week.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, exactly.  You take out my first round, but even at that, I probably wasn't going to be contending.  Brooks -- Dustin is giving him a run today.  But so far, hey, I was contending, close to the top of the leaderboard, is nice in tournaments like this.  It's nice to be out there late on a Sunday and especially around here.
I quite enjoyed today.  It's quite loud out there, but I just enjoy being out there and I enjoy kind of being in -- I felt like I was in the heat of the battle today, and that was really nice.
