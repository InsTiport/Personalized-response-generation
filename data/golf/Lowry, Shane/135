Q.   7‑under par for 16 holes suggests you played extremely well.   How would you say you played? 
SHANE LOWRY:   I played quite nicely today.   I picked off my birdies when I had chances.   Stephen played quite nicely as well but managed to get a couple up early on the par 5s.   Yeah, it was pretty good golf from the two of us really.

Q.   2‑up and seven to play, what's the mind‑set then?   Don't blow it or stay aggressive and get it done?
SHANE LOWRY:   You're just trying to make birdies.   2‑up with seven to play, and I think Stevie hit it into three feet the next hole, the par3, 3‑iron up the hill.   So it was a hole where I was thinking, just make par and get on with it and still be 2‑up and he made birdie. 
I made a great up‑and‑down on the next to keep myself 1‑up and I birdied 14, we parred 15 and had a nice birdie on 16.   When you're in that situation, you're just trying to make birdies.   The course is playing soft and the greens are nice, so you're going to need birdies to win holes.

Q.   Irish guys tell us they play a lot of match play in their youth.   Is that the case for you?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I did.   Most of our tournaments as amateurs are match play so I'll be well used to it.   This is only my third match‑play tournament as a pro, so trying to get back into the swing of things this week.
