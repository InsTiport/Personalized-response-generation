Q. Post-70 but you had to work hard for it today?
SHANE LOWRY: No, actually I didn't have to work that hard.  I played as good of golf as I've ever played today.  Just couldn't get the ball in the hole.  I don't know how many putts I had but I had a lot.  If I can hole a few putts tomorrow, you never know what can happen.
Q. Is it difficult sometimes when you're getting frustrated to keep the mental side going?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is.  Made bogey on 13 for that reason alone, having hit it in close all day.  Only managed to make a couple of birdies, and then ended up going for the flag on 13 and missing the green left, not getting up-and-down.
But you know, finished nicely.  Would have been nice to get one on the way in, but I'm only three back.  If I can shoot mid 60s tomorrow, I definitely can win this tournament.
Q. Three shots on this course, there's a lot of traps out there?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the thing is, there's not -- there's not too many bogeys out there.  There's not that many birdies either.  It's hard to make birdies because the greens, it's hard to hole putts on the greens.  They are very soft.  Obviously the rain we've had the last week and stuff like that.  So it's tough.
Q. Will it help the fact that you've recently won a tournament?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, listen, I'm playing on confidence.  I'm not going out there trying to do anything tomorrow.  I'm just going out there with a game plan and going to try and execute that.  I don't need to prove myself to anyone tomorrow.  I'm going out there, and like I said, I'm only three back from the lead.  If I can get off to a half-decent start, shoot 3- or 4-under on the front nine and give myself a chance on the back nine.
