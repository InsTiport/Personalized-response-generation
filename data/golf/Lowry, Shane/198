   Q. Shane, I went out to watch you on 1 to follow you there and somebody told me you had doubled 18. Then I see you wedge in from how many yards,97?   
 SHANE LOWRY: 65 yards. Good guess. I had a nice finish. I had a great par on 7 and kept me going and another great shot into 8 and missed that, but a chip-in on the last.   
  
  Q. From where on the last?  
 SHANE LOWRY: Just over the back. Hit a great second shot straight out of the rough and hit at the pin, back of the green and chipped in.   
  
  Q. What happened at 7?   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I hit my tee shot miles right, 3-wood short of the green and pitched to about 20 feet and holed it for par. So I holed a couple of putts today anyway. Still missed a few short ones but it's a little bit of an improvement from yesterday.   
 I'm playing well. I had a bad finish yesterday and I was disappointed but I knew I was playing well enough to shoot a good score today. And then the double on 18, I actually made a good double, up-and-down from 80 yards for double. I knew I was playing well enough. Just one bad tee shot there and the rest of the round, I actually played better yesterday. But I just holed a few putts today and hit a few -- obviously holed a couple of shots.  
  
  Q. Early-morning factor, being out on those greens.   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, they were good this morning. Although I hit a putt on the 8th, and God knows how it went left. But you know, they were not bad this morning.  
  
  Q. Take us through 18.   
 SHANE LOWRY: Hit my tee shot down and into the water on the left and had to take a drop 210 yards for my third shot, hit 4-iron into the water again.   
  
  Q. Are you feeling more comfortable with every round, every week out here?  
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, my game feels so comfortable now doing it. Now every time I tee it up, I feel like I'm going to make a lot of birdies which is what I'm doing. I had an eagle and six birdies today, five birdies yesterday.   
  
  Q. This is the sort of course where you need to make a lot of birdies, too.   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the scoring is good and hopefully over the weekend, I can keep it going and make a few more and see what happens.
