SHANE LOWRY: I don't think I had my best stuff out there today, but I got it around.  You know, it's nice.  It's nice to get off to a good start.  There's been a certain few weeks over the last while, I've struggled on Thursday.  To shoot a good score the first day, hopefully I can kick on from here now.
Q. Is it even nicer to shoot a good score when you say you didn't play your absolute best?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I don't feel like I drove the ball as well as I should have or could have.  I hit it close a couple of times out of the rough, which helps.  It's not easy out there.  I know it's not that windy but it's tricky.
Q. 4-under, first round, puts you right in the hunt?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm very happy.  Look, I'm going to have a nice -- don't tee off for another 24 hours.  Go back to the house and relax, take it easy the rest of the day and then get out there tomorrow and see what I can do.
Q. What was the most pleasing aspect of that round?
SHANE LOWRY: Just how I handled myself and how I scored really.  I don't think I played completely great today.  I missed quite a few fairways, but you know, the chances I did give myself, I took them.  That's nice.  That's nice to get off to a good start here.
I was feeling a little bit this morning, I was feeling quite anxious on the putting green before I went out but I was looking forward to getting out there, and obviously it's beautiful weather here in Lahinch, so it's nice, yeah.
Q. What has been the key to the success you've had in the last year since we last spoke?
SHANE LOWRY: Just maybe, like I said, I think I scored quite well today and that's what I've been doing.  I've been not getting too down on myself with bad shots, and just getting on with things.  You know, mentally I've been in a great place the last six or eight months.  I had it out there today and hopefully I have the rest of the week.
Q. Afternoon tee off time to look forward to?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I have 24-hours now, -ish,  between now and my next round.  So you know, I'll go back and relax this evening and get out there tomorrow and try and shoot as good a score as I can.
There have been certain weeks over the last while I shot myself in the foot the first round.  It was nice to get out there and shoot a good score.  I'm not going to lie; I was feeling a bit uneasy this morning, a bit anxious, wanting to get out there and get off to a decent start and I did, so I'm very happy right now.
Q. Just talk more about that.  Excitement, joy and coming back to play on home soil but with it comes expectation and commits on your side, as well?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it's very hard to describe it.  Over the years, I've tried to dampen it or tried to take expectation off myself, but it's just so hard.  Like I was on the putting green before out there this morning and I kind of couldn't wait to get going.  Sort of once I hit my first couple of shots, you're into your round and you're going down and the adrenaline is pulling you through.
Q. In terms of form heading into The Irish Open, though, this is about as good as it could be for you, couldn't it?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is.  Like I've been playing nicely over the last while and I'm very happy where my game is at at the minute.  You know, long may it continue.  But I've got three more rounds here.  Try and go out and shoot as best a score as I can tomorrow and see where it leaves me, and do the same Saturday and Sunday.
Q. Quick word about the fans.  It's brilliant out there.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I think tomorrow is going to be -- we were early this morning.  So there was huge crowds for how early we were teeing off and I think tomorrow is going to be mad out there.  But hopefully I can give them something to cheer for at the weekend, yeah.
