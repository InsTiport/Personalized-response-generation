 Q.   Essentially a terrific week?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it's a great week.   I think even with the golf I played today, I don't think I deserved to have a chance going there on the last to get into a playoff.   
But yeah, I suppose I look back and it was a decent week and I feel pretty good to be honest.   But that's golf, and Joost hung in there well and he made a great par on 17 and a great par on the last, and fair play to him.   He's a worthy winner.  
   
 Q.   I know you make your own luck in this game but you didn't seem to get the breaks out there.   
SHANE LOWRY:   I didn't hole much.   I think 9 was a big putt for me, four or five feet for birdie; to shoot level par on the front nine, as well‑‑ I would have had a spring in my step going to the 10th key.   Just kept missing on the wrong side and not giving myself birdie chances.   I'm a bit disappointed to be honest.  
   
 Q.   Is there a certain satisfaction, though, splashing out of the bunker, make being sure of a birdie at the last and not be in the group?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, there was a big group tied third.   Joost, if he left himself a 4‑footer and the way the greens were this afternoon, would have been tricky.   But he hit a great first putt, and I was just happy with birdie to finish second.   
Joost was very close to The Ryder Cup team.   He could easily be going to Gleneagles the way he's performed this year, but hopefully himself and myself will be on the next Ryder Cup Team.
