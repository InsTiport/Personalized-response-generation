  SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, a little bit frustrated out there.   I think I was fairly robbed on the last for birdie.   1‑under would have been a decent way to start but level par is not bad; when you're off late on Thursday, the greens were a bit iffy and bumpy and quite hard to hole putts on. 
Looking forward to getting out in the morning on some fresh greens and shooting a good score.

Q.   In terms of playing, what was it like? 
SHANE LOWRY:   The wind got up a little bit in the afternoon.   It was swirling out there a little bit.   It was tough in places and tough to judge the wind.   So yeah other than that, the greens were a little bit iffy.   They always get bumpy in the afternoon with a lot of traffic on them.   As I said, nice and fresh in the morning and hopefully I can hole a few.

Q.   Do you think it's going to be a low score? 
SHANE LOWRY:   No, I shot Mikko shot 7, and the next best 4‑under.   I think something in the early teens will do the business this week.   I mean, the rough is very juicy out there, and the fairways are quite tight. 
So yeah, I don't see anyone running away with a 20‑under or anything this week for sure.   But golf is a funny game, you never know.
