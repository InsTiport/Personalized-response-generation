Q. The back-to-back birdies on 7 and 8, obvious highlight but overall how do you assess that today?
SHANE LOWRY: Not very good.  To be honest, I don't -- it's not very good.  Severely disappointed.  What can you do.
Q. The conditions today, very different to the last two days.  Was that a factor?
SHANE LOWRY: No.  It was still pretty similar.  You know, 4-under scores out there.  I just didn't do it today.
Q. The last three days, what have you found the most challenging aspect of this course?
SHANE LOWRY: Just a difficult golf course.  Off the tee, second shots when you get out of position, are not easy.  It's quite a tricky golf course if you hit it out of position.
Q. Pretty frustrating day out there for you today?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, look, I'm disappointed it didn't happen.  Yeah, I just have to go out and try and shoot a good score tomorrow and see what happens.
Q. Was there a feeling after you got the two birdies just around the turn that things might turn in terms of the round?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, and then I made a very sloppy bogey on 9 but look, I don't even want to talk through my round.  I'm just disappointed and annoyed and I just want to get out of here to be honest.
Q. What's the feeling, what do you need to do for tomorrow personally, then?
SHANE LOWRY: I'm not doing anything this afternoon.  Whatever tomorrow brings, tomorrow will bring.  But after playing my way out of the tournament -- doesn't matter what I do tomorrow.  It's going to be a disappointing week.
