Q. Disappointing not to continue the winning run but you come up against a pretty good player.
SHANE LOWRY: I did.  I struggles early on but I fought back well.  I done what we talked about in the team room at the start of the week.  When you get down, you just keep trying to win holes.  I came back and missed a good chance to go back to all-square, which is a bit annoying, but he birdied 15 and 17 there to beat me.  So just one of those things, he didn't miss much and I didn't hole much and that's the way the match went.
Q. A lot of positives to take out of the week?
SHANE LOWRY: Definitely one of the best weeks of my career so far.  I really enjoyed every minute of it.  Lads have been great.  Darren has been great.  The team room has been just the best craic ever.  Just one of these weeks where you'll always remember it.
