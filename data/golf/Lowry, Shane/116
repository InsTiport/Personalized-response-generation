Q. Just give us your assessment of the round today.SHANE LOWRY: I suppose I played -- if anything, I feel like I played better yesterday.  I just managed to hole a few putts today.  That was key.  A couple of good par saves on the back nine.  Like I said, I rolled a few in from 10, 15, 20 feet. It was nice not to be grinding out there.  And just like yesterday, I played as good as I played all year.  I drove the ball long and straight.  I'd say I probably had nine or ten wedges into holes yesterday and didn't capitalize at all.  So it's nice to go out there and shoot a decent score.Q. Shane, you played well on a lot of tough courses this year.  Why do you think that is?  What part of your game helps on tough courses like this?SHANE LOWRY: If you look at my career so far, I tend to play well on tough courses, when we have a high winning score.  Every year around winter I tend to do okay.  I used to like it when we played at Valderrama.  When pars are good and you pick off a few birdies, I tend to like it. Out here it's all about driving the golf ball.  I feel like I'm driving the ball well at the minute.  I'm hitting it long and straight, and I just hope I can do that for another two days.Q. Have you had the pleasure of playing beside Jim Furyk at this stage in your career?SHANE LOWRY: I actually played a practice round with him at The Open, well, a few, five or six holes with him at The Open.  No, not yet.  Hopefully, I'll get out there in the last group tomorrow, and it will be a nice one.  Tick another one off the list, final group on a Saturday at WGC.  It's kind of nice.  I feel like my game is good enough to go out there and repeat this again.Q. How do you feel like the golf course is playing?  A lot of guys are talking about the course playing tough?SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it's playing tough.  If you hit it into the rough, it's very tough.  I hit it into the rough a couple of times coming in, and I got a couple of bad flyers, like on 18.  8-iron went about 190 or 200 yards or something. It's just tough.  You've just got to -- my game plan this week is I've left my 3-wood in my locker, and I put an extra wedge in because the greens are so firm.  I just plan to hit driver on every hole and hopefully give myself a few chances.
