 Q.  Shane, great day.  I know you were trying to win this championship, but that's a great Sunday and a huge move up the FedExCup points list.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is.  I think I more less got my card back.  I think I might have won the second tournament.  I don't know what golf Rory is playing today, but it was just incredible.  Yeah, very happy the way I played.  Give myself a great bit of confidence going into next week.   
 Q.  Your game has been trending in the right direction.  Big finish.  Next week the U.S. Open.  Got to have some confidence for the remainder of the season.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, definitely.  I've been happy the way my season has been going even before this week.  Just coming in here trying to get in the U.S. Open; I've got that, so it's been a good week and I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  Just some comments on the day.  Solid finish, but Rory is doing something special out there.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, I had a look back and seen he was 21 after 12.  I kind of thought, we're playing for second now.  Yeah, I just tried to go about my business and I played okay.  Managed to hole a few putts and (indiscernible) got myself in trouble, and I'm very happy with my result.   
 Q.  Give you some confidence going into next week?  
SHANE LOWRY: Oh, absolutely.  Tough golf course next week.  It's U.S. Open.  I'm excited to be going there, and, yeah, I'm playing okay, so I'm happy.   
 Q.  How do you assess the entire weekend as a whole?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it's been great.  Hamilton Golf & Country Club here has been great.  I stepped on the first tee on Tuesday morning when I went out to play and I loved it straightaway.   
Yeah, I've enjoyed my week here.  Like I said, looking forward to getting onto Pebble Beach now.
