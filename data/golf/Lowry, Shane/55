Q. What sort of a day was it?
SHANE LOWRY: It was good until -- I played four bad holes at the end there.  Yeah, I got a bit frustrated out there and let it get to me a little bit, but like you said, that was a nice putt on the last.  Would have been very disappointed to shoot over par.  Try to get out early in the morning.  I mean, the scoring is not hectic, is it.  Try to get out early in the morning and shoot a score and see what happens.
I made a few silly bogeys out there, which is what's been happening.  Just very frustrating because holed a few nice putts for birdie and felt like I was going along nice, and then you know, 3-putt at 15, which was very disappointing, because I had got a way with my tee shot and hit a good second shot.
But look, could be worse; could be better, obviously, and I'll give it a go tomorrow.
Q. Was there an element with the pace of the greens?
SHANE LOWRY: I struggled with them because I don't think they look as quick as they are and I just hit a lot of putts too hard.  That was a big thing.  I might have to hit a few putts now.  I feel like the putting green was possibly a fraction slower than the ones on the course, I'm not sure.
Q. Is it just important now to forget about the expectations in the first round, the fact that you've banked a level par 72 and you're only five off the lead and just get on with the next round?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I go back -- look, I always find it very hard to come straightaway, especially after bogeying the last and talk about my round.  I'll go back and sit there and relax for the evening, and I'm sure I'll go out tomorrow and give it my best, and hopefully that gives me a decent run at it on the weekend.
