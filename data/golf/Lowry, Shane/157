Q.   What's your verdict on this week? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was obviously a great week for me.   Played some of the‑‑ while I've been playing good golf for a while, managed to get the putter going this week and I shot some great scores, and looks like I'm going to fall one short of‑‑ maybe one or two short of winning the tournament.   But you can't really beat yourself up about that.   Still going to be a great week, and I'll get some good Race to Dubai points and World Ranking points, as well. 
It's going to be a tough evening this evening if I don't get into a playoff or if I don't win, but I'll keep myself up before I defend in Portugal.

Q.   You were flying once you pitched in at the 10; wonderful moment. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was, I was flying.   I chipped in on 10.   Didn't hit a great chip shot.   Just hit the flag and went in.   When you do stuff like that, you sort of start to think, maybe it's going to be my day. 
But a bit of bad‑‑ you know, the holes in were playing tough and it was going to be tough to play them in par, sloppy bogey on 15 was the costly one I think.   But can't complain really.

Q.   Across the week, lovely stuff and Carnoustie, live long the memory?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, four rounds in the 60s, 64 around Carnoustie, what more can I say.   I think my golf is as good as it's ever been, and if I keep doing what I'm doing and doing the right things, I can't see a win too far around the corner.
