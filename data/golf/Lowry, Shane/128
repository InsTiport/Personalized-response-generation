  SHANE LOWRY:   I mean, yeah, I played lovely today.   I mean, I didn't really putt a full round until 17 there.   It's just a tough hole and I just kind of got complacent and got ahead of myself.   And then when you hit it on the last there, you kind of needed to make birdie.   Hit a lovely chip and holed the putt, so it was nice.

Q.   Is it tough to play against a buddy of yours?
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yea, it is.   Graeme beat me two years ago in this, in the last 16.   I kind of owed him one.   I play a lot of practice rounds with Graeme.   To be honest, I don't beat him very often, so it was nice to get one over on him today. 

Q.   Your impressions of Harding Park? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Great golf course.   I arrived here on Saturday, and played here Sunday.   And it's a different golf course than when I played Sunday.   It's quite firm.   Playing firm and fast now and it's good.   I can only imagine what it's going to be like on the weekend.
