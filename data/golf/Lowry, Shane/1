  SHANE LOWRY: There's a lot of relief out there this morning. I knew I needed it when I went out, and I made a great par on 11, hit a great shot in. Like going back off at 7:30 this morning I had 230 to the hole and it was cold and the ball wasn't going very far and I hit a great 4âiron and twoâputted out, and then I made the stupidest bogey ever on 12. It was playing easy this morning, it was a perfect little 9âiron into the middle of the green and I pulled it over the back, but that's what that hole does to you. 
But yeah, I was happy. The chip on 14 was just incredible. It was one of those where I said to Bo, just chip this to 20 feet, and it just came out perfect. It kind of checked on top of the hill. There's probably not too many worse leaves on the golf course than there, so that was nice to do that. 
And then I fatted a wedge shot on 15 that stayed on the bank, so yeah, the golfing gods were kind of on my side this morning, so hopefully I can go out this afternoon and kind of shoot a decent number. At the end of the day the scoring is probably going to be good, but who knows where the pin positions are. Yeah, I'm just happy to be in for the weekend and happy to get two more rounds around here. 

Q. I know you wanted that one at 17, too. You had some real opportunities to maybe get a coupleââ 
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the one on 17 kind of felt like it would give me a little buffer going up 18 to play the hole freely and try and make another one. You've got a 20âfooter on the last and you're trying not to do nothing stupid, really, knock it four feet by or anything, so you're just trying to twoâputt that. 
I'm just happy to get two more rounds. Like I said to Bo walking up 17, you just want to get into the weekend. I want to get two more rounds here just to learn, just to keep learning how to play this place because I don't quite have it figured out yet. I'm going to get a few more chances to come back here. This weekend is all about learning for me, and hopefully I can shoot a couple of good scores along the way. 

Q. Tiger's reaction to your chipâin on 14 might be the most excited he was. 
SHANE LOWRY: Well, as I said, it's probably the second best chip I've ever seen on this course. His on 16 was a little better under the circumstances. That's what I said to him walking up 15. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Look, I got to play two rounds with my golfing idol the last couple of days around here. It's justââ like I said yesterday or Thursday, it was a bit of a surreal experience, great guy to play with and I loved every minute of it, and I'm happy I made the weekend, and I'm hoping to kick on now. 

Q. Do you expect more of an Augustaâlike golf course this weekend, today and tomorrow? 
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it's veryââ it's still quite cold and damp here. It's not drying out at all. But the course is in great shape, but who knows howââ I don't think you can get much drier. The greens are so soft. I was watching the golf yesterday morning, we thought there was some birdies, 11, 12, 13, I thought I'm going to be about 15 behind going out here this afternoon, and this golf course kind of ââ it can jump up and bite you when you think you have it by the scruff of the neck. You need to be cautious around here, but there is good scores out there, as well.
