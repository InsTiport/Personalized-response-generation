  Q. Disappointed?   
 SHANE LOWRY: You know, I was trying to go out and shoot 65, but I'll be okay, go get ready for next week.  
  
  Q. What is the biggest thing you've learned this week or these two days, a little more about yourself do you think?   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I wasn't really firing on all cylinders, so I didn't really learn much.   
 So I went for a couple of pins when I shouldn't have and stuff like that. But, that's life.   
  
  Q. A lot of attention media-wise, do you think once you get on to the tour that will all settle down?   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm looking forward to just being another player out there and just being able to get on with it.  
  
  Q. But if you play the way you would like to be playing, we'll still want to talk to you.   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, hopefully.  
  
  Q. Have you had a chance to keep up your physical work that you've done with Eric Miller that you were doing at Baltray?  
 SHANE LOWRY: I haven't been doing much, two weeks off after Wales and get back into it then.  
  
  Q. Is it possible to do that on Tour, working these routines?   
 SHANE LOWRY: It is easier to do it out here than playing amateur golf, because playing amateur golf, you're playing 36 holes a day and you go back to your room and you're shattered at the end of the evening.   
  
  Q. Have you entered for the Open?  
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm qualifying on Sunningdale on Monday. I'm just going to play it blind.
