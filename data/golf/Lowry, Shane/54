Q. How was it today?
SHANE LOWRY: It was lovely.  Weather's fantastic, very lucky.  Not much wind to content with.  It's a tricky golf course and it's very hard to hit it close and it's very hard to make birdies.  The greens are so good; if you give yourself chances, you can hole them, but it's very hard to get it inside 20 feet.
I'm happy with how I finished today.  I finished very badly yesterday so I was conscious of that and finished strong today.  A lot happier today than I was yesterday.
Q. Is this a challenge you embrace?
SHANE LOWRY: I enjoyed it out there today.  It's a fantastic golf course.  It tests all part of your game, and yeah, I felt like I played okay.  I felt like over two rounds, 2-under, I could be a couple better but I'm happy with that.
Q. Is tomorrow a patience game?
SHANE LOWRY: I think so because I don't think it's going to be low.  Scoring here, if I can shoot in the 60s tomorrow, I can have a great chance on Sunday.
Q. How satisfying a round was that?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was nice to finish with a birdie.  Felt like I played decent again today and I was quite frustrated when I finished yesterday, but I had a look at the scores after and made me realize it wasn't all that easy out there yesterday.
Just went out and tried to be patient today and managed to finish nice, which is good.
Q. You put yourself in a real position to challenge now?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm not sure what the winning score is going to be but I can't imagine it's going to be very low.  Not sure what the forecast is like for the weekend.  If there's any wind at all, it's going to be very difficult.  I have to go out tomorrow and do the same things, stay patient and try to take my chances when I get them.
Q. You alluded to early in the week, you feel like your game is very close to clicking?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, I think that's why I was so frustrated yesterday because I played so nicely and just had a smelly finish.  My game feels good and feel like all parts of it are quite good.  I've done most things well today, again.  I'm just looking forward to the afternoon off now and getting in tomorrow and see what I can do.
Q. Clearly when patience pays, that's a satisfying feeling because this is now a patient test?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, you play the golf course, especially in these conditions, and you think you should be, like you sort of can't understand how no one is 10-under, sort of thing.  It's just very tricky out there to get it close.  You get it inside 20 feet and there's a great chance because the greens are so good but it's very hard to get it inside 20 feet.  I'm happy how I played today.
