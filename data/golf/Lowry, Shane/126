Q.   Thoughts on that finish? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it's good.   It's been a month or two or a couple of months since I've had a chance to win.   So you know, it was nice, nice to go out there today and give myself a chance.   I felt like I played well.   I just didn't hole anything.   Nothing happened for me. 
    For me the big thing about the week is putting myself in contention again.   The massive thing is three rounds in a row without a bogey is pretty good, especially the way I play golf. 
    I was quite in control of myself and my game all week‑‑ well, apart from Thursday, or since Friday.   It's nice just to be back at the top of the leaderboard, and seeing your name up there is always nice.   It would have been really nice to hole that at the last but that's the way the day kind of went. 
    Happy, really looking forward to The Irish Open next week.   Going in with a little bit of form, which is nice and hopefully I can do something special up there.

Q.   A special place to go, Royal County Down? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   I've only played Royal County Down a few times, but it's a nice golf course and nice place.   It's my home tournament, so I'm going there and I really want to win.

Q.   Same coastline as Baltray?
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, not far, only an hour up the road.   You never know.   You never know.
