Q. A good start with a birdie on your third hole and then nine pars in a row.  Was it a question of having to stay patient today?
SHANE LOWRY: It was quite a frustrating day.  I felt like I was playing okay, really struggled with the greens out there, struggled with the pace, struggled to get the ball online.  It wasn't easy, but I kept fighting, kept going, stayed patient.  Made a couple birdies towards the end.  Made a bad bogey on 6.  Other than that, I'm pretty happy where I am going into the weekend.
Q. Do you think the greens were the main difference between today and yesterday?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I think I could have easily shot 65 today without doing anything too spectacular.
The greens are a bit tricky.  There's a bit of a knock on them, especially when they're wet.  Really, really pushes the ball either left or right where you are going to cross.  It's quite tough to read the putts.  Just something that I'm going to have to deal with for the weekend and just hopefully I keep playing good golf.
Q. Going out late tomorrow, there will be another set of conditions for you to to try to contend with then as well, won't there?
SHANE LOWRY: I believe a little bit of wind the weekend, so I'm not too play pleased to hear that.  I'm looking forward to getting out there, hopefully no one goes too far away from me this afternoon and I can give it a go this weekend.
Q. Having not played much since your win in America, it must be nice to be in contention?
SHANE LOWRY: It is, yeah.  I felt a little bit rusty the first couple of rounds last week, but played well in the weekend.  Obviously the last couple of days have went well.  I made two bogey in my last four competitive rounds, which is nice.  I just need to keep that going and keep plugging away.
