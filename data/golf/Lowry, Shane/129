 Q.   Shane, obviously a difficult day.  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was tough.   You know, didn't really mind it.   You know, I don't mind it like this, and played nicely and just felt like I really deserved that putt on the last.   One‑over is probably the worst part of it that I shot today, but yeah, it was tough out there.   But that's what it's going to be like all week.   It's not going to take many under par to win this tournament.  
   
 Q.   You obviously feel like you left quite a few out there.  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, you know, I think I definitely deserved to shoot level or under par today.   You know, had 1‑under before play and made a very bad double on 15 and then missed a short putt on 16.   You know, like I said, I feel like I really deserved that one on the last.  
   
 Q.   Generally, though, how would you sort of sum up your game, this week, last week at Wentworth as well?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it's good.   I mean I love these conditions.   To be able to compete, I know I can compete in these conditions.   So yeah, you know, my game is good.   I was in control out there today.   I didn't really hit many bad shots.   
Yeah, if I can just hole a few putts.   I struggled to read the greens, actually hit a lot of putts, missed quite a bit, and they weren't necessarily bad putts, but hopefully I'll get it right tomorrow.
