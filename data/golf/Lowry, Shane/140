Q.   65 today, what are your thoughts on that performance? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I'm pretty happy.   I've never, ever done well here before.   So to be leading after two rounds, looks like I'm going to be leading after two rounds, is nice.   Still a long way to go in the tournament but I'm really looking forward to the weekend.

Q.   You made that look easy.   You seemed to have it on a string; was it like that the whole way around?
SHANE LOWRY:   Felt like it today.   I didn't drive it that good yesterday but still shot a decent score.   Drove it a lot better today, drove it a lot straighter and gave myself a lot of chances and rolled in a few putts, so it was nice.

Q.   You've been playing very consistent for the last six or seven weeks, so it's probably not much of a surprise that you're in this position?
SHANE LOWRY:   I felt like coming over, I could give it a go this week.   I was around 10th going into the back nine on Sunday last week, and similar the week before in Switzerland. 
So if I can get myself in a good position come the back nine this weekend, again, hopefully I can give it a go. 

Q.   Do you set a target for the weekend or is it the old one shot at a time?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, aim old clichÃ©s.   I'm just going to go out and keep doing what I'm doing.   Just standing up, hitting my driver and finding it again.   That's the way I play golf and that's what I'm going to do this weekend.
