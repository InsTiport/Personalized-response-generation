 Q.  Back in Turkey, how much are you looking forward to this week  
 Shane Lowry. Its nice to be here. Its definitely one of those weeks where its a really nice week. Lovely weather, lovely golf course, great hotel. I know a few guys and I have my families here, so its a chilled week, but theres a lot of business to take care of as well. Im looking forward to getting out there.   
 Q.  Hows the game feeling coming into this week?  
SHANE LOWRY: It was average enough last week. I played alright in parts. Ive been playing alright. I had a decent week in Japan the week before  Wentworth and Dunhill was okay. Im going to give it everything I can over this week and try and win the Race to Dubai  see how high I can finish up there. Ill go out and give it my best and see where it leaves me.   
 Q.  What does it mean to win a Rolex Series event?  
SHANE LOWRY: On the European Tour they are our biggest events. To start the year with a win in Abu Dhabi at a Rolex Series event was huge  that gave me the confidence going forward. Outside of a Major, as a European Tour player it probably doesnt get much bigger. There are WGCs as well, but Rolex Series events are definitely up there.   
 Q.  Does having the chance to win the Race to Dubai play on your mind?  
SHANE LOWRY: For me, I think it would be the icing on the cake. Im going to give it my best shot but if I dont win it, I wont be too disappointed. Ive had a decent year and Id be pretty happy with what Ive got at Christmas. Its my main goal over the next few weeks to perform as best as I can and go to the final 18 holes in Dubai, it would be lovely to have a chance to win the Race to Dubai. To be European Number One would be really special and would add to the year Ive had.   
 Q.  What are your memories of this course?  
SHANE LOWRY: I remember scoring being good  theres a lot of birdie chances out there. Its just keeping bogeys off the card and taking your chances when you get them. If you play the par fives well you have a chance of shooting a good score, a lot will be won and lost on the par fives this week.
