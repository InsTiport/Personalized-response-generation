  SHANE LOWRY:   I think I was in more bunkers‑‑ like I was in the desert today.   Better than in the water.   But get off to a shaky enough start, but‑‑ was quite pleased.   Yesterday afternoon‑‑ just did a little bit of bunker play and seemed to work today. 
Yeah, kept me in it and played nicely in the end.   I did miss a 5‑footer on 7 for birdie and hit two great shots into 8, made eagle‑‑ you just don't want to hit it in the water and make double.   If you hit in the water you're making at least double.   It's a brutal hole. 
1‑under is a good start.   What did he shoot‑‑

Q.   62.   10‑under? 
SHANE LOWRY:   10‑under?   You're joking.   That's the best score I've ever seen.   Like, fair enough, if you hit it well off the tee, there's birdies out there, but not ten, not in my book, anyway. 

Q.   Playing a different course‑‑
SHANE LOWRY:   Was he walking off after 15 or something?     (Laughter)   yeah, listen, I'm happy with my start.   I'm up there and just hope he doesn't shoot another 10‑under tomorrow. 

Q.   Your approach on 8? 
SHANE LOWRY:   218 front, 233 flag, it was into the wind, had a perfect 5‑wood so just hit a lovely shot.   Hit it straight on line to the left flag and hit it about ten feet, managed to hole it. 
I was thinking going up there, if I can make birdie and par the last.
