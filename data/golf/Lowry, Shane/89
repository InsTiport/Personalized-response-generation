 Q.  Talk about the week and what you saw here today.  
SHANE LOWRY: It's unbelievable the difference.  There still aren't too many guys under par.  I think if you hit it in the fairway, you could hit greens easier.  They're not as firm and as fast so it's definitely made it easier for us.  Obviously the rough is a lot juicier so you really need to keep the ball in the short stuff.  It's been an interesting day so far.  Happy that they've called it and we get to go back and have a little rest and get back out there tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  What were you told during the delays, especially the first one when you weren't given a chance to warm up?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was a shame.  I mean, we were out in cover beside the 7th tee.  It wasn't many seats available.  We were standing there for like well over an hour.  And it wasn't ideal, but I went back out there, I felt okay.  I kind of normally don't need to warm up that much, which is good for me, but imagine some of the older guys were might have been feeling it.  That was fine.  That's what the USGA had to do to get as much golf as they could in today.   
 Q.  Thank you, Shane.  
SHANE LOWRY: See you tomorrow.
