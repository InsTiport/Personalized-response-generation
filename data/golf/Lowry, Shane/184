  SHANE LOWRY:   Obviously birdieing the first, get off to a nice start, that was nice to birdie the first and then disastrous second, doubled the second.   You know, just said to myself, there's plenty of birdies out there and then in a way, it's not too bad doing something like that early on in the round because there's always a chance to get back.   
Yeah, just played some good golf, and holed some nice putts.   Putting was kind of the main key for me today.   I holed a lot of sort of 8‑footers, 10‑footers for birdies, but I was hitting it close, as well.   Made a great par on 14 which was key.   I think I was 4‑under at the time, short hole, wedge in my hand, missed the green right, very difficult up‑and‑down, and I played a great shot.   Holed about an 8‑footer for a par, which kept the momentum going.  
Then birdied the last two, which is nice, as well.   So all in all, very happy.  
   
 Q.   You said that double early on; does that just make you not knuckle down that bit more?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was just kind of one of those things, you have to deal with it, nothing you can do about it.   Mentally I was very good today, as well, which is always nice.   
I knew the golf course was playing easy, so to get off to a start like that is quite difficult to say, and then you look up and see Francesco 10‑under, it's like, okay, I need to make a few birdies, but I did manage to make a few birdies luckily enough.   
The golf course is very generous off the tee and if you hit it in the right position off the tee, it's not necessarily hitting the fairway but hitting in the right position.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel the score has been coming?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, definitely.   I think I had 27 putts today, which is the lowest I've had for two or three months and that was the key to my good score today.   
   
 Q.   And that means the confidence has been decent?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, confidence has been decent.   My golf for a long time has been probably as good as it's ever been over the last few months.   Just haven't been getting the scores I feel like I deserve, so I think I deserved this one, anyway.
