   SHANE LOWRY: I made a few silly mistakes going at pins and that's what you have to do on Sunday when you're that far back to try and win, and that's what I was trying to do. I didn't come here to Top-10, I was going out there to try and win. I just went for a few pins and missed them in the wrong spots and made bogeys, but that's the way things go.   
  
  Q. Good spot to be, Killarney; do you like the Irish Open back here?  
 SHANE LOWRY: It's been a great week. You can just see going down to 18, doesn't get much better than this. It was great.   
  
  Q. Walking up 18, you walked up some pretty impressive 18 fairways in the last couple of weeks, obviously St. Andrews is special, how would you compare that with home crowd?   
 SHANE LOWRY: It's a bit of a chill going up 18. It was a great group going up 18 and holing that putt on the last, as well just put the icing on the cake, maybe 15 feet.   
  
  Q. Equal to St. Andrews?   
 SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, yeah, I would say so.   
  
  Q. When do you get to Whistling Straits?   
 SHANE LOWRY: I'm going over and flying out of Dublin next Sunday morning. So I'll get there Sunday night and I'll be playing on Monday.  
  
  Q. Know much about it?  
 SHANE LOWRY: I remember it's a really linksy feel. I'm just going to have to go out and take a five days off and work towards that for next weekend.   
 I just can't wait to get out there. Really looking forward to it. I think the way things are going in my life and my career, I feel it's just to be going and playing in these tournaments. I can't wait to get out there.
