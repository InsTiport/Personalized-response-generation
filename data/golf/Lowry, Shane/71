Q. What's your take on a lovely round of golf today?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I played good.  I mean, I've been playing good all week.  The first day I shot 2-over but I played nicely and I didn't hole anything.  With six holes to go yesterday, I was still 2-over for the tournament, and I got Dermot, my caddie, reading the greens.  I'm 11-under since.  He's done all right.
If I can go out and shoot a decent score tomorrow, it would be a nice week.  Yeah, I'm pretty happen.
Q. Sounds like it's something you thought about.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I was just struggling to pick lines and just struggling to hit good putts.  I just felt if I had a bit of knowledge and information, I would do a little bit better.  It's worked so far, so hopefully keep going.
Q. Did it work immediately?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, first one, I actually just missed but I hit a good putt.  Then holed a good one on the next.  I've holed probably four putts outside 25 feet.  It's been pretty good.
Q. Do you find that you're trusting him that much more?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it's just easier to trust the read and just try and pick a good pace and hit a good putt.  It's been nice.
But look, my long game has been great all week.  I've been pretty happy with that.  I'm looking forward to getting out there tomorrow and hopefully I can shoot another decent score.
Q. In terms of today's round, was it bogey at the first?
SHANE LOWRY: They always say, some of your best rounds start with a bogey.  I made a pretty sloppy bogey on the first, but from there on in, it was pretty flawless, I was happy.
Q. From 2-over, which is well down the bottom, you can look at that top of the board now, can't you.
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, Hideki I think is 15 now, so I'm still quite a way behind, but if we can get a bit of wind tomorrow, like it's been the last couple of days, might shoot something in the mid 60s again, you never know.
