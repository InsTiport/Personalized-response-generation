 Q.  You've won here in Abu Dhabi and also become the latest Rolex Series Event winner?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, obviously it's great to have a Rolex Series beside had my name now.  I get the gold bib and get the star there.   
You know, I think, we're very lucky to be able to play such big events on The European Tour and Rolex have done a great job.  All the players, I can vouch for them and say we're very grateful to be playing for the types of money we are in the events we're playing in.  So yeah, I'm just over the moon to have won.   
 Q.  A battle out there today but the caddie gets a gold bib for the rest of the season which is fantastic, as well.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is.  You see them and you're kind of envious of the other caddies with their gold bibs and you want one yourself.  My caddie has only been working for me for a few months.  It's a great to our career and I'm very happy.
