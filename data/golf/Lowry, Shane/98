 Q. (No Microphone.)  
SHANE LOWRY: I just stood up and I've been hitting good shots most of the day and hitting my targets also, so it was a fairly easy shot, I felt and I just hit a perfect shot in right at the flag and obviously needed luck to go in the hole. But, yeah, I felt like definitely a little bit of luck and feeling that I wasn't doing better on the front so I'm fairly happy and I'll put that picture up in my house and it will be a nice memento to have.  
   
 Q. When you picked the ball out of the hole you kind of did a fake throw to the crowd and then pocketed the ball.   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, yeah, that will definitely go in a frame somewhere in the house.  
   
 Q. From the point of view of the week, it started so well, four birdies in the first five holes, the first round 68. You got a feeling for what it was like to be in contention in the Masters. Clearly the middle part of the week didn't go so well and you finished well. So what do you take from this week?  
SHANE LOWRY: I mean, yesterday it was just a tough day. And I just let it get away from me. Friday didn't go too well, obviously, either. I feel like my game wasn't there, I didn't hole enough putts. I made a few bad decisions. I feel like I could have done a lot better and I'm a bit disappointed with the whole week as a whole. When I sit back and look at it, this week will definitely help me in the future. So I got to look at it that way.   
Just the few little things where I missed a few greens on Thursday that you probably can't and even today just a simple one the likes of 8, I hit what I thought was a good shot in there and then went up and there was no chip. So you learn something new about this course every day you play it. So you just have to put that in the memory bank and bring it back here next year with you.   
   
 Q. Talk us through a very special Masters moment.   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, obviously it was amazing to have a hole‑in‑one on 16 around here in the final round. I just wish I would have been able to come up with more birdies but it was a perfect shot. I just hit it in right of the hole and it just took it down in. I feel pretty lucky to have a hole‑in‑one around this place, in this tournament. So, yeah, it's nice. I'm sure I'll get a picture somewhere and frame it in the house and it will be nice memento to have.  
   
 Q. Quite a roar.   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was a nice roar. No, I wasn't giving the ball away. My last hole‑in‑one in competition my parents were there as well, actually, and it was in Dubai and I still have the ball from that. So I feel like I'll keep that one.  
   
 Q. How do you reflect on Masters week?  
SHANE LOWRY: There's a lot of good positives to take out of it. I played, I feel like my iron play was quite good for most of the week. Just a few bad breaks here and there the last couple of days and I feel like I could have been a little bit closer to the lead, but that's the way Major golf is and that's the way this course is. So, every week you play a Major, especially the Masters is a learning curve and I learned a lot this week and I'm sure I'll take it with me in the future.   
   
 Q. Lots to play for this year, of course, you take a lot of encouraging things away as you try to qualify for Ryder Cup and Olympics later in the year.   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, I'm quite a ways away from that now, obviously, Olympics I'm on the team as it stands, but Ryder Cup is kind of one of the main goals, for sure this year. I need something good to happen soon. So, I feel like my game's okay, and there's no alarm bells ringing anywhere, so I just need to get on with it and I got three weeks off now to kind of regroup and get back for Wells Fargo and I look forward to going there and hopefully doing something good.
