Q. It was a tough battle out there.  How would you describe it?
SHANE LOWRY: I personally feel like it almost got away.  I'm a little bit disappointed.  This was my best week in quite a while.  So many positives to take from this week.  And going forward I'm looking forward to next week.
Look, after coming so close, it's hard to describe what it's like, but I'm sure I'll get over it and move on to next week.
Q. What are some of those positive things you'll take from your round?
SHANE LOWRY: Best I've hit the ball in a while.  I've already won this year, so this is my 9th tournament.  And a win and another great chance to win, I suppose I'm doing things right.
Look, like I said, I'm looking forward to next week and the rest of the season.
