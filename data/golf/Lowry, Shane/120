Q. Talk about the round.SHANE LOWRY: I mean, I feel like I played the golf today to really have a chance to win at the end.  A couple of short putts for par that you can't be doing on days like this. I just didn't really -- I just didn't do enough.  Holed a few more putts would have had a chance coming in on the last few.  Even still, I was thinking if I could get to 3, if I could birdie 17 and 18 when I was playing them. It was a good week for me, I'm probably back inside top 15 in the world.  I don't know how far I'm away from my card over here now.  But a few goals have been reached.  Yeah, it was a decent day.Q. Great experience to draw on future majors?SHANE LOWRY: It was, yeah.  Like, long morning this morning, I was awake at 7:30 this morning.  It was a long day.  You hope to learn from things like today. Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed my week, to be honest.  Loved the golf course, I loved how tough it played.  Tends to suit me a lot, tough golf courses. Overall I'm pretty pleased at how I played.  When you walk away from a major championship and you feel like you played the golf to win you've got to be happy with yourself.Q. Nervous at the start?SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I can't remember what I hit at the first.  I hit a poor tee shot on the first, but I hit a good second shot and holed a great putt for par.  That got me going.  I hit a good shot into the third and it just got a bit of a downslope and rolled to the back of the green, and I three-putted that. I left myself a couple of putts that were really tough downhillers.  It was such a grind out there.  It was quite tough.  And I felt like we were playing catchup on the group in front of us all day, as well.
