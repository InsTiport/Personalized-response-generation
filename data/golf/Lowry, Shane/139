Q.   Am I right to presume there's mixed feelings after today? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I got off to a flyer, off to a great start, and just nothing really happened for me.   I did make a few‑‑ I made three good par saves, but yeah, I mean, I would have liked to make a couple more birdies.   Probably should have.   Didn't really hole many putts out there today but for the first few holes. 
I'm right where I want to be for tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   Bogey‑free, tidy 68, but you looked to be biting your lip after finding the water, not quite making anything at 15?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, when you don't birdie 11 and 15 out there, they are the three holes on the back nine where you look to make your score.   Gave myself‑‑ obviously hit a bad shot in the water on 11 and short‑sided myself on 15 and 18, and had no chance really.   But yeah, I'm right where I want to be, as I said for tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   Is it all the more galling when you see a playing partner who is now two clear of you, or is there dissatisfaction despite the misgivings?
SHANE LOWRY:   I'm still there.   If you had given me this Thursday morning before I stood on the first tee, would I have taken your hand off.   I'm where I want to be and I feel like I have a chance tomorrow.   Joost is playing lovely but I felt like I played lovely myself.   Just warm up the putter tonight and see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   That's the key is it, form on the greens?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, you have to hole putts and you have to get a little bit lucky to win tournaments.
