 Q.   Your thoughts on 3‑under par around here?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it wasn't that easy out there.   It was quite breezy this morning.   Yeah, I think I made six birdies, which is nice, and a couple of bad bogeys, but I'm happy with 3‑under.  
   
 Q.   Gives of the impression there are plenty of opportunities.   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, there are.   If you play well, if you hit decent shots, it gives you some chances.   If you hit it straight off the tee, you have a lot of chances out there, but there's a lot of trouble out there, as well.   Just trying to get around here without making too many mistakes and trying to pick off the birdies when you get a chance.  
   
 Q.   You've been playing nicely, and you've been kind of playing nicely, there were signs last week and then fall back just a little?  
SHANE LOWRY:   The last two weeks I felt I was sort of Top‑10'ing it in the back nine on Sunday, which is always a nice place to be.   If I can get myself within a couple of the lead going into the back nine this Sunday, I'll be happy enough.  
   
 Q.   The nature of the game, sometimes it clicks and then you're flying?  
SHANE LOWRY:   That's just the way it is.   You just need to give yourself as many opportunities as you can to win and hopefully you can knock one or two of them off each year over the course of your career.
