  SHANE LOWRY:   I played nicely.   I really feel like 5‑under was the worst I could have shot out there today.   Delighted with the start, the last few weeks I've been getting off to a ropey start.   Nice to get off to a decent start today and hopefully I can keep it on tomorrow. 
I drove the ball quite well which means you're going into these greens with a lot of mid‑irons, short irons.   Didn't really hole much on the greens.   Most of my birdies were sort of gimmies, so it was nice.   Hopefully I can hole a few putts over the weekend and see what happens.

Q.   Did you banish the thoughts of Ireland very swiftly? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I did.   I mean, it was a tough week.   For me to miss the cut in Ireland is never nice.   Got home for the weekend, took it easy and come out here and got ready Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Q.   So did you analyse, particularly, or just decide, shut that in the box and get on because I'm playing well. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Felt like I'm playing okay in Ireland, same as the U.S. Open the week before.   Just have to keep going and do what you're doing, and you get days like today when things go your way and shoot 5‑under and hopefully I can keep that up. 

Q.   Essentially there's so much that's good about your game at the moment. 
SHANE LOWRY:   There actually is.   Feel like my golf is good, I'm driving the ball good and my iron play is as good as I've ever been.   Just see if I can get the putter warm over the weekend and see what happens.
