Q. Shane, just how good does 66 feel in those conditions?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, it was tricky.  It was windy out there.  When you get down into the course it's kind of in the trees and tough to pick where it is.
Yeah, I'm chuffed.  I've given myself a great chance going into tomorrow.  That's what I wanted at the start of the week, so I'm happy, yeah.
Q. You spoke earlier in the week about how you've had a couple Top 10s coming in here.  Where is the level of confidence right now?
SHANE LOWRY: It's pretty good.  I had two weeks after and didn't really do that much.  I played a few games of golf with friends and stuff, but it was the most relaxed two weeks off I've had all year.
Just sort of seemed like I came back out this week and didn't really know how I was going to play.  I just went about my business and managed to get off to a good start on Thursday.  Kept it going, kept the momentum going.
The big thing this week is I'm holing a few putts.  Holed a great putt for par on the last there, which is great for momentum going into tomorrow.
Hopefully I can build on it and keep it going.
Q. You won in Abu Dhabi earlier this year for the first time in three and a half years that you had a win.  How much belief does that give you going into tomorrow knowing you can do this?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, loads.  You know, I led from the front pretty much all week as well.  Went to another RBC event in Hilton Head and I led a lot of the week there.
I'm trying to get as used to being at the top of the leaderboard as I can.  It does take a little bit of getting used to, especially at the start of this year.  I had a couple of barren years, and it was nice to come out this year and sort of the be up there top of the leaderboard a few weeks.
Like you said, managed to knock one off in January, and hopefully I can go out and give myself a great chance tomorrow.
