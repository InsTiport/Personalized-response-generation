Q.   Another very good day. 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, 6‑under I suppose the first day out, I don't know who is leading or what core is leading but I'm happy with 6‑under and I'm in a good position with three days to go.   Obviously was very disappointed bogeying the last two.   Felt like I had the ball on a string all day and felt like it came very easy to me today.   
    Just to bogey those last two was disappointing but 6‑under is a good score out there, and yeah, I'm looking forward to the next few days. 

Q.   You don't sound amazed with your round.   Is it just a case of keep running with the confidence? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, just keep going and try not to think about it too much.   That's all I'm doing.   The golf is good at the minute and I feel like I'm not hitting many bad shots which is good and when I am, my short game is good.   Everything feels good at the minute and I just have to keep going and keep going until it stops. 
    Feeling good, no jet‑lag this week because we have been here a couple of weeks now, so yeah, I feel great.   I really enjoy it, they have got a great golf course here at Mission Hills and very enjoyable to play and it's in great condition. 

Q.   Probably going to take a pretty low score to win this thing, isn't it? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it is, late teens, but you never know, if a bit of wind gets up or something like that.   Actually when I played here on Tuesday, I didn't think it was as easy, but gave myself a lot of chances so 6‑under is all right.
