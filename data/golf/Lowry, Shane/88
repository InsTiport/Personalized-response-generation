 Q.  Shane Lowry, kind of a crazy one out there today.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is a bit softer.  I mean, that's the way it is.  That's one of your former champions throwing tees at me.   
 Q.  I see that.  
SHANE LOWRY: No, it is.  But, you know, the golf course played really tough yesterday so it softened it up for us a little bit for us, and it's definitely more playable today.  You can see guys shooting under par.  We didn't see too many under par yesterday.   
I'm happy to hang on.  I'm on even par through 11 holes.  Got like a 25-footer on 12 for birdie.  So I just can't wait to get back out there.  The forecast is great for the rest of the week, which is great.  And hopefully, we get sort of the second round done by early Saturday morning and get everybody in the third round Saturday afternoon.   
 Q.  Thank you.  Good luck to you.  
SHANE LOWRY: Thanks.
