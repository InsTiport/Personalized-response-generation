Q.   What is going through your mind right now?
SHANE LOWRY:   Very happy to be honest.   Obviously it was always going to be a tough match for me against Rory today, but playing against the world No.1, I'm feeling quite good now, but it's important not to get too high now because it's only the first round, and I've got another match tomorrow and really looking forward to playing that.

Q.   Talk about the two chip‑ins that really turned everything around. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, my short game is the best part of my game, and I hit a bad pitch shot on the par‑5, I think it was 11, 12‑‑ 11.   It was just a straightforward chip.   I actually fancied it, and then flew the green on the next and I was just trying to get it up‑and‑down to get a halve, and I chipped in and that kind of got me going.   I hit a lovely 5‑wood to three feet on the next hole, and it got me going towards the end of the round.

Q.   When you walked out on the tee this morning were you thinking you could beat this guy?
SHANE LOWRY:   Deep down I knew I could beat him.   I'm not here for no reason.   I'm not here to make up the numbers.   I was quite nervous starting off.   I handed him a few holes early doors, but he handed me a few back later on in the round.   And this is match play, and I got a few breaks where I needed them, and I'm just fortunate to win.
