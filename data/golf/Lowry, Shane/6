 Q. Just kind of talk aboutââ did you just not get everything going?   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I can't seem to get my head around this place. Played lovely in practice. Played really good going into it, and just off to a bad start. Had a bogey on 11 and didn't birdie 13 with a 7âiron in my hand, and you kind ofââ a poor bogey at 14. Just a couple of bad mistakes early on. It's not that I was chasing all day, but I just felt like I couldn't get a putt to the hole. I felt like I kept leaving myself nice putts underneath the hole and just kind of struggled to get the ball to the hole. But look, it is what it is. I'll regroup tonight, and whatever time we do play at tomorrow, I'll be ready to go and try and shoot the best score I can.   
   
 Q. The atmosphere, you've understood it the last couple days practicing, but this wasââ you're playing with the defending Masters champion and there's nobody out there.   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, like I told him, with my draw, it's a bit of an advantage not having any crowds out there. I thought that was good. It was nice to play with Tiger my first time I was able to play with him. It is pretty cool. I didn't want to get distracted by it today, and I don't think I did, but playing with like my golfing hero is just pretty cool around this place, and as the Open Champion playing with the defending champion, that was just kind of a bit of a surreal experience. But I am very disappointed with my day, but I did enjoy my day, as well.   
Like I said, I just need to regroup now tonight. I played it really, really nice in practice and I played really well in Houston last week, so no reason why I can't go out and shoot a good score tomorrow.   
   
 Q. What do you do during the break, just kind ofââ   
SHANE LOWRY: I went back home actually. I'm just like 15 minutes away. I kind of figured when we got work when we were going back out, I was going to have like an hour and 15 minutes from the text message we got, so I only need 40 minutes to warm up, so I just went back to the house and had a second breakfast and chilled out. I'm staying with GâMac this week, so we just got a cup of coffee and chilled out.   
   
 Q. Will you go to the range and try to work some things out?   
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm not going to go and do too much. It takes a bit out of me being out in this heat. I'm going to rest this evening, and like I say, when I do get out there tomorrow, I'll just go out there and give it my best and hopefully that's good enough.
