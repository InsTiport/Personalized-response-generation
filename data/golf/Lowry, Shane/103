A flash interview with:   
SHANE LOWRY   
 Q.  Just comment on the round, if you can, for us today.  
SHANE LOWRY: Struggled at the end.  I felt like I was playing nicely.  The golf course has been very tough today.  I felt the greens were quite firm.  You know, I just hit a couple of very poor shots at the end, obviously made a bad mistake on 17.   
It was nice to finish with birdie.  I think I would have been pretty annoyed if I was sitting in here after shooting double par at the end.  Birdie was nice, and I'm looking forward to it again.   
I need to put 17 behind me, put it out of my head.  Only 3 off the lead going into the weekend.  It's kind of right where you want to be.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Your first time...  
SHANE LOWRY: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What was it about this course that fits you?  
SHANE LOWRY: I just like it.  It's a great event.  The golf course is really nice.  I like playing on firm greens.   
I hope it stays like that for the weekend.  I like everything about it.  It's great.   
Not much more I can say.   
 Q.  What can you say with your mindset going into the weekend?  
SHANE LOWRY: Listen, we all go out and try -- our first job is to post some decent scores, make the cut, put ourselves in a chance going into Saturday and Sunday.   
I have done that job now, so hoping to do my job for tomorrow and that's giving myself a chance going into Sunday.  If I can shoot a couple under par, I'm sure I will be right there.
