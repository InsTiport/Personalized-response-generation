Q.   How do you reflect on this week? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Another good week, delighted.   You know, a couple of bad holes during the week but to be honest I felt a bit tired. 
You know, coming into the back nine today, I think I managed to handle myself nicely and make a few birdies, especially after that double on 9.   But yeah, I'm going to finish at least tied fifth, so another good week in a big tournament and some good World Ranking points, too.

Q.   And if you're feeling the fatigue and you put it together like that in the back nine, the birdie at the last has to boost your chances? 
SHANE LOWRY:   My concentration levels are very good and I'm delighted with the great Race to Dubai points and great World Ranking points.   Onwards and upwards from here.

Q.   Did you feel you had a chance into the final day despite the way the leaders were playing?
SHANE LOWRY:   I felt like I need to go really low, like 8, but obviously 8 is not enough.   The two lads have just gone miles ahead. 
I noticed that earlier‑‑ actually got myself in a nice position at 14‑under after 8, cruising along lovely and then hit a sloppy shot on 9 and that's where I knew I was fighting for a decent finish after that.   Managed to make a few birdies, and delighted.

Q.   Looking at the calibre of the field and all those tucked in behind you?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, there's more Ryder Cup players than not on it; it's great to be up there with those boys and I feel very comfortable there.
Off to Mission Hills tomorrow, so, yeah, looking forward to the World Golf Championships; what could be wrong with that.
