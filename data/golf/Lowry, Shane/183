  SHANE LOWRY:   Quite a frustrating day on the golf course to be honest.   Even though the conditions were really tough and I played really well, just missed a couple of short putts for birdies and hit a couple of decent shots and actually made bogeys and just one of those days that I could have shot 3‑, 4‑, 5‑under, and ended up shooting 1‑under, but what can you do.   I'm there or thereabouts going into the weekend, and that's all I can ask for.  
   
 Q.   Because of you or conditions or combination of both?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Hit a couple of the wrong clubs.   Hit a wedge over the back of the last, which is just criminal really.   Just a couple of errors like that, really, as opposed to‑‑ I was hitting good shots myself.   The greens I found them quite difficult to see a line on the greens.   
But hopefully go out there tomorrow and shoot a number and see where it leaves me Sunday.   
   
 Q.   Slightly different with the wind picking up?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was difficult today.   Somewhat easier with the wind, you've got 5, 17, 12, the par 5s are playing very easy.   So they are really par 4s and you can pick up a couple of shots there, and you should really be able to shoot a decent score.   
There are really only four or five hard holes out there with the wind.   The course is as firm as I've ever seen it.   It's going to be‑‑ I imagine if the wind is like this over the weekend, it's going to be quite tough.   Something in the early teens.   
   
 Q.   Not the run away scores we seen in recent years.   
SHANE LOWRY:   No, when I came here and walked the course on Wednesday, these greens have really firmed up, it's actually quite difficult to hit the ball close.   Top‑10 here at the weekend, so, yeah, happy enough.
