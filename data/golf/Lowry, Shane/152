  SHANE LOWRY:   Just felt a bit flat out there today.   It was tough.   Trying not to look at score boards and next thing I knew, I was two ahead‑‑ I had done okay.   I haven't been there for a while. 
He's six ahead of me going into tomorrow but this course, anything can happen.   Hopefully I can get off to a good start.   I just have to go and see what I can do.   Be nice to contend and nice to give myself a chance going into the back nine tomorrow.   Would have been nice to hole that putt on the last.   Just the difference; he misses, I hole it and all of a sudden it's only four but that's just the way it goes.
Disappointed, 1‑over, but could have been a lot worse.   I didn't play great today.   Hit some poor drives.   Just didn't feel comfortable out there.   My alignment felt a bit off and just didn't feel that comfortable, simple as that. 
A couple of putts, I mean, I didn't really hole much, which is another thing.   But I made a couple of great saves on 16 and a nice up‑and‑down for birdie on 17.   I can't really complain.   I actually didn't play that great today.   3‑putt on 8 was a shocker, like that was awful. 
Great save on 11 after an awful second shot.   You know, I wasn't just as mentally switched on as I have been.   Hitting that shot in left of the flag is just a bit silly there and missing that green long left. 
But missing the drive on the next, just wasn't really firing on all cylinders.   But I still have half a chance and if you'd have given me this position going into tomorrow on Wednesday, I would have taken your hand off, so I can't really complain.
