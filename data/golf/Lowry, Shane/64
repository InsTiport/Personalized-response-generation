 Q.  Thoughts on the final day, how was that?  
SHANE LOWRY: It was good.  I didn't get anything going on the front nine, and finished nicely.  Nice Top-10.  Bit of a reward for some good golf this week.  I feel like I played really well, and I'm looking forward to the Dunhill next week.  I'm very excited going up there, three courses that I love, and I feel like my game is in good shape.   
 Q.  Obviously at the moment, your countryman, Paul Dunne, is leading by one.  Will you go down and support him?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I'm going to go down there and pack my stuff, and hopefully I'll be coming up to see him on the 18th green.  I was watching the board, obviously for my own reasons, I was trying to get up there myself.  But when it was out of my hands and I couldn't get there, I'm rooting Paul on.  Young kid, he's a great add, and I know his caddie, Darren, very well, and hopefully he can do the business.
