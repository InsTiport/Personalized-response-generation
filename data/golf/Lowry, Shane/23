SHANE LOWRY: I just got off to a nice start and I just kept it going. It was tricky out there because it was raining early on. But I managed to play the holes in the wet fairly well, and then when the rain stopped and the wind died down it was beautiful there for the back sort of last seven or eight holes. I took advantage of it.   
You know, it's a good day. It's a decent week coming back after four weeks off. Probably sneak maybe a Top 15 out of it, which will be nice, and another few Race to Dubai points and happy enough.   
 Q.  You were level par after 15 on Friday in the second round and you're bogey-free since then, 39 holes with ten birdies. 10-under for the last 39 holes, it's like real form again.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is. Four weeks off coming into a big tournament, tough golf course, I didn't know what to expect. I was happy to get through to the weekend. I knew once I did, I could kind of make a run at it. You know, if anything, the first couple of days my putter was close. Although I felt like I was hit going putts, I felt like nothing was going in but I stayed patient all week and thankfully that patience paid off at the end.   
 Q.  Now, the timing of your warm-up this morning so that you could watch the match, you were teeing off at 5 past 11.00, 20 minutes after the match finished, but the match was almost done and dusted 20 minutes into the second half?  
SHANE LOWRY: When we got the try to go 24, 3-up, I got up off my seat and started my warmup. I was happy it was done and dusted then and Paul had it on his phone on the range, as well. Successful day all around. Ireland win and 66 is always nice.   
 Q.  Did you go on to the golf course with a bit more of a smile on your face?  
SHANE LOWRY: I'm sure I would have been a bit more disappointed if they didn't win. Obviously they were expected to win, but it's just nice. I'm very happy the way things went for them. I'm going out there in a few weeks for the quarterfinals and I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  How important was these last four days in terms of getting back into the swing of things after all the celebrations from July?  
SHANE LOWRY: Huge. I think I knew coming here, I could play well, but I was a bit anxious. I didn't know what to expect, and you know, I'm going up to a place that I love playing golf in next week. Conditions might be a bit tricky but will suit me. From then on, I feel like I'm playing on golf courses that I like and that suit me.   
I feel like I can have a really good end to the year but this is obviously a great way to kick start it, to shoot 66 today and give myself a good bit of momentum going into next week and hopefully I can build on that.   
 Q.  You mentioned The Race to Dubai.  
SHANE LOWRY: It's all going to come down to the last few events. They are so big. I'm playing Turkey and Dubai. I'll just worry about myself.   
 Q.  This form, this round, indicate that you're in form?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, absolutely. I feel like I'm playing good golf all year, so there's no point stopping now.   
 Q.  And a trip to the quarterfinals?  
SHANE LOWRY: The following week. So I just go out a few days early and then we've got a tournament in Japan, the, Zozo, the week after. It's ideal timing, yeah.   
 Q.  You said yesterday if you went out and shot a low one you might sneak a Top-10. That could well be the case?  
SHANE LOWRY: To be honest I thought if I holed the putt on the last, I'd finish Top-10. But get Top 15 and some valuable Race to Dubai points. I'm obviously very happy, any day you shoot a bogey-free 66 around Wentworth is pretty nice.   
 Q.  39 holes without a bogey around here, that's very impressive considering the difficulty of the golf course?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it is a difficult golf course. We had a bit of testing conditions today. It was tricky all week and I just feel like, you know, I played my way into the week lovely. Iffy enough couple of first and second round, but you know, the weekend, built some momentum nicely coming into today and I felt like I went out there and just did my thing today and played nicely.   
 Q.  This will be the first week so to speak of the new reality in your place of the upper echelons of world golf. Has it been much different?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I've enjoyed it. I've been busier than I've normally been but I've enjoyed it. I don't think it's bothered me in any way negatively. I think I've took it in my stride pretty well, and the mantle, Champion Golfer of the Year is pretty nice to have. I'm not going to complain about having to do extra stuff or anything like that. I'll just get on with it and do my thing, and when I get on the golf course, try to play as good as I can, and it worked this week.   
 Q.  Next few weeks, some tournaments you enjoy, obviously Dunhill Links is a tournament that you will enjoy. It's serious work, but a bit of craic, as well. Some serious business towards the end of the season with the likes of Antalya and of course Dubai, so some interesting weeks ahead for you?  
SHANE LOWRY: I've got a busy schedule coming up and I feel like there's a lot of tournaments and courses where I've done well on in the past. Going to the courses for the first time in Japan and Italy, but I feel like my game is in a decent place mentally and my confidence is pretty good. So I feel like I can go out and give The Race to Dubai a good shot towards the end of the year.
