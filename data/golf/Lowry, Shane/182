  SHANE LOWRY:   I feel like we got screwed over with the weather to be honest.   First few, put a jacket on and never took it off until the 18th tee which, was hard out there.   Not very enjoyable.   Couldn't hole a putt.   Just disappointing day and I was trying so hard to do well. 
But, what can you do.   I just have to get on with it and try to shoot the best score I can tomorrow. 

Q.   We all remember that amazing day in Baltray a few years ago; conditions very similar to today, weren't they?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was quite similar obviously, but it was really tough out there.   When you turn around, 14, 15, 16, 17; 17 we couldn't get home in two, and 16 was playing driver, 2‑iron.   Everything was just so tough.   I just didn't scramble the ball well and didn't get up‑and‑down when I should have.   You know, shooting 4‑over, that's golf.

Q.   Will you do some work on your game before tomorrow?
SHANE LOWRY:   I'll do a little bit.   I feel like my game is good.   I just feel like it was very tough out there.   My putting is what's let me down over the last few weeks and let me down today; what can you do. 

Q.   What was the mood like out there with yourself and Darren? 
SHANE LOWRY:   Just have to get on with it.   What else can you do.   Like we were looking back over there to see if we can get a break in the clouds, and walking down 17, we just looked at each other and started laughing.   It was that sort of day.   It was just difficult but just have to get on with it.

Q.   How do you feel the game is yourself in spite of the conditions today?
SHANE LOWRY:   I feel like my game is good.   I said to my caddie, I hit the ball well and playing nicely.   Just not scoring well.   It's one of those things.   Just have to keep grinding away and see when it happens.
