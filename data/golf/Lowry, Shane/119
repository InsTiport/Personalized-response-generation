Q. Tricky this afternoon; happy with that 66?SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, obviously it's a decent score and gives me a good chance going into tomorrow and going into the weekend.  I'm just happy with the good start.  Played really nicely today actually.  Sort of felt like I could have been a couple better but I'll take that.Q. On the sixth, a low, boring shot -- how did you hit that shot? We're going to show you a tee shot from the sixth which has Pro Tracer on it, a low, boring draw.  How did you hit this shot?SHANE LOWRY: Oh, yeah, that's a 2-iron I have.  I put that in the bag a few weeks ago for the U.S. Open.  Just put it back in my stance and hit it and hope for the best.  Normally works.  It's a good club.Q. You went on to make a terrific birdie at 10.  Describe this one for us?SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, hit a great drive down ten.  It's a tricky tee shot, tough to hit the fairway.  It's a tricky tee shot, tough to hit the fairway and hit a lovely wedge shot.  That was a perfect number for me.  As you see, maybe six or eight feet and I managed to roll that in.  That kind of got me going into the back nine.  Felt like I just played solid and I knew 16 was kind of there, and 16 was a good chance.  I was happy to birdie that, too.Q. I know you love a links golf course.  What's your feeling on this course?SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I like it.  It's a very fair golf course.  You play good golf and shoot a good score, if you hit bad shots there's a lot of bunkers off the tee that can penalize you.  I managed to stay out of the bunkers today and hope to stay out of them for the rest of the week.
