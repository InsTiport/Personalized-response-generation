 Q.   An eagle at 18 is something special.   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was a nice way to finish.   Played lovely.   For the first sort of 10, 11 holes and then dropped a couple of silly shots and I didn't really hole any putts.   I finished I think it was 4‑under for the last five.   Lovely way to finish.  
   
 Q.   And with the Truck on 18 for the hole‑in‑one prize, what did you hit in?  
SHANE LOWRY:   I hit 3‑wood into the bunker, the green‑side bunker was pin‑high, maybe six paces from the flag.   So a little chip shot, hit it nicely and I think it went in.   
   
 Q.   Would you like that Truck if possible?   
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, see me driving around that.   Give it a go.   
   
 Q.   Right back where you were?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I'm back into the Top‑10 now.   I know the leaders are in double digits, but if I can go out there and shoot a good score tomorrow, try and get in there for Sunday.   
   
 Q.   How was it playing with the amateur?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it was great, really enjoyable.   Obviously something different for us.   We never do that.   You know, it was a bit of extra, obviously we were playing for two cars, me and Robert.   
We done all right, we were 5‑under through nine looking at the leaderboard and then we dropped a couple of silly shots the last nine, and me and Robert didn't really contribute as much as we should have today.   But the amateur played really well.   
   
 Q.   Quite a fun change?  
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, it's a lot different.   It was good, something that they might have to look at in the future, it was really enjoyable.
