Q.   Good start? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty happy with that.   I got lucky a couple of times on the back nine and managed to have a couple of good up‑and‑downs.   Yeah, it was nice.   I got off to a great start.   I was 6‑under after 11 and just played average enough from there on in but got a way with it and managed to shoot 6‑under which is nice.

Q.   The conditions look like they got a bit tougher?
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah tough, yeah.   I mean, we were nearly last off, so the wind picked up and it was playing very tough.. the downwind holes, down out of the left coming in was playing quite tough and then the 18th was playing really tough there.   So, yeah, it was tough coming in, so I'm delighted with 6‑under.

Q.   A continuation of the recent form, isn't it? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, recent form and I love it up here, as well.   I love playing links golf and obviously I've done quite well here before and I've been playing quite well the last few weeks. 
    So I just hope I can go out and do okay.   The forecast is bad for the next couple of days, so if I can keep going and keep my head down and do okay and give myself a chance on Sunday.   The summer has been very kind to me.   I think before May, I barely made a cut, and then, you know, from May onwards, it's been‑‑ I have haven't looked back.   It's been very good.   I've really enjoyed competing and being in contention a lot this summer.   It gives me the kind of drive to go on and keep doing that. 

Q.   After Wales, having such a good result there, did you almost just want to play the next week? 
    SHANE LOWRY:   I finished in Wales and I had a day for Bank of Ireland on the Tuesday and didn't hit a shot.   Took the whole week off and didn't hit any balls or anything.   Because I've got seven out of the next eight weeks coming up, I need to be fresh for those.   So you know, it's paying off and I'm still paying off quite well and managed to hole a few putts, as well, which is nice.

Q.   Did you watch The Ryder Cup?
    SHANE LOWRY:   I did.   I was actually in Portugal for a few days with my girlfriend, and, yeah, we sat down, had a house with SKY Sports, which is nice, and watched Ryder Cup.   It was great viewing.   I didn't see much of it on Sunday because I flew home, but I seen every shot I think Friday and Saturday.   It was great and I was delighted for the lads. 
    I kind of felt like I really, really wanted to be there   and felt the way I'm playing at the minute that I was good enough to be there, as well.   But you know, wasn't to be this year.   I think, you know, looking at The Ryder Cup last week has given me the kind of‑‑ given me the ambition to go on and the belief to go on and try to make the next team, and I really think I can.
