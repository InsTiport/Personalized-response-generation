Q. Round of 66 and no dropped shots.  That must have been delightful for you?
SHANE LOWRY: It was nice.  I played nicely today.  I got myself in trouble a couple of types, a couple of good ups and downs.  I kept it going, which was nice.  I managed to make a few birdies.  I felt I gave myself a lot of chances.  I'll take it.
Q. How did the greens play this afternoon?  One or two of the guys this morning said they thought it would be tough after the spike marks and the softness of this morning?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, they are very soft.  From 20 feet, you are just making sure that you don't give yourself a 3- or 4-footer for par.  It's one of those you are just trying to drop them in.  Thankfully a couple went in for me.  Hopefully get out in the morning and have some fresh greens, it will be nice.
Q. The win in America recently meant, I suppose, you can change your mindset a little bit and cherry pick your events now, doesn't it?
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it it does.  It's great.  I haven't really sit down to see what I'm going to do next year, but I can pick my schedule whatever way I want, tournaments I feel like I'm going to do well in.  It's given me great confidence as well going forward and to win a tournament like this.  And to shoot this round is part of that.
Q. It seems like five minutes since you won the Irish Open.  You are the highest ranked player in the world here this week that must be pretty nice to hear?
SHANE LOWRY: It is.  It also has its own things to put you under a little bit more pressure than you already are.  I spoke with my coach last night and managed to deal with that nicely.  Hopefully I can deal with the rest of the week.
Q. Finally, a word on the overall experience, the big crowds today.  Have you enjoyed it?
SHANE LOWRY: It's great.  It's very much an (indiscernible) feel about it.  Big event, great golf course, big crowds, very knowledgeable crowds as well.  It's great.  I'm looking forward to the weekend here.
