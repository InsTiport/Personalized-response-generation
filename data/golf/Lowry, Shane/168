  MARK STEVENS:   Shane, why don't you tell us if you've played the courses, what you think of the Trump International here. 
SHANE LOWRY:   Actually I haven't played yet.   Yeah, I arrived yesterday, and pretty nice place, nice‑‑ well, the weather looks a bit dodgy today, but nice and warm yesterday, it was good.   Good practice facilities here, and the hotel is nice.   So yeah, good week already.
MARK STEVENS:   What are your expectations coming into this week?   You had a good start of your U.S. year at Match Play. 
SHANE LOWRY:   I mean, I don't know what my expectations are.   Obviously I'd like to do really well.   You know, do I think I can win?   I know I can win if I play good golf.   But I'm trying not to think about it like that.   I'm trying to just take it one day at a time and see what happens come Sunday. 
I know I'm potentially one of the highest ranked players in the field this week, but I need to get that out of my mind and I need to just focus on one thing, and that's‑‑ the only thing that matters now is the first tee shot on Thursday.   I'll practice today and tomorrow, pro‑am tomorrow, and looking forward to getting going on Thursday.
MARK STEVENS:   And also I know a lot of people are curious if you have any updates on your schedule.   You're planning on staying over here? 
SHANE LOWRY:   I am planning on staying, but I don't think it's looking great for Tampa next week.   I think top 10s get in this week, so hopefully I can top 10 and get in.   I'm planning on staying here right here to May.   I don't have any updates yet.   Speaking to Connor yesterday, he hasn't heard anything back from anyone yet, so we're just playing the waiting game, and hopefully can get a few more starts over here. 

Q.   Does that put any extra pressure on you?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, obviously a top 10 would be great to get into next week.   I really want to play here as much as I can, so if I can top 10, as I said, just focus on one thing and that's the first round on Thursday, try and shoot a good couple of scores, get me in contention, come Saturday afternoon and Sunday, you never know. 
MARK STEVENS:   Do you have any plans to go out and see any of the sights here in Puerto Rico? 
SHANE LOWRY:   I don't know.   I've never been here, and the guys I'm with have never been‑‑ like my caddie and I were knocking around with Paul Casey and his caddie last night.   We've never been here before, so we don't really know what's going on.   We kind of planned on staying in the hotel for the week, but if anyone has any suggestions I'm sure we'll take them up.

Q.   Have you been to the Caribbean before?
SHANE LOWRY:   No, this is my first time. 

Q.   How will the weather affect you this week? 
SHANE LOWRY:   I mean, it's fine for me.   I grew up playing in wind and rain.   I mean, it's obviously quite warm, so I suppose it'll be tropical storms, so there could be delays, which obviously can affect you a bit.   But as regards the wind, I'm not too fussed about that.   I'd actually like to see it a bit windy.

Q.   Is this a tournament and event that was on your radar screen at all or is coming here a completely new experience for you?
SHANE LOWRY:   I want to play on the PGA TOUR as much as I can.   I spoke to Connor, my manager, maybe six weeks ago now and said, I knew this was opposite the Cadillac, so I said to him, any chance we can get an invite there, and we were lucky enough that we did get an invite.   Very grateful for that, and hopefully I can make the most of it this week.

Q.   How is it playing on the Tour in Europe? 
SHANE LOWRY:   I love it.   I mean, sometimes it can get on top of you.   It's quite a lonely game at times.   But I love doing what I'm doing, and I'm very grateful that I play golf for a living.   I feel like I'm very lucky.   I love doing what I'm doing, as I said, and I think it's great. 

Q.   Having placed in the top 10 at Match Play, do you feel like you carry any momentum from that or come in with a clean slate because it's a different tournament, different conditions?
SHANE LOWRY:   Yeah, exactly.   I try to‑‑ I had a bit of practice last week.   I had up with a friend of mine in Palm Beach, and I practiced well yesterday, so I'm going out there, play a few holes today and see what the course is like, see how it suits me.   It's a new week, and as everyone knows that plays this game, it's not about last week, it's all about this week.   You know, I just have to try and practice as good as I can between now and Thursday and get ready for that. 
MARK STEVENS:   You've probably always heard about the U.S. Tour playing in great conditions every week.   You've been here in snow, last week you were at Honda in the cold, now it's raining but it's still nice here. 
SHANE LOWRY:   In Europe it's the same.   The bad weather seems to follow us around at times.   I'm sure the weather will pick up in the U.S. as the year goes along, but yeah, snow in Arizona was weird, and then last week at the Honda it was quite cold at the weekend, which made it tough.   But I like the tough conditions.
