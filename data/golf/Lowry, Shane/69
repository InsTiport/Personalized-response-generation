 Q.  Obviously disappointment with the two holes you dropped shots on, but a fantastic finish on 18 with a brilliant second shot.  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I feel like it's a lot more than I deserved.  I'm fairly disappointed at the minute.  You know, when I got up to the 12th, I looked at the scoreboard and I seen Alex had got to 11-under, so I knew what I needed to do.   
You know, we got a bit of rain 13, 14, 15 kind of didn't help our cause and I just hit a bad tee shot on 15.  Bit of a mental -- a bit of a brain fart on 17.  Well, yeah, it was nice to eagle the last.  If I'd walked away finishing 10th or 11th here, I would have been very disappointed.   
So it's a decent week, a few World Ranking points, a few Race to Dubai points.  I've got to build on it.  It's my best week in a while.  I started like a train today, and my putter felt fantastic all day.  I mean, I burnt the edges even when they weren't going in.  Yeah, a lot of positives I suppose.   
 Q.  Entering a busy part of the year.  What's the main positive you take out of this week?  
SHANE LOWRY: Yeah, I've got Memorial next week.  I'm going to America tomorrow.  I've just got to build on this now and try and perform over there.  Need to drive the ball a bit better.  Drove it quite poorly most of the week.   
My iron play and my short game and my putting was fantastic, so you know, I've been battling for months to try to get my putting right, and then get my putting right and my driving goes a little bit.  So that's what this game does.   
But like I said, there's a lot of positives.  It's hard to kind of see them now but when I get home -- I'm looking forward to getting home to my wife and daughter tonight and just chill out for a few hours and then I fly tomorrow.
