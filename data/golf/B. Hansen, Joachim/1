 Q.  Very well-played, nice tidy 66 out there in your words. How do you reflect on day two?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: Solid again. Played really well today. Got off to a bad start on the first hole, but a few pars after that and suddenly I holed my second one on the fifth hole which was nice, and I kept running from there.   
 Q.  What does a shot like that do for momentum in your round?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: A lot. I was seeking a birdie or two coming into the ninth hole.   
 Q.  And 18 had a chance?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: Just lipped out of, unfortunately. I holed some good putts on the last stretch. Really solid.   
 Q.  A lot of talk about this being a ball-striker's golf course. How do you like the challenge of this layout?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: I love it. Reminds me a little bit about last week. It's just a bit longer, but you really need to hit the fairways and the greens. The rough around the greens is hard to play from. Fairways and greens is what you want to do.   
 Q.  Last week, great week for you in Spain. Again, confidence-wise, how big was that? Particularly the weekend?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: Secured my card next year.   
 Q.  Great round of golf. What pleased you most out there?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: I've been hitting the ball well. Got my coach here this week, which is really nice, and my father, as well. So them on the sideline and my coach, just fixing my swing.   
 Q.  Securing your card, how much freedom does that give you the rest of the season?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: A lot. I was starting to get a bit cheeky on that, you know, a few missed cuts and then you're gone. Finishing fourth last week was just what I needed to relax a bit and set some new targets.   
 Q.  In position, Rolex Series Event, feeling confident?  
JOACHIM B. HANSEN: Yeah, looking forward to the next two days and see what happens.
