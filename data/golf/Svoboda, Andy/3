 Q.   Pair of 66s to start off the week for Andy Svoboda.   Andy, how have you been able to keep it going Round 2?  
ANDY SVOBODA:   I made six birdies today.   I kept the ball in the fairway and hit some nice iron shots, and my putting was great again, so it was a really good start.   I'm looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   How do you build off last week?   You put yourself in a good spot through 54 and a little struggle on Sunday, still a T18.   What can you draw from that?  
ANDY SVOBODA:   Yeah, I definitely got some good experience last week playing in the last group the last couple days, and I learned a lot.   So hopefully I can grow and play better in the future.  
   
 Q.   How different of a test is it going from Summerlin to the Seaside layout here at McGladrey?  
ANDY SVOBODA:   It's a lot different.   This course has a lot of wind, and the greens are really firm.   And it's just, you know, kind of opposite spectrum.   
But you know, this course is really playing tough.   
   
 Q.   Scores have shown that.   Thanks, Andy.   Back to you.   
   
 Q.   Andy Svoboda, 4‑under, 66 in Round 2.   You had it going pretty good early, and then a little bit of a rough spot in the middle there.   
ANDY SVOBODA:   Yeah, I hit some great wedges early and got under, 2‑under quick.   I was happy with my round.   I shot 4‑under today, and it played really tough out there, so I can't complain.  
   
 Q.   You gotta like these fall events.   You played well last week in Las Vegas and as well this week.   
ANDY SVOBODA:   Yeah.   This being my second go is a big deal, I think.   I know the courses.   I know what to expect, and I like these courses.   They're ball‑striker courses where you gotta hit the ball in the fairway and place your iron shots on the green, in a good spot.   
So I like both these venues, and it's showing.
