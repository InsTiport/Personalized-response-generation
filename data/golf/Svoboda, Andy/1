 Q.   Andrew, I know difficult day for you out there.   Not a bad start to the round, just that one little bad stretch on the Back 9 that got you.   
ANDY SVOBODA:   Yeah.   Sad is I made a bogey with a sand wedge, threeâ€‘putted and then hit the wrong club and made bogey.   And hit a drive that was like a yard off on 14.   Made bogey.   And just didn't make any putts coming in.  
All in all it was a good week.   I wish I had done better, but I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   You're close, so you've got to be excited about the season ahead I would think.   
ANDY SVOBODA:   Yeah.   I've been playing well.   I'm very, very happy.   I'm looking forward to getting some more good finishes and getting in contention and seeing if I can win one of these things one day.
