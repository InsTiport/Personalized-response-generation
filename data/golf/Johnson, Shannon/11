Q. You looked like you were playing pretty well this morning.
SHANNON JOHNSON: Yeah, definitely.  You know, I had such a good tempo on the range and just tried to keep that on the first tee.  For me if I get going one way, it's too quick, and things kind of tend to go a little sideways.  So for me just got into a super nice rhythm off the start, and just kind of kept it going.
Q. You're the one that finally stopped the Margaret train.
SHANNON JOHNSON: Yeah.  She's such a great player and such a good person, and we had a great time out there.  But it's nice to -- when you come to these, you want to play the best in the field, and I was lucky enough to get her as a draw and play against her.
Q. You seem to be a pretty speedy player.
SHANNON JOHNSON: Kind of, a little bit.  I like to kind of take my time when I need to, and I really want to -- I'm such a visual person and I want numbers, so for me just getting all the info before I hit is the biggest key, and me and my caddie have been working pretty well together.
Q. Now you've got like two and a half hours.
SHANNON JOHNSON: I know, so probably change out the shoes, get those dry, and go grab some lunch.  Yesterday I took a nap in the locker room, so I'm going to do that again today.
Q. That's the nice thing about playing fast and winning big, you get that luxury.
SHANNON JOHNSON: Absolutely, I'm looking forward to it.
