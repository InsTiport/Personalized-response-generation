 Q.  Dramatic finish.  How far was that bunker shot would you say?  10 yards?  
IRENE KIM: Maybe 10, 20.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I just like felt it, and I was like -- I kind of like aligned my ball to the hole, and I was like, I just have to follow through, and I did, and it went in.   
 Q.  Ever hole a bunker shot with that kind of circumstance, with the match pretty much on the line?  
IRENE KIM: No, I've never had that.   
 Q.  You guys, it was tight going into the back nine, and then you birdied, I think, four in a row and three wins, right, three out of four holes on the back --  
LEILA DIZON: I wasn't really keeping track.   
IRENE KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  You birdied 10, 11 and 12 you halved the hole, and 13 I think you birdied again?  
IRENE KIM: Yeah, she chipped in.   
 Q.  You chipped in on --  
IRENE KIM: She chipped in like three times this year.   
LEILA DIZON: Yeah, but I chipped in -- what hole was it?   
 Q.  How long was that championship?  
LEILA DIZON: It wasn't far, actually.  It was like seven yards, I think, yeah, and it just rolled straight in.   
 Q.  And the birdies on 10 and 11, who made those?  
IRENE KIM: 10, 11, 12.   
LEILA DIZON: On 10, it was like about seven feet.  It was like seven feet, and it was like left to right putt, downhill, and I thought it looked too much, but it actually started breaking and actually went in.   
IRENE KIM: The best birdie putt was that long one, hole 5.  It was this really long like birdie putt.   
LEILA DIZON: It was like 60 feet.   
IRENE KIM: And I was trying to make par, and it just happened to go in.   
 Q.  How long was your putt on 11?  
IRENE KIM: Like six feet.   
 Q.  What did you hit in there?  
IRENE KIM: I just aimed for the heart.   
 Q.  What club did you have?  
IRENE KIM: I think I hit a 9-iron to like 120-ish.   
 Q.  Your thoughts, you're in the semifinals, a couple wins away from winning it all?  
IRENE KIM: I'm really surprised, honestly.   
 Q.  Why are you surprised?  
IRENE KIM: Well, we were second seed, so that was a good feeling coming into match play, but I don't know, the field is just really good.  It's a really pure, hard course.   
LEILA DIZON: And I had some like lucky shots and putts and chips.   
 Q.  How about the long day?  What will you guys do?  Are you just ready to go to bed?  
IRENE KIM: I'm very ready to go to bed, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.   
LEILA DIZON: Yeah, after the 18th hole, I was like really tired, but as soon as I started playing, I got like my adrenaline going, and so like especially the last couple holes, I was like super like nervous because we were only 1-up -- they made a birdie, the par-3 --   
 Q.  They cut your deficit.  
IRENE KIM: Yeah, they made par, then birdie, when we made bogey and par.   
 Q.  You are going to Penn next year?  
IRENE KIM: Yes.   
 Q.  Where are you going to school?  
LEILA DIZON: Northwestern University.   
 Q.  Next year?  
LEILA DIZON: Two years.   
 Q.  And you're a past DCP finalist.  How much did that experience maybe help you this week?  
LEILA DIZON: Tremendously.  Well, it was 2015, so it was three years ago, but with drive, chip and putt, I practiced my putting, chipping and driving nonstop, and that really helps with this course especially because you have to have your drives in the fairway.  You have to be able to putt, and you have to be able to chip, so those three aspects really helped.   
 Q.  Have you guys played USGA stuff before this?  
IRENE KIM: We both played U.S. Girls' last year.   
 Q.  Did you make match play?  
IRENE KIM: Yes, but we lost that round of 64.   
 Q.  So this is the farthest you have ever gotten?  
IRENE KIM: Yep.
