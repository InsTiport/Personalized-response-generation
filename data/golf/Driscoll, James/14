  Q. James, good day out there for all three of you guys. Just comment, if you can?  
 JAMES DRISCOLL: Yeah, Vaughn got off to a great start. I just tried to ride his coattails for awhile. Stads got hot. I just kind of did my thing and hung in there and made some putts, which I haven't been doing the last couple months. Good day.  
  
  Q. Talk about playing in a group like that.   
 JAMES DRISCOLL: Yeah. Definitely Vaughn was really carrying the load for the front-9. He was carrying it from everywhere, and then Stads got hot with the putter, and I just kind of threw a couple birdies in there all day. Yeah, it was nice. We all got along well.  
 Even now the wind will blow hard for five minutes and kind of die hard. They'll have it tough in the afternoon. From here on it's going to be a really good test.  
  
  Q. Back-9?  
 JAMES DRISCOLL: Back-9 picked up. It wasn't really too bad. It's really hard when it blows like that. The course is in the best condition I've ever played in my life. The greens are unbelievable.
