Q.   James, 14 points today; great start to the tournament.   Just get some comments on your round. 
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah, it was overall, from top to bottom, probably one of the better rounds I've had for the year for sure.
I drove it a little bit better than I have been, kept putting well, and my irons have been pretty good as of late. 
So just a solid day.

Q.   Couple bogeys on the card, but those don't hurt you when you make a lot of birdies in this format. 
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah, it's kind of set up that way.   Even the bogeys I made I didn't feel like I hit that bad a shots.   All in all, I think it was a really good day.

Q.   Some really solid play for you over the last month or so.   Talk about your year up to this point. 
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah, I feel like I've been working on all the right things.   They're just coming together seems like â€‘ feels like they are. 
Definitely some work to do and a lot of room for improvement, but I'm happy with the way things are going. 

Q.   So 14 points at least birdie with a lost ball in the hazard on 18, which is a par 5.   You were expecting to get at least birdie, maybe an eagle and 5 points. 
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah, yeah, kind of went the opposite direction I wanted on that hole.
Overall I played really well today.   I pleased with how it ended.
