 Q.   2‑under yesterday, got off to a good start today with birdieing your second hole today.   You gotta be feeling pretty good.   
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Yeah.   In some ways I felt like at the end of yesterday's round I kind of let a good opportunity slip a little bit.   There were a couple of shots I felt like I gave up at the end of the round, but for the most part I'm just happy with the way things ended yesterday and only played a couple holes today and got one birdie in, so hopefully we'll get decent weather tomorrow and just get off to a good start and try to keep rolling.  
   
 Q.   How about this part of the country?   Obviously kind of your neck of the woods.   
JAMES DRISCOLL:   Two‑hour drive from home.   So I love this tournament.   It's easy for me.   I can drive.   A lot of my friends and family can come out and watch, and the golf course is so fun.   I mean the back nine is just ‑‑ if you do all the right things, you should be having a lot of opportunities for birdies and eagles on that back nine.   
So it gives you a great chance to go low.   It doesn't give you birdies.   They're not handing them out on the back nine, but for the most part if you hit the ball where you should, you can really go deep on the back nine.   
So it just makes for a fun day if you know where your ball is going.  
   
 Q.   Are you the type that enjoys the more family and friends out here or is it getting to be a little bit of a cumbersome task having them all out?  
JAMES DRISCOLL:   It all depends how you play.   If you're playing well, it's great.   If you're not playing well, you're just bummed out that you've wasted all their time.   So it's my job to play well and make it fun for everybody.
