Q.  The bunker shot at 18; you had options?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  Yeah, once I got there, I knew that I was going to be going under the first tree and over the other, so I didn't even really have to think about the trees.  It was just a matter of the ball sitting down in the bunker so I had to just kind of hit a half-skull and make sure I didn't catch it fat.
Q.  The other option was to wedge it out?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  Yeah, probably, but I didn't even think of that to be honest.  Once I saw the lie was half-decent and I had a fairly open shot I knew I was going to at least try to knock it on the green.
Q.  Halfway there, were you holding your breath?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  No, I thought it had enough to get over the water and in the practice rounds I had played around with the bank there and I had seen that the rough holds it up.  So I thought it was going to be dry for sure.
Q.  What's your reaction to the round, seeing your name on the leaderboard?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  This is unchartered territory for me so this is so exciting.  This is what I have always wanted to be doing, so it's fun for the first time.
Q.  No nerves in that respect?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  Oh, I was nervous.  Yeah, I was a little nervous.  Not like ridiculous but I was a little nervous over the last couple of holes for sure.
Q.  Is it easy making the transition back east from the West Coast?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  Not really.  I never really feel like I'm going to play better in any other -- in any place, you know what I mean.

I felt fine on the West Coast but I didn't play well.  I felt comfortable enough to play well.
Q.  You're from Florida?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  I'm from Boston.  I spend like three months in Florida for the last four years.
Q.  Did you live in Palm Beach?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  That's where I stay, West Palm.
Q.  No hockey in the off-season this year?
JAMES DRISCOLL:  I did, yeah.
