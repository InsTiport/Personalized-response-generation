PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They are very talented, and they really are people that have good hearts.  I want to congratulate the Internationals.   
On behalf of all of the people of Texas, of all of the people of -- if you look today, if you see what's happening, how horrible it is but we have it under really great control, Puerto Rico, and the people of Florida, who are really suffering over this last short period of time with hurricanes.  I want to just remember them and we are going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much.   
And I tell you what, I've been watching this from the beginning, and I have to say our Team USA, wow, did you play well.   
That great putter that I've been copying his putting stroke for many, many years, but it hasn't worked; Steve Stricker.  We're going to present Steve with the trophy.  I want to thank everybody.  This is a special group of folks, tremendous money is donated to charity by the TOUR every year.
