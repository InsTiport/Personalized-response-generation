   TAICHIRO KIYOTA: I putted well today but didn't hit good shots. My putting actually saved me as there were a lot of tough pin placements out there. The wind picked up a bit today which made it a bit harder.  
 I've got to really shoot a good round tomorrow if I am to have a chance of winning. It'll be tough as I'm a few shots behind.  
 Last year, I had a good chance to win this tournament in India but Mark Brown played really on the back nine to beat me. I got ahead of myself then and started thinking about winning.  
 I don't want to think too far ahead this time and will just take it one shot at a time.
