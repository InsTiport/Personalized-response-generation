   TAICHIRO KIYOTA:  My putting was very good today. I enjoyed my two rounds so far, really enjoyed it.   
 I've played my very best, it's unbelievable. I like the greens here. We've played here the last two weeks on the Asian Tour and the greens are the same. The feeling has gotten better.   
 The key was I kept myself very calm. I'm working on staying focussed on the golf course. It's a difficult golf course and I thought my way around it pretty well.   
 It's my second year on the Asian Tour and I'll try to play some in Japan as well. I want to try to play in tournaments in every country.   
 My favourite player of course is Tiger Woods. He's a very good player. This year, he's won every tournament. I watch him on TV, he's a great player.
