   TAICHIRO KIYOTA:  As the score shows the front nine was great but on the back nine I started to think of victory and lost my pace. I started thinking I could win on the 12th and made bogey and that just knocked my off my pace. But Mark Brown played great golf over the back nine and I feel he definitely won it.   
Apart from the finish, this has been a rich experience this week which will be very helpful in my development going forward. I have really enjoyed the experience.
