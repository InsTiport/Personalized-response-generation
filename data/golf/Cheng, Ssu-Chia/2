 Q.  Ssu-Chia, you made a great putt for par on 9.  How big was that putt in the middle of your round?  
SSU-CHIA CHENG: I mean, it's really important for us.  I missed the green on the right side and I didn't chip the ball really well.  I got about 18, 20 feet downhill.  You know, I didn't think too much.  Candie hits it five, six feet, uphill putt, so I think I just looked at the line, just putted, and the ball just go in.  We're just both really happy.  I believe it was really important for us.   
 Q.  Candie, what makes you and Ssu-Chia such a great team out here?  
CANDIE KUNG: I think we're very relaxed out there.  We're having a lot of fun.  I trusted her play.  I know she was going to make her pars wherever she is, and I could be a little more aggressive with the par-5s and a couple of the par-4s, and I happened to make a couple putts coming in, too.   
 Q.  Having Jorge having worked out here before, have you guys taken advantage of his local knowledge of the course maybe in practice rounds, or how has that helped you guys?  
CANDIE KUNG: I trust my caddie.  He's walked the course a lot, and there was actually a couple putts out here today that I asked Jorge about it, and he was pretty good with it.  Yeah.
