Q. How did you hold off a charging Australia team when they were making eagles out there?
CANDIE KUNG: We were just trying to play our own golf out there.  They were making birdies, making eagles, and we were making birdies out there, too.  She played awesome today.  We just kept it in there.
Q. Ssu-Chia, what was your strategy going into the matches today?
SSU-CHIA CHENG: Well, we don't have a strategy.  No strategy is our strength.  We just made more birdies this match.
Q. You're the lone member of this team that it was their first appearance.  What was that first tee atmosphere like for you?
SSU-CHIA CHENG: Well, I'm really excited.  It's been a long time since I played representing my country, and match play, as well.  Yeah, really exciting.  I just tried to have fun out there and just played my best, yeah.
