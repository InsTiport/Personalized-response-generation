  Q. Ssu-Chia, six birdies today, but even more importantly, an eagle on the Aon Risk Reward Challenge hole.  Take us through how you played the hole and how nice it was to come away with an eagle.
 SSU-CHIA CHENG:   So the LPGA moved the tee up and then I was kind of between like 3-wood or driver off the tee, and then I was had like 3-wood in my hand and like the last minutes, the last second I would just feel like driver -- I just felt more comfortable with driver.
 I hit a good drive and then hit it a little right of the green and I think I got like a luck a bounce.  Then bounce on the green and I got about like a three-foot putt and I made it.  It actually drop in the last second.
 So, yeah, it was a great eagle.
 Q. Nice.  That sounds like a great eagle.  Kind of similar pin positions I would imagine tomorrow, or just the location of the tees is what it seems like they do around here.  The weekend is a lot more scorable.
 SSU-CHIA CHENG:   Uh-huh, yeah.
 Q. How do you anticipate trying to go low again tomorrow?
 SSU-CHIA CHENG:   So obviously for 16 I know where my lie would be tomorrow if the tee is still up tomorrow.
 But I had a great round today.  I had several birdies out there.  Putter is being pretty good today.  Maybe only thing is just my driver.  If I can hit my driver better tomorrow will be good.
 Q. Hit it like 16 all the time.
 SSU-CHIA CHENG:   (Laughter.)
