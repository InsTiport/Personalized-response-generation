Q. How pleased are you with that?
ANTHONY WALL: Great.  Solid.  I drove the ball really well, which is key out there.  It's a great test and a great golf course, so it should be a really enjoyable week.
Q. The front nine looks dramatic and flattens out on the back nine.  Quite a contrast.
ANTHONY WALL: The par 5s on both nines are very similar.  They really require good tee shots and very strong second shots.  There's fours and threes to be had, but also sixes and sevens.
Q. Is there a feeling you're due a good performance across all four days?
ANTHONY WALL: I've always played well in Ireland.  I love links golf, and I have to say I think this course suits a lot of golfers, not just me.  I think it will be a strong week and I do look forward to a good week myself.
Q. You tied second at Portrush just up the coast a few years ago.
ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, I think I have three or four seconds in Ireland.  So I look forward to at least another one hopefully.
