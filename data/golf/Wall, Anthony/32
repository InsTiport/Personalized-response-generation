Q.  What's your verdict on the round?
ANTHONY WALL:  I played well.  I had good luck on the greens.  I hit the right spots. For the middle of July it was pretty wet, and cold as well.
Q.  Is this current patch the best you have played?
ANTHONY WALL:  I'm playing well.  I wouldn't say I'm playing that great at the moment.  I think I played better about a month ago.  I'm just doing whatever I can do keep it going.  I have my coach coming over from Australia next week.
Q.  Top 10 in the Order of Merit, thoughts on your chances of getting into the Ryder Cup?
ANTHONY WALL:  Oh, yeah top 10 of the Order of Merit is where you want to be    inaudible.
Q.  What's your game plan tomorrow?
ANTHONY WALL:  Much of the same, keep it out of trouble, drive it long and straight as possible, get it on the greens.
