 Q.  Would you have taken a 70 this morning?  ANTHONY WALL: Once I saw the weather, probably not, and I started really well.  I missed a few sort of short 10, 15 footers, but 70 is an okay start.   Q.  What was it like out there?  ANTHONY WALL: It was beautiful until probably 20 minutes ago.  Slight missed opportunity, but overall it was a decent morning.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANTHONY WALL: Back nine you turn back into it and everything is left-to-right wind, which holds your ball up, so you've got to keep banging it down the left and ignore what's down the right.   Q.  Obviously in 2009 it was a dramatic experience for you.  Can you compare the two?  ANTHONY WALL: Obviously links golf is links golf in a way, but the scoring here will be slightly better, so you've got to get your putting books on.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANTHONY WALL: Apart from myself, probably Jordan Spieth.   Q.  But you can see it's going to get harder over the next days?  ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.   Q.  What would be acceptable?  ANTHONY WALL: Probably double that.  Double that, I'll be somewhere near.
