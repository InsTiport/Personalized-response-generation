   ANTHONY WALL:  I just played some good golf today. I kept it simple, could have holed a few more putts but no blemishes so no bogeys for the last two days, which is unusual for me. I normally throw a few bogeys so it is great. It is tough out here as we are all playing such great golf. I had a great year last year and this year I feel I have not made a good start. I feel I am swinging well, better than I have ever done but not putting things together. To make no bogeys on the weekend is a plus for me as I have been throwing silly shots away which I didn't do last year.
