  Q. 1-over par through ten holes, six birdies in a row over seven or eight holes, had a changed?   
 ANTHONY WALL: I couldn't tell you to be honest. Just kept doing what I've been doing all week. Hit a lot of good shots for three days and the par 5s were there, hit all the greens and had eagle putts and made some other the other two as well.  
  
  Q. What goes through your mind in a round like that?  
 ANTHONY WALL: Keep going I think. Don't happen very often so keep doing.  
  
  Q. Any sense coming into this week it was going to be a good one?  
 ANTHONY WALL: I putted nicely last week, but I didn't really hole that many. I finished Top-10. So I felt my game was in good shape.   
 So if I can stay focussed and fit -- it was quite tiring after a long three weeks, so looking to do well here.   
  
  Q. 83rd on the Order of Merit, fair return on a year's play?   
 ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, I've not really started playing well since July, so yeah, it's about right.   
  
  Q. All set for tomorrow's final round?  
 ANTHONY WALL: Well, I've come these three weeks trying to get Top-5 minimum really because otherwise my Order of Merit doesn't change much. So for me it's just go out there and do the same again.
