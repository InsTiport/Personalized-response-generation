Q. What are your thoughts, a very tough match against Richard Green?
ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, I always thought it would be a tough game.  He's a terrific player and super putter.  Obviously really pleased to get through.  He came back at me at the end and I managed to hang on and do him in an extra hole.  That was a really, really good game.
Q. Looked like there was a fair bit of nip and tuck.  There wasn't much between you.
ANTHONY WALL: We played pretty evenly.  I hit a couple good shots on the back nine and then converted and he did the same on the last few.  So it was a really great game.
Q. When he birdies the last to force extra time, you're thinking, oh, come on, one last dig here, one bit more of resolve?
ANTHONY WALL: It's funny, when I had a downslope bunker shot, and I actually thought I played it really well, it just pulled up.  I actually would have had another go at it.  I thought it was pretty good, just pulled up ten foot short and miss-read it.
All credit to him.  He did really well and overall it was a great game, I have to say.
Q. Do you feel better and better, the more advanced you get in this tournament, now that you can sense the prize, if you like.
ANTHONY WALL: It's tough, isn't it.  Every day you're playing someone different and you feel different, so you just have to take each game.  But I've played better every day and every round, so that's encouraging.
