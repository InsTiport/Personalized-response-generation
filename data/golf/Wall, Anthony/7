 Q.  What a finish, a wonderful way to close out the match?  
ANTHONY WALL: Not often you finish two, three on any course, so I was doubly chuffed.  Hit a lovely 4-iron to 17 and made birdie.  My two best shots were just short and chipped in, a great finish.   
 Q.  It had been tough prior to that.  Looked like you were, hesitate to say, in control.  You had the match, and then he came back, then you need to turn the corner again.  
ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, exactly the right description.  It was that way.  We were sort of jostling position, and then I got a couple ahead.  Didn't give him a couple because he made two good pars on two strong holes.  Managed to come back, so it was fantastic.   
 Q.  How do you assess your standard play, because you haven't been entirely happy with it across the course of the week, but the results are there.  
ANTHONY WALL: I'm not overly happy but I'm hitting a lot of good drives.  I've been chipping well, to be honest and my short game has been good.  My irons are okay.  They are not amazing, but they are didn't and it's working.  Long may it continue.   
 Q.  And the course is splendid in this weather.  
ANTHONY WALL: Perfect place to be.  It's gorgeous.   
 Q.  Semifinals this afternoon, Oliver Fisher?  
ANTHONY WALL: Yeah, that will be good.  Two more English.  It will be a good game.  He's obviously playing a little bit better, which is good news for him, so it will be a good match.
