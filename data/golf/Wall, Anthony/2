Q. Another great round for you, first bogey of the day on the last there, which you just said is playing quite long but another great run of birdies during the round?
ANTHONY WALL: Yes, played well.  Putted good from sort of ten or 12 feet, which is the key around here.  Greens are very good and they are quite flat around the hole.  So you have every chance of holing these ten-, 12-footers, which is great.  I did play well.  I was very pleased with today.
It got colder and the wind was picking up and it was more of a crosswind.  It was good to get off to such a strong start because then it made the back nine play easier mentally for myself.
Q. Feel like the game is in good shape at the moment?  It's a tough course when it's starting to blow like it is now.
ANTHONY WALL: It is, and there are a lot of doglegs out there and we don't know it as well as some.  It's a great test.
Q. And obviously the extra incentive is there's an Open Championship place up for grabs.  I think you qualified in South Africa last year.  Is that on your mind at the moment?
ANTHONY WALL: Not particularly.  Not particularly.  I'm more concerned with doing well this week.  Obviously a result and an open spot would be fantastic.  But at the moment we're only halfway through.
So at the moment it's like halfway around the grand national.  Trying to keep shooting 68s, 67s, 66s, those sort of scores, and that will give me a chance.
