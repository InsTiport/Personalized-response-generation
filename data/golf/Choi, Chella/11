 Q.  Even par today.  Happy with your round?  
CHELLA CHOI: Oh, I missed two, three putt, so that's problem.  Key is just putting, so I just practice my putting.   
So hope weekend is better.   
 Q.  You're only one off the lead right now.  You feeling confident you can put some more birdies up on the weekend?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yes.  This is like a lot of birdie, you know.  I think afternoon tee off players better the score, so I just keep -- just focus on birdie every hole after 36 hole.   
 Q.  How was the course playing today compared to yesterday?  
CHELLA CHOI: Way easier than yesterday, but I don't know why score.  You know, but like greens firm -- greens not firm -- greens soft than yesterday, but not much wind.   
So I can go to just straight to the pin, but yesterday I just follow my (indiscernible).   
Pretty same yesterday, so that's why I didn't make a birdie.
