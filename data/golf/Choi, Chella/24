Q. Let's start off.  How do you feel to be back?  What did it feel driving back to the course?  Did you get to the course today?

Q. Is there something about your game that fits this course?  Is that why you won last year?
CHELLA CHOI: Yeah, because this course is very narrow and a little bit dogleg right to left a lot.  If I miss right side I don't have chance second shot, so always miss left is okay.
