Q. I see you still haven't gotten your dad off the bag yet.
CHELLA CHOI: Yes, I know, like he's come back.  I want to work with my dad, so he comes back, so we played good today.  So it was good.
Q. What did that win do for you?  Did it give you confidence?
CHELLA CHOI: Yeah, of course.  It's really good experience for me.  I am a winning player, so I can do my second win.
Q. How is it being home in Korea?  Are you having a great time this week?
CHELLA CHOI: Of course, I'm so excited.  My whole family here.  My whole family came here.
Q. What did the dinner mean to you on Monday night?  Got to take everyone out and have a good time.
CHELLA CHOI: You like it?
Q. It was great.
CHELLA CHOI: Of course, I love it, like a lot of players love it.  Try to enjoy some Korean barbeque and Korean food, and you guys sitting on the ground first time, right.  I'm really happy.
Q. It's different in the States when some family comes out; they can go anywhere in the States.  But you come to Korea, and this is the one time when it's a really big, big deal.  Is there added pressure because you have so many fans here, family here, and so many people watching?
CHELLA CHOI: This tournament is my favorite tournament the whole year, because you know, my hometown and my whole family came out here.  And I'm really happy like just one event in Korea, but I'm so excited and I'm really proud of my country.
