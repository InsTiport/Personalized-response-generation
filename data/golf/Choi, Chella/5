 Q.  How nice is it to get off to a good start here?  
CHELLA CHOI: We are lucky today, Thursday.  Like beautiful weather, golf condition is really good.  Last couple days, practise rounds is really bad, but today, beautiful weather.  Beautiful golf course.  Very calm.  So it's really different golf course, so that's why a little easier.  Basically a little easier.   
 Q.  How do you like this course?  
CHELLA CHOI: Pretty good.  That's why 6-under.  Very calm.  Like no wind.  Like we can make a lot of birdie chance and no wind, we have a lot of chance and we can make like easy putting, reading and we can go stroke.  If I make like a good stroke, I make it.  It's really good day to play golf today.   
 Q.  How does your approach change tomorrow with the forecast?  
CHELLA CHOI: I don't really want to think right now.  Windy day, right?  Everybody saying, so just keep saying, so just keep like confidence in myself and calm myself and just focus on my game and my shot.   
 Q.  Do you typically like links-style courses?  
CHELLA CHOI: No.  No.  I don't like it but I play last week, but really not good.  It's not links-style British Open.  The shot was good, but putting a little tough last week.  So I practise a lot putting and I trying to make more confidence for myself.   
 Q.  So you felt confident out there today?  
CHELLA CHOI: Better.  Much better.
