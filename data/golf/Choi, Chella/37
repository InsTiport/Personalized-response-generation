  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Chella Choi into the interview room.   Looks like you found a little wardrobe.   Did it happen before you teed off?   
CHELLA CHOI:   No.   No.9 putting, switched my divot, and pulled my pocket.   
THE MODERATOR:   At least you have tights on.   
CHELLA CHOI:   This morning a little bit cold so I try leggings, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Can you take me through the round today, what went well.   
CHELLA CHOI:   I play really good today.   Same yesterday.   Shot it really good today.   I hit 16 the green, 12 hit the fairway.   So shot was really good.   
THE MODERATOR:   This will be your first LPGA Tour victory, maybe premature, but what are your thoughts going into the weekend?

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   66, 67, how good do you think that is on this course through 36 holes?

 Q.   This course is known for giving up low scores.   Do you think if you maintain that, where you're in that 3‑under, 4‑under, 5‑under, do you think that will be enough to win or do you think there will be other people coming at you who will go much lower?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I don't know.   I have two more day.   I don't care other players.   I just try keep low my score, yeah.

CHELLA CHOI:   Olympics?   
   
 Q.   Yes, in 2016.   
CHELLA CHOI:   A lot of Korean players.   Very lot, right?   
I try, but I need more experience.   Yeah, I try.   
   
 Q.   What do you think it will mean to have that as an Olympic sport, to prepare for that?
