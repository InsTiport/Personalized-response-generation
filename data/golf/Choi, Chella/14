 Q.  What a fantastic round.  How did you manage to keep going in some difficult weather?  
CHELLA CHOI: I could focus on the game today, like very tough conditions.  Rains a lot every hole.  I'm trying to enjoy.  Everybody is in the same conditions.  I made one bogey, and bogey-free yesterday, and today, made just one bogey.  So I'm really happy today.   
 Q.  Have you played in such conditions before?  
CHELLA CHOI: Of course every year, right.  I remember a couple years ago here, but you know, I played last week.  But condition is bad then last week.   
But pretty tough conditions today, but it's okay.  I know from last week.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy the challenge or do you think it's too cold?  
CHELLA CHOI: Of course not, but I think I can focus on my game.  My driver, my driving is pretty straight than other players I think.  So I think this condition is okay.   
 Q.  And you like the links golf?  
CHELLA CHOI: Of course.  It's just one time in the year, I try to enjoy here.   
 Q.  What bits do you enjoy doing?  Is it keeping the ball low?  Is it the challenge?  What about playing links golf you like?  
CHELLA CHOI: If I miss the fairway, it's very tough but I hit yesterday and today, all hit the fairway.   
 Q.  Every hole?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yes, every hole.  So it's not too tough for me, but a little wind and rain every hole.  But I'm trying to do my best this week.   
 Q.  A lot of people are mentioning the pace of the greens.  How do they change when the rain started coming down this afternoon?  
CHELLA CHOI: You know, change fast.  It's windy, windy day, so I'm trying to, if I am putting, before putting, okay, past the hole, past the hole, so it's not too hard for me, yeah.
