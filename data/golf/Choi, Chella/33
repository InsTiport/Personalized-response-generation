Q.   Great round, just take me through your day. 
CHELLA CHOI:   Thank you.   I played really good today.   My position is really good, my shot was good.   But, some of my tee shot missed, but always my second shot or third shot, my shot was good.   So confidence is better than before.   Hopefully do my best tomorrow. 

Q.   Really with this golf course, placement is so key.   How much is that giving you confidence, like you said, your second or third shots? 
CHELLA CHOI:   I just focus my, how do I say, my spot, so I just try just focus just my spot and it's the right side.   I trust my shot, so shot was good.

Q.   Was there a particular point in the round today that you knew that you were playing well and that perhaps you could put up a really good score to keep yourself up in contention?
CHELLA CHOI:   I don't know why, I practice Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday's Pro‑Am today, I can't understand, because two low score, I think like second day is 5‑under, 6‑under winning, but a lot of players, pretty great, they have very good shot and very good swing.   Yeah, amazing. 

Q.   And how did you feel about your game entering this week?   Have you been feeling confident early in the year? 
CHELLA CHOI:   I'm really, really tired Monday, so I rest Tuesday.   I played Pro‑Am Wednesday, but I played with president here of golf course and captain, so they know spot, so pretty good for me.   And confidence, my swing and my condition is much better, so, yeah.
