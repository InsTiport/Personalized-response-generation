Q.   Great round.   You're tied for the lead right now at 8‑under par.   Tell me how you played today? 
CHELLA CHOI:   Actually, my condition is bad yesterday and two days ago my left shoulder is hurting and very tight.   But yesterday I massaged it there, so my condition is better, and my shot and putting was a perfect day today.

Q.   Talk about all those birdies today?
CHELLA CHOI:   I'm very happy.   I know I don't know how I make the putt.   But very good putting stroke today, and I can read it really good today, so, yeah.

Q.   You've been playing really well this year.   Just talk about how you feel right now just with your whole game. 
CHELLA CHOI:   I work out really hard last winter for my driving distance, and just focused on my driving distance and my workout. 
So I'm not tired after third or fourth round.   So my feel is better and my shot is confident from experience.   So, yeah.

Q.   So this is a big week for you.   It's your 22nd birthday?
CHELLA CHOI:   Uh‑huh, I'm very happy because a couple years ago and last year I'm very unhappy.   Missed the cut two years, so I'm very happy this year.

Q.   Your birthday is tomorrow?
CHELLA CHOI:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   So how nice would it be to shoot a really low round on your birthday tomorrow? 
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, hopefully I'll do my best.
