 Q.  Chella Choi, 5-under today.  Great job.  First round tied for the lead.  How are you feeling after day one?  
CHELLA CHOI: Pretty good.  I could focus on the game today.  It was windy and tough out there, but every player in same condition, so try to calm myself and control myself.   
 Q.  I saw you got off to a good start today.  What was the key to getting off to a good start and getting yourself in the red?  
CHELLA CHOI: Last week we off, so my condition is really good and my shot is really good, so I just focus on my short game.   
Starting is really good.  Like I made a par, par, and, you know, starting a lot of good birdies, so good.   
 Q.  Was there any pivotal moments today in your round today?  Any big moments, long putts, anything like that?  
CHELLA CHOI: Nothing.  Shot was really good today.  (Indiscernible.)   
 Q.  A lot of players were talking about that this course and the conditions were playing a little tougher this year than maybe in previous years with the wind and cooler conditions.  Did you see that as well?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yeah, I felt little bit shorter than my distance, shorter than last year, but everybody is same condition and today is a lot of wind.  I just focus on just my shot.   
 Q.  Are you excited for the rest of the week and trying to go chase another victory?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yeah, very exciting and, you know, like this golf course a lot of the birdie in the course, so trying to focus on just a lot of birdie, 18 hole birdie.  Yeah.
