Q. What's been the key to your strong play through these first two rounds?
CHELLA CHOI: First, I played double yesterday my birthday, 26.  And birthday everybody congratulated me, so I'm very happy.  Before the tee shot, the conditions were really good and I was very happy.  I worked really hard the last three weeks, off week.  So my condition and my game is better, it's more stronger than before, so the game's easier.
Q. Where were you at and what were you doing to work on your game over the past three weeks when LPGA was off?
CHELLA CHOI: Before three weeks off, we had a tournament a lot, nine weeks.  But I was very tired, so I tried to work out really hard so my tee shot is better.  I want to hit a hard tee shot every four days.  So I focus on my just driving game, so my game is better.  And confidence is better, so shot is better.
Q. Did you see a coach or anything during those three weeks or was it just kind of you working on it yourself?
CHELLA CHOI: I worked really hard with my coach, Mike Bender Golf training, so I worked out really hard at the academy on my golf swing a lot.
Q. And your birthday, did you do anything special to celebrate?
CHELLA CHOI: Feels like a tired today.  I'm 26 (laughing).
Q. How difficult is it?  I know you had to come out here early, get a couple holes in, finish up your first round and play 18 more pretty quickly.  How did you deal with that?
CHELLA CHOI: Very tough.  I just had four hours sleep last night because almost 9 o'clock, 9:00pm and we woke up before 4am, so we're starting at 7:00.  But we moved to 6:55, so it was really hard.  So I want to go home and nap.
