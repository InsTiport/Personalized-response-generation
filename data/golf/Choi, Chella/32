  THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'd like to welcome current co‑leader in the second round of the Wegmans LPGA Championship, Chella Choi.   Thank you so much for coming in.   
CHELLA CHOI:   Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR:   A little bit tougher out there today.   You were able to grind it out, but yesterday you had six birdies and a bogey.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   Not quite as good today, but still pretty good.   Just tell me about your round, please.   
CHELLA CHOI:   I had a great round today, but like I made ‑‑ I hit 14 fairways yesterday, but today just was 11.   But it's not bad, but bad than yesterday.   And my shot is good than yesterday, but I missed a couple of birdie putts, just inside five yards.   So like a little bit disappointed, and yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Can you just take us through your birdies and your bogeys?   You birdied the 11th hole which was your second hole of the day.   
CHELLA CHOI:   11 hole make birdie.  
THE MODERATOR:   What did you hit into there?   
CHELLA CHOI:   I hit driver in fairway and second shot is a 20 hybrid, and third shot is 9‑iron, 9‑iron, 120 yards and two yards back pin to the hole.   So yeah.   And two feet.   And I made a birdie.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then you bogeyed the 12th hole, your third hole of the day.   What happened there?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Same as 11 hole and No. 12.   So I had really confidence.   And a little bit pulled, so I missed chip‑in and two yards I missed the putt.  
THE MODERATOR:   Another bogey at the 16th hole, your seventh hole of the day.   What happened there.  
CHELLA CHOI:   I made a birdie.  
THE MODERATOR:   Birdie at 16.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah.   I hit driver really good fairway, and second shot 130 yards, I hit 8‑iron, and maybe six yards and I made birdie.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then the first hole, your tenth.   What happened there?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Pretty long hole, No. 1.   I hit driver and hit the 20 hybrid, but a little bit short.   But I missed my chip‑in, like a little bit past the hole.   So yeah.   I missed the par putt two yards.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then number six, the birdie.   
CHELLA CHOI:   Number six I hit a really good second shot right to the hole, like nine yards.   So I had a three‑putt.   
THE MODERATOR:   That's a bogey.   Sorry.   I had those mixed up.  
CHELLA CHOI:   That's okay.  
THE MODERATOR:   Sorry, Chella.   Any questions for Chella today?   
   
 Q.   Sounds like your chipping was a little off today.   Was that ‑‑ you know, you mentioned chipping a couple of times.   Did you struggle a little bit with that?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I had two times mistake, like on No. 1 I had a chipping 18 yards.   Looked like uphill, but over past the hole, like just grass, but I tried uphill, so past the hole.   
And No. 6, the same, like looks like uphill and over the hole, like play a little bit downhill, but I had a little bit hard my putting.   
   
 Q.   Chella, on that No. 1 hole, how disappointing was it to know that your approach stopped short of the green?   It looked like the mud stopped it short where on a good day you probably would have been on.   
CHELLA CHOI:   Looked like uphill and green is soft, so I try 50 percent carry and 50 percent run.   But I hit it good, but too fast.   
   
 Q.   Chella, on a course that's this difficult with rough this tough, how are you going to prepare for 36 holes tomorrow?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I think just focus on my driving, my driving accuracy, not distance.   So try just focus on inside round.  
   
 Q.   Will you do anything tonight differently than you would if it were an 18‑hole round as opposed to 36?  
THE MODERATOR:   Will you change your routine tonight because there's 36 holes tomorrow.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Nothing.   I try ‑‑ and I have a really good experience for a couple of years ago, a U.S. Open sectional qualifying.   That is 36‑hole round.   So I have two, three times I play.   So I can do it.   Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Do you have a message written on your hand to yourself?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Secret.   
THE MODERATOR:   It's a secret.   Is it a reminder for you?   Something to think about.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah.   Before tee shots, like, okay, I try just focus just one spot, like yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Okay.   I can't understand the Korean writing.   
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah.   It's a secret.   
THE MODERATOR:   It's a secret.   Okay.   
   
 Q.   Given where you are at 4‑under ‑‑ is it four?   4‑under for the tournament, how confident are you that you're poised to contend for tomorrow going into tomorrow?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I think that course is really hard, fairways so small and greens are small.   
But I have a really good ‑‑ I played really good yesterday, so I have confidence better than last couple weeks.   So I think just trust my swing and focus on my every before shot.   So I think ‑‑ I think same looking today and yesterday, I think I can do it tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR:   How did your dad do today as caddy?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Pretty good.   He did really good today, but I missed some putts.   So yeah, we can play good tomorrow hopefully.  
   
 Q.   What do you think you're doing the best in your game, in all of your game, what do you think you're doing the best of all the strokes?  
CHELLA CHOI:   Driving accuracy, and I think my shot is really good now.   Feeling is good and confidence is good.   Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right, Chella.   Thank you so much for coming in.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Thank you very much.
