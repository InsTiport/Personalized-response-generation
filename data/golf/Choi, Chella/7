 Q.  Bogey-free 65, the best round of the year.  What worked so well for you today?  
CHELLA CHOI: I couldn't focus on the game very today.  This morning a little chilly.  I trying to warm jacket, two warm jacket, and I just focus on shot and shot.   
I play really good and my putter really help for me, so I really enjoyed it today.   
 Q.  Yeah.  It certainly got hot with you on the course.  Three birdies to end your round.  Founders Cup last week you put all four rounds you under par.  What did you find in your game last week to bring here to Kia?  
CHELLA CHOI: I like this golf course, and last week, too, but I really good memory here and beautiful weather, course condition, and beautiful flowers.  Very positive think and do my best.   
 Q.  You've been at the Kia Classic ever single year the tournament's been held.  How has that experience helped you out on the course today?  
CHELLA CHOI: You know, I know this golf course and I know everywhere, so I try to keep the fairway and fairway is easy and green is small, so if I hit the green like a lot of birdie chance in this golf course.   
So if I hit the fairway and greens, a lot of birdie chances out there.
