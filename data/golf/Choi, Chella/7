Q. Today, windy.
CHELLA CHOI: I know.
Q. How was the wind affecting your play today?
CHELLA CHOI: It's so hard.  It's so hard.  I couldn't focus on the game very today.  My father work really good today, so he gave me a perfect yardage today.
So, you know, around greens really tough, so I trying to which way is better, so that one is very good.
Q. Okay.  So you finished on the back, correct, you finished on No. 9?
CHELLA CHOI: Uh-huh.
Q. And so you birdied 7 and 8 to get yourself to 2-under.  Tell me about those two birdies.
CHELLA CHOI: Before tournament I think back nine is little harder, but back nine is 1-under and I starting No. 1 made a birdie, 2-under.  So very exciting to like I play good.
But first easy No. 4?  5?  No.4, par-3, I (indiscernible) way short and made a bogey.
No. 5 is really tough hole, so made a bogey so even.  So I really tough.
And No. 7, par-3, made ten yard.  So really good read to make that, so made a putt.
And No. 8 is par-5, so easy par-5.
Q. You're only two back of the lead right now.  The score could change.  How do you feel going into tomorrow and the next two days?
CHELLA CHOI: Very exciting.  You know, this is my like very good -- a lot of the good memory in here.  Couple years ago play really good.
And when I came here to hotel, you know, a lot of the good stuff and my picture on there.  When I on my TV a lot of my picture on there, so I'm very exciting and really, really thankful to Blue Bay.
