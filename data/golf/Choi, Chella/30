Q.   Well, good round.   No bogeys?
  CHELLA CHOI:   Yes.
Q.   Was today very important in minimizing the stakes or getting a low round?   What was your game plan coming into today? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Well, today course conditions a little bit wetter than yesterday, so I tried more to carry the pin.   So I had more birdie chances than birdie yesterday and no bogeys today.   So good up‑and‑downs. 
  I think 16, 17, 18, I don't make the birdies, so I think I will be good tomorrow, and I'll do my best.
Q.   You're always in the mix, and you always make a run on Saturday.   Do you think you do that? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   16, 17, 18, I like those holes.   So I think three holes, two birdies I tried, but no birdies, so, yeah.
Q.   Is there anything about Saturdays that you think you play particularly well? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Saturday is moving day, right?   So I had five birdies, no bogeys, so pretty good score.   But I had a lot of chances and no birdies on par‑5.   So I think I will try more birdies on par‑5s tomorrow.
Q.   So you think the rainy conditions from last night helped you definitely want to go aggressive? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, yeah.
Q.   How about the rest of the people in your group?   Was everybody playing aggressively and going for the pin? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, yeah, they did the same thing trying to.
Q.   Do you think that attributes to a lot of low scores today? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, I think so.
Q.   What about tomorrow?   Do you think it will dry out a little bit or stay the same? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Maybe no rain tonight, right? 
Q.   I don't know. 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Maybe, so I think it will be drier than today.   Maybe some conditions as yesterday for tomorrow.
Q.   You're still in the hunt.   Is dad really trying to get you to win? 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, hopefully.   But I don't know, how is the score?   4 behind, right? 
Q.   Yeah, I think you're 4, but you can make it up. 
  CHELLA CHOI:   Thank you, thank you so much.
