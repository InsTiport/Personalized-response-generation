 Q.  2-Under this afternoon.  What was working for you today?  
CHELLA CHOI: I play good and follow yesterday, but starting is not good.  Starting two bogey, but I trying to be patient and focus on shot by shot.   
Really good comeback and I made three birdies, so it's really good finish.   
 Q.  What did you tell yourself to keep yourself in it after the two bogeys to start?  
CHELLA CHOI: Before shot, before tee off, I just keep I want to play like keep the fairway.  I missed two green in par-3 so I change my mind like hit the fairway and hit the green.   
 Q.  What was the adjustment from playing early in the morning yesterday to the afternoon today?  
CHELLA CHOI: Green condition is different, like a lot of bumpy.  Little different condition, but everything very good, weather and people and flowers so good, so I trying to keep my just my score.   
 Q.  How do you adjust for those green conditions as the day wears on?  
CHELLA CHOI: Little hard.  It's bumpy.  But everybody same condition so don't care.  Just hitting, just stroke.
