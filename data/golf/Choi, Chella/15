 Q.  Not a lot of wind out there.  Talk about the conditions and how you were able to get a good round going.  
CHELLA CHOI: The course condition is really good, and the greens are a little soft, so sometimes before putting I'm just trying to, okay, past the hole, past the hole.  But sometimes just feel a little bit short.  But made five birdies today, so good today.   
 Q.  Did today's round kind of remind you of 2015 out here?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yes, this is my favorite tournament, and this is everything good memory and everything -- everything good in here.  I'm trying to remind and try to win, but three more days, and just play morning tee off, play just finished, so I have three more days chance, and I'll try and do my best.   
 Q.  What do you like about playing here?  Obviously you won here a few years ago.  
CHELLA CHOI: Because I won three years ago.  Everything good memory, and everybody knows and everybody cheers for me.  That's why, I think.   
 Q.  What were you hitting well?  What were you playing well today?  
CHELLA CHOI: I don't know, first before tee off, very confident here, and I know this golf course very well, so I talked with my dad, and pretty good layout and pretty good -- you know, like a little different No. 18, different course shape than last year.  But I made a birdie, so good thing.
