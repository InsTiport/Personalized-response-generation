 Q.  So up and down all day, right?  Talk about today's round.  
CHELLA CHOI: A little bit disappointed the last couple holes, I struggled with those shots.  I think this position is not too bad for the weekend and looking forward to the next two days.   
 Q.  What do you need to work on now after that round?  
CHELLA CHOI: I think my shot was very good.  But like I just sometimes miss a little left.  So I figure it out right now and maybe tomorrow is better.  But it's very good here.   
 Q.  What do you do to correct that, your miss left?  
CHELLA CHOI: I think my before shot, like my mind is just go to hole.  Like I want to make a birdie.  So too much want to make birdie.   
 Q.  Is it playing really difficult out there?  Did it play more difficult?  
CHELLA CHOI: Today is a little bit difficult because distance is shorter than yesterday, so more long club than yesterday.  So when I hit No. 3, No. 4, yesterday, 7-iron, but today, it's really, really hard 20 hybrid.  So 7 is way different club, right.  So a little different, but maybe tomorrow is better.   
 Q.  Is it at least a good feeling that you may not have played your best, but you're still up near the top of the leaderboard?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yes, so I'm very excited with my position right now, and I like this feel.  Like a little nervous but I like this feel, yeah.
