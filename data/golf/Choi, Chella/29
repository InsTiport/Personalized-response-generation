 Q.   You're playing really well and then you have a two‑hour delay.   Was it difficult to come back and still have the rhythm you had going when you were playing earlier?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, it was two‑hour delay, but like after play 9 and weather is bad, so...   
I'm sorry, I can't focus.  
   
 Q.   Ask the question again?   
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You were playing really well before the rain delay, and then you have the rain delay and you come back.   Was that difficult to adjust to?   
CHELLA CHOI:   I not play this morning.   I play already yesterday two round, and I play nine hole and delay, maybe one hour delay.  
We play again.   Still condition is really good.   My shot is good.   My putting is good.   That's why play is good today.  
   
 Q.   A lot of things picked up for you in the last two days.   Thursday you shot +2; here you are at ‑5, ‑6.  
CHELLA CHOI:   Actually, my shot is good, but I don't make that much putting.   So just one birdie No. 17 Thursday.  
But yesterday and today my shots really good and made putt more.  
   
 Q.   Comes down to putting?  
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, putting more.  
   
 Q.   What was it like to finish on 18 with a birdie to propel you into tomorrow?  
CHELLA CHOI:   You know, like my play is really good before No. 18.   I made birdie No. 17, so I had confident and I try one more birdie.  
Greens are soft, so I try like (indiscernible) shot.   I like yardages so I hit 70‑yard third shot.   So that's good.   And I made a birdie.  
   
 Q.   What do you feel about your chances going into tomorrow and winning?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I didn't see score, but close, right?   So I have a chance.  
But after Thursday it's really tough like too much score.   Now really close, so I have a chance.   You know, I have a really a lot of confidence and a lot of experience, so I try my best tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   I know that your dad is on the bag for you.   Is he hoping you have a win so he can retire?  
CHELLA CHOI:   Yeah, so exciting.   Just one more day, right?   
   
 Q.   How has that been having him on the bag for you?  
CHELLA CHOI:   I'm seven year this year LPGA Tour.   We work together eight years, so one year Symetra Tour and seven year LPGA.  
So I hopefully tomorrow I have chance again, so I try do my best.
