 Q.  You started from the back nine, so not very well, your front nine, but great after.  
CHELLA CHOI: First front nine -- I start on 10.  So 10 through No. 18, very good up-and-down on some holes.  So I have confidence starting the first hole.   
 Q.  So when did you arrive?  
CHELLA CHOI: Yesterday.   
 Q.  So no practice?  
CHELLA CHOI: No practice.  Just I hit some balls yesterday and I just played just one hole, No. 10, because I start 10 today.  But it's okay.  My caddie -- my father caddies, so my caddie walked 18 yesterday, so I trust my father.   
 Q.  This is the third time you've played.  So you are familiar with this golf course, right?  
CHELLA CHOI: I played so well the first year, and last year is not good.  But this tournament, I like this golf course, because the shape is very good and condition is very good, but green is a little bit slow.   
But everything is very good condition here.  So I like this golf course, but last year, so bad.  I want to play better this year.   
 Q.  Everyone said, most Chinese said, the top golf course, right, just 1-under, maybe 2-under --  
CHELLA CHOI: Last year, conditions are more harder because if I hit the green, always over.  But this year, like if I hit the green, it stops, my ball.  It's easier than last year.  It's more easier because last year very difficult.
