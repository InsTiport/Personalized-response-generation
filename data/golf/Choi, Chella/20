Q. Can you tell us about the dinner that you hosted?  For instance, the turnout was higher than you expected, what it was like?  For those players who were not able to attend, could you elaborate a little on the dinner?
CHELLA CHOI: I host this dinner every year.  Initially it started out as a dinner to the staff, but then I started inviting players.
So this year we had more players than staff members.  I really enjoyed the dinner.  There were some players that could not attend.  I usually extend the invitation a week prior to this championship, but there are players who don't come for two weeks straight, so I was not able to invite them.
But they understood, so we had a good time.
Q. In particular, players like Brooke Henderson, it's her first time to Korea and she's never had Korean food before.  Do you think it's more meaningful for them?
CHELLA CHOI: I travel a lot with my family and a lot of players travel with their family.  I wanted to host a dinner where the players and their family can have a good time.
For Brooke, it was the first time coming to Korea, so I wanted to show her how Koreans eat sitting cross-legged on the floor.  She actually drank alcohol.  I'm not quite sure she's legal drinking age.
I think she had a good time.
Q. Do you plan to host the dinner next year and perhaps make it bigger next year?
CHELLA CHOI: I think a long as players want to and are interested I will continue to host the dinner until I retire.
