Q. So close for you, but you've got to feel mixed emotions, I would think, coming off the course.
KATHERINE KIRK: Yeah, obviously nice to finish with a birdie.  That kind of takes some of the sting out of bogeying 16 and 17.  But yeah, I mean, I did my best.  That's all I can ask for.  I mean, I'll probably think a bit more about it tonight and next week, and be a little bit maybe bittersweet more.
I don't know, I feel like I did everything I could today.  So yeah, I guess I can be happy with that.
Q. It's been a great season, a career resurgence for you.  We talked a little about it yesterday.  Do you see a bright future ahead for you?
KATHERINE KIRK: Yeah, definitely.  I know I'm doing the right stuff, so it's nice to see it paying off on the golf course.  Yeah, every week that you play well, you get in contention, you get that little bit more comfortable being up there.  Yeah, just comfortable in that position.
So yeah, I don't know, looking forward to finishing off the year and maybe get another W.  The girls are so good out here; it's just fun to be able to compete again and know I've got the right stuff.  It's fun.
