 Q.  Coming back and being able to close out your match this morning, how big was that for you guys?  
KATHERINE KIRK: Yeah, nice.  It's going to be hopefully a longer day for us if we get through -- I assume we're going to be in the playoff.   
SU OH: We've played 14 once, so we know what we're doing on 14.  Kat played great this morning.   
KATHERINE KIRK: We ham-and-egged it well again.   
SU OH: Yeah, we're a great team.   
KATHERINE KIRK: Made some birdies at the right time, and yeah, nice to --   
SU OH: We were feeding off each other, too.  We were both playing quite solid, so we'd just trust that one is going to stiff it, so we could be aggressive with it.   
 Q.  Did you get a lot of confidence from that win over the Koreans the second round?  
KATHERINE KIRK: We did, yeah.  We, again, played well at the right times, and they struggled a little bit, so I mean, we knew that kind of if we could make some birdies early and get up early that it would be to our advantage, and it worked out that way, which was great.
