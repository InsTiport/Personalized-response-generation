Q. That was harder than it had to be, seven years removed from your last win.  Talk about making that last putt, and can you put it into words?
KATHERINE KIRK: Not really.  So much hard work and patience, and I had a rough couple years like 2015 and 2016, and just an amazing team behind me.  My husband has been 100 percent supportive the whole time.  Yeah, I can't put it into words.  It's just a great feeling.
Q. How much does it mean to you that you were able to keep yourself in it?
KATHERINE KIRK: I mean, they were just encouraging me the whole time, and I mean, it's just -- yeah, it's like having, I guess, extra people out there cheering you on and knowing that you've got support back home and people pulling for you and praying for you.  Yeah, it means a lot.  It's an individual sport, but it's certainly a team effort.
Q. Ashleigh played great all day, but talk about how you were able to finish it off.
KATHERINE KIRK: You know, to be honest, I hit like a really kind of low skuller on 14, and I was like, oh, gosh, I need something to happen here because I was just struggling.  But Ashleigh played great all day.  Yeah, I put the pressure on her.  Pretty fun finish there.  I knew I had to make it, and she played great, so all credit to her.
