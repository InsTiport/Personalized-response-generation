  Q. Gabi just mentioned how cool it was to play with you in her interview.  A future into the insight of Australia golf, it's looking pretty bright?
 KATHERINE KIRK:   Absolutely.  She's got a ton of talent and she's a sweet kid, too.  When she's ready to come out, she'll do great and be great for the Tour.  Nice to play with a young gun and to see that she has a lovely personality, too.
 Q. We've seen the young gun.  You're very experienced.  How does that experience help you going into tomorrow?
 KATHERINE KIRK:   I'd like to think it helps a lot.  I've played out here, I don't know how many years now but certainly being a veteran, got a lot of good rounds here under my belt and good memories, and it's going to be a nerve-wracking day but I've just got to go out there and try and execute as best I can and try and stick to what I've been doing because it's been pretty solid so far.  So don't change anything too much.
 Q. When you say "nerve-wracking," what other kind of things will you do?
 KATHERINE KIRK:   Breathing is about the only thing you can do.  I think anyone that tells you they don't get nervous or higher blood pressure or heart rate is lying.  Yeah, about all you can do is just work on deep breathing and sticking to your routines and hope that that works.
