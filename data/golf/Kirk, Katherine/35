 Q.   Got to run me through the chip shot on 18.   
KATHERINE KIRK:   I had 23 yards to the hole and hit a little gap wedge up there.   I didn't see where it landed, but saw it catch the edge at the last minute and drop in.   
Yeah, pretty happy.  
   
 Q.   Got to be a good feeling going into tomorrow.   
KATHERINE KIRK:   Yeah, got off to a great start today.   Just stalled a bit through I guess the middle of the round.   Couldn't get it close enough to make putts.  
It was nice to finish with a birdie.   I think that will give me some momentum tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   If Lizette finishes at 12, how tough will she be to catch?  
KATHERINE KIRK:   Very tough.   I guess that puts me, what, four behind?   Yeah, I mean, there are birdies out here and it is a crazy game.   I've got memories of coming from six behind at the Canadian Open.   
   
 Q.   Draw upon that?  
KATHERINE KIRK:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   What was that day like?   Take me through that day.   
KATHERINE KIRK:   Shot 3â€‘under; never expected to even have a chance.   Maybe having low expectations kind of helped.  
But, yeah, I mean, I've seen other people come from five or six behind, too.   You just got to go out there and give it your best and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Got some good mojo on this golf course after the double eagle a couple years ago?   
KATHERINE KIRK:   Yeah, I've played this golf course maybe 10 times now, so I feel comfortable on it.   It's playing a little bit different this year than past years.   Usually it's wetter and slower.   It's a bit drier and faster this year, so it's nice.  
   
 Q.   Make it tougher?   
KATHERINE KIRK:   You do have to pay attention more, but I don't know if you can quite say tougher.  
Yeah, just different.   
   
 Q.   All right.   Perfect.
