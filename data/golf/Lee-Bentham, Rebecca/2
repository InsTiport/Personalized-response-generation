 Q.   That birdie at 18 may be massive in the scheme of things, right?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I'm not sure.   I haven't really been keeping track of what the cut is.   I knew that to give myself a best chance that I wanted to make it.   So I left the ball short out there, so the last putt I told myself, don't leave it short.   If I'm going to miss, knock it by ten feet.   I don't care.  
   
 Q.   So some tougher pin placements today?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I think I just didn't hit it well today.   Yeah, just myself.  
   
 Q.   So you going to the range afterwards?  
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Probably, you'll find me.  
   
 Q.   What are you working on?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Just go back to fundamentals.   I just didn't feel quite like my foundations weren't there today.   I tried to go back to it on the golf course, but it's hard to commit to shots just out on the golf course.  
   
 Q.   Just not trusting it today?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   How important is it at this point in the season to make cuts?   This is a crucial part of the year.   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   This is my living, so to make cuts is how I feed myself, so every stroke matters to me, for sure.  
   
 Q.   Rebecca, I was following you.   You had a couple of very close calls.   Just wanted to get your thoughts on those holes, 16 and 17?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah, I mean, coming down the stretch, I knew I had to make birdies.   I tried to give myself chances, but like I said, I just wasn't feeling my swing today, so it's tough out there.   I tried to grind as hard as I could.  
   
 Q.   Now you wait, right?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I do.   I wait and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   What do you do for the rest of the day on a day like this?   Do you watch the screen, stay away from it?   What do you do?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I might check every now and then.   Obviously, I'll check at the end of the day to see if I made the cut.   So I have family here, so I might as well enjoy the rest of the day, work on my swing a bit and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Does the pressure start to mount at this time of the season to try to qualify for the Asian events and to get into those?   What is that like?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   For sure.   Right now I'm on the cut of making it to the Evian.   Obviously, if I do well the next few events I can make it to Asia, and that's obviously my goal.   So right now I'm just taking it one tournament at a time.
