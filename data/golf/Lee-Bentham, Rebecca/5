Q.   Nice 5‑under.   Is that what you finished at? 
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah. 

Q.   Started off with nine straight pars and then got things going on the back.   What was the biggest difference for you on the back nine?
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I just told myself to be patient.   Putts weren't going in on the front nine, but I was making pars.   So I knew if I kept making pars the birdies would come.
It did happen, so back nine I started dropping more putts.   Overall it was a good round.   Bogey‑free.

Q.   When you came in to today, this week, has your game been feeling pretty good?   Have you been pleased with how you're striking the ball? 
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah, my last tournament was the Kia and I missed the cut by one and didn't get into Kraft.   That was a huge learning process to go through that.   It was kind of heartbreaking. 
I spent the next three weeks playing a lot of golf every day rounds, building up my confidence.   Had a lot of good rounds going into this tournament, so I felt confident. 
I just knew if I kept playing the way I did then things would turn out fine.

Q.   Where were you practicing in between?
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   I stayed out in California because right now my home base is Toronto.   I didn't want to go back home in the cold.   I used the opportunity while I was down there and asked courses, any course, if they would be willing to let me play there.   I played all over the southern California area, like San Diego.

Q.   Nice.   So when you made the birdie on 10 did you feel the momentum swing? 
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah, finally I made one.   I knew if I made one, they would keep coming.   I have been stroking it well on the practice green, so just kind of get the feel.

Q.   I saw the other day what happened with your mom.   How is she doing? 
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   She's doing good, luckily.   I mean, I would have felt so bad if something bad happened.   Thank God she's okay.   She came out and watched all 18.   It's nice.

Q.   So just win of those random things.   She follows you around all the time, right?
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah. 

Q.   So it was a little different to have that kind of happen?
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Uh‑huh.   Never happened before.   She stands there to help out, and just one of those freak accidents.   Just so glad and relieved that right now she's fine.

Q.   Hey, it happens to everyone.   Great playing.   Thank you so much.   Best of luck the rest of the week.
