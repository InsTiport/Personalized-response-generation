  REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Not much.   Same mindset.   Played well yesterday.   Hit the ball well.   
Today I think I just left a few out there with putting.   Had a three‑putt on I think 16 or 17 coming in.  
Then I missed like a three‑footer on No. 10.   So that hurt.   
But overall, I felt like I played solid.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your start today.   You birdied 6 of your first ten holes.   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Just staying focused.   My dad was helping me stay focused.   I would kind of get irritated at some shots I didn't feel I hit that solid, but he just kept saying, It's fine; just keep going.   So that helped.  
   
 Q.   Describe the way you played 18.   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   The hole I just played?  
   
 Q.   No.   Your 9, actually.   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Okay.   I hit a good drive.   I just kind of hooked the second shot a little bit, and then I ended up just under the tree with no shot but a low punch shot.  
Hit a pitching wedge, half swing.   I hit it good but just rolled off the back.   I told my dad I would rather chip than putt and then it went in, so I was like, There you go.  
   
 Q.   And your position going into the weekend, assume you feel pretty good about that.   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   Yeah, I'm playing well.   This is the first tournament I kind of got my name up on the leaderboard.   Kind of a new experience for me.  
Finishing last year at the Evian tied for 11th is kind of what I'm drawing back on, being on the leaderboard, staying focused.  
   
 Q.   Can you notice a change in the gallery now that you're on the top of the leaderboard?   
REBECCA LEE‑BENTHAM:   There is definitely more people out there today than there was yesterday.   But, I mean, there is lots of people everywhere, so I'm used to seeing people around.
