 Q.  You had enough game in you to come back and close it out.  Really impressive stuff.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I played terrible on the front side.  We didn't hit any fairways, didn't hit any greens.  And out here on the front side you're not going to play well.  Just kind of hanging out.  It was nice to make the turn, 9 with a birdie, kind of build some momentum, and obviously carried it over to this side, which is nice.   
 Q.  You have so much power.  I'm curious, how many drivers do you hit out here?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Driver every hole.  It's match play, don't be afraid.  I hit the driver well, long and straight, although today wasn't the case, but usually it is.  You've got to take advantage of your length.
