Q. What do you take away from this round?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I felt like I've been doing the same things I've been doing.  I putted a little better, made a few changes in that.  It's working.  I'm hitting it really well.  Just hit it terrible on 2 and I ended up in the worst place possible.  But just got to clean up those silly mistakes, a three-putt.  On 17, the ball probably had a little water on it, so it didn't have any spin, any check-up on it, but that happens.  But you've got to avoid the three-putt and the double.
Q. When you put so many birdies together on your scorecard, what does that do for you confidence-wise?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I'm still confident.  No difference.  I feel like I've been playing pretty good for a while.  I just haven't scored well.  Sometimes the scoring just isn't there.  But I feel like I'm hitting it the same, so I'm pleased.
Q. What have you done with your putting?  Have you changed putters or anything?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   No.
Q. What have you been doing differently?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just going back to old stuff.  Just going back to old stuff.  That's it.
Q. What about the coaching change?  Can you talk about that with us a little bit?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   What about the coaching change?  What about it?
Q. Who are you working with now?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Nobody.
Q. Not Pete?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I bounce ideas off Pete.  I bounce ideas off Butch.  I've said that before.  It's not really much.  I don't need that much coaching.  Me and Claude, we only worked on a few things.  Pretty much still working on those things.  It's not like anything has changed.
Q. And you're feeling healthy?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah.  I feel good.
