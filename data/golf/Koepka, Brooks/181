Q. 1-under par today.  Just a matter of more putts going in tomorrow?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah.  I need to hit the ball better.  I'm still not hitting it that great.  I'm putting awful.  I don't feel comfortable over the putts.  I don't feel like I'm lined up right.  It's just not sitting well in my hands right now.
I don't know what the deal it.  But we're going to work on it right now and hopefully figure it out for tomorrow.
Q. What do you do after a round like that with 18 holes to go, what will you work on tonight to try to change that heading into the final round?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Go back to basics.  It's pretty simple.  I'm not doing too much.  I don't know what it is but we'll take a look at it, just go through some of the drills I do and see where it is from there.
Q. Still in a good position with one to go.  Good luck tomorrow.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Thanks, appreciate it.
Q. Is it a feeling though that you're getting the ball close enough, you're getting those opportunities to make a difference tomorrow?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Kind of.  I don't feel like I'm hitting the ball well.  The shot on 17 I pulled it by ten yards left.  I wasn't even trying to go at that flag.  It comes down to putts.  You got to make putts if you want to win the golf tournament.  I need to do that.
