Q. (No microphone)?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was nice.  Obviously today was a bit tough walking 36, ground is wet.  It's not -- it wasn't ideal for my ankle, but you've got to do it.  We still played pretty well considering where we were on Tuesday, Monday Tuesday.  It's fine.
Q. (No microphone)?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I mean, it's nice.  It comes along.  You play well here, everything is going to take care of itself.  It's one of those things.  I wanted to win, I didn't do that.  At the same time, you've got to look back and realize you played well here, so obviously it's going to take care of itself when it comes to Ryder Cup.
