 Q.  Brooks, how big was that par save on 6 to start your round?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: That was nice. You know, you'd hate to make bogey there. It would, I guess, get the day off on a bad note. But to make that was kind of a momentum-builder and kind of helped me get things going for the round.   
 Q.  It's a marathon day really. With so much at stake, how do you prioritize what you do now between rounds?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'll probably go lay on my physio's bed and probably try to fall asleep, grab some food, and just relax. We've just got 18 more holes. You try not to look at it where there's $15 million. Yeah, it would be nice, but at the same time, just got to go out there -- I've been doing this my whole life. Just go play 18 holes.   
 Q.  You make it sound like just another round of golf.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: That's what it is. It is another round.   
 Q.  What's different about your game yesterday to today?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, just got into some old bad habits. Kind of what it's been like the last few weeks. Just didn't really feel like I've trusted anything. But once I got here today, everything felt good. Just kind of reestablished those -- what I was doing when I got here, those drills, or whatever I was trying to correct.   
 Q.  Given what's at stake this afternoon, does the intensity change at all?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I mean, I'm locked in. I'm locked in on every round. I don't see any point in trying to be more focused. I don't know if that's possible. But you don't just go out there like it's a round with your buddies, either. You just go out there, go focus, and go hit the golf shots you need to hit. And then at the end, total them up, and hopefully you're there. And if not, then I gave it best, and I'm satisfied with that.
