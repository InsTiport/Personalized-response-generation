Q. 6 and 5 win, nice to get off to a great start this week.  Just some opening comments, please.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously feels nice to be back.  My golf game disappeared there for a month and a half.  So it's good to be back.  Putting really well.  The golf game feels really good.  Found some things last week at Bay Hill and built off that today.
But you've got to get off to a good start here.  I didn't do that last year.  And we played pretty well, so just kind of -- it's good to be back, have some confidence.  A course you remember and play well.
Q. What did you find last week?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just we were doing everything we weren't supposed to do.  We were just something under it, flipping on it and kind of hanging back.  And just got to go back to my bread and butter fading the ball.  I don't know if we were trying to draw the ball for a bit and then trying to fade it.  Just felt out of sync.  My body got out of whack.  The rhythm, the timing, everything was just completely off.
We figured it out.  We went to the range Friday night after Bay Hill, after missing the cut, went to the range and probably spent about an hour and a half, two hours there.  I was grinding my butt off the last few weeks.  And unfortunately the hard work didn't pay off early, but it's starting to pay off now.
Q. What worked well out there today?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Today I putted really well.  It's nice to be able to have putts for birdie.  I haven't done that for the last month and a half or so.  I made a lot of putts.  Never felt like I was really out of the hole.  And it's good looking forward to the match tomorrow.
