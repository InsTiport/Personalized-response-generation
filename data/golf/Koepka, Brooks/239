  BROOKS KOEPKA:   Good learning experience.   Looking forward to next week.  
   
 Q.   What did you take from this week?   It was an exciting week.   I love following you.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   You know, just I was very comfortable under the pressure.   You know, on 17, maybe just a bad decision.   You know, I was worried about going a little long instead of being aggressive.  
Swing feels good.   Everything feels good.   Just got to work on those putts under pressure and I'll be fine.  
   
 Q.   You're going to be back.   See you in Vegas?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, I'll be there.   
   
 Q.   Great week.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Assess the week overall.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   You know, tied for third isn't too bad.   Obviously today wasn't the day I expected or anything.   Still good tournament.   Just got to take the bright side and move on to next week.  
   
 Q.   How was it being out there with the lead today?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   It was good.   I felt pretty comfortable.   Things felt good.   Obviously I just didn't get it done.   
But, you know, it happens.   Just learn from it and move on.   
   
 Q.   What's your outlook going into next week now?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I think it's good.   I'm playing good.   Looking forward to it.   Hopefully it'll be a little bit better.
