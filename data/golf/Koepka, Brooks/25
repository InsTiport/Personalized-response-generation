 Q.  I know probably not the week you were looking for, but if we can just get some comments on your play this week.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I struck it really well. Really pleased with how I'm hitting it. I just haven't putted well, and every time I have missed one, I've hit some good shots, but I just end up in the worst place possible. It is very easy out here to turn a decent round into what can be a little bit of a disaster and you can rack up some big numbers pretty quick.   
 Q.  You could never get momentum going it seemed.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: If you're not going to make putts -- a perfect example, I hit it right on the front of 18 green and then three-putted. It's just those little bit of scoring opportunities where -- I think I've played, what, 18 rounds since August? Just need to pick up a little bit, pick up the pace, give it maybe a little bit more touch around the greens, a little bit more feel. But the way I'm striking it, I'm very pleased. I feel very happy with it.   
 Q.  When you've had inactivity, has it been the putting that you've found lacks faster than --  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I struggled a little bit at the end of last year. That's why I kind of changed that putting grip, changed to a new grip. Honestly, it's one thing -- it feels great, and I struck it really well on the putting green, but then it's another thing when the gun goes off. I think every golfer kind of knows that, and you can feel a little bit different.   
 Q.  I know you said earlier in the week that you thought the knee was fine. Physically are you --  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, everything is good. No complaints. It has nothing to do with my knee.   
 Q.  You're not playing next week, I believe?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'll be at Bay Hill. You're going to see me at Bay Hill.   
 Q.  How is your schedule from there?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I've got four more weeks in a row.
