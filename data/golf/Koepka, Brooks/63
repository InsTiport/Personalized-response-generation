 Q.  You said earlier in the week that winning majors might be easier than winning regular Tour events, but how is it to close them out?  That was the most emotional we've seen you in a win.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I mean, I didn't hit the ball in the fairway, so you're going to have some problems out here.  It's a difficult day, difficult golf course, and it just was a battle.  DJ played a hell of a round to come back and to grind it out there.  Very, very satisfied.  This is probably the most satisfied I've been with all the majors.   
 Q.  At what point today did you realize it wasn't going to be easy and what was the most important shot putt?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Probably doesn't sound like much, but the putt on 16 I thought was, just gave me a little bit more confidence coming down the stretch.  I know I missed one on 17, but you know, I think 16 helped me make 18.   
 Q.  And given the wire-to-wire dominance, where do you rankings this among your four majors and with four wins in your last eight starts, does this putt to rest the debate over who is No. 1 in the world?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I don't know, it's up to the World Ranking system or whatever.  I feel like I'm playing good.  This one's definitely at the top of the list of how emotionally spent I am and how mentally spent I am.  This one definitely tops the list.
