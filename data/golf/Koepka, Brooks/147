BROOKS KOEPKA: Obviously it was tough.  You're not going to make many birdies today.  So when you get a chance, I felt like I needed to make it.  You can't make a big number; no doubles, which I'm happy about.  But I'm excited to get to play again this weekend.
Q. Do you need to drive the ball better?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously.
Q. Obviously you're putting great but in order to win this week you need to be better off the tee.
BROOKS KOEPKA: You've just got to stay patient and keep plugging along.
Q. (Inaudible.)
BROOKS KOEPKA: I think I watched maybe like a hole or two.  I watched Dustin for a little bit.  I've got stuff to do, workout, I've got stuff around.  I need to prepare and be ready for today.
Q. (Inaudible.)
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I'm excited about it.  I think it will be interesting this weekend.  I'm excited to play.  And hopefully this rain goes away and we can get some good conditions.
Q. (Inaudible.)
BROOKS KOEPKA: You know, just trying to keep doing what I'm doing.  I feel like I'm playing really well.  And today the putter wasn't as hot, but that happens.  It's tough to make putts when you're not that close to the hole.  But I felt like I only had two really good opportunities today.  So keep doing what I'm doing and playing well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
BROOKS KOEPKA: It wasn't on the green, I promise you that.
