Q.   What was it like going down the stretch? 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   It was fun.   Missed a short putt on 10.   Obviously got a little unlucky, a couple of breaks in the bunker on 11 but it happens.   Played solid and a good week.

Q.   How were your nerves? 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   They were fine, I'm good.   I've been in this spot a little bit lately.   You know, I felt fine. 

Q.   With six holes left, there were 18 players within two shots of the lead.   Were you cognizant of how bunched up the leaderboard was and did that affect your strategy to be more aggressive?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   No, didn't affect my strategy at all.   I saw a bunch at 13 and we were on 14 or so.   Didn't make a difference.   Still got to go out and do your thing.

Q.   This has been an amazing learning experience for 20 months as a professional what will you learn from? 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just got to putt better.   Some wayward shots under pressure but it's fun, learn from it.
