Q. Brooks, you came in here as one of the favorites, but you came up just a buck or two shy in Vegas.  Your thoughts.
BROOKS KOEPKA: I didn't putt very well on the weekend.  Ball striking yesterday was pretty poor and that kind of cost me, and it is when it is.  Congratulations for Rod.
Q. From here where do we go?  What's the plans for the rest of the season?
BROOKS KOEPKA: We got a week off next week, and we're going to Japan for Dunlop Phoenix and then Tiger's event.  So looking forward maybe to put a win on the board.
Q. Well, keep going forward, man.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Thanks.
