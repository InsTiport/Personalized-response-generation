  Q. We haven't spoken to you in a week.  Just curious how you feel about your game at this point.
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   I mean, I've hit a lot of good shots.  Every once in a while a bit sloppy, but it is what it is.  I feel it's not far away.
 Q. What do you think is holding you back at all?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just consistency, that's it.  Just not putting the same swing on it every time every once in a while.  1 tee is bad and then 15 I just can't get on my left side.  But the shot into 14 was pretty bad, too.  But it seems like right now I'm having one or two holes that are really costing me, but other than that, I'm playing fine.
 Q. I know it wasn't the goal to play five in a row heading into the PGA Championship; is there any concern at all about having that stretch heading into the first major of the year?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   No, not really.  You've got to play your way into it.  When you don't have the results you want, you've got to go out here and find it.  It's not like you're just going to sit at home and it's going to magically -- you've got to work the put in, put the reps in and it will show eventually.
 Q. The camera showed you with a little bit of a grimace coming out of the bunker on 17.  Did you tweak anything?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   I've always struggled with uphill lies.  I can't figure out a reason why on 15, I just can't get on my left side.  I had an MRI on Monday.  Nothing has changed.  We'll see how it goes.
 Q. Had an MRI this past Monday?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah.
 Q. What led to that?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just wanted to check on it, see where it's at.  We got the results right after Korea, and then we just wanted to check, and nothing is improved, it's still the same.  So we'll figure it out when we're done.
 Q. How do you feel?
 BROOKS KOEPKA:   I feel okay, feel physically fine.  It has its moments.
