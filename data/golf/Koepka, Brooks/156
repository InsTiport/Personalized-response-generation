Q. Today a slightly tighter affair.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, when you play Patrick Reed you know you're going to be in for a good match.  And 3-up with four to go, you kind of knew it was going to go to 18, because of the way he is.  I enjoyed it and he played well.
Q. How tough is it to toughen yourself up to get into the deep part of the tournament that you get into?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's fun, you just do your thing, and playing well, just need to keep -- keep doing what I'm doing.  Today I struggled with putting.  I couldn't get the putts in the hole.  I don't know what the deal was, whether the greens were a little bit slower or just a little off on some touch putts.  Just tune that up and it should be fine tomorrow.
Q. So there will be practice before you have a nice meal and a rest tonight?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, going to go do that.
Q. Brooks, was it easier to play knowing all you needed was a half or was it more difficult with maybe a little internal pressure to close it out?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It didn't matter.  I just needed to go out and play, do what I've been doing and I did that today.  So it's good.  You knew you were going to be in for a tough match.  Patrick is a hell of a competitor.  I was telling my caddie we kind of knew it was going to go down to the wire there.  It was fun.  Just need to clean up a few things for tomorrow.
Q. What have you proven to yourself this week?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Nothing.  I'm playing fine.  I guess the last couple of months have been a little bit unlike me.  I haven't been playing very well.  But we figured it out.  So I'm not too worried.
