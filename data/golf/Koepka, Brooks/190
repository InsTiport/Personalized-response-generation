 Q.  Just summarize the way you played today.  That was obviously a pretty good way to close the match out?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I played pretty well all day.  I drove the ball a lot better today, so I was putting it in the fairway.  Was able to put some spin on the ball around the greens and things like that.  But I putted really well.  Been putting really well for a while, just haven't seen things drop.  It's nice to finally see the putts drop.   
 Q.  You are in pretty good shape with the win yesterday over Billy and now over Jaco.  Have you been keeping tabs on the match?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, I really don't care.  It doesn't bother me.  I've just got one guy to play every day, and the goal is to beat him.  I did that today.  Jaco played well.  I squeaked it out thankfully and thanks to the putter.   
 Q.  So the putter was the strong suit for you today?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I putted pretty well.  I made those key putts, those 10 and 12-footers that you kind of need to make and put some pressure on.  I played beautifully today.  Not much else to say.
