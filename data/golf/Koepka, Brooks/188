 Q.  That was a hard fought match.  You had to roll one in at the end to keep it at 1-up.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Kuch knows how to a battle.  He's been through it all, Ryder Cups, Presidents Cups, everything.  He's got the experience on me a little bit.  But today I played really well and so did Kuch.  Hats off to him.  It was a fun match.  It was enjoyable.  I'm sure it was fun to watch.   
 Q.  Talk about now the afternoon and your next match.  What do you have to even be better as you advance?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I don't know who.  Is it Jason?  He's a couple up, I see.  Just got to play my own game.  I'm playing well, rolling the ball well.  It should be a fun match.   
 Q.  Does this take you back to college?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I only had one NCAA Championship when I was playing match play, so I guess you could say I haven't had that much, especially missing out on match play for U.S. Am, U.S. Junior, things like that.  So I guess I've got the least experience of anybody, but it's fun.
