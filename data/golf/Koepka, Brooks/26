Q. Brooks, tough day out there, tough conditions, as well. If we can just get some comments on your play.
BROOKS KOEPKA: I actually played pretty good. Every time I just -- I didn't even hit bad shots and I was getting penalized. That happens. Two in the water there on whatever it is, 6, and not enough sand in the bunker on 18, and just a bad shot. Didn't feel like I played that bad.
Q. Is that the thing about this course, that that can happen because of the challenge of this course?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, there's a lot of water out here, so if you're going to find the water twice on a hole, you're going to make some big numbers. I didn't feel like I played that bad.
Q. 6 just not cut, the tee shot?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I was trying to hold it against the wind, and it kept going. One of those things where if it's cutting, it's going right. It just felt like I probably hit it too good, too low, for it to really hold the wind.
