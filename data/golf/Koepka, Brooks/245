 Q.   Good job.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Right down the middle of the fairway, I think we had like 255 to the hole.   The wind just off to the left and we hit good hybrid in there to about 20feet and made a little left‑to‑right slider down the hill, so it was good.   Good putt.  
   
 Q.   How far did the putt move?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Probably about sixfeet.   It broke a lot, but it went in dead center.  
   
 Q.   Pretty exciting?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it was good.   It was good to get off to a good start.   Just a little disappointed with the finish.
