Q. Just comment on the match.  Obviously didn't come out like you wanted, but what was the key for the Europeans?
BROOKS KOEPKA: They played so well on that front nine.  They got up so early.  We screwed up No. 8, making bogey there and giving them that one.  I think they were -- after 10, I think they were like 7 or 8-under.  They played really well, so it's tough to beat.
Q. When you get 4-down, you have to keep pumping birdies in?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I didn't putt very well today and I know DJ didn't hit it his best.  They played really good.  Hats off to them.  They were impressive to watch.  Both of them were in it every hole.  They both had looks every hole and that's what you've got to do.
