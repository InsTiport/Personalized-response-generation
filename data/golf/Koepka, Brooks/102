Q. Brooks, topsy-turvy day, down early and then got back into it.  Ended up seemingly fitting, but I know you liked your advantage there a couple holes ago?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously I did.  We both both played really well.  I think we were about 5- or 6-under there each.  We both played really well.  In fairness, probably the match should have ended, both played that well.  And sometimes you can't do anything about it, you play great.  And it was fun.  It was a fun match.
Q. Are you scoreboard watching as you go?  Are you sensing what's happening around?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, it's hard not to.  There's about a scoreboard every hole, so you just keep looking, and I keep rooting for the guys.  At the same time, you're trying your butt off, and hopefully it's enough.
Q. Can you just really quickly talk about Paul Casey's shot at 17?  There's no defense in golf, but that was a great shot.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Obviously, it pays being in the fairway, and obviously he hit a great shot in there to 17, hit it to about five foot and made a great putt to send down the last all-square, and it was a fun match, grind it out all day.
