 Q.  How does it feel to be a three-time major champion, just give us a sense of your emotions right now?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's incredible.  To think where I was four months ago, I didn't really even dream about -- and to come out here and play as well as we did, it's really incredible.   
 Q.  Your confidence, your composure out there, you spoke during this week just how good you felt coming into the week.  What was the thing that clicked for you?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I struck it so well at Firestone, I just wasn't putting well.  My head was kind of moving back on the ball.  And that's all we focused on when we got here.  We just needed to hit the ball well and do the stuff I was doing, and continue -- and I don't think -- Claude didn't say one word to me this week I was hitting it that good.  He just stood behind me and was like, yup, that's perfect.  And we just worked on some putting and that was it and making sure my head stayed still.  And to come out here and play as well as we did was really, I can't even put into words how well I played and I'm so excited for myself and my caddie and my team.   
 Q.  A day of drama as well with Tiger and Adam Scott and a lot of big players coming at you.  What was that like for you to play in that kind of atmosphere?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously it was kind of the first time Tiger's been in contention and I've been in contention at the same time, so the fans definitely let you know what he was doing.  And I was playing with Scotty, so I knew what I was up against.  And Scotty played unbelievably well and so did Tiger.  They definitely made me question it there for a bit or think about it, for sure.
