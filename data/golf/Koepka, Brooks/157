 Q.  Talk about the wind picking up.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I played really well today.  I was able to control the flag, control the spin.  That's what you've got to do.   
The greens obviously were a little bit slower.  They slowed them up just for the wind.  Putted really well.  Any time you are hitting it well and putting it well, it's tough to beat.   
 Q.  Did you help Bubba?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I did.  I was looking at Bubba on Tuesday and I was just kind of -- we were talking about some things.  Sneds gave him a lot of advice and I was trying to get him a little bit more.   
 Q.  What did you tell him?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: He needs to get the putts to the hole.  He's dying them in the front edge or leaving them short.  He needs to actually get it to the hole.  He can't really make it if you are leaving it short.  That's kind of what we were talking about.   
 Q.  How different did things play today than yesterday with the wind?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I thought it was interesting.  A lot of the downwind holes, they moved the tees up.  That was interesting.  11, they have the tee up.  Especially on what's that short one?  5 or whatever, the par-4.  It was interesting with what they did with some of the tee boxes.  They kind of moved them around.   
 Q.  How different does the mentality have to be in match play?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It doesn't really matter to me.  It's trying to win every hole.  That's all I'm trying to do.  If you look like you are not really going to, you have got to squeak out a half somehow.  You are never really out of it whether it's holing out a shot -- you can build some momentum even on a half.   
 Q.  You almost won every hole today?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Almost, I guess, yeah.  It would have been nice to end it on 10.  We've got to keep doing what we're doing against Patrick tomorrow and we should be fine.
