 Q.  I'm here with Brooks Koepka.  Three birdies in your last five holes.  Do you feel like you have some momentum now going into this final round?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I hope so.  I haven't figured out the front side.  The backside I feel like I can score, suits me.  But I need to get off to a good start this afternoon.   
 Q.  What are you going to do to prepare yourself between this little lull that you have?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Go grab some food and chill, just relax and not to anything; 45 minutes and we'll get going, get geared up.   
 Q.  You're supposed to say you're going to call your mom.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I already talked to her.  She was up early so I already talked to her.  Yeah, I'm sure she'll be calling and texting me.   
 Q.  Thank you for your time and good luck this afternoon.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Thanks.   
 Q.  Good to see that last one fall.  How encouraging is that entering the final round, have a disjointed third round?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, it was kind of all over the place.  Finish with a birdie.  Hopefully carry that momentum into the front side.  Struggled on the front side.  I don't know what the deal is.  Should be able to get a few birdies but really haven't done much this week on the front side.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you more details about the front side because the back-9 is supposed to be more challenging.  Can you pinpoint anything with the front-9 that might be the trouble?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just haven't hit quality shots.  I haven't hit any good putts.  Just execution, that's all it is.  Everybody else seems to be doing it just fine.  I just haven't figured it out yet.
