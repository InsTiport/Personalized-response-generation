 Q.  65. What was the secret to it?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just made more putts today. Drove it really well today. I made good putts all week, they just haven't fallen, today they fell. And I feel like I'm really close and that's all you can do. You can hit good putts, these greens are a little inconsistent and you can roll one dead in the middle, it misses right, it misses left the next time. So I'm putting good and just got to keep doing it.   
 Q.  How does this golf course change? You played it in all the conditions now so far this week. How early today -- the wind feels like it's starting to pick up, how does it change when the wind comes up?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I think the back nine is quite difficult. I'm not a big fan of winds off the left, so on the back side there's quite a few of them where they were off the left. It all depends. It depends on the pin locations I think, too. Some of them I went at, I felt like today was my day so I was going to go at them, and just missed them a little bit and made bogey, but just some unfortunate things happened.   
 Q.  Great week's work last week, Pete Cowan caught on with you as well. Coming in here do you feel like things are really starting to sharpen up for you as you move into the meat of the season?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, that was my goal, by the time I got to L.A. was to be as sharp as I need to be. And my game feels great, nothing wrong with it, I'm very pleased with where it's at, just haven't put any results up.
