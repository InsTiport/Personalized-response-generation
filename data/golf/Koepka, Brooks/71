 Q.  Brooks, a lot of folks point to the four in a row and almost five in a row there.  I thought the putt on 11, unlikely you hole a birdie, talk about how it ignited your around.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It really did.  It was nice to see the hole open up.  Important putt to get things started.  To see that go in from 25 feet it's always nice but it definitely spurred me on for the last, you know, five, six holes.   
 Q.  14 and 15 were not easy birdies especially from that back bunker.  It looked like a heavy bunker shot for you?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah.  The tee shot was sitting down in an old divot, had mud on it.  Trying to get it up on the green and close.  Kind of lucky it went in the back bunker instead of going in the hazard.  Keep grinding.  You never know what's around the corner.  You make four in a row like that -- wish I would have made the one on the last.  Solid round, just trying to keep pace.   
 Q.  What does this do for your weekend, are you right where you expected to be?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I would like to have been in the lead.  But I mean hey, 61 today was pretty darn impressive.  Got to hang in there, keep going for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Brooks, everybody else is saying that the back-9 was the harder half of this golf course all week.  You kind of light it on fire.  
 Why were you able to get things rolling on the four hole stretch?   
BROOKS KOEPKA: Lot of it was the putter.  I'm putting pretty good.  I seen the lines quite well right now.  The touch is pretty good.  But the putt on 11 was kind of what opened it up for me.  I felt like I was hitting it okay on the front, really getting up and out of it and the back is definitely tougher.  When you see 16 is the lead you got to do something when you're 7-under par.
