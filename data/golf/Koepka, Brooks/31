Q. Clearly a different day from yesterday's bogey-free 66. Tell us about that one from your point of view.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just timing was a bit off. Didn't hit that many good shots the last 15 holes. Good on the first two but other than that, it was a bit of a disaster. Going to go to the range and just figure it out, just a little bit of time.
Q. Lack of play not a factor or the knee not a factor?
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, no. I don't know, everybody likes to make an excuse. It's just me.
Q. What about the mind-set when you're in that situation where it's not going well and the driver is not finding the fairways, what do you do to try to keep it under control?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just find your go-to shot and try to hit that go-to shot. Try to, hit a few of them, and then tried go back to hitting a normal shot and a couple fairway bunkers and couldn't even find the fairways, so it was difficult.
Q. Your coach, Claude Harmon, was here earlier in the week. Is he still here and can you go do some work with him now?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing. It's just timing. It will take 15 balls. Yeah, it's a lot different on the golf course trying to do it because there are consequences.
Q. Thoughts going into the weekend with some ground to make up?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously be off a little earlier, so probably no wind, shoot a low one and then we'll see. We'll see where Sunday ends up.
