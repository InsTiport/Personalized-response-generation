 Q.  Competitive round out here.  Are you happy with that?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah.  I felt like I played pretty well.  I didn't drive the ball as well as I felt like I could have.  But I rolled the pill really nice and pretty happy with 4-under.   
 Q.  Did the course change in the conditions, the different wind directions, a little warmer today from when you played practice rounds?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Obviously, it's a little wet so the ball's not going as far on the ground.  But it's still warm and the ball is traveling a long ways.   
So we had a little bit softer wind but it picked up there at the end, so I don't know, I felt like it was kind of all over the place.  It was kind of switching a little bit here and there, but it is what it is.  It's Hawaii.   
 Q.  Happy with how the new equipment performed in competition?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, no, we have seen it for awhile now.  The Nike stuff is unbelievable, the driver, all the woods are unbelievable.  And this ball, too, especially is great in the wind.  It's perfect to play it here.
