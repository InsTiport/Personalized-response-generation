Q. Rough start with those two bogeys early on.  How would you assess that the day went for you?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was all right.  I felt like we got a lot of bad breaks.  1, for that ball not to trickle down the green and you got a 70-footer with about 15 feet of break.
9, too, that ball ended up by the bunker.  It just wasn't my day.  Putts weren't dropping, I couldn't get them to the hole again.  It is what it is but pretty pleased with how the things are with the Nike gear and it's a pretty solid start.
Q. How much do you learn from continuing to put yourself in positions of being in the final group and what can you take going forward?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Every time you're in a final group you learn something.  It's incredible the way Jordan manages his game going around all 18 holes.  He doesn't seem to make a mistake.  When he does get in trouble, he gets out of it and he makes those 15 foot clutch putts to kind of keep the round going.  It's impressive to watch.  It really is.  It's fun to watch.  But for me, I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully it come together pretty soon.
Q. Schedule going forward?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Going to do Phoenix and then Pebble.  So I still got to get some time off, just re-adjust and hopefully get back at it again.
