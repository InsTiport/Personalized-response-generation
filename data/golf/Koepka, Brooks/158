Q. I want you to take a look back the course.  Really windy out here.  Was it as easy for you as it looked?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I played real well today.  Putted really well and I feel like my game is in good shape.
Q. How much has the golf course changed?  It's at least 12 to 15 miles per hour windier than it was on Wednesday?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Obviously it's dried out a little bit.  Downwind.  It's tough to judge it, especially when you are downwind.  A couple of times we thought we might be the opposite.  But playing real well.  Just need to do that tomorrow.
Q. You have to have really good feelings going into tomorrow about yourself and your game?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I do.  I feel like I'm playing well.  Just need to continue it tomorrow and through the weekend.
Q. Will you play in this wind or call it a day?
BROOKS KOEPKA: No.  I'm going to go chill.
