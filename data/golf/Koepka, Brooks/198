 Q.  What was the best part of the game?  Seemingly everything went good for you today.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I felt like everything was pretty solid.  All the way from the driver to the putter.  Everything was -- putts seemed to drop yesterday, that was a bit of an issue for us.  We weren't getting the putts to the hole.  The speed was just much better and that's why the putts were able to drop.   
 Q.  You had six birdies in a row on the front.  Not many people listening can appreciate that or have ever done that.  What is that like?  Can you describe the feeling?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I honestly didn't know I made all those in a row.  We got in the scoring tent and I figured it out that I made that many in a row.  But just keep going.  Just keep trucking along and that's kind of what it was.   
 Q.  Looking back at the round you had the 63 and yet you parred 9 and 18, the two par-5s.  What happened there?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I don't know.  I better pick it up tomorrow.  I know that.  I don't know.  It felt like we played really solid.   
On 9 we got a little bit of a bad break.  Had a chip that went with the wind left.   
Then 18, that second shot in there wasn't -- it wasn't a shank, but it was not pretty, to say the least.   
 Q.  It was a little ugly there.  Talk about tomorrow.  Playing with Jordan, final group, chance to win this thing.  Probably have to go low again.  Talk about what you're looking forward to tomorrow?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Probably have to go low?  Definitely have to go low.  It's hard to catch Jordan.  No, I need to go out and do what I did today.  I put on a stripe show today and it was fun and any time you do that, golf's fun.
