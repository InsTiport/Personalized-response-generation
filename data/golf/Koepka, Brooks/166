Q. Another win here on the 16th green.  What makes you two such a formidable team?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's easy when you've got somebody who putts it as good as Brandt does.  The fairways were overrated today.  I don't think we hit -- I think we hit maybe three.  But just grinded it out.  We've got a lot of grit.
Q. You were very emotional after the win.  You were fist pumping with the crowd here.  Huge crowd here.  How were you able to dial it back and perform the way you are performing with this large gallery here?
BRANDT SNEDEKER: It's tough.  It's the hardest thing we have to deal with this week, not getting too over-amped and not getting too excited, and trying to get them into it too much.
But we did a great job of staying patient today.  It was not pretty by any stretch of the imagination, but we found a way to win.  That's all you've got to do.  You never know how it's going to look.
Brooks did an awesome job of staying patient and giving me looks out there.  We both hit some great shots when we had to.  So proud of this guy.  This guy needs to know how good he is and he's starting to figure it out right now.
