 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Not really.  I don't really care.  It's not me.  I didn't shoot 62, so it doesn't bother me.  I'm happy for him.  I'm glad he shot 62, that's sweet.  But other than that it doesn't have anything to do with me, so I'm not really concerned.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I didn't think so.  I thought it was fine.  You know, maybe the wind picked up a little bit, but I didn't think it was a big deal.  I felt like the wind direction was pretty light all day.  Maybe it got gusty up to maybe a club, club and a half.  But nothing really more.  So I didn't think it was that bad.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I mean I'm sure it got a little more difficult, I think, as the day goes on.  I'm sure there's a little bit some guys might be feeling some pressure, I don't know.  I don't know.  You've got to ask them.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Not really.  You've got to be aggressive anyways, if you want to win.  You've got to be able to -- it's conservatively aggressive, I guess you could say is the best way to put that.  I can't make mistakes with bogeys tomorrow if I want to catch them.
