 Q.  A loss today, but you move on.  You play Matt Kuchar tomorrow.  Your thoughts on the week so far and thoughts on playing Matt tomorrow?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, it will be exciting to play Matt.  I didn't play very well today, but that happens and you've just got to move on.   
Tomorrow is a new day, kind of take it for what it's worth.  Everyone is going to have a bad day.   
 Q.  You're in for a good battle.  Just some thoughts about tomorrow?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It will be fun, he's a great guy.  Got to know him the last two years pretty well.  Seems like we've played a lot.  It will be fun.  It's match play, he's going to be grinding and I'll be grinding, hope I just get the better of him.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'm 25 years old, and I work out, so I shouldn't have an issue with that.
