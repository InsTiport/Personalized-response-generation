 Q.   Pulled off the golf course on the 12th hole, a dislocated rib that you've been battling since Friday.   Just give me the degree of pain you're in right now.  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Hurts to breathe.   That's the only way I can say that.   It's not fun to even take steps and walk, walk the golf course isn't fun.   I didn't want to quit but I hit a shot on 11, second shot in the green and that's the most pain I think I've ever felt on a golf course and 12th tee wasn't much better.   
So, you know, the next few weeks coming up, I don't want to make anything any worse.  
   
 Q.   Concerns moving to Augusta right now because it is your first Masters and just a few weeks away?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I haven't really thought about that.   I'm kind of taking it minute by minute right now.   Just hoping to get better.   Hoping some rest should be fine.   I'm going to get a lot of treatment and see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   Brooks, I appreciate your time.   All the best.
