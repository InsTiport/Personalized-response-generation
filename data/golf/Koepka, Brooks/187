BROOKS KOEPKA: We both played really well.  He's played plenty of Ryder Cups, President Cups, things like that.   
 Q.  Obviously 17 or 18, two magnificent holes.  17, first of all?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was interesting.  The wind switched on us.   
 Q.  18, having made that birdie to go 1-up.  What's going through your mind as you look at 18?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I thought just put it in the fairway and give yourself a chance.   
 Q.  How much are you looking forward to the Masters?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I feel like my game is starting to peak right now.  We're playing well.  I feel confident, I'm ready to move on.
