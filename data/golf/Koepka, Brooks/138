Q. First time together as partners, not the way you wanted.  Did you take anything positive from this?
DANIEL BERGER: Absolutely.  Bran again and Louis are a great team which they showed because they have a great record.  We had a few stretch of holes where we lost it a little bit but Brooks played really well.  I think I could have played a little bit better, and if that was the case, we may have come out with the win.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Just didn't give ourselves any chances on the back side.  We didn't give ourselves enough chances for birdie and you have to be able to do that, especially as windy as it is today.
It is what it is.  We played fine.  Just a few errant shots cost both of us.
