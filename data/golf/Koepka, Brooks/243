Q.   Thoughts on your position in this tournament after two days? 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   It was good and then it was really poor on the back side.   I didn't play very well on the back, but I kept it in there.   Didn't make any bogeys, so that's always good.   So you have to take some positive out of it and just keep going on the weekend.

Q.   The birdie at the last is something of a positive, brings a smile back. 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it was nice.   You know, it was a bad drive, but kind of got lucky with the lie in the rough so I took advantage of it.

Q.   Tommy Fleetwood said the two of you fed off each other just that little bit. 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it was good.   Any time you have somebody in your group playing well, it's nice; you feed off it.   And he's a really nice kid, I enjoyed the two days with him.

Q.   Are you feeling the benefit of some time at home after all the exploits on The Challenge Tour and upgrade to The European Tour?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it's nice to know my schedule now, to be able to go home, relax and know I have two weeks to prepare and things like that.   So it's been fun.   Nice to get home. 

Q.   So you had a chance to celebrate? 
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, I had a good time back in South Florida.

Q.   What are your thoughts from here on in?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Like I said you've just got to grind it out.   You never know what's going to happen.   But still got two more days.
