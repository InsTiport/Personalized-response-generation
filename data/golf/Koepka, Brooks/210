Q.   When you were 3‑down, standing on the 16 tee, what was going through your mind?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   We were trying to figure out whether we could actually drive the green if we killed it, because we thought we needed to make something happen.   My caddie told me to lay it up and get a good number in and see what happens.   Luckily, I was able to squeak this one out.

Q.   Obviously things changes quickly, beautiful tee shot on the 20th hole?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, actually we did not play well all day today.   Just been scrapping it around.   To get a W out of this one was special just because you had to grind so hard.   It was tough and it was actually the first good number we had all day.   So that kind of helped it.

Q.   How did the course play out there today?
BROOKS KOEPKA:   It was tough, but I didn't put myself‑‑ it wasn't as tough as I made it.   I didn't put myself in good spots.   Didn't make good birdies.   Getting off to a terrible start every day.   It's not the start I want.   Can't do that to tomorrow.
