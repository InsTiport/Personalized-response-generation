A flash interview with:   
BROOKS KOEPKA   
 Q.  4-under 67 in the first round.  Nice finish coming home with two birdies.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, it was nice.  You know, it felt like I played pretty solid on the front.  Nothing really happened.  But back 9 I started hitting the ball terrible.  I don't know what was going on.  Hopefully we'll fix that for tomorrow.  I was kind of pull/drawing everything.   
It wasn't good, but somehow found a way to get in at 4.   
 Q.  Were the greens a little bumpy coming home?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, they're fun.  The greens are good.  They roll true.  They're fast and they're firm.  If you can roll the rock, you can do well.   
 Q.  Was there a push for you guys to finish?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah.  I mean, we were trying to finish.  I mean, that's the goal.  I didn't want to come out in the morning.  I don't think Bubba did or Justin.  So I think the group behind us even got finished, so that's good.   
 Q.  How was your reaction at 16?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Well, that's fun.  I mean, I like 16.  It's cool.  You only get it once a year, so it's fun.  They get riled up.  I enjoy it.
