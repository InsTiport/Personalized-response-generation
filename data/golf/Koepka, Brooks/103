Q. You throw that dart in there on 16, and you're pushing it, but then Stenson hits a couple putts and it was over as quick as you guys were back in it.
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, exactly.  You know, the Euros have putted very well.  They are making the 10-foot, the 20-foot momentum swingers that you need to make if you want to be in the lead, and they are doing a good job of it.
You know, we just haven't made anything.  I haven't made anything, it feels like, outside six feet all week, and the frustrating part is you're just hitting good putts and sometimes they don't go in.  You just have to keep hitting good ones and hopefully they fall.
Q. Judging by the volume in this room and such, it doesn't seem anybody is conceding anything going into tomorrow.
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, anything can happen.  If you go out and everybody does what they are supposed to do, they should essentially win the match.  We've got a few guys that are playing well, and you just need to try to find some motivation, some momentum, anything you can to really build on it and go out and finish on a high note.
