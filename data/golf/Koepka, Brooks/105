 Q.  Brooks, Tony, well played.  How big a point is this after being down-2 early on?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Absolutely, feels like 2.  Early on there, it didn't look like we were -- we weren't -- Rose played unbelievable, and Jon played very well, too, The opening nine holes and got us down early, which you never really plan on, but you just got to fight and keep fighting.  We got Tony with a lucky break there on 16, which was great, and then he capitalized on it was unbelievable.  But to come out in his first Ryder Cup and play the way he did, I'm proud of him and glad to have him as my teammate.   
 Q.  Well said.  Tony, very well played.  Welcome to the Ryder Cup.  
TONY FINAU: Thanks.   
 Q.  How were the nerves of 16? What were you thinking when that ball was in the air?  
TONY FINAU: I knew it needed to get up a little bit.  It rose on me a little bit, started to spin.  I said get lucky somehow, that's what I was thinking in my head.  Fortunately I did.  That was a huge break for us.  I needed to make 2 there to win this match, and I was able to brush that one in and keep the momentum on our side.  Brooks played some incredible golf if the middle of our back nine, and I needed him to.  We ham-and-egged it pretty well.  They played some great golf, and we were able to capitalize at the end and then pull this one off.  Really proud of this guy.
