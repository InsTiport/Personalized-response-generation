 Q. Talk about your day?BROOKS KOEPKA: It wasn't good.  I didn't really strike the ball very well.  I putted pretty well, but finished it off nice.  It didn't help that me or Dustin.  I mean, I felt like we were both hitting good putts that wouldn't go in.  We were kind of spraying it everywhere.  We didn't really get a chance to feed off each other.  Sometimes one guy makes it and opens it up for the other guy.
Q. What was it like out there today?BROOKS KOEPKA: It was tough.  But if you tell me I was going to take even par after 54, I would have taken it.  So you've just got to look at it that way.  It was very tough today.  Some of the pin locations were brutal.  And the wind was up, too, because it's been dead the last two days.  I haven't played in any. But, you know, even par is not too bad.
Q. What a lot of the players were saying Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, that they thought winning score would be -- obviously Martin has been out there putting some low numbers up.  He's at 7 now.  But do you feel like tomorrow you're in this tournament?BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, absolutely.  Anything can happen out here.  You shoot 3-, 4-under, you know, you get hot, you get it going, you never know.  Put some pressure on him, and we'll see what he does.  But right now I'm pretty pleased with where I'm at.
Q. Do you think the USGA, they're likely to be tougher tomorrow?  Do you think there's a 3- or 4-under out there?BROOKS KOEPKA: I do.  You better play perfectly.  That's the only thing I can say to that.  If you play perfectly and put the ball in the right spots and make a few 20-, 25-footers, you definitely have a chance.
