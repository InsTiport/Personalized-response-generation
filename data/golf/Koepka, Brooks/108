 Q.  Your first Ryder Cup, can we speak about your pairing in this opening match?  
TONY FINAU: We've played practise rounds together, and you know, we both -- we have very similar games, so we know -- we complement each other well, as far as playing together.  Obviously a two-time Major Champion this year.  Who wouldn't want to play with him?   
Really, it's a privilege for me to tee it up with this dude.   
 Q.  Any previous history?  
TONY FINAU: Not a lot.  We played together on Tour for some years now, but again, just playing with him throughout the Playoffs, kind of the first times I've really played with him.  Obviously an unbelievable player, and enough can't be said about that.  So to team up with him and just represent our country this week is going to be an honour for us.   
 Q.  Brooks, could you speak about the pairing against Rose and Rahm?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously two of their best players.  That's what we want when we go out, set the tone, get off to a good start, and try to get everyone else behind us in the States and the rest of the team.   
I think it's a very good opportunity to kind get a great start.  You know, you want to do it against your two best players, and that's kind of how we'd love to do it, and we're excited for the challenge, and we'll be up for it.   
 Q.  You certainly know about those players.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: You see them all the time.  Obviously Rosey has been playing extremely well, as of late, and you know, Jon's first Ryder Cup, along with Tony, so you know, Rosey has got a bit more experience than I do, but it will be fun.   
Any time you have a rookie as good as Tony, and someone that's as impressive as what I've seen over the past last month from him, I'm really looking forward to getting out there and playing with Tony.
