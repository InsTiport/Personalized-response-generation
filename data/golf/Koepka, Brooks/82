Q. What a day; how difficult was it out there with the swirling winds?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was extremely difficult.  This wind is probably blowing 20, 25 miles an hour sometimes, and it's quite difficult.  You never feel easy over any shot.  But you've just got to put it in the center of the green and take your two-putt on a lot of these holes and try to be aggressive when you can.
Q. You've got this stealth exterior; what's going on inside when you're making a charge like you did on that back nine today?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'm just focused on what I've got to do.  I mean, I'm pumped inside, raring to go.  Just need to keep doing what I'm doing, and luckily I was able to get a few putts to drop, and sometimes you've got to hold back your emotions a little bit, too, because you're so excited and caught up in the moment, you've just got to keep thinking about the next shot.
