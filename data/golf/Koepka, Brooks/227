 Q.   What an exciting birdie, birdie, birdie finish for you.   Talk about it.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it was kind of a struggle the first 15 holes.   The putter was just ice cold, missed a couple short ones, and finally got it going.   My caddie said something to me about getting my hands a little higher, and it worked, so happy I finished with three birdies.  
   
 Q.   You birdie 9 and you have a little something going, then you play the next six holes in 1‑over par before the finish.   How did you keep your patience in that stretch?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Oh, I'm just very chill.   Nothing really bothers me no matter what happens, up, down, I'm always fine with it.   But you've got three easy finishing holes.   You can finish 3‑, 4‑under, so I just kind of patiently waited for those.   
   
 Q.   You hit all these other fairways in this third round, but you averaged 323 off the tee.   You'll take that distance off the tee, even if you miss a couple fairways?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, that sounds about right to me.   No, I'm hitting the driver well for me.   Seven fairways is decent, the way I see it.   The rough is deep, but I'm hitting 9‑irons and wedges into the green where guys might be hitting 7‑irons.  
   
 Q.   You took a shot at winning this last year.   What are your thoughts going into the final round.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just relax, man.   It's only a golf tournament.   I know that sounds stupid, but I learned a lot from last year and even over the past year putting myself in contention.   Just relax and have fun, and everything will take care of itself.
