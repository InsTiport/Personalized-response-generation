Q. You put together a 70 in the third round.  How satisfied are you with your play today?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was a great up-and-down -- I've made one bad swing every day, and it's definitely penalized me.  I've had a double every day.  So if I can clean that up and play mistake free tomorrow and hit these putts a little bit harder, I think everything could fall my way.
Q. Yesterday we were talking about how to play this course when it comes to the weekend and moving day.  Specifically on Sunday, what has to be the mindset at a place like this with all the water, especially coming down the stretch?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously if you're nervous it'll show up.  This golf course, there's about five to seven holes where you can really take advantage of it if you hit the fairway and you've got a good number to the flag, and you've got to take advantage of those if you want to move up, and the rest of the holes you're just kind of hanging on and trying to make par, maybe sneaking in one or two birdies.  This golf course was very difficult in the afternoon, especially with the wind kind of doing what it does today.  It's up there for a little bit and then it kind of switches directions and you never really feel confident over the ball.
Q. Was there anything overnight or this morning on the range that you were working on specifically to try and put it in play this round?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I was just trying to feel like don't get my left -- start with my left.  I was dragging it a little bit.  I was trying to do the opposite and felt like I really released it, and felt like I did a good job with that on Tuesday, and it hit the tree left.  Sometimes you can overdo it and over-think it.  You just need to let go.  I haven't hit the ball very well this week.  I've putted good, but just haven't struck it the way I wanted to.
