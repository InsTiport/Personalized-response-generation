 Q.  Looked like you were playing okay today.  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I felt like I played good enough to shoot 4- or 5-under par.  It was those momentum-building shots.  You look at the turn, 18, goes in the water where it should be a birdie, a relatively easy birdie.   
Then on 1, had one horseshoe back at me.  It would be nice to have those and feel like you're making a lot of progress out here because it was a tough day.   
 Q.  It was really cool to watch Sunday last week. How hard is it to bounce back after last week, and get into the flow of the round?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I didn't find it too difficult.  It's nice to be back playing.  It's nice to compete again.  I know it's something I've always wanted to do is get to No. 1 but you still have to get out here and compete and you want to grow that lead on No. 1, and it's fun, man, I love competition.  I love getting out here and playing and just need to play a little better the next three days.   
 Q.  You seem like a player that needs a chip on your shoulder or something to push you.  Is hanging on to the No. 1 spot going to be something like that, a little extra incentive?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I think so.  The goal was to get to No. 1 and once you get here, you just need to stay here.  That's something I think every player dreams of and every player wants to do, but it's even better when I've got my good friend pushing me.  You know that he's always right behind you, so you've got to play good every time you come to play.
