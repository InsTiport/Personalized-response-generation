Q. Despite a not-so-good start, in the middle of the round, you had a few birdies.  How was it for you in the tough conditions?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, obviously it was tough.  The wind was blowing pretty hard.  The short putt, I don't know if that was a lack of concentration.  To be honest with you, I got over the putt and I didn't really trust where it was lined up.  I was actually lined up correct the first time and I didn't think it was.
Kind of righted the ship there in the middle, and then that double; it's hard.  The wind gusts sometimes in one direction and then it goes in another.
You know, a little bit disappointing way to finish, but I guess it's all right.
Q. What exactly happened on 15 for you?
BROOKS KOEPKA: 15, the wind gust -- it was blowing straight down for us and all of a sudden it came in off the right.  That's why you saw Dustin and myself come up ten and 15 yards short.  We were playing left of the pin a little bit, and it would have been just fine if it didn't gust like that.
Then obviously it plugged, and when it was on the fringe, it actually took a massive hop right off the putter face and didn't have any speed to it.  And then obviously the four-footer was tricky enough.
Q. The last few holes, did you feel like you had chances to make birdies to maybe try to create --
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I thought so.  I thought the one on 16, I should have -- I felt like I actually hit a really good putt.  It just didn't go in.  And then, you know, it was kind of -- and then 18, it's hard to get there with that wind and actually have a good chance.  You know, I hit a good 3-wood in there.  I made a decent birdie.
But a little disappointed the way I played over the last two days, but that's fine.
