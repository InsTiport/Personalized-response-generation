 Q.   Can you take us through the eagle on 18?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I pulled a drive obviously in the left bunker, and had about 220 to the hole.   Hit 4‑iron just to the back of the green and made about a 30‑, 35‑footer.   
   
 Q.   Was the putt doing anything?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   The putt kind of moved a little both ways, went a little right in the beginning and then a little left at the end and went right in the center.   
   
 Q.   Got to be a good way to make the tournament.   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, nice way to finish off and get rolling on the front side, build some momentum.
