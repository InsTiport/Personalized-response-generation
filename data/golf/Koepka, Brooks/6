Q. Pretty steady the first few rounds? 
BROOKS KOEPKA: I mean, I wouldn't call them steady. They're pretty sloppy. Just giving away shots. Not really doing anything good. Made some dumb mistakes. 5 and 6, you can't do that. 

Q. Is that just not being comfortable or focused? 
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, just sometimes I feel like it's going to cut and it draws. It's just slightly out. It's not out by much, but it's enough to make a difference. 

Q. On 15 what did you have in and how far were you? 
BROOKS KOEPKA: I don't exactly know the real number. I know we were trying to hit it 215. Just a 5âiron right in there. Kept it short of the hole, which is obviously nice. Greens are soft enough where you can keep it short. But lucky enough to make 3 there. 

Q. You hit it to about six feet? 
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I hit it to about five, six feet, yeah. 

Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, do you just sort of wake up and go firing at them all? 
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, you've got to shoot a low number. I think that's pretty obvious. Go out, go play good, see what happens.
