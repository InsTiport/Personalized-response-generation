Q. How would you assess the round?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was kind of up-and-down.  Every time I made a bogey, I seemed to make a birdie.  It was a bit strange.  Made those nice three birdies in the row making the turn.  Never really felt like I had much momentum.  I didn't put the ball in the fairway.  It's tough to get the ball close to the hole.  I made those key putts to keep your round going which was nice.
Q. How as the ankle?  You said yesterday was the first time you played a full 18?
BROOKS KOEPKA: 5-under, I'll be all right.
Q. Considering the circumstances, how big is this for you?  How much did it exceed your expectation?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I wouldn't have played if I didn't think I would win.  I think I can win with one ankle.  We have been playing really well lately.  And even though I took a month off or three weeks, whatever it was, I still felt like I kept that rhythm going.  Still was able to kind of putt a little bit.  So that was nice.  But I don't know, I feel like I picked up right where I left off.
A goal of mine was to make a Ryder Cup team.  It wasn't fun watching yourself fall back.  I also want to win a major.  That's one of the goals.
Q. With double Ryder Cup spots available this week, how much added pressure is that?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'm not thinking about it.  I'm trying to win a major.  If I win a major, everything takes care of itself.  Simple.
Q. What is your schedule like heading into the playoffs?
BROOKS KOEPKA: See how the ankle is first.  Kind of assess it after Sunday, see where we are.  That will depend a lot.  We'll be there for the playoffs.
Q. Do you get more aggressive tomorrow?
BROOKS KOEPKA: All kind of depends how much the golf course drys out, the pin locations, things like that.  We're playing well.  We're striking the ball the way we want it.  We're putting pretty well.  So just keep doing what we're doing, should be fine.
