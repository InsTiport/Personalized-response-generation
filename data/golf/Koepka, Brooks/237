 Q.   What are your thoughts on the third round here then?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   I started off pretty good, putter got hot early and then kind of disappeared on the back nine.   Didn't hit very good shots.   But that's golf.   It happens.   
   
 Q.   I presume you were in great shape when you got that purple patch, what, three birdies, four holes?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, it was a nice little start.   Any time you get off to a good start the front nine, it's good.   It just left me on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   What left you? What happened?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Ball strike.   Wasn't hitting it as good.     Wasn't starting on my lines and finishing anywhere near where it should have been, but that's all right, it happens, good round tomorrow, I'll be fine.  
   
 Q.   It's unlike you, isn't it?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, usually I strike it pretty good.   That's usually not the problem.  
   
 Q.   Are you the kind of guy that goes out and analyzes or just accepts, that's golf and off you go again?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Just golf.   Can't get too upset.   Still got a chance going into tomorrow, so can't complain.   
   
 Q.   You're still in a fine position; I daresay you've seen what Stephen Gallacher managed to achieve on the back nine?  
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, hell of a round with the wind.   Tomorrow, just do my thing and hopefully it works out.  
   
 Q.   Playing alongside Rory with the crowds?   
BROOKS KOEPKA:   Yeah, any time you get in the final pairing on Saturday with Rory, it's always good.
