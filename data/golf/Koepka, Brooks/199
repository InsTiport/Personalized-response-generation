Q. A little bit behind, but what's going so well for you so far?
BROOKS KOEPKA: I'm hitting the ball really well.  I'm putting the ball in play and giving myself chances.  Today, I feel like I could have easily shot 8 or 9-under.  Just need to get prepared for tomorrow.
Q. Was it the leaves or the putts or what?  I know the grain can be a little tricky the first time around.
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was a bit of both.  Speed was a little bit off and your lines were a little bit off and you're not going to be close on some of them.  You have to hit them with great speed here, especially with the grain.  And there's such slope on some of these, even the short ones, those eight footers and things like that, and you're playing a foot of break and you got to have perfect speed.  And I just didn't have that.
Q. Do you feel if you get that corrected you have one of those 7 or 8-under rounds, a couple of them to get into contention?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, I feel like I'm really close, I just need to hit the putts a little bit harder and actually get them to the hole.  That would be nice.  But I feel like I'm playing well, I just need to hit the putts a little bit harder and that's about it.
