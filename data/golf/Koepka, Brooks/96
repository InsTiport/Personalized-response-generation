 Q.  Finish with a high of the week, the best score.  How was that today and how was the week?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, it was a weird round.  I played so well.  I just felt like I really got unlucky, hitting down the first, 45 yards from the hole and got a bad break on 2.  I'm not trying to moan, but it's a tough day today.  The wind is swirling right now.  It's not easy to figure out which direction the wind is coming from.   
 Q.  How did it feel, first tournament playing as world No. 1, any different?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: No, no difference.  It's just nice to play.  Unfortunately I didn't play as well as I would have liked, but tried to rebound today and shoot the best score you can.  It's tough.  The conditions aren't exactly easy.  I'm excited for some rest.  Get my back figured out and move on.   
 Q.  More positives this week than negatives?  
BROOKS KOEPKA: I don't think there's really anything to take.  I don't think there's many positives and I don't think there's many negatives.  It's just kind of a blah week.  I just didn't make anything.  Struck it well.  Just didn't hit anything close.  Controlled the ball flight.  Chipped it decent.   
Sometimes you're going to have those weeks where you just kind of ho-hum it, and you just kind of finish middle of the pack.
