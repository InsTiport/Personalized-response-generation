Q. How was that?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Yeah, feels pretty good.  Obviously it's tough conditions.  The wind is blowing.  I'm pleased with my round.  Hung in there.  Felt like I made a few mistakes but that happens, and just got to move on from it.
This wind, you hit one bad shot it's exaggerated and you wind up with double really quick.  Keep the ball on the ground and control your miss asks did a good job of that today.
Q. Playing with your brother today, how was that?
BROOKS KOEPKA: It was good.  Obviously didn't play the way he would have liked but it's fun to see him play up close.  I haven't seen him play since Zurich last year.  We don't play together when we're at home, and we're obviously on two different schedules and we're never really home at the same time.
I enjoy watching him play, trying to cheer him on as much as I can.
Q. Carnoustie tomorrow, how much do you think this prepares you?
BROOKS KOEPKA: Hopefully it's not as windy.  I don't know what the forecast is.  I haven't really looked at it.  But yeah, I mean, any time you play some links golf, the more rounds of links golf you can get going into Carnoustie is going to be good.  Played it on Wednesday.  Wasn't blowing too bad.  Carnoustie is, as you know, can be very difficult in some wind, and hopefully it stays calm enough.
