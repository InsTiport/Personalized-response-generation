 Q.   Obviously you've caddied a lot of rounds out here.   Can you kind of put that round in perspective of just how special it was?  
MIKE "FLUFF" COWAN:   You know, it's really kind of difficult to do to tell you the truth, but all I can say is it was a very special round of golf, very special.   I mean, the lowest one I've ever caddied for.   Incredible.   
   
 Q.   And how soon into the round did you realize there was something special happening?   
MIKE "FLUFF" COWAN:   Well, I don't know.   This is going to sound kind of drab, but I try not to really think about it a whole lot.   When he made the birdie putt on 4 is when I thought to myself, there's something happening here.   I realized we still had five more holes to play, and anything can happen, but when he made the birdie putt at 4 was my time.   
   
 Q.   Looking back, is there a shot that's going to stick out that you thought that was defining of the 59?   
MIKE "FLUFF" COWAN:   Well, maybe the putt he made at 7.   We had just bogeyed 5 with a three‑putt, hit a good shot at 6, and‑‑ well, it wasn't really a birdie putt, semi‑birdie putt, 20‑something‑footer, and he didn't hit a particularly good putt there, left it a little short, and then made a really nice putt at 7 to try to rebuild the momentum we had going.   
You know, I mean, at that point I'm thinking, as much as 59 I'm thinking we're crawling our way right into this golf tournament, not that we hadn't a little earlier than that.   One shot that might be‑‑ and it was too early to actually think about a 59, but the hole‑out at 15 was pretty freaking special.
