Q. Cheyenne, great round today.  This overall experience is so much fun.  What has this whole week been like, your second time playing here at Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   It's so much fun.  Like being here is so amazing in itself because you're a winner on tour, and just getting to play alongside athletes, celebrities, has been so much fun.
It's a very different experience, but it kind of brings out more the joy in the game rather than the, you know, fierce competition that we have each week.  This week I was really relaxed and having fun.  Hopefully I can carry that mentality through the season.
Q. Bogey-free 66.  What are some highlights of today?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, let's see, I birdied No. 2 today, and I birdied that hole all four days, which is kind of shocking, because it's a pretty tough hole.
Then on 18 I made a good par save.  So my putter was working really well this week.  First tournament I've had without a three-putt, I've been working on my putting a little bit.  And just a highlight was how good I was inside ten feet this week.
Q. And you talk about the putting.  With the exception of the final group, you were near that level all week long.
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yes.
Q. And so what is it that made you all the difference there?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   I think my ball striking is definitely improving.  I had some shorter birdie opportunities, so that's really big.
And my wedges are really good.  I've been working on that a lot.  But with my putting, I mean, the most important thing is putting is starting it online and your speed, so both of those -- I mean, I honestly had perfect speed each day and they were starting online.  I was really confident and I was hitting them in the center of the cup, which is always nice.
Q. And when we talked at the end of last year, you were working on some swing changes.
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah.
Q. How is that working out and is it something that's beginning to click?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, you know, all those old habits still come in for sure.  It's getting -- I need to continue to work on like under a pressure shot, making -- just committing to my new changes and not falling back into my old habits.
Yeah, my club is not perfect at the top, but it's getting better and using my body a little bit better, making sure the club shallows out, swinging a little bit more to the right so I can hit a draw.
Me and my caddie were saying like I have hit like a lot of good quality shots this week that I haven't hit in a while because I've been having to aim towards the middle of the green and shoot away from a lot of the pins.
But with like how much better I'm hitting I can be a little bit more aggressive, which is nice.
Q. So coming up on maybe our real off-season.
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah.
Q. What are you going to be doing before you're back here in Orlando hopefully next for Gainbridge?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, I'm going to continue to work on the changes.  This is a nice -- this is such a great tournament to play in to see where I am at.  I took two weeks after off CME.  So just keep improving, keep working out a little bit, hit it farther.
I have a lot of positives to build on and my game feels pretty good going into the season, so keep trying to get better.
