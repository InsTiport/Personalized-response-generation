  Q. You had to chose between golf and equestrian at 12?
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, growing up I was like the horse girl.  I didn't want dolls, I wanted animals, especially horses.  So I did competitions growing up for equestrian and did the jumps and dressage.
 I loved it, but I loved golf more.  But I've been wanting to see some horses while I'm here though.
 Q. Have you gone onto the equestrian center?
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   No, but I saw a commercial on TV about it and I would love to just go to see them or watch.  It looks amazing, so...
 Q. Really big investment, but big money making.
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, exactly.
 Q. How did the course play today?
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   It was windy.  Like with the rain at first it kind of softened the greens.  I didn't think when it was raining it was playing that difficult.  After it stopped raining and the wind picked up that cold front coming through it was really windy.  Like on 14 it felt like we were playing the road hole in Scotland just for how windy it was.
 I had to go up like two clubs.  So disappointing finish, but there is always tomorrow.
 Q. Yeah, you got 18 holes left to build on.  Only four shots out of a top 3.
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, exactly.  I know Austin and Jennifer are playing really well, but my goal so get top 5, so just going to kind of go for that tomorrow.
 Q. And you have two people who separate themselves and go at it themselves --
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, right.
 Q. -- does it make it almost a little easier that you can say, Hey, I can just climb the leaderboard.  I'm not going for a win.  I'm still going for a high finish.
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, exactly.  I think it makes it a little bit easier just because it's a two-person race right now and it doesn't look like they're going to fall ten shots back.
 Yeah, I think especially like the girls that are further back it's kind of like you want to make birdies within your group to move up the leaderboard and kind of -- because one shot when you're especially so close makes a big difference.
 Q. How big do you think tomorrow is especially going into two weeks off?  Some down time before we get a west coast swing.
 CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah.  I felt like I was playing pretty well, and last few holes I hit some kind of errant shots, so I'm looking to just keep being more consistent throughout my round with my ball striking.
 Yeah, just hit a lot of greens because if you hit the green you're going to have a birdie look.  Yeah, just good finish tomorrow and that will lead to the west coast swing.
