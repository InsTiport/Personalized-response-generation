Q. So how are the conditions out there today?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   It was hard.  Yeah, I 'm mentally kind of drained right now.  It was kind of wet so the course played a little bit different, just longer, tougher pins, which I was kind of expecting.
I expected it to be a little bit harder today.  But I mean, it is playing longer but the greens are a little bit slower, not as fast as like we have been seeing, especially the first day.  But it was tough.
Q. And how is it being in Texas, short commute?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, it's great.  It's very comfortable.  Like my dad has his car here and just I feel very comfortable and I know where everything is.  I don't need GPS, so that's nice.
Q. What are you looking forward to tomorrow?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, hopefully the weather holds up.  But just grind it out, because you never know like with the conditions like what the leaders are going to shoot.
So if I put a good number up there, like 5-under, I think can get it like two, 3-under par total think it'll go a long way.
