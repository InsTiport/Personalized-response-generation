Q. From Monday qualifier to now in contention after two rounds; how have you been feeling the past two days?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT: Extremely grateful, because at the beginning of the week when I got here I was just trying to get into the tournament.
Yeah, after that 63 I had a lot of confidence.  I been working on my mental game a lot; a lot of work on my putting.
It's paid off.
Q. What are some of your strengths that really came out today on the golf course?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT: Yeah, definitely say my putting.  I got lessen from Stan Utley Sunday.  I've seen him since I was probably like 12 years old and haven't seen him in a while.
I was like, Hey, can you look at my putting?  He gave me a tip and it's just given me all the confidence.  I'm fairly straight off the tee, so I just think just my putter has been really hot.
Q. This was a longer day now.  Later in the afternoon.  Do you think the weather had anything to do with it, having to readjust to some colder temperatures?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT: Yes, on the front nine it was windy.  I had to make a few 5-footers for par.  Yeah, coming in a little colder.  Ball wasn't going quite as far.
I think just later in the day the green speed is a little iffy.  Like at first when I started out they were quick, and as the day got on they're kind of bumpy, a little slower.  It was just kind of a constant adjustment we had to make.
Q. Doing pretty with the today, but you've got a weekend ahead of you.
CHEYENNE KNIGHT: Yeah.
Q. What are looking to improve to stay at the top?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT: Yeah, a little bit of my ball striking, a little bit of my longer irons.  Hit a few loose shots today with the longer irons.
Yeah, we're only halfway done.  There is a lot golf left.  I'm just trying pace myself and really just enjoy my time.
