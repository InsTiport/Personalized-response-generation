Q. Can you just tell me a little bit about your round today?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, I was trying to play fast to beat the rain, but yesterday after my round kind of found something with my putting.
I had four 3-putts the first day, so it was steady.  Hit a lot of greens.  Had a lot of birdie opportunities today.  It was a solid round.
Q. How did Jackrabbit play today versus yesterday at Cypress?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, I personally think Jackrabbit is a little bit easier only because there are some shorter holes and you have -- and there is an extra Par-5, which goes a long way.
So I would say it did play a little bit easier just like because you had some shorter shots in and you could attack some of the pins.
But Cypress yesterday was tough.  I think also just like playing a second day and actually getting used to everything helped as well.
Q. So you're looking good with the cut line.  What are you looking to improve upon?  You said putting.  Anything else for the weekend?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Getting my start line a little bit better on some of my iron shots.  I'm used to hitting my hybrids a lot, so those are pretty good.
But just dial in my start line a little bit better and try to get back to under par.
