Q. What a day for you.  Talk to me how you're feeling coming off of that playoff?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   Yeah, I mean, that's why you practice and why you play is to win, and getting beat by a birdie, I mean, Stacy hit three like really good, quality shots.  I matched her for the most part.  My putt just didn't break, but no, I'm really happy the way I hung in there today.  The conditions were really tough.
It's all a learning experience.  I kind of struggled starting the restart, so I feel really good about my game.
Q. What's the mentality or strategy heading into today?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   I thought -- I said yesterday I thought even par or 1-under would go a really long way because of how tough the golf course is playing, and yeah, I just kind of thought I had everything to gain today and nothing to lose.
Q. How confident are you feeling heading into next week's major?
CHEYENNE KNIGHT:   I'm feeling good.  This is a good prep for links golf for next week, and I'm excited.  So it was all great this week.
