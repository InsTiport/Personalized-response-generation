Q. It just didn't look like you drove the ball well enough today.
SAM HORSFIELD: Yeah, I didn't hit it good on the back nine, but there on the extra hole I had a perfect number, and I guess I was just a little juiced up, and I flagged it but just too much club, and it didn't end up in a very good spot.
Q. This golf course dictates you can't go at the hole a lot, you have to play conservative shots; do you think that kept you from dominating the golf course and making a lot of birdies?
SAM HORSFIELD: No, I wouldn't say so.  I just didn't hit it close, and I just didn't make enough putts.
Q. Match play is tough, isn't it, winner and a loser every day?
SAM HORSFIELD: Yeah.  It sucks, but whatever.
