 Q.  Give us your thoughts on the round?  
SAM HORSFIELD: It was a grind.  I did not have my best stuff there.  But one I've been working on is keeping a good attitude.  I did that good today and I think that is what kept me from maybe shooting over par and turning in a respectable 3-under.   
 Q.  Is it frustrating when you know this is a golf course that you can shoot low on?  
SAM HORSFIELD: Yeah, it is.  I just hit some really poor iron shots.  I just wasn't really feeling it early on, but I sort of got it back there.  I hit a good tee shot down 9 and you know, I got a good feeling there, and I played solid from there on in.   
 Q.  Five shots off the lead at the moment going into Sunday.  Any thoughts on change of strategy, maybe try to chase that down here?  
SAM HORSFIELD: No, you know, I feel like I'm putting really well this week, or a lot like what I grew up on the greens, kind of grainy.  Just try to give myself a lot of opportunities and I'm feeling good with the putter, hopefully get a few to drop from some lengths tomorrow.
