 Q.  It's got to be a good feeling to get the first round under your belt?  
SAM HORSFIELD: Yeah, I could have made a couple more putts.  I think me and my caddie were talking, and I think I missed eight putts inside of 12 feet, so I just hit it really good today, and it was fun.  Fun to get back into it after playing the Western last week.  It was fun to get back into a tournament.   
 Q.  You say you missed some short putts, but you had four birdies, five birdies on the day.  
SAM HORSFIELD: I had five birdies and a bogey, yeah.  I think I hit 17 greens in regulation, and three of my birdies came from I had three eagle putts.  From there, it's kind of hard to not play good.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the North Course today?  
SAM HORSFIELD: It's playing -- it's definitely not the harder of the courses, so I felt like come in here and get a good score, which I did, and then tomorrow on the South Course we'll see how it is.  It's supposed to rain, which will soften it up, which is an advantage for me.  I hit it quite far and I hit it quite high.  I'm excited for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You mentioned it a little bit, which leads me to the question, North Course being easier, in quotes, of the two courses.  Did you think about putting a big number up today to get a little pad for tomorrow?  
SAM HORSFIELD: You can't really think about that.  At the end of the day, I'm just trying to go out there and play my best, and if I have a good day, then I shoot whatever, and if I have a bad day, I go make it up tomorrow.  You can't put too much pressure on yourself, especially when you're just trying to finish in the top 64, make it to the match play.
