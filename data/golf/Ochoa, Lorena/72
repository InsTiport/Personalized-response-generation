 Q. Still the defending champ heading into Sunday's final. Take us through some of your shots today. 
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, it wasn't a great day. I didn't hit the ball good and I didn't putt good. It was a roller coaster out there. 
 I made birdie on the last hole and have a little chance now. There's nothing I can do. Just come here tomorrow and do my best.

 Q. Important to have a strong finish out there to provide more confidence heading into tomorrow? You mentioned the birdie. 
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes. I mean, you know, I feel (indiscernible) better. I mean, like I said, you know, tomorrow is another round.

 Q. There were a lot of low scores out there tomorrow. What do you think you have to shoot to be right at the top?
 LORENA OCHOA: I'm not going to think about that. I'm going to try to make birdie on every hole and we'll see what happens. You never know.
