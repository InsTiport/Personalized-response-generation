 Q. Sum up the week, put the week into words. 
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, for sure I wanted to play better but I think it was important for the week for me to try to enjoy it as much as I could and that's what I did. It was the first time to have my husband on the course, and I think we both had a good time.
 And I want to say thank you to the players for being here and making this tournament so special.
