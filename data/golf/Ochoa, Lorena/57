 Q. What did it mean to be out here to see that? 
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, I can't imagine how she's doing right now. But I guess it will come for all of us at one point. So we can only say that we enjoyed having her and thank you for everything. 

 Q. Did you say anything to her? 
 LORENA OCHOA: Congratulations and thank you for everything. The same. 

 Q. Can you talk about your coming back here to defend your title in 2008? 
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes, I wanted to sink that ball on 17. You know, we've been doing that every year, it was just a tough week. Hard to concentrate. And I didn't have my best week on the greens. It was just not easy year for me. 
 But I'm just going to take it easy, and enjoy the weekend here with my family. I'm very happy because it's been a great year.

 Q. Can you talk about your season? You've had some great things happening, and some other things off the course, too. Just talk about the year?
 LORENA OCHOA: Okay. I think a great year. We improved a lot on the foundation, helping more kids. And winning the tournaments, winning a major. Playing the tournament in Guadalajara, I think was the best of the year. A lot of good things. 
 I think I have a better idea of what I want to do next year, and even have more time for me and have more time for practice because it's hard to do everything. I think I'm going to be a better player next year. I'm going to make sure I have a good season, and come back strong.
