 Q.  Tomorrow is another day? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I will be ready for tomorrow. 

 Q.  You're used to taking the lead into Sunday, is that right? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

 Q.  Maybe it's time that you come from behind on Sunday? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Maybe it's time.  I'm positive, you know.  I'm not very happy with that double bogey on the par 3, but the good thing is I'm only two shots behind the leaders, and I'm happy with my game. 
 I hit solid today to give myself an opportunity, and hopefully tomorrow is one of those low rounds, and I can make it to the top. 

 Q.  What happened on 15? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I misjudged the wind.  I thought it was a great shot.  I hit it the way I wanted to hit it, and I hit it the so low that the wind didn't touch the ball, and I ended up on the back of the green.  And sometimes it's different with the weather and things, but it was just a shot that went wrong. 

 Q.  Today you got off to great starts, eagle and birdie, get right up there; whereas yesterday you took a while to get started.  Hopefully you can put 18 together, good, solid golf? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yes.  I think this is a course that sometimes is easy to make pars, sometimes it's easy to make birdies, so hopefully you get off to a good start, and I'm going to do that tomorrow. 

 Q.  You were going to go for the green in the first hole there -- 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Uh-huh.  I went left to right, and I tried with my shot and -- (no microphone).  Hopefully I can come out there tomorrow and play well. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  It's easier, you know. 

 Q.  You barely missed 3 and 4. 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  And 6 you kind of got ahold of it, I think.  I'm stretching it. 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yeah, just one of those days you don't make many putts, but hopefully tomorrow.  Thank you.
