   LORENA OCHOA:  Well, I tried really hard and I gave everything.  I'm really happy because of that.  There is nothing else I can do. I played really good.  Just my putting didn't really help me today and a little upset about that, but nothing else I can do. 

 Q.  You had a really good chance; you were in it all day.  Can you tell us about what happened on the last few holes?  Did you misread greens or not feel comfortable on the greens? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  No, nothing really happened.  I just had a really bad break on my second shot, on 16.  I had a really bad lie, downhill deep in the rough.  One yard to the right I'm in the bunker and one yard to the left I'm in a good lie in the fairway.  Just sometimes, you know, you need to have good breaks and make them. 
 So it didn't happen for me. 

 Q.  You had a lot of people pulling for you; talk about going into the next tournament. 
 LORENA OCHOA:  We have a big event with Annika in MÃ©xico and then go to Rochester.  There's nothing that I can really change, just keep trying and hopefully it will happen. 

 Q.  The U.S. Open coming up, your next chance, is there more pressure on you being No. 1? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  No, I don't feel the pressure.  I'm enjoying myself a lot and I'm really having a good time.  I want to, you know, stay there.  So I'm going to keep working hard and hopefully next time. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts on the course? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I think the course on the weekend played a lot more like a major.  During the week it was soft greens and soft fairways but they did a great job on the weekend.  It's a good challenge. 

 Q.  And how about the crowds? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I always enjoy it very much.  They give a lot of support and a lot of Mexicans come to watch me play.  It feels very nice.
