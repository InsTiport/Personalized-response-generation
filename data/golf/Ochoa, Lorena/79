  Q. That was a great shot, birdie, birdie, and the first birdie was not easy.   
 LORENA OCHOA: I think that driver, I was very fortunate that it was in play.   
  
  Q. And the second hole?   
 LORENA OCHOA: The second birdie? I hit a driver and then I hit a 5-iron just in front of the green, maybe 25 feet for birdie, just 2-putted.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like you were on cruise control there for the last few holes?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I felt good today. I think you know, I was smart and just playing on the right side of the course. On 17th tee, I got really mad, bad drive off the tee and didn't hit a good chip, but the rest, I have no complaints. I think 3-under is always good and we're just starting and I'm going to try to take it one club at a time.  
  
  Q. What was the right club to take on the 17th?   
 LORENA OCHOA: 5-wood.  
  
  Q. What did you hit in practise?  
 LORENA OCHOA: In practise, I hit everything.   
  
  Q. Character of the course, is it different today after a little bit of rain overnight? Is it the course softer?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I don't think it rained during the night. I'm sure but the conditions were perfect. We played 13 holes with zero wind, and they were soft, the greens, and we all knew that it was going to be 6-, 7-under for sure. It's okay. Hopefully we have good weather and a low round tomorrow.   
 I think the first day, I'm not worried. You just go out there and I thought, let's work hard and try to putt my name up there.
