  Q. Can you just talk about your week and being here in Mexico City?  
 LORENA OCHOA: It was a good week. I think overall it was really one of the best weeks, for sure. Losing the tournament, it doesn't feel that good, but I tried my best, and congratulations to her.   
 I learned a lot, and I think the way I finished on the Back 9 was the way to play and I enjoyed with my crowd. So I want to say thank you to all of them, and we'll try again next year.  
  
  Q. What mental thoughts are going through your head as you go through your Back 9, and you are making a comeback?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Just to keep all the emotions down. It was hard to do it.   
 I mean I really thought I had a chance. I tried to be aggressive on the last ball, I hit the green in two, and getting a good ball and good break, I thought this is happening. But unfortunately, I didn't make the putt, but I tried my best. I really enjoyed today.  
  
  Q. Okay. Looking forward to next week, you're defending your title.   
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes. We'll have a flight tomorrow, and maybe practice a little bit tomorrow on the course. So I'll be there tomorrow.
