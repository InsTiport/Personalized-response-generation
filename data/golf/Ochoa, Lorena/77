  Q. What happened on the back?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, you know, I got a bad break on No. 10 in that bunker, and then I hit really bad my driver. I got in trouble with my tee shot, a lot of wind.   
  
  Q. Did you lose your swing at all, or just were conditions just overwhelming?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yeah, I lost my swing a little bit -- in the bunker right.   
  
  Q. I imagine you'll go straight to the range and try to find whatever you had?   
 LORENA OCHOA: You know, there's nothing I can do. I still managed to get 1-under par for the day, and still in the Top-10 and hopefully tomorrow I can play good.   
  
  Q. The wind seemed to be quiet when you were in the trees and then you got out and it was swirling a little?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I don't think there was much to complain about. The wind conditions were the same for everybody.   
 My tee shots were what got me in trouble and for some reason I just didn't feel comfortable over the ball and that's what happened.   
  
  Q. You might be four or five behind going into tomorrow.   
 LORENA OCHOA: I would like to be closer if not in the lead but if this is my position, there's nothing I can do. Hopefully I can get a good start tomorrow and we'll see.   
  
  Q. You had a very good front nine. Is there a highlight amongst the five birdies?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I really enjoyed No. 9. My strategy was to keep it short of the bunkers and it paid off with a good putt. I played very well on the front and hopefully I find the same thing tomorrow for 18 holes.   
  
  Q. Do you have any idea when you lose your swing what's going on?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I'm ahead of the ball already and the face is open -- my upper body.   
  
  Q. Do you still think you can win this thing?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes.
