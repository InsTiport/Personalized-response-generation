  Q. Just talk about the day today, obviously a little bit better than yesterday?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, for sure, a better day from the tee to the green. I didn't miss popular shots, but I feel a little bit frustrated because I felt like I was going really low today, but it just seems like I couldn't get a rhythm and I couldn't get a momentum but the good thing is we have two more days. Hopefully better on the weekend.  
  
  Q. Obviously you came in here wanting to win, do you think where you're sitting right now, is that still a realistic goal for you?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, I'm not going to say that I don't have chances anymore. But I guess right now, it's out of my hands what the other players do. I'm going to try to get here tomorrow, probably going to play early again and shoot a low round. It would be nice to just even if I had a chance to win, or just to post a low round for me and especially for the fans.
