  Q. Talk about your weekend play, maybe didn't go as well as you would have liked?  
 LORENA OCHOA: That's for sure. I didn't have a good weekend. It was tough for me. Really no excuses but it's been a tough year. I tried really hard but it didn't happen for me.  
  
  Q. Did you get a feeling at the start of the day that Suzann might have been too far out in front to catch her?  
 LORENA OCHOA: I wasn't thinking about her. I was trying to concentrate on my own game and make as many birdies as possible. For sure she had a great week and she's been playing very solid especially during the weekend and she deserved a win.  
  
  Q. It's been two years since she's last won, with a five-shot lead, I'm sure she'll get it home, were you surprised she went that long without winning given how good she is?  
 LORENA OCHOA: You never know. Sometimes you play good when you don't win and sometimes you play okay and a win, you never know how it's going to come. She's been working hard and she's been patient and she has a great attitude, and this is a good tournament for her, so congratulations.   
  
  Q. So one more golfer chasing you as the No. 1 position now?  
 LORENA OCHOA: It's okay.
