   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in. Nice birdie to finish off your day on 18, which puts you into a tie for the lead going into Sunday. Talk about how your day went for you.  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes, well, for sure I'm really pleased the way I played today. I can't remember when was the last time I hit the ball so solidly. I think I have 18 birdie chances and didn't make any bogeys.   
 It was a great day, one of those days you want to remember always. You keep them in the top of your head and have just good memories.   
 So I'm pretty happy. I wanted to put myself in a good position on Sunday to give myself a chance to win the tournament. I'm happy I'm right up there. I know it's not going be easy, because Sophie and the other players are really good. But I'm gonna try to win the tournament tomorrow.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, I left some birdie opportunities out there on the front nine, definitely. I probably should have made one or two more putts. Just, you know, either right on the edge or just leave it a little bit short or just misread one of them. That's exactly what I told myself: Just keep doing the same thing and be patient.   
 It was important to me to make the putt on the hole No. 12, and then just got momentum from that. Right away it happened, you know. I started hitting the ball as well and feeling more comfortable with my putting. I dropped a few good putts today, and that was really the difference today.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: Answering the questions why I'm not playing good?   
  
  Q. Yeah, does that give you extra motivation.   
 LORENA OCHOA: No. You know, when you are a professional, you have to be there for the good and for the bad answers. You know, I respect the opinion of the media and the players, and the results show that I wasn't playing my best golf.   
 It's okay. There's nothing wrong. I also say that I've been working hard and I feel much better and I play good the last few weeks. I feel that I'm getting the better rhythm, and that's why I'm here today.   
 Hopefully tomorrow is a better day and we just continue in that direction.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: I think tomorrow for both of us gonna be exactly the same thing. Gonna tee off having the same opportunities. Sophie's been playing great. You know, I don't want to say it's an advantage, because every single time it's different. It depends on how you feel, how is the course, how you're hitting the ball.  
 I'm gonna try not to pay attention to her game tomorrow and just play my own game, and hopefully be at the top.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: I learned that I'm okay, and sometimes it's better to put the ball on the green first so she can see where I put it. I'm just gonna try to think that way tomorrow.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: I think they water the fairways and the green quite a bit during the night because they were soft today. It surprised me. I really, really felt that on the weekend they gonna play really hard, and it surprised me that they were soft.   
 We'll see what is the surprise tomorrow and just try to adjust and play from that.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: Like I just said, I'm gonna play my own game and try to see the scoreboard. I think if I get a good start, like I been trying to do every day, I should be in good shape.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: The wind, yes, especially on the back.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: Every tee shot it was in a different direction, so you have to think twice and make sure you have the right club selection. It was swirling around. I don't know if it's usual in this area, but seems like on every tee it was a different direction.   
 You have to be patient and have a good strategy and pick the right club.
