  Q. The Back 9 probably didn't go the way you wanted today. What are your views on your opening round?  
 LORENA OCHOA: I got in trouble from the tee. When you're playing in a major championship, I'm not so good in the morning. I think it was a good way to start a couple under. And then I'm pretty upset that I didn't take advantage of that.   
 But that's the way it is. I finished one under par, and tomorrow should be a better day for me.   
  
  Q. When your driver's going a little wayward, are you thinking mechanics out there to try to fix it or?  
 LORENA OCHOA: No, no, no. I think more just freedom. I wasn't really quick with my hands today, just I didn't give myself enough time.   
 I think I was a little bit anxious, and so I'm going to go to the range and work a little bit on my rhythm and get a better feeling for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Your driving was so good last week in Phoenix.   
 LORENA OCHOA: It was a little bit in the rough, and you're going to hit it where you are. (Laughs).   
 But yeah, for sure, it wasn't a good day for me today, so I'm going to, like I said, get a better feeling in the afternoon, and tomorrow that will be my goal just to hit more fairways and be in better position.  
  
  Q. When you look at the leader board and you see some people at 6-under, are you surprised at those low scores?  
 LORENA OCHOA: I think it's really good golf with the pin placement we had today, and I am surprised. I think three, 4-under is good, but I saw the 6's and that's very impressive.   
 So I play tomorrow in the afternoon. I'm just trying to stay positive and hopefully tomorrow make a few more birdies.
