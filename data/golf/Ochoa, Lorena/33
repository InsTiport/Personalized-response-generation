  Q. Lorena, we saw some maybe some rare signs of frustration for you. Was that kind of what you were feeling today?  
 LORENA OCHOA: It was not a good day. Par-5s, and I didn't have good opportunity to make birdie, and that would be the way I like to play.   
  
  Q. You might be six shots or so behind going into tomorrow. Is there anything you can do to maybe put the pressure on Suzann, to try and take the lead tomorrow?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, I think, you know, I'm sort of try to come here tomorrow, and I guess I'm going to play ahead of her and hopefully make a few birdies to get a low round in there, and it hasn't happened.   
  
  Q. Is it difficult? You've had big leads before. Is it difficult sometimes playing with that big lead to change your game maybe?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yeah, because it's different. Everybody plays different.   
 It seems like, you know, she's playing really solid golf, so you have to play a really low round to have a chance.  
  
  Q. Was today a lot tougher than the previous two for the conditions on the course?  
 LORENA OCHOA: I think a little bit. Not hard. I think if you hit the ball good, you're going to arrive, and it didn't happen for me today, but hopefully tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Good luck.   
 LORENA OCHOA: Thank you.
