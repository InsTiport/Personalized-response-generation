  Q. Was that the kind of round -- was that a good round for you, about as good as you could do today?  
 LORENA OCHOA: It should be better but I'm really happy with that. It was important to get started in the right direction and I like my position.   
 I'm going to go to do some practice in the afternoon and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Is this the sort of course you feel comfortable on when you're playing here? Why did you shoot so well today?  
 LORENA OCHOA: I think for sure, it's a pretty course, but it's more the way you are hitting the ball. And last week, my second shots were far away from the flag. Today I was more accurate. It's easier when you have birdie chances. So I'm going to try to repeat that the next three days.  
  
  Q. You're the closest to Anna Rawson, two strokes behind her, how good of a round is 7-under out there this morning?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Pretty good. I think it was important to take advantage of the nice weather this morning. It got harder in the afternoon with the wind. For me, it's good to have a low round in the early wave, so we'll see how the weather is tomorrow and just try to do the same.   
  
  Q. And I guess you must feel good about your position, another chance maybe to take a run at this tournament title.   
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, that's way too ahead. I'm just trying to play one day at a time and be 100% for tomorrow and go from there.
