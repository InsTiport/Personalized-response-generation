  Q.  Talk about your day.   
 LORENA OCHOA:  It was a good day.  I try a little bit hard and bogey and (indiscernible) birdies on the back.  You know, good rhythm, and a little bit bad rhythm finish with a bad bogey on 18.  Nothing I can do now and I think tomorrow should be a good day to go low.   
  
  Q.  Has the course accepted the water to this point to your satisfaction?   
 LORENA OCHOA:  The course is in good shape, just very, very wet.  But the greens are in great shape and everything around the greens look good, so I think, you know, once you get out there -- and there's a bit of a breeze today.   
 The wind has been a big factor.  You, know, I'm doing okay.  We'll see tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible).   
 LORENA OCHOA:  I saw that last year.  It's very important to finish even around par on the last three holes.  It's just a learning experience, so I'm going to make sure that I finish even par or hopefully under for the last three holes.   
  
  Q.  Do you have a different mindset for a 54-hole tournament as opposed to a 72-hole tournament?   
 LORENA OCHOA:  It's important to have a good (indiscernible), so I did okay today.  I wanted to do better but I didn't see (indiscernible), so tomorrow is going to be important.  Tomorrow is Cinco de Mayo.   
  
  Q.  What was it about the Back 9 where you turned it on?   
 LORENA OCHOA:  I didn't like my start, and, you know, I knew I had to make some birdies and put myself in a good position.  So be more aggressive on the Back 9, get good rhythm.  I'm going to try to do the same tomorrow and hopefully we can make a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible).   
 LORENA OCHOA:  My left hand is (indiscernible) hopefully it will be good for tomorrow.
