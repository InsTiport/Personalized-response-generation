 Q.  What kind of day did you have today? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  It was a good day.  It was solid.  It was tougher than yesterday because of the wind.  Just played safe golf and had some birdie chances and I liked very much the way I finished. 

 Q.  Was that your goal today, to play safe? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Well, I think I played for sure -- just played in the right position because some holes could be really tough and lead to a big number.  I liked that strategy and was really controlling my irons, so that was good. 

 Q.  Have you changed a little bit the way you are and not care that you're not winning? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  No, I like it.  In a tournament like this it's not hard to look at the leaderboard, at the scoreboard.  You're always trying to see what is the number and which players are around there.  It's kind of fun. 

 Q.  When do you start feeling the pressure of this event? 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Well, we always play under pressure and we know how important it is every hole, every day.  I've been trying to put -- just keep trying to play solid every day, and I'm going to do the same Saturday and Sunday.
