  Q. What is your explanation or evaluation of your play today?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I think it was easy. We didn't have much wind. It's important to take advantage of that today and get a good start. I'm going to need to work harder.   
 There are some tough pin placements. Some different than last year, so we have that out of the way. Of course, we're going to be playing here for the next few days.  
  
  Q. Had a couple of doubles on the card today. It was kind of frustrating. Is it hard to make up those shots, I guess?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes. You know I have nothing to complain. I still have a chance. I'm not too far from the top 16 to make it to the next round. So I'm just going to be positive now and play good tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Tell me it works in your favor when you come off just like you said. You're not chasing the lead, you're chasing the Top 16?  
 LORENA OCHOA: If you make it, it works in your favor, so we'll see tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How important is it going to be to get off to a good start so you don't have to come 16, 17, 18?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I don't want to do anything crazy. I think I'm only two shots back. So tomorrow just play a normal round of golf, and enjoy myself all day, I should be in good shape.  
  
  Q. Did you have a wedge go right under there early on? What was that?   
 LORENA OCHOA: On the 8.  
  
  Q. Just undercut it?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Yep. That's it.
