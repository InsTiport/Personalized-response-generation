   MIKE SCANLAN: Tell us about your day. How did it go for you out there?   
 LORENA OCHOA: It was a better day for sure, especially the start. And I was able to be at 3-under par for the round, unfortunately I had a couple of bogeys, but it was a tough finish. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day.   
  
  Q. Has it been difficult juggling playing and hosting?   
 LORENA OCHOA: No, it's been good. A lot easier than I've done. I think they have done a great job with the renovation and I have just been able to stay relaxed and practice and take my practice time.   
 No, for sure, it's been a lot of respect from the fans. The volunteers are doing a great job, too. So it's unfortunate I didn't have my best two days so far but hopefully the weekend is better.  
  
  Q. Is everything okay with your swing?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I'm a little bit out of rhythm. I'm a little bit quick with my hands. I think that's why I'm losing the control of the ball, and I'm not having any easy birdie chances. One of my goals tomorrow is just to do better than that, and hopefully I have closer birdie opportunities.
