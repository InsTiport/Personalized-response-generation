 LORENA OCHOA:  Yes, that putt made my day.  I'm really happy.  You know, all day I was just trying to make birdies.  I didn't make any putts.

And finally on the 18th, that was the last one.  And it feels good to finish in a good position.
Q.  I saw you hit 14 greens today; that's almost flawless.  You had 34 putts; that's not normal for you.
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yes.  You know, I have    the putts I missed, I was pretty far.  The greens are huge here, and I was    with the wind and conditions sometimes, you just put the ball on the green.  But I would have 40  or 45  or 50 foot putts.

So I feel good.  I feel very comfortable.  I'm not going to give up.  I think I'm in a good position for the weekend.  I think if I make those putts tomorrow I'll be in good shape.
Q.  What are the conditions today compared to yesterday?
 LORENA OCHOA:  I thought they would be easier, but no, for some reason    I think the wind picked up earlier than I thought it would be.  And in the back nine they have some tough pin placements.  I want to say pretty similar.  I think it was about the same.
Q.  Were there any holes you had trouble getting there in regulation?
LORENA OCHOA:  No.
Q.  Were you hitting longer irons or shorter irons than yesterday?
 LORENA OCHOA:  Shorter irons today, yes.  Yesterday on the back nine, from 10 to 18, I had a lot longer than today.  There was 25 to 30 yards of wind.  Today only 15 or 20 yards.  Some of them were straight into.
Q.  So it was longer today or playing longer yesterday?
LORENA OCHOA:  Shorter today.
