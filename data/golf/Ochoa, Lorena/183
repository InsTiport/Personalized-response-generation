LORENA OCHOA:  Yes, my tee shot, I just was a little bit too easy, fell a little behind.  I told myself, make sure you get it past the hole and you'll have a good approach coming back.  I wasn't going to go    it was too far.
Q.  How do you feel, feeling pretty good?
LORENA OCHOA:  Either way, it was a tough match, and I came back and it was great on 16, get some momentum and on 17 we tied for par.
Q.  Your friendliness with Brittany, you guys are friends, and it was kind of fun, I know it's hard for you
LORENA OCHOA:  Yeah, it's much better playing with someone that you share something on the golf course, so many hours, so many holes today, so it was a fun match.  It was very relaxed and I really had a great time.
