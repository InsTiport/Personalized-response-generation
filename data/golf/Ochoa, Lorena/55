  Q. Everyone seemed to find it hard out there with the heat today?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes, but it wasn't only that. I got myself into a bit of trouble out there today. For some reason it didn't happen for me today, but hopefully, I can play better tomorrow.   
  
  Q. But you're still looking good going into the weekend?  
 LORENA OCHOA: For sure, I am not too far from the leaders, and I will try to be a little more aggressive tomorrow and hopefully the balls will drop.   
  
  Q. What do you think of Feng Shanshan today?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Firstly, I want to say congratulations for all that she has done.   
She is very young and a great model for girls starting to play. I wish her all the best.   
  
  Q. What is the plan for now?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I am going to rest. I am a little tired.
