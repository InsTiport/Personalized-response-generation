   MIKE SCANLAN: Happy birthday.   
 LORENA OCHOA: Thank you.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Today is your birthday; did it feel any different out there today, especially being here with your family, all your friends and all of the people in Guadalajara?   
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes, it's the first time in many years that I'm here in Guadalajara for my birthday. It was nice to have time with my family and to be here playing in front of my people.  
 It was nice to hear them sing the happy birthday. It was very nice, very special.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you talk about your day today? You played pretty well. Were you happy with it.  
 LORENA OCHOA: I was a little bit, I moved up a few places and that's important. I made more birdies today, a few mistakes but I think the birdies are fun for me and for the gallery and hopefully tomorrow it's even better.   
  
  Q. What's your strategy going into tomorrow? Are you going to change anything?  
 LORENA OCHOA: No, I think I know the strategy of the course. It's more about controlling my emotions and my feelings.   
 I'm just going to be with a smile on my face and trying to enjoy every moment on every hole and it should be a great day tomorrow for all of us.  
  
  Q. You're seven shots back. Is it possible to come back and win your own event?  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes, I'm not going to give up. You never know what could happen. I'm going to make sure I got a good start, that's always important, and my goal is to put some pressure on the other players, and most important, to really enjoy the round. That would be great for me.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you.
