  Q. Can you talk about your birdies?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I made five birdies. I had a birdie on the second hole. I hit a 5-wood just ten yards short and I chipped up to about three feet and made it.   
 Made birdie on No. 4 with a 6-iron, 165 yards, six feet and I made it.   
 Made bogey on No. 8. I just left it way short and I have about a 40-footer.   
 No. 10, I hit a 3-wood and 2-putted for birdie.   
 Number 13, I hit a 7-iron 165 yards about ten feet and I made it.   
 14, I hit a 3-wood to 130 yards and 2-putted for birdie.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the conditions a little bit, how windy it was?   
 LORENA OCHOA: I'm impressed with how low the scores are. They are very tough conditions, and I'm very happy with my round and happy with the position I am. I'm really excited for tomorrow.
