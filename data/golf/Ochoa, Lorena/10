 Q. How do you feel being back out there again? 
 LORENA OCHOA: Well, it's good to be back. It would be better if I had a better round today. Especially the end of the day was a tough one because I tried really hard to stay around par and just finishing really good. But nothing I can do now.

 Q. Do you take it just as hard now as you do pre-retirement or do you have a different outlook now? 
 LORENA OCHOA: No, I thought this year the tournament would be easier for me. I thought it would be just less -- you know, with a lot of adrenaline and under pressure, I was trying to play good. 
 But it was really difficult for me. I didn't have any control on my shots. I was hitting the ball too far. I probably hit four balls over the green, so that's tough to score. Hopefully tomorrow I adjust a little bit better and then try to have a better round.

 Q. How did your caddy do? 
 LORENA OCHOA: He did pretty good. I was very impressed. But I know talking to him he did a good job. He was taking care of his, how do you say, his bag, his goodies, so he did good.

 Q. You and Ai are good friends. How do you think about Ai in this tournament? 
 LORENA OCHOA: In this tournament or in general? 

 Q. In the tournament. 
 LORENA OCHOA: She's very good. She's a very, very solid player. Her putting is very good, and she proved that today one more time. So now she's got birdies. She's a great player. I like her. We are good friends, and I wish her the best.
