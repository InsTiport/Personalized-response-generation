 Q. How good was your round considering the conditions? 
 LORENA OCHOA: It was close to being really, really good, but the way I finished, I am very disappointed. I made two bogeys in the last seven holes. I know they are playing tough, but I just missed a few important chances. It was a tough day but in the big picture, I am happy with my score.

 Q. Was it the long shots, the full shots or the putting? 
 LORENA OCHOA: It was everything. From the tee, it was important to hit good drivers, which I did, which I'm even more upset because I was in good position on certain holes, but I couldn't control my swing. With so much wind I kept losing my balance. 

 Q. How do you feel about your standing in the tournament overall at the halfway point?
 LORENA OCHOA: I am happy. Of course I have two more days to go, and I know that three or four shots better, and I would be in the Top-10. 
 So I'm going to try to be positive for the weekend and get here tomorrow with a good feeling. Hopefully we will have not too much wind the next couple of days, and I can shoot a low round.

 Q. What was the iron you used on 16? It looked like the wind had an effect. 
 LORENA OCHOA: 6-iron, 139 yards. It was 25 miles per hour wind I think into us right-to-left, and I lost my balance and hit the ball to the right. 

 Q. So basically managing the wind today, it affected everything? 
 LORENA OCHOA: Yes.
