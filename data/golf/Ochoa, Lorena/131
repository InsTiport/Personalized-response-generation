   PAM WARNER:  Lorena, thanks for joining us today.  Big week for you here in Alabama.  You've been on a little bit of a vacation, but you've come in and won the last three tournaments you played in.  Talk about your time off and coming back and playing this week 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Hello everybody.  Yeah, this has been my first week back playing.  I took four weeks off.  It was nice to be able to go home and spend time with friends and family, but I'm glad to be back.  It was a little bit too much. 
 Because this year after winning the British and my sponsors and things to do, I was very happy to be back here on Tour on Sunday and be relaxed and practice and get out on the course. 
 I now have a good feel of the golf course.  It's going to be a good challenge and I think it's going to be fun.  The greens are at different levels, and that's always interesting.  I can't wait to start playing tomorrow. 
 PAM WARNER:  Questions for Lorena. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  They help a lot.  They help a lot.  Yes, it was tough.  I did six weeks before that and it was just a perfect time to go home and relax a little bit.  I was mentally really tired and physically just like, you know, getting heavy legs.  It was also, you know, for me it was great after the wins just to spend time with my family and share it them what I did, talk to them a little bit.  I've been able to be home and really enjoy myself. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I live in Guadalajara.  Every time I have a week off I go home.  My coach is back there, too.  So the last two weeks I have good practice and, you know, getting back and feel good and being 100% ready to start the tournament this week. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  The first two weeks nothing, and the last two weeks good practice. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
LORENA OCHOA:  The wedding?  It was good; it was fun.  It was, you know, it was just a great occasion to get the relatives together and friends I haven't seen in a long time.  My brother looked very happy, so it was a great time.  Thank you. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Well, you know, the three of them, the three wins, were very important.  All of them very different.  In Portland on Sunday I was feeling all the pressure.  On 18 green feeling everything really, really together and thinking, Three in a row. 
 And I don't know if you remember but in Portland we had a lot of Mexicans watching the beautiful Sunday round.  And now, you know, that I'm here, I'm back, of course I'm thinking of winning four in a row.  That's why I'm here. 
 I like my chances.  I know there are many good players out there, but I want to take it a round at a time and get a good round in tomorrow and go from there. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Uh-huh. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yes.  I think everything is a little bit humid, a little bit wet, the course.  But by Sunday, by the weekend, I think it should be fine.  I like also the change with the greens, the grass.  I'm a little more used to that instead of Bermuda.  I have good memories here in Alabama.  Everybody as been so good and just helping us a lot.  Been good so far. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I think on this course you really need to take advantage of Par 5s.  Three of them are pretty reachable.  Make a few birdies.  Some of holes the greens are high and big, you know, hills.  How do you say?  It goes down.  Down, uh-huh. 
 But if you miss a second shot it could cost you very easy and be hard to save the par.  So a lot of (indiscernible) here, especially on the greens.  Sometimes maybe more important to just put the ball in a good position and play for par on a few holes.  Really have a great strategy in which holes (indiscernible). 
 I actually got here on Sunday and got a good practice on Monday and Tuesday.  I feel comfortable with the strategy, and I think we should be in good shape. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I played only nine holes on Monday and Tuesday.  It was more important to me to get a good practice and a good rhythm after the wedding.  It happened on Saturday.  I didn't play Saturday or Sunday. 
 It was important to hit some balls and get back into the rhythm.  I'm feeling really good.  I hit the ball good today.  So, yeah, I'm doing okay. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I'm not sure.  I think I average on tour about 235.  It's a little bit different in Guadalajara.  We are almost 3,000 meters, so we hit the ball farther.  Once you get here it's humid and pretty heavy, so it's different, yeah, to adjust. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yeah.  I don't think I'm going to try to do anything crazy on that hole.  If I have less than 210 in front of the green I think I'll give myself a chance to hit the green in two.  If not, just lay up, even though it's a very easy lay up.  8-iron on the left side maybe a hundred yards in because you could cost you. 
 So it depends, you know, what do you need to do, especially on a Sunday afternoon.  But it looks like I'm going to play from the safe side and be smart on that hole. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I'm not going home where I can recharge and be happy and workout and eat some Mexican food, get strong. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  Yes, yes.  Not necessarily that I rest physically because I been going to the beach and different activities.  Just to get away from golf it helps and do something different.  I'm feeling really good, and I'm excited to be back.  It's good to be back on the Tour once you been away.  I'm happy to be here. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 LORENA OCHOA:  I love to do it.  I think I can do it.  So right now it's just one tournament at a time.  Just really enjoying my time that I have the opportunities.  I'm going to fight pretty hard. 
 PAM WARNER:  Any more questions?  All right.  Thank you.  Good luck this week.
