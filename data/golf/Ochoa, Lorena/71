  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: For some reason I only made two birdies in 36 holes. It was very different the first two days. That's the way life is, and I can't complain. It's really been a great week. Beautiful golf course, great crowds, a lot of support. I try my best, so we try next year.  
  
  Q. (Question regarding Katherine Hull.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: Yeah, congratulations to her. You know, we're good friends. We spend time together, and just to see her win it was very special. I know how she's feeling with a first win. She did a great job. Congratulations.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 LORENA OCHOA: No, (indiscernible) in the rough and I didn't want to get in her way. I wanted to make sure she concentrate on reading the hole good. She was very good. She was very calm, and she look like she enjoying.   
  
  Q. What are your thoughts about the greens?  
 LORENA OCHOA: The greens are getting harder and harder.
