Q. Just your general assessments of what you saw today or this week?
JOE LACAVA:   Well, today was better than the week.  He hit good quality shots, rolled it pretty well I thought.  Didn't get a whole lot out of the round.  I don't always look at the final score; I was looking at how he was feeling, and I thought he was moving pretty good and hit it pretty well.  Like I said, it was a tough day.
Q. Encouraging signs moving forward?
JOE LACAVA:   Yeah, for sure.  I think physically he feels good.  Probably go home and work on what he needs to work on, which is probably everything.
Q. What were you happiest to see and what were you maybe not as happy to see?
JOE LACAVA:   Well, I'm happy to see -- making the cut isn't the goal, but the way he made the cut was nice, making two birdies and a nice par on 9, knowing we needed to play on the weekend.  He's 18 for 18 here.  Like I said, I think for me, the bottom line is you're not always going to have -- try to get a little more out of the round.  I feel like he's hitting it better than he scored, know what I mean?  Yeah, overall not too bad.
Q. Are you happy to see him after five months?
JOE LACAVA:   Elated.  Elated to see Rob and him and Erica and to come to one of my favorite spots.  What's not to like?
Q. The last stretch like that would have been 2017?
JOE LACAVA:   Yeah, that was almost a whole year, but that was different circumstances, hurt, beat up, completely different circumstance.  So we'll just try to make the best of the rest of the year.
