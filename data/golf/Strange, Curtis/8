Q.  How did you play?
CURTIS STRANGE:  Not as well as yesterday.  I didn't play as well.  But compounded with a little more wind, it played a little tougher.  So I'm happy with 1 over.  I didn't hit a lot of good shots, but I hit some decent.  I mean I'm happy with 1 over.
Q.  Do you have any like highlight shots?
CURTIS STRANGE:  The best part of my day was when I finished, I birdied 17 and 18.  And it's nice to leave the golf course feeling good about your finish.  So many times we leave the golf course and we bogey the last hole or we miss a putt or something and we're irritated and aggravated, but today I feel good about it.
Q.  So are you confident about tomorrow?
CURTIS STRANGE:  Well, you know, I don't think you can get    I feel okay about my game, but I think everybody's a little cautiously optimistic about the winds coming in.  And I don't care how good your game is, it's going to be very difficult the next two days if they come in.
