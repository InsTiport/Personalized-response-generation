  Q. Scott, your first match in the World Match Play, you've beaten the No. 1 seed, the world No. 4, how does that feel?  
 SCOTT STRANGE: Feels pretty good. Always a nice start.  
  
  Q. How were the emotions late on in that match, because it was very tight.   
 SCOTT STRANGE: Surprisingly the first tee shot I was pretty calm. The whole day I was pretty calm. Not really too excited about it. Just kept on a level playing field and just sort of kept playing consistent, solid golf all day.  
  
  Q. In World Ranking terms, you come in as the outsider; what was your attitude coming in?  
 SCOTT STRANGE: Match play is one-on-one. So A guy can shoot 84 and some guy can shoot 62. I know I can shoot 66. I felt pretty comfortable.   
 I knew Paul was coming back from a bit of time off, so the best time to beat him.  
  
  Q. How much experience do you have in match play?  
 SCOTT STRANGE: A fair bit. As an amateur I played, and my record is pretty good in Australia, looking forward to this afternoon.  
  
  Q. Playing Retief this afternoon, another formidable opponent, what's your thoughts on that one?   
 SCOTT STRANGE: Well, I'll assess that over lunch and tee up on the first and get going again.
