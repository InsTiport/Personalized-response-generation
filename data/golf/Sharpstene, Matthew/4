Q. What was the turning point in the match?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   I won 10 and 11, and on 11 I made a birdie.  It's a really good birdie.
Q. How long was your birdie?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   I hit a 2-iron to like 10 feet and I made it.  And then I won 13.  I birdied 13.  So that got me to 1-up.  Then tied 14.  He beat me on 15, and then 16 I kind of got lucky because I hit a pretty bad chip but he was over the green in three.  I kind up-and-down for par, and he didn't.  So I was 1-up with two to play.
I like these holes.  I didn't have much problem there.
Q. When did the TV cameras show up?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   There was one on 15 tee, and then 16, 17 and 18.
Q. Had you ever played in front of the cameras?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   No.
Q. What did you think about that?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   It's cool.  I feel like I was a little nervous, but it's fun, just proving to a lot of people what I can do.
Q. Was that your dad on the bag?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   Yeah, it's been awesome having him on the bag.  He taught me all throughout.  I've never had a lesson with anybody else.
Q. What was your first thought when you saw John's name against yours in the bracket last night?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   I was excited, just because I wanted to play against someone good, and that way coming out of the gates, if I win, it just shows that I can play.  Here I am.
Q. On that last putt, you knew you had to at least get it close.  What did it look like as far as the speed and the break and all that?  How long was it?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   I mean it was straight uphill right into the wind.  It was like 30, 35 feet.  I've been leaving a lot of putts short, so I was like telling myself, don't leave it short.  I hit it pretty hard.  When I hit it, I honestly thought it might have to sit, but it ended up being just short.
Q. Are you proud of yourself right now?
MATTHEW SHARPSTENE:   Yeah, yeah, I'm happy.  I've still got a long way to go.  I came here to win.
