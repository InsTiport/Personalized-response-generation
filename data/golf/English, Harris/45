  HARRIS ENGLISH:   Played well coming the stretch, and I knew coming into today Graeme was a pretty hard Ryder Cup warrior for the European side and it was going to be a tough match.   He got off to a pretty good start and I knew I had to do something on the back nine to get going.   I hit some really good shots, made a couple of putts and got it done.  
   
 Q.   It's an interesting format.   If you come away on Thursday, you probably knew you needed to play well today and the same tomorrow?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   You've got to have a little luck.   Losing to Rickie yesterday, the destiny is not really in my hands.   I needed to come out and play a good match and I did that.   Kind of see how it goes from here.   Every match you are going to play somebody tough and you've gotta bring you're "A" game.  
   
 Q.   Do you typically play well in this area if the U.S.?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I really hadn't played in San Francisco that much.   I played in the West Coast a good bit.   I played U.S. Amateur.   I played Olympic Club in the U.S. Amateur in 2007.   I enjoy this area, I love the West Coast.   It's a good changeâ€‘up from Georgia where I'm from.
