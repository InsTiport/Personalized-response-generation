 Q.  I know you feel like you left some shots out there even though you played a great tournament.  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I wish I would have had a couple more good birdie chances coming down the stretch, but that's how golf is.  Jordan has played really well coming down the stretch, and I was just right there, I guess, to put some pressure on him, and it didn't work out.  I love being in this position.  I love being in the heat like that coming down the last nine holes with a chance to win, so I feel like I played some good golf and hit some good golf shots and take a lot of confidence from this tournament.   
 Q.  At what point were you checking the leaderboard and aware of what was happening behind you?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I definitely knew what was going on pretty much all day.  Obviously getting off to that good start on the first hole was -- (crowd erupts over Spieth #17 chip-in) watching him kind of do what he did at the Masters, I felt really bad for him, but I knew he would come back from it and kind of do what he did here.  He's one of the best putters in the world and best players in the world, and I knew he was going to come back and he was going to be tough to beat today, and I gave it a good go.  I thought 4-under would have a pretty good chance.   
 Q.  In the same respect do you take a lot of confidence in your third top 10 this year?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, I love being in that position and just wish I could be in it more because the more and more I'm in it, the better I'm going to get.  I've got a week off next week and can go into Memphis where I've had some success earlier, had a win there a couple years ago, so can take a lot of confidence from this week and go into Memphis and the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  Walk me through that eagle hole out on No. 1, and how important was that as you're looking at the leaderboard here and chasing the leader?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, that was a great start.  Obviously there's only two par-5s out here, so if you can birdie both of them, it's a really good chance, and starting out with a hole-out, I couldn't expect anything more than that, and it got me off to a good start and I kind of kept going from there.  I felt like I played some really good golf and hit some good shots coming down the stretch, and unfortunately it didn't work out, but obviously Spieth did some pretty spectacular stuff coming down the stretch.  I mean, it's not easy to lose, but it's easier to lose like that when somebody just outplays you.   
 Q.  For you after 11 no birdies.  Obviously going down the stretch it's difficult to win.  What is your feeling about how you ended up playing down the stretch?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I felt good.  I wish I could have hit it a little closer to the hole a couple times, but I felt like I really managed my game.  I played some good, smart golf, and I just needed a couple more putts.  I can take a lot from this week and have a lot of confidence going into Memphis, which is my next tournament, then the U.S. Open.  So I'm very excited about where my game is at.  I've put a lot of hard work in.  My game is back on track, and it's paid off.   
 Q.  How hungry are you to get back into that winner's circle?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's why we play this game is to get in that situation, to feel the heat, feel the nerves a little bit.  I love it.  Yeah, I'm going to not take a whole lot of days off next week, I'm going to go back and practice and work to be there in Memphis.
