 Q.   Talk about your bogey on 8.   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It's really tough out there.   This golf course is tight, and if you miss a shot, the desert kind of sneaks up, and it kind of jumped off and bit me on the (indiscernible).   
I hit it a little left off the tee and hit it in a bush and took an unplayable.   That was my only bogey of the day, so I'm very happy with where I stand and I'm looking forward to the weekend.
