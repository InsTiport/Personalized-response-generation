Q.   Harris, I know there was a disappointing end, but that round had so much promise?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I was in very much control of my game.   Very good speed on my putts today, that was the key.   These Bermuda greens are rolling nice and soft today.   But you could definitely get after it.

Q.   I spoke with Jimmy Johnson your caddy, and he mentioned early this morning you had long clubs into the greens.   Tell me how the course is playing right now? 
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Extremely soft.   We're playing lift, clean and place today.   Driver is pretty much plugging on the fairways.   This course plays long. 
Last year when it was firm, I could have some shorter irons into the greens with.   Today I was hitting a lot of 4‑irons, 6‑irons, and 3‑irons, so it plays pretty tough.

Q.   Referencing Jimmy, this is the third week with Jimmy on the bag.   Talk to us about what sort of experience he brings to you? 
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Jimmy is very calm out there.   I know whatever shot I can hit, he's probably seen it 20 times.   Whatever experience I'm going to have on the golf course, he's been in every situation.   It's just very calming for me to have him on the bag and to get that experience from him.

Q.   4‑under 60, nice start.   Good luck the rest of the week. 
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Appreciate it.   Thanks.
