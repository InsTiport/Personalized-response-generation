 Q.   You birdied No. 9, your last hole?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Nice.   Was it soft out there?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, a little different from Tuesday and Wednesday.   
The wind wasn't blowing too much this morning; it was definitely out there and I had to take advantage of it.   
   
 Q.   Does lift, clean and place help scoring?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It does a little bit, especially around the greens, if you get a chip or something, you can find an area around where you can find a good lie.   It helps a little bit.   
   
 Q.   No advantage because everybody has it too; right?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Exactly.   
   
 Q.   Well played.   I appreciate it.   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Thanks.
