  Q. How would you describe your playing from then to now?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   I built a great team around me back at Sea Island.  They pushed me, helped me get to where I am right now.  Nobody's ever given up.  It's been awesome.  Definitely some highs and lows, but that's the way golf rolls and it just makes stuff that happened today that much sweeter.
 Q. This is not just a flash in the pan.  You've been playing so consistently well for a long time now.  To finally get that victory and that validation that all this hard work has paid off -- and by the way, you're the first guy back here next year.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I like that.  I like that.
 Q. How impactful is that?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   It's huge.  It's a little bit of a monkey off your back.  I mean, having two-plus years of job security out here is awesome because you're kind of on a one-year contract out here.  Playing against some of the best guys in the world and when you win, you get some more years out here.  So I'm very happy with that.  I'm happy with my team, like I said.  I like where my golf game's going.  It's been an awesome ride so far and it's awesome to get some validation like today.
 Q. What a day.  Took one extra hole to finally get back in the winner's circle, but I think right now the wait was more than worth it.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   It was.  It was.  I was kicking myself after number 16.  I felt like it was a pretty stock 60 degree wedge and I guess I read the wind wrong or was jacked up a little bit.  I really couldn't believe that ball went over the green.  That's about as bad of a bogey as you can make right there on a pretty easy hole.
 Played 18 awesome, kind of, after yesterday, I kind of learned my lesson of you got to aim a little more right than you think, and pulled off a great shot in regulation.  It felt like I hit a good putt, just broke off and really had the same club in.  I was about five yards further in the playoff, and hit a good shot and made a good 2-putt.  I mean, I was pretty nervous over that last putt, but definitely glad to see it go in.
 Q. I want to know when you really kick started this round, in your mind.  You stood on 11 tee, probably saw where things were, you make a big putt there on 11 and then all of a sudden it's like the flood gates open and you got right back in this tournament and seized it.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Like I said, all week it's all about patience and you can reel off four, five birdies out here in a heart beat.  I really like that back nine.  I feel like I can almost birdie every hole out there.  And it just takes one putt to go in like that and then you feel like you can make every putt.  And I felt like all week I was putting really well, leaned on it a lot and made some really good putts yesterday and today.  It kind of kept me in it and it was nice coming down 18 and had a putt for the win and it didn't go in, but I knew I was still in it and had to keep playing.
 Q. A little over seven years since that last win, but what you've done to turn around your game the last 18 months has been awesome.  What does it mean to validate all the work and the play that you've had over the last year and a half to get the win and show that you've been playing at a level that deserves victory?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   It's huge because you're really not a hundred percent sure if you're working on the right thing.  So being able to see the results is what tells you that you're doing the right stuff.  And it took a little while, but, to kind of get rid of that scar tissue a little bit, but I feel like I've been there for a while and I've been really close.  I've had some really good Sunday rounds these past few months and I've really turned in, a Sunday is a day I look forward to and I kind of had that today.  I had a good feeling about today.
 Obviously, Joaquin played unbelievable shooting 9-under today.  This in the windiest conditions we had all week and it was tricky out there, hard to get your distance control down.  But we did great job and hung in there and fought and I've watched people come down this hole for a long time and I'm glad to be able to do it myself.
 Q. Assess the play in regulation on 18 and the playoff, obviously.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I was in a pretty good spot, made a really good birdie on 15.  16, I was kicking myself.  That was a really tough bogey on a good birdie opportunity.
 But coming down to 18, kind of learned a little bit of a lesson from yesterday after I pulled my 4-iron.  I had a little bit longer distance, had a perfect 3-iron distance and just aimed a little bit further right and pulled it off.  Had a good chance at ending it in regulation, but didn't see it break that much.
 I thought, I still have a chance in a playoff.  I think I was 0-1 coming into today in playoffs and just trying to redeem myself.  And I knew birdie was probably not going to lose this hole and kind of stuck to my strategy and had a great 2-putt.
 Q. When you made that putt in the playoff, what emotions did you release all these years?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I mean, I was obviously pretty nervous over that putt, but it means a lot.  Winning is so hard out here and I haven't done it in a long time and I guess I thought it was a little easier said than done.  I won in 2013, but it's been awhile and I love being in this position as I was today and in the last group.  And I felt like I played solid all week, played solid all day today with the pressure and came out and played really well.  I stuck to my strategy.  I executed really well and it was awesome.
