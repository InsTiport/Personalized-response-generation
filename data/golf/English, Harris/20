  Q. Tell us about your day.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   It started on the back nine, it was pretty tough out there.  The wind was gusting pretty good, swirl a little bit and obviously I felt like that's the hardest stretch of golf on this course is really 11 through 14, so I got through those pretty well and knew I could get some of the short holes, 15, 16, 17, 18, and played well today.  I feel like this is probably my best putting week I've had in the last couple months, really worked hard and was seeing the lines really well today.
 Q. A couple guys went a little bit crazy out there, shooting a 60 and a 59.  Do you see that whatsoever on this golf course?  I find it hard to.
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, especially with the wind going today.  I mean, Dustin was what, 9-under through nine holes or something.  We were watching on the leaderboard.  I don't care what golf course you're playing, that's impressive.
 I could see a little bit on the front with some holes, par 5s you could eagle.  No. 4, I guess eagle as well.  You could definitely get it going on the front nine, but that back nine, like I said, 11 through 14 is all you want, and that's some impressive stuff from Scottie and Dustin.
 Q. Looking forward to the weekend, you've played a lot of solid golf this year.  Do you feel like you have to step it up and get that victory or keep plugging away doing what you're doing and hopefully that will get it done?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   I'll just keep plugging away doing what I'm doing.  I can't really control what anybody else does.  Just stick to what I'm doing.  Obviously playing some good golf and feel like I'm in good shape right now, and just keep putting myself in position.  I think it will happen.  That's what I did back in 2013, and I think more and more that I'm in that position, the better chance you are of pulling off a victory.
