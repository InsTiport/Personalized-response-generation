 Q.   Obviously it wasn't the way you wanted to finish.   Explain down the stretch from your perspective.   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, it was nice.   Just started hitting it better but started putting a little worse.   Starting out the day I was hitting it all over the map and making some good saves.   My short game kept me in it this week.   
But I misread a couple putts, also made some pretty poor putts, but that's how it goes.   I mean, I love being in this spot and I love being in contention and getting the juices flowing a little bit.   I definitely learned a lot from this week.  
   
 Q.   You showed a lot of calmness at Mayakoba and here didn't finish the same way.   Can you take away lessons from when you lose, as well?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Oh, for sure.   I mean, I really hung in there well this week.   I didn't have my best stuff, but my short game really kept me in it.   I take a lot from that, and all the hard work I've put in this winter on short game.   It's good to finish not 5 and not have my best golf this week.
