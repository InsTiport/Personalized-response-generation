  Q. Your opening round, a mediocre even par round of 70, today.  You were back to the Harris English that we saw last week with that 64.  What changed?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I'll be honest, Thursday, I had a couple mental lapses out there and had not really this h that in a while.  Kind of zoned out and made some really soft bogeys, and some pretty easy short game shots that I just didn't execute.   Got some good rest last night.  Felt good about today.  I knew I had to come out and shoot 4- or 5-under to make the cut.  The wind was down from yesterday.  Played well.  Executed well today and kind of got back into my form that I left Kapalua.
 Q. Last week you led wire-to-wire and you slept on the lead each and every night.  Now you're chasing the lead, four back currently.  Is that a different attitude compared to last week?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   A little bit, yes.  I feel like I can come out here tomorrow and play aggressive and try to chase them down.  I know with the wind laying down, I think the forecast is this weekend, come out and go get it.  I played well here a lot of previous years at Waialae and I kind of know what it takes to compete out here.  I played in the last group before out here before.  I'm ready for it and feel like I'm rested.  I'm confident in my game, so hopefully I can get a low one tomorrow and see where we go.
 Q. How would you describe your round today?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   It was good.  I was a little more mentally locked in today.  I could tell, a little tired yesterday.  I kind of zoned out, which I've been really good about the past couple months and just kind of let it slip a little bit.   Made some really, really soft bogeys yesterday, and slept good last night.  Came ready to play today.  I knew I probably had to shoot 4- or 5-under to make the cut.  Played really well.  Any time you play well without any bogeys, you've played some good golf.  Drove it well and hit it in the fairway a lot and gave myself a lot of chances.  I had a couple more chances coming down the stretch but didn't convert but happy where I'm standing, only four back as of now from the lead, and anything can happen on the weekend.
 Q. You were right around the cut line when you made the turn.  What was your mentality on the back nine?  Did you have a goal set coming in and is that how the tournament is, you can be on the cut line, midway through your round on Friday and end up being in contention?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I've done that here before a few times.  Played this tournament a lot.  Had a lot of success here and I feel like it suits my game a lot.  Coming down that back nine, I shot 4-under on the front and just have to keep playing aggressive.  I feel like I was hitting the ball well, hitting my irons well, and was able to take dead aim at some flags.  Played really well and made some good eight-, ten-footers for birdie and feel pretty good about the weekend.
 Q. What will your focus going into the weekend be?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Keep it rolling.  I feel like I'm playing well.  Managing the ball well.  Kind of got it back today.  Got back my game and I think the wind is going to be down for the weekend and scores are going to be low.  You've got to stay aggressive, play the par 5s well here and keep making birdies.
 Q. Your thoughts on the WGC moving from moving Mexico to Concession in Florida?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   I was excited about going to Mexico City.  Never been there before.  Watched the golf course there a lot and I was looking forward so I'm kind of bummed it's not there but I've heard good things about Concession.  It will all kind of tie into the Florida Swing.
 I'm looking forward to trying a new track.  I've heard it's pretty hard and I feel like it's going to be a good test for us.
