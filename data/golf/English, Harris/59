Q.   Harris, it seemed to be a stress-free, 3‑under, 68, would you agree with that?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I don't know if I'd call it stress free.   With this wind pumping this afternoon and swirling around a little bit it's tough.   I felt like I hit the ball really solid today and that's the key.   I was just concentrating on the ball flight and trying to flight my shots really well and flight my iron shots, and did a pretty good job of it.   And I'm very happy with 3‑under.

Q.   And the short game was good.   The chip‑in at 6.   No. 8 I thought was a great up and down. 
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, when you miss the green, you get in some dicey spots out here.   And it really helps, especially with the chip‑in on 6.   And even the bunker sand save on 8, that's not an easy shot.   But it keeps the round going and keeps that momentum.

Q.   I counted two drivers today.   Did you hit any more than two?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Probably no more than two.   That's what I love about this place.   It kind of brings everybody back.   And I can't really gain an advantage by hitting a driver out here.   You're playing the spots.   And trying to hit as many fairways as you can.   And trying to hit the center of the greens, because the greens are small.   You can see by the scores, 5‑under leading.   It's a tough track, and especially getting some wind like this.   It makes it even tougher.
