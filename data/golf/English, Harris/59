 Q.   Pretty good start?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yes, sir.   I've been working hard the past couple weeks and it finally came together today.   I've been working hard on my short game and getting my wedge distances under control.   Just being more reactive out there.   I feel like I've been grinding too hard on mechanics and not really playing golf.   Today I just played golf and it worked out.  
   
 Q.   What is your history on this course?   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I played here, this is my third year here and third year on TOUR.   I had a good finish here my first year.   I think I finished like fifth or sixth, so I really like the golf course.   I like the area a lot, and I'm excited about the next couple days.
