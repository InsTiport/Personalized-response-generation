 Q.  Always nice to finish with a birdie out there, especially on the Thursday of a major?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Definitely feel good about the birdie on the last hole.  Had a lot of good looks coming in on 6, 7, 8, 9 and got one to go.  Very happy with my round, had a lot of control over my ball today.  Played solid.   
 Q.  What did you know at Baltusrol before you came here?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: I mean, I remember watching it back in '05, when Phil won.  I was in high school then.  I had heard how great of a golf course it was.  I'm a big Tillinghast fan.  I love all his golf courses and I heard it was a good solid test.  There was nothing tricked up about it just a really solid golf course.   
 Q.  Does it favor any type of game?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: I mean, you've got to hit the fairway out here.  I was hitting the driver really well.  It definitely feels like it favors the long player.  I'm sure you can see a Zach Johnson or one of the shorter hitters in the game that can play well.  It's a solid golf course.  You have got to do everything well around here.   
 Q.  When you look at the trend this year with the majors, I think Harris English fits right into the other three?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, that would be nice.  I'm pretty happy with the way I started.  Hopefully can keep it going.  If I can get in the mix on the weekend, that would be a lot of fun.  See where it goes.
