 Q.   4‑under par, nice start.   
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, it was a good way to get off to a good start for this tournament.   Hit the ball really well.   It's tough out there, just really hard to hit the fairways out here, and when you're out of this Bermuda rough hitting 9‑irons and 8‑irons into these small greens, it's tough.  
   
 Q.   Much different golf course than last week, but did it help to play last week?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, for sure, to get on this time zone and get over here early and kind of get the rust off, that was what last week was for, even though this golf course is totally different.   It's flat out here.   Last week was probably the most hilly golf course I've ever been to.   But I love these Bermuda greens and I love this tournament, and I'll always come back here.  
   
 Q.   You start the year off now as a two‑time winner on the PGA TOUR.   As you look back, surprised or just really still soaking it in?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, still soaking it in.   This is my third year on TOUR.   A goal of mine last year was to get a win, and I somehow got two, and it kind of gives me a lot of confidence coming into these tournaments that I've already played these golf courses.   This is my third time playing this tournament.   I guess it's kind of like a veteran feel out here.   I know where to stay, I know how to play these golf holes, and it's a good feeling.  
   
 Q.   What can the players expect out there this afternoon?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Definitely the course is going to dry out more and more as the day goes on.   The greens get pretty crusty out there, pretty fast.   It's just a really fun, tough golf course.   You think‑‑ I don't know how long it is, but it's pretty short, you think you can tear it up, but you don't see too many guys taking it deep.
