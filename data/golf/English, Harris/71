 Q.   The first round you hit it really well, the second round you putted really well.   How would you describe this third round?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It was up and down today.   Hit a couple good shots in a row and then I'd turn around and hit a bad one way off line.   It was just kind of grind it til you find it.   This course is tough.   It's hard to hit the fairways, and you've just got to be a wizard around the greens, and that's kind of how I approached today.   I didn't have my best golf, but I scraped it around at 3‑under par and still in this golf tournament.  
   
 Q.   You made some equipment changes recently.   You put Callaway wedges in and you also switched to the Odyssey 2‑ball putter?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, I've actually played the wedges, I think this is my fifth or sixth tournament with them, so I really like them.   Roger Cleveland has been helping me out a lot with those wedges and getting them tuned in.   I went to the Odyssey 2‑ball putter this week, and it's worked out nice.  
   
 Q.   You get to go play with Chris Kirk, one of your best friends out here?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, we've eaten dinner a lot this week and last week back in Maui.   We're really good friends, and I'm looking forward to playing with him.  
   
 Q.   You guys were actually paired together in Maui?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   We were.   We played the first day together.   Kirk shot 7‑under, so he got me a little bit, so maybe I can get some revenge on him tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel comfortable in this position as a two‑time winner on the PGA TOUR?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I do.   This is probably my fourth, fifth, sixth time in this position, just knowing how your body reacts to pressure and how to slow down your walk and slow down your breathing a little bit, so I'm getting better and better at that.
