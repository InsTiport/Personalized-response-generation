Q. Nice back nine.  Closing with a birdie.  You get yourself up there on the leaderboard.  Consider yourself in contention.  How do you feel about that?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, felt good.  I mean, it was kind of tough there towards the end.  It got pretty dark and really cold and kind of tough to judge how far the ball is going.  So it's nice to get a birdie the last.
But scrambled pretty well all day.  Putted really nice.  My speed was great, made some long putts.  That really helps out the round, and overall it was nice.  Feel like I'm in pretty good position, keep doing what I'm doing and see what happens on the weekend.
Q. Talk about the darkness and the little bit of dampness coming on, and you get to that ninth hole.  Describe what happened and how you managed to get that birdie.
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, the boxes started skidding a little bit on the greens when they had a little moisture on them, and got up pretty good break on 9, hit it right down the middle of the fairway, had a really downhill lie for my second shot.  And pulled an 8-iron a little bit and kicked off the bank and went up there to about three feet short of the hole.  So I was happy to see that after bogeying 8.  Feel like I hit a really good shot on the 8 and came up well short of the green there.
But it's nice to close with birdie.  Get back late tonight, but eat some dinner and get some good rest and come out here tomorrow afternoon.
Q. Strategy tomorrow, anything tomorrow you have to do?
HARRIS ENGLISH: It's just kind of the same.  I expect the greens to be a little firmer tomorrow.  And the weekend of the U.S. Open, you expect to be tough, I mean, tough pins, and I feel like you play par golf out here and leave yourself 15- or 20-footers, and I feel like my putter has been really good this week, and just keep doing that.
