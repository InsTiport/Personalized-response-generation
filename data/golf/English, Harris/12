Q. I just wanted to ask what DJ is doing right now, it looks like he's kind of walking away from the field.  You were in a similar position at the Northern Trust a few weeks ago.  When he starts going on one of these rolls what's that like from a player perspective?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, it's really impressive.  There's really nothing you can do about it.  I saw he hit maybe two fairways yesterday and still shot what he did.
I mean, if he hits the ball like everybody knows he can and the way he's putting -- I haven't seen him putt that well in a long time.  The work him and Austin have been doing on the greens is incredible, and he's on a run right now.  It's hard to stop.
Those guys trying to chase him down, they're probably going to have to shoot 6-, 7-under tomorrow to have a chance, because he's not just trying to win, he's trying to beat everybody by 10 shots.
What he did at Northern Trust, it's impressive the run he's on right now.
Q. Is it a little bit disappointing when you look at the leaderboard and you're playing as well as you are?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It just means I've got to get better.  I like seeing guys playing really well like that, and obviously he's worked really hard.  Just kind of tells me that I've got to work on my game and get a little bit better to have a chance to be up there with him.
Q. What does it mean to you to get to East Lake after starting the season with kind of limited status?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, it's awesome.  I mean, a huge of goal of mine obviously starting the year.  I didn't really know how many tournaments I was going to get into.  To finish the year off at this place is awesome.
Really happy with the year I've had, the way I've come back from having my back against the wall.  I feel like I can use this to jump start these next couple years and be in a lot more of these tournaments, a lot more majors, and hopefully have a chance to do what Dustin is doing right now and have a chance to win this thing in the next couple years.
Q. I don't know if you do a list of priorities or goals you want to accomplish, but would this have been on your list starting out the season?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   This is always at the top of my list because when you're playing good golf, you're always going to be in the TOUR Championship.  It gets you in everything you want.  For golf, for PGA TOUR golf, this gets you in everything you want, all the majors, the World Golf Championships, all the big events, and that's what I want to be in.
That's why I practice and play, to have a chance at playing with the best players in the world.
Q. Along those lines, I don't think you're in the Masters in November, correct?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Not in November.
Q. I know they've talked about Daniel not being able to get in.  Is it weird at all?  Will it be weird at all sitting at home watching knowing that under any other circumstances you would have qualified?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It will be weird.  I feel bad for Berger because I don't know what he is in the world right now, 13th or -- he's playing some really good golf.  It is what it is.
I mean, they have their rules, and if you play good golf you're going to get in all the tournaments and have a chance at winning all of them.  I think he'll be fine.  I'll be fine watching at home.  It's going to be awesome to watch the Masters in November, and we'll use it for fuel in April.
