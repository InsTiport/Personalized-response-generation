Q. I know you shot 2-over today but given the conditions are you pleased with that round?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I wasn't too pleased walking off No. 2 with a double. That was the wrong club, hitting it over the green. But I mean, looking at the leaderboard on like 13 and 14 I was like, nobody's really running away with this thing, because it's so hard to not make bogeys out there, because you're going to miss shots, you're going to misjudge the wind. And that's what we were struggling with was, in off the left, how much is it hurting, is it just off the left. And, I mean, you miss by 10 yards out here and you're toast. The greens were getting super dried out towards the end. And then 17 and 18's all you want. I mean, you got to beat up some of the easier holes, like 16, you got to make birdie there and just hold on from then. But I like where I'm at, I think I'll be a couple shots back, so I think it's going to play tough again tomorrow and just got to grind it out.
Q. What was the toughest shot you faced today?
HARRIS ENGLISH: I left myself too far in on 11. I thought the wind was going to be off the left off the tee, I hit 4-iron like I've been hitting all week, and had like 205 flag. I mean, that's one of the toughest greens out here and that was probably the best shot of the day, hit 4-iron and just went over the green in the bunker and then you're downwind and you're not going to get it that close. But it was just tough out there, it was -- you got to be on point and you got to relay on your short game. I don't know how many greens I hit today, but pretty happy with only shooting 2-over. I think my caddie was getting tired of raking bunkers out there. I hit it in like nine bunkers. But off the tee though that's better than the rough, the rough is nasty.
Q. Have you ever seen it play this tough ever before?
HARRIS ENGLISH: I haven't. I've never seen it this windy three consecutive days. Never seen the rough this high before. And, but that north breeze is really hard. I enjoy it, I love hard golf courses, I like it playing like this, I feel like it can keep me in it.
