  Q. Solid day, irons great and putting was solid, as well?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah, irons have been awesome all week this week.  I feel like it's a great mid-iron golf course and I've been hitting it really well.  Had my putting going today, as well.  So kind of everything was clicking.  Kind of a tricky day today with the wind swirling around right before the rain delay, and after the rain delay, the wind was kind of all over the place.  Felt like I managed it pretty well and short game was good.  Tough finish, not the finish I was looking for but felt like I got a lot of momentum going into tomorrow.
 Q. You and Louis almost started feeding off one another after the delay.  The chip-in on 14, walk us through the chip-in?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   That was a brutal lie, dead into the grain, thick lie.  I'm just playing it like a bunker shot.  Took a couple practice swings on a similar lie kind of close to the ball.  Just really opened up the blade, playing like a bunker shot and hope for the best.
 Q. Some thoughts on tomorrow?  You're in a good spot, playing well.  What has to get better tomorrow to walk away with a trophy?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   Just keep doing what I'm doing.  Putting myself in the hunt again.  I know there are probably going to be a lot more birdies to be had tomorrow but keep doing what I'm doing.   Hitting the irons well.  Make something good putts and see where I stand after 18 tomorrow.
