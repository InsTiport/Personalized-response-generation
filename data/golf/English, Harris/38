 Q.  After coming so close the last few years, your goal was to make it this year, particularly the way you did at the BMW.  Talk about that.  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Just to get in the TOUR Championship means -- it's not just another tournament, on account of, I hope it's on the schedule for the next year and getting in China in a couple week, getting into Doral, getting into the four Majors, so I'm very excited about how it kind of plans my schedule for next year.   
 Q.  I guess Augusta has got to be pretty special to get back to after missing last year.  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, it's huge.  That's kind of the tournament you always circle.  And getting there two years ago was pretty special, but I've been itching to get back and feel like I can take a little more experience into that week.   
 Q.  From Valdosta to Athens, how does it feel to be out here in Atlanta?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: It's awesome.  A lot of Georgia fans out here, a lot of friend and family coming out to support, which makes me feel good.  It's a good spot.  I played a couple times as a junior here, played a couple times in college, so I'm very familiar with the area.   
 Q.  You obviously have a belief in yourself.  You have to to be on the PGA TOUR.  But getting here to the TOUR Championship, persevering through the last couple of years and the last few weeks of this golfing season to get here, what has that meant to your confidence?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: It's big.  Every week I feel like you have to almost prove yourself out here.  Making that 20-footer on the last hole last week kind of instills that belief, that confidence.   
And it's stuff like that, it's shots that you hit all year that you can put in the memory bank and use for when you need it.  I feel like with that putt and the way I played coming down the stretch, now I can do that.
