 Q.   Some comments on your round.  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I felt I played really well.   One tee shot on 6 kind of pulled it a little bit, went in the water and that was my only -- make double on the hole.  
   
 Q.   Did you have to reload?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Reloaded, yeah.   It was one of those shots I know I'm playing well, just pulled it a little bit, went in the water.   What can you do?   Didn't really let it affect me.   I just was 1-over.   Coming into the back-9 the wind was laying down a little bit.   You can get to the par-5s on the back-9.   Had some birdie chances there.   I played well.   Made five birdies, an eagle and two birdies on the back-9.   Eagled No. 12.   Got a little downwind on that hole.   It was good.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit for your second shot?  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   5-iron.   Smashed it, too.  
   
 Q.   Kind of a big hitter, Harris.  
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Hit the driver pretty good today.   It was a good round.   Definitely some low scores out there.   The greens are softer, the wind is not really humming like it usually is out here and the greens are not as firm and fast as they usually are.   You'll see some low scores.   I saw some on the leaderboard coming up 18.   I'm very happy with how I started.
