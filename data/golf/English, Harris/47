Q.   Low round of the week, at least matching it.   Bogey-free, 30 on the back-9.   That's pretty good playing.   You're smiling.   That's got to make you feel better.
HARRIS ENGLISH:   That felt good.   The course is a little more getable today.   Yesterday the wind was swirling, struggling to get the ball pin high either over the green or short of the green. 
Today it kind of clicked.   Obviously had some putts going in and got to have some lucky stuff and pulled my ball on 18 and hit the tree and came out in the fairway.   I know I need to do something with it. 
Yeah, this is a round I can take into next week and have a lot of momentum going.

Q.   I was going to ask you because this is a tough tract, you go around bogey-free, 65.   Even with a few breaks, a birdie at 17.   That's really some good playing.
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Yeah.   I really felt good about my game all week.   Yesterday I was pretty disappointed.   Hit a couple bad shots coming down the stretch.   Stuff got in my way.   Made birdie on the last two to shoot 3-over.   Momentum today.   This golf course is tough.   You got to do everything well. 

Q.   How do you think the leaders now as they go out they'll see your score, is it that getable today or do you think these conditions will stiffen up?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I hope they stiffen up but with the wind is actually a little bit different today.   Felt like it was an easier wind.   You get some par-5s downwind, you get 15 downwind, 16 is more down off the right.   So makes it a little easier coming down the Snake Pit.   We'll see.   You never know.   The wind could get swirling around here pretty good.

Q.   See you at Bay Hill.
HARRIS ENGLISH:   Thank you.
