  Q. Harris, another solid round of golf, clean card, 5-under par, you're in great position.  What's worked so well for you these first two rounds?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   I thought I scrambled well today.  I didn't necessarily have my A Game ball-striking-wise.  The wind was pumping pretty good on our front nine, which is the back nine, which is the teeth of this golf course and felt like I got through it on 14 and kind of kept me going with birdie chances, hit No. 18 in two and two-putted.  Just kept it rolling.  I felt like I made a lot of really good putts yesterday and a lot of good six- and seven-footers today, which were good par saves and good birdie putts.  I'm really happy with where I'm at.
 Q. Hitting driver on some holes, 14, in particular -- seeing the fairway -- how much does it matter off the tee in this golf course?
 HARRIS ENGLISH:   They have some be mounds that block your view to the fairway on some of these tee balls.  14 they moved the tee up a little bit because it was pretty hard into the wind on the tee, so it's just getting your lines off the tee and trusting them, because like you said, you can't really see from in the fairway mand you have to trust the prep work you did in the rounds of actually hitting it.  I felt like I did a good job.  My caddie and I were on the same page, had some good numbers a lot of the time and having a clean card in a Playoff event is always nice.
