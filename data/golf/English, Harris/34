 Q.  Kind of crazy, right?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, a lot of stopping and starting out there.   
I mean, coming off Memphis last week, we had a pretty big rain delay in the last round, so you kind of get used to it.  Nothing you can do about it this time of year.  I felt like I had a good day, kept the ball in front of me, and played nice.  A lot of pars out there on the course.   
Course is still playing tough.  You've still got to hit fairways and greens to have a chance at birdie.  So, yeah, the rain made it a little softer and made it a little easier, but it's a real tough golf course.   
 Q.  Did you try to step on the pedal a little bit when it was a little softer out there?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, playing those practice rounds, it was hard to keep the ball on the green sometimes.  When it softened up, you could take more dead aim at the flag and spin a couple balls back that you hadn't seen in three days or so.   
So it's definitely easier, but like I said, you hit the ball in the rough, you're not making a lot of pars.   
 Q.  How many did you finish?  
HARRIS ENGLISH: I think I got in 13.  I think I'm on 4 green right now.
