Q.   You go out in 30 and then birdie the last three holes, 62.   What was going on out there?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I was just playing really aggressive, started out pretty hot, hit my irons really well, so just kept playing aggressive. 
And that's what you got to do out here.   Put it in the fairway and then try to go out and get after it.   And that's what I was doing.   I was getting my putter hot and it was a lot of fun. 

Q.   Tell us about your history.   You're a rookie on the PGA TOUR, you're a Georgia Bulldog, born and raised in Georgia, a little bit of your history. 
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I grew up in Georgia, my parents now live in Thomasville, Georgia, way southwest.   Graduated in four years this past spring.   Had an awesome time. 
I played couple Nationwide Tour events this summer and had a good time and here I am, went through Qâ€‘School out here at PGA West, so I have a lot of good vibes out here, and it's just a fun week.   I'm so glad to be out here.

Q.   You played last week in Hawaii, so what's the experience been like now this some two weeks?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   It's good.   I had a lot of nerves in Hawaii, I didn't know what to expect going into the tournament.   And kind of coming into here I knew what to expect and knew how to prepare better and I was familiar with these golf courses, that helped a lot.   So I'm just having a good time, just kind of I'm loving it. 

Q.   What's the best part of the your game right now?
HARRIS ENGLISH:   I drove the ball really well today.   Out here the fairways are pretty generous, but I hit the ball really well off the tee and it really set me up coming into the greens.   I had a lot of wedges into the greens, so I could be real aggressive.
