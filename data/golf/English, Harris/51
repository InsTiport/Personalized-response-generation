 Q.  I hate to put the hex on you, but bogey-free around this place is pretty special.  HARRIS ENGLISH: It really is.  It's the first time I've been around Torrey Pines bogey free.  The South Course was really tough yesterday.  I played it later in the day and had some fog roll in on the last couple holes.  So I ended up playing well and had it going on the North Course today.  I made some good solid 4- to 6-footers to keep the round going.  That's huge.   Q.  What would be more satisfying today, playing the North or finishing off with a 68, which is a pretty good score on the South?  HARRIS ENGLISH: Definitely the South.  That's such a great golf course.  It really doesn't give you any room for error.  I came out this morning and I made some good saves for par and that kind of kept the momentum going to the North Course today. I made some good birdies on the back nine and I'm very pleased with where I'm sitting.   Q.  I know this has been an important week because of what Farmers is doing with the recognizing the best teachers.  Mr. Harris must be pretty happy with the way you're playing, right?  HARRIS ENGLISH: He is.  Exactly.  I mean I've had some really good teachers.  Mr. Harris was at my favorite school in Chattanooga.  I had some great teachers as well when I grew up.  So it's a cool week to represent them and play for them and for all teachers across America, it's really cool.   Q.  Keep going.  See you tomorrow.  HARRIS ENGLISH: Appreciate it.  Thanks.   Q.  It looked fun from our perspective what was it like from your perspective?  HARRIS ENGLISH: A lot of fun.  Beautiful day out here at Torrey Pines.  I got it rolling today.  It's hard to make a lot of birdies on the South Course.  North you can tear up a little more, have a lot more wedges in.  I hit some shots close and made some good putts.   Q.  How would you describe the differences between the North Course and the South course?  HARRIS ENGLISH: The South Course is just a beast.  It doesn't give you any room for error.  The greens are a little firmer, a little faster.  It's so easy to hit that errant shot and make a bogey or get in the rough and now you can't get it to the green. Yesterday I made some really good par saves.  I chipped in for par on my second hole, I made some really good 6- and 8-footers for par.  And that's what you got to do.  You're not going to hit it perfect.  But playing the South Course with no bogeys is really hard.   Q.  Considering how long the South Course is, the longest on the PGA TOUR, how much was your length an advantage there?  HARRIS ENGLISH: I really hit the driver well.  It started last week at Phoenix, where I really started slotting it and hitting it very well.  It really helps to hit it long and straight out here.  If I hit a lot of fairways and give myself a lot of chances, I feel like that that helps my game.  When I'm in the fairway, it gives me a great chance to make birdies.   Q.  Tell us how you're feeling.  HARRIS ENGLISH: It was awesome.  Obviously Torrey Pines is in great shape right now.  Got beautiful weather, it's tough.  The rough is tough out there, especially on the South Course.  The North you can beat up a little bit more, but it's very tricky. I'm very pleased with 10-under after two days, basically bogey-free.  I made some good, 6-, 8-, 10-footers for par and that really kept the round going and that's what you got to do on these courses.   Q.  What is setting up so well for you right now?  HARRIS ENGLISH: I finally got my driver going.  That's kind of been a struggle the latter half of last year and now I put a new driver in at Sony from Callaway and it's been awesome.  It started in Phoenix last week I started hitting the driver well and it carried over this week.  It helps me to hit it long and straight out here to give your self a lot of chances to make birdie because it's tough playing out of the rough.
