Q. Another steady round.  Three birdies.  You finished three and a half holes short.  How do you assess your day?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I played good.  This golf course, you have to control your misses and I feel like I did that pretty well.  Kept the ball pretty much in play.  Kept my putter hot which is key in Major Championships.  Getting up-and-down when I do miss the green and making some good eight and ten foot putts.
Q. Not a lot of wind, was it a pretty good scoring day from your perspective?
HARRIS ENGLISH: It was.  The greens got pretty firm those last probably five or six holes, and it got really, really dark out there.  It was pretty eery.  It was kind of hard to see out there for the last couple holes.  But the greens were firming up, but I do think we got a little better draw.  It looked like yesterday afternoon it got pretty windy, but that's how it goes.
Q. Does it throw a wrench in the plans, change your preparation?  You've got to finish out this round and then roll right into round 3?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, it's golf.  During the summer months, we have a lot of rain delays, so you kind of get used to it.  Just come out tomorrow and prepare for finishing the next three and then get ready for the third round.
Q. A couple Georgia Bulldogs out there.  Russell Henley with a good day.  A little competition there?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, it's awesome to see Russell's name up there on the leaderboard.  Always nice to see a fellow Georgia Bulldog doing well.  I don't think it's an extra competition, but it would be fun to play with him coming down the stretch.
