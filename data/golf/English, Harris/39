Q. Just comment on your round out there today for you.
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, felt good.  Had a couple bogeys early on.  I thought it played a little tougher, had some back pins that if you weren't spot on it was tough to get it close.  Brought it back nicely, and I'm happy with 3-under.  I wanted to make a couple coming in, but overall, I feel like I'm in good shape.
Q. It was kind of a rocky start for you; what turned it around?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, started on No. 10 and hit two really good shots and it landed up top and came all the way back down, turned a 15-footer into a 65-footer, and three-putted that one.  Stuff that that happens.  This course is not that easy.  Even though the conditions are soft and the wind is down, you've still got to hit really good shots.  It's hard to get close to the pin.  I hit a streak where I made some birdies, and that was it.
Q. You've kind of made this into a yearly tradition, being right around the bubble heading into the TOUR Championship.  What were your thoughts heading into this week trying to break through and get there?
HARRIS ENGLISH: Yeah, I've been doing it the past few years.  I mean, it's not really any more pressure.  If I play good, I play good and get in next week.  Obviously that's been my goal the whole year.  If I don't, I'll get some time at home.  It kind of is what it is.  I can't put more pressure on the next two rounds than any other golf tournament.  I've got to go out and do what I do and stick to my game plan, and hopefully it'll work out.
