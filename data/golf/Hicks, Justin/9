Q.   (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN HICKS:   You come out here from Hawaii, the opening week there, you kind of come out here and the ball just sits up a lot and the wind doesn't blow a whole lot and we're not getting as much run in the fairway.
But I've been doing some really good stuff starting this 2014 season from tee to green anyways and starting to get the putter going back there in Mexico, I made the switch with my putter and am keeping it going, just trying to give myself as many opportunities as I can. 

Q.   When you talk about your ball striking, your Top‑10 in greens in regulation and in fairways, has there been something that you have found that has kind of been the magic touch so far this season?
JUSTIN HICKS:   Well, I led greens in regulation on the Nationwide Tour to get my card back two years ago, so I'm not afraid to hit greens when I play golf. 
It's something that I really enjoy doing.   I like to shape the ball both ways and to me it's like I just kind of go out each day and see how many opportunities I can give myself.   And hopefully, I usually do a pretty good job of hitting it pretty straight and hitting a fair amount of greens and hopefully making a few putts.

Q.   A round like today, you're switching courses tomorrow, how does this sort of setup how this week kind of flows for you?
JUSTIN HICKS:   It kind of takes me back years ago when I played some mini‑tour events and they used multiple golf courses, quite honestly.   And I also did on the Web.com TOUR and a couple of charity pro‑ams, which I've had some success on as well.   So I think that it's kind of fun in a way.   Because you're seeing different places, but you don't have a choice but really to kind of try to like it and have fun with it and go see what we can do tomorrow.
