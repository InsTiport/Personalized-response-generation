Q.   That was quite a day.   There were a lot of low scores today, yours obviously one of the better ones.   What was working out there today?
JUSTIN HICKS:   Well, I think in general this year, I've done a really good job of getting the ball in the fairway and then hitting a lot of greens.   You know, there's something about this course that kind of sets up to my eye a little bit, and this week I kind of continued with my plan of how I've kind of played throughout the year and done a good job of putting the ball in the fairway and hitting the ball on the green and near the hole.   I gave myself a lot of great looks this week and found a putter last week on my week off that felt really good in my hands and I was lining it up great.   It was a lot of fun.   I enjoyed it from start to finish. 

Q.   You're in a funny situation now, three strokes off, I guess, but there's still that big chance of a playoff or whatever. 
JUSTIN HICKS:   Yeah, I'm not even really thinking about that too much.   Last I saw, Jim had a really big lead to start the day, and I think Tim Clark now has made a charge.   You know, whatever happens with those guys happens with those guys, but yeah, we played a great week, and I'm just really excited about it. 

Q.   You won the Wayne Gretzky Classic a few years ago in Canada.   Does playing in Canada suit you?
JUSTIN HICKS:   I grew up in the Detroit area and I've always had a good time playing in Canada.   Everyone is pretty friendly here.   It reminds me a little bit of home maybe, and Montreal is a great city, and I've really enjoyed visiting this week.   The food has been wonderful all week.   So yeah, I'd love to come back.
