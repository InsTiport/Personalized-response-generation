Q.   How about Harris today?
JUSTIN HICKS:   He's obviously playing some really good golf.   For the most part, we're all kind of together out there.   Guys are playing well and then he's running away a little bit.   He still has two rounds left and anything can happen out there. 
The way the course is playing, he can make a bogey in a heartbeat.   Certainly have some chances to make birdies, but you got to hit a lot of good shots and it's a little tricky out there.

Q.   36 holes in, how do you -- is it just keeping doing what you're doing, you can't take too many chances out there?
JUSTIN HICKS:   We keep doing what we're doing.   We have to get our opportunities and hopefully we'll be able to do it.   Hit some fairways.   It's harder to get them without hitting fairways. 
It's really what it's all about, give yourself some chances.   The greens are tough to get close on.   Like I said, the wind is a little tricky out there, hit the fairways and give ourselves some opportunities and see what happens.

Q.   Looking at this week, if you did grab a round, are you surprised Harris was able to get a 64, kind of a little bit of distance?   Is that surprising as tough as the course has been playing?
JUSTIN HICKS:   Not really, because he made a few birdies today and yesterday.   I can see how you get a run going out here.   I can see how you can be 5, 6-under.
