 Q. How did it go out there?
 MIKE ZINNI: It was a struggle. I started 3-putting and it just seemed like I was 3-putting every hole. So it was tough. 

 Q. Did the greens were tough or just the wind or what happened?
 MIKE ZINNI: Well, a little bit of everything. But it was mostly me. I started off being too tentative and then I started to be a little aggressive and then it just was like a little 3-putt here, a 3-putt, a 3-putt, you know, couldn't get going there. I missed the little ones then after that.

 Q. Do you take anything positive away from today and what do you have to go do tomorrow?
 MIKE ZINNI: I got to shoot in the 60s to have a chance. And the golf course is tough, so we'll see about it. But you never know. You never know what's going to happen.
