 LAURA NEAL:   Thanks for coming in.  Can we go over your score card, your birdies and bogeys for today.
JEONG JANG:  Birdie on 12.  80 yards and L-wedge.
13, 6-iron and 6 feet.
And No. 14, 125 yards, 8-iron.  20 feet.
Bogey on 2.  6-iron and 145 yards and over the green and chip it in, but I didn't make it. 
LAURA NEAL:   How far was the putt? 
JEONG JANG:  6 feet. 
LAURA NEAL:   Bogey on 6. 
JEONG JANG:  I had 106 yards, 6-iron over the green, and 3 feet, missed the putt. 
LAURA NEAL:   Birdie on 9. 
JEONG JANG:  195 yards, just in front of the green, and chip it. 

Q.   How firm were the greens?
JEONG JANG:  It looks like asphalt, blacktop, very firm, so every shot is over the pin.

Q.   Would you talk about the golf course?  This was round 1, and the conditions from Monday to today, has the course changed because of the hot sun we've been getting?
JEONG JANG:  The course is in great shape, and the course play out is also great.  But every day is just a little bit different.  Yesterday and today is pretty dry.  I like this course.  It's very difficult.  It's a thinking course.

Q.   Are there any easy holes out there today?
JEONG JANG:  No, no.

Q.   You're saying you like that?  A lot of players say they would like a milder, gentler golf course.
JEONG JANG:  Every hole has to be thinking.

Q.   What about pin placements today?  I guess the pin placements for a Thursday are relatively okay.
JEONG JANG:  It was great.

Q.   Better than the Pro-Am day?
JEONG JANG:  Right.  Much better than yesterday.

Q.   Harder yesterday?
JEONG JANG:  Oh, yes, it was harder.

Q.   Really?  How do you feel about your season this year?  How you've been playing?
JEONG JANG:  This is totally different than last year.  I have a new teacher, so it's better than last year, much, much better than last year.

Q.   Do you feel like when you're playing you can keep it up the rest of the week?
JEONG JANG:  Yes.

Q.   What's the best part of your game that is working?
JEONG JANG:  I have new confidence.  That's good for me. 
LAURA NEAL:   Thank you.
