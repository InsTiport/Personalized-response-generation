   PAM WARNER:  J.J., thanks for joining us today.  Great playing out there.  The front 9 was a little bit tough, but you came back.  On the back 9 you had three birdies in the last four holes.  Talk about how you played today.   
 JEONG JANG:  You know, tough out there.  More wind than yesterday.  You know, I do my best and come back the last four holes.  I think I kind of proud of myself.   
 PAM WARNER:  Can we go over your scorecard, the playoff hole first?   
 JEONG JANG:  Yes.  I hit 5-wood from second, over the green.  It was tough.  I was barely over and I putted from there, like around 15 feet.   
 PAM WARNER:  How far was your last putt?   
 JEONG JANG:  Maybe like foot.   
 PAM WARNER:  Can we go over the rest of your scorecard?  Bogey on 2nd.   
 JEONG JANG:  Bogey on 2nd.  Hit it right bunker.   
 PAM WARNER:  With what club?   
 JEONG JANG:  8-iron, actually 9-iron.  Bunker 15 I missed it for bogey, 15 foot.  Bogey on 3.  I hit left side, left under a tree with driver and I punched out went in the bunker.  I hit it bunker shot I don't know how far, maybe 30 feet and I missed it.   
 And 5 I 3-putted from like 45 feet.  Then birdie on 15, had 10 feet.  I hit it sand wedge from third shot.   
 16 I hit a sand wedge and really short.  I made almost 30 feet putt.  And then 18 I hit driver and 3-wood in right bunker and almost made it, so put the birdie.   
 PAM WARNER:  What was going on in the front 9?  Was something not working?   
 JEONG JANG:  You know, I hit just bad tee shot on third and my putt was kind of short and didn't hit it.  I didn't know the green was that slow, so, you know, that just putting problem front 9.   
 PAM WARNER:  Do you think the wind was a problem out there today?  Because you said it kind of started up once you teed off.   
 JEONG JANG:  Yes, when I'm trying to hit a driver and the wind blow -- and my ball is hitting like right/left.  And so like there's more like right to left wind today all day.   
 So I kind of hard time with my driver.   
 PAM WARNER:  What got you going here on the back?   
 JEONG JANG:  You know I just want to be on top.  Doesn't matter who's going to win.  I just want to finish top 5.  I was starting with second so I want to be on top and the last four holes I'd make birdies.  I try my best and I make three birdies.   
 PAM WARNER:  You probably played with Natalie before and she just got her first win.   
 JEONG JANG:  Yes.  You know, I really, really -- more than really -- like happy for her.  She did really great job.  I think right time, too.  She did first win.   
 PAM WARNER:  Thank you so much.   
 JEONG JANG:  Thank you.
