  Q. Can you talk about getting there?   
 JEONG JANG: I was super nervous. That was like super nervous time I ever, ever had. But I made it, so I'm just proud of myself. Now we'll see what happens tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Now tomorrow you're playing for a million dollars?  
 JEONG JANG: Yes.  
  
  Q. How exciting is that?   
 JEONG JANG: I think actually I missed it after today last year, so I can play Sunday this year, so even I'm happy with that. So I'll try the best I can tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the format and the million dollars, I guess we talked about the million dollars. What is it like starting over on your scorecard?   
 JEONG JANG: Well, I feel like it's not really fair.   
 One round, 18 holes and one million dollars, that's kind of like bonus time, so, see what happens.   
  
  Q. Is there a key hole out there for you?   
 JEONG JANG: You know, the last couple of holes were really windy. And I think 16, 17, 18 are really key. Tomorrow I think to pay attention.
