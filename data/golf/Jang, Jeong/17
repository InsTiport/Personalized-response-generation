  Q.  Just talk about now you've got the first ones to win, so just talk about getting this first match out of the way, and now you've got some time to rest.   
 JEONG JANG:  Actually, it's really, really exciting.  Actually last year I didn't go past the first match last year.  I really paid attention in the first round -- I hit great tee shots and made a lot of putts, and that's why I did finish.   
  
  Q.  Was there any hole where you felt things turned?   
 JEONG JANG:  That was 14.   
  
  Q.  Did you birdie that?   
 JEONG JANG:  No, actually I hit a bad tee shot.  I hit the tree and I was kind of like really far -- it wasn't far, but we had like inside a hundred yards, and I hit the tree and I had like 115 and I got up-and-down and made a great par there.   
  
  Q.  That gave you the momentum you needed?   
 JEONG JANG:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  Have you had a chance to look ahead at who you'll be playing?   
 JEONG JANG:  I think it should be Angela or Se Ri -- I don't know who is winning -- tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Have you given any thought to your game plan for tomorrow?   
 JEONG JANG:  I think I want to focus on my golf, more like until Sunday comes, so I want to pay attention more.
