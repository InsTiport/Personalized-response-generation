 Q.  Talk about winning your match and going into the weekends? 
 JEONG JANG:  I had a really, really tough day and I didn't hit any good shots -- actually, a couple of good shots but I don't like it.  I'm disappointed.  And putting was really good, and match play you have to be a really good putter. 
 So, okay, but Angela the last couple of holes, she played bad and I got lucky. 

 Q.  Does knowing that you didn't play your best, does that make you nervous for tomorrow, does it give you confidence? 
 JEONG JANG:  I was 2-down until like 13 or something.  I was 2-down and I finished 2-up, so more confidence and I think I can be better.  I don't think it can get worse than today, so I think I can do better tomorrow. 

 Q.  How do you get yourself in that moment so that you can turn it around and go from 2-down to 2-up? 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, everybody can shoot -- like, you know, we don't know what's going to happen on the next shot.  This is a pretty tough course, so I didn't give up. 

 Q.  Your plans for tomorrow? 
 JEONG JANG:  I want to hit more straight drivers and I want to hit more greens and then see what happens. 

 Q.  Did the wind have a factor in anything today? 
 JEONG JANG:  Not really.
