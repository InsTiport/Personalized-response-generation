   JEONG JANG:  I hit 3-wood and I had lob wedge.  And then 5, we hit driver and 3-wood and I had 40-yard lob wedge, 5 foot. 
 No. 6, I had 8-iron from 150.  To 160 yards with 7-iron, I'm sorry.  Par 3, I had 7-iron 15 feet. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay. 
 JEONG JANG:  Bogey on 10th.  I missed the green, the right side, and chipped to maybe three feet; two-putt. 
 11, what's 11?  I hit gap wedge 110, 5-iron, and it was almost 30 feet. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Wow. 
 JEONG JANG:  And 13, 3-wood.  We had lob wedge and then 15 feet. 
 14, I hit driver, 3-wood, and use pitching wedge one foot. 
 17, oh, we had the lob wedge, and a foot. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Hit your lob wedge to a foot.  Okay.  We'll get started.  JJ, you had a great round.  You tied a tournament record at 8-under par.  It was set two years ago by Lorena Ochoa. 
 Good way to start out your round.  Talk about what was going on out there after your bogey and you rattled off those four birdies. 
 JEONG JANG:  I missed a three-feet putt the first hole and that wake me up.  I hit really good tee shots today.  In irons I was really, really good.  And the putting is really good, so everything was really good. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Pretty windy out there, but I hit a really good tee shot there with the wind, and I make almost every putt, seems like, so I had a really good round.  The wind doesn't really bother me today. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I think so.  I think so. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No.  A long time ago.  Yeah.  Not really.  Not really.  Actually, I hit like bad iron shot today on the range.  Hit it really left so I was kind of irritated this morning and I try to fight with my caddie.  Like, What are you doing?  Just help me out. 
 And I try to figure out my driver, and I hit a really good driver on the range.  Just didn't think about it and just hit a good shot and make every putt. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  My putting is getting better.  I have putting problem last couple months.  The putting is getting better and I have a lot of confidence.  I know my putting is getting better, so I have a lot of confidence and my swing is getting better so I can play better. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Well, you know, I didn't win last year, but I finished better than two years ago.  I finish 7, I think, and I finish 8 two years ago on the Money List.  I play better, I just didn't have the wins. 
 So I don't think that -- I want to win, but that's really hard, so I want to keep trying and keep trying and see what happens. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Second, January 2nd I start winter training.  I try a little different the winter training this year.  I started the boxing.  The reason I started, I want to lose weight a little bit.  I gained ten pounds in the winter. 
 But the boxing is really good training for that, you know, working on sides, like abs.  So I hired a trainer and I'm a little farther than last year, so that help me a lot. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  (Giggling) you know, half hour from my home in Orlando.  I don't know the city name, but half hour from my home.  Yeah, (indiscernible) boxing. 
 I training with a wonderful guy, and he's training the Muay Thai, so he is training with me.  Actually, you know, I like it because I don't have to think about golf when I'm training, so no stress.  That help me a lot. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  (Giggling) Taekwondo and Muay Thai is way different.  I don't even know how to do it, but boxing is pretty fun. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No.  Just punching the trainer's pad.  You know, good workout. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yes, I actually did.  I lose ten pounds.  I wanted to lose a little more and I try hard, and I don't know what happened.  Just stop ten pounds, but I try.
