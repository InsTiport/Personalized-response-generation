Q.   Heard you're retiring.
JEONG JANG:   Yes.

Q.   Why so?
JEONG JANG:   I just think it's just time to retire.   Perfect timing.

Q.   Why do you think it's perfect timing now?
JEONG JANG:   I don't know.   Just feels that way.   My heart's going that way. 

Q.   How much of this decision comes down to the difficulties of raising a family on the road?   I know you have "Sam's mom" on the back of your hat.
JEONG JANG:   Yeah.

Q.   Obviously she's your priority.
JEONG JANG:   But it's not just one thing.   It's my wrist.   My wrist is not healthy.   I had a wrist surgery done.   So it's just from my just wrist problem, injury like before.   Just can't practice as much as before. 
Just I think I just can't practice as much as all the girls.   So I'm just thinking it's time.

Q.   Too tough to compete out here if you can't practice?
JEONG JANG:   Yeah.   You know, all the players getting so good.   You know, all the young kids, and you know, they hit so far. 

Q.   Right.   Any plans for a second career?   What will you do after this?
JEONG JANG:   Actually I just want to rest a few months at least.   Just don't think about not going anywhere.   And I don't want to pack.   I want to just be mom, be wife, being just daughter.   And just stay home, just relax and not really think about it.

Q.   Wasn't your husband caddying for you for a while?
JEONG JANG:   Two years.

Q.   What's he doing now?
JEONG JANG:   He just go back to work and he was teaching golf.

Q.   Okay.
JEONG JANG:   And he used to be pro golfer.   He retired since that.   He's been teaching, and he's going to go work, back to work.

Q.   Will you all stay in Orlando?
JEONG JANG:   Yeah.   We will stay in Orlando.

Q.   What do you want your legacy to be leaving?   What do you want people to remember you for out here?
JEONG JANG:   I don't know. 

Q.   I mean you were one of the first Korean players to win out here and started kind of a lot of‑‑
JEONG JANG:   Yeah, first generation like Se Ri and me and Hee‑Won and Kimmie and Grace.   I just don't know, I never think about it.   But just something good think about me.

Q.   Hee‑Won is retiring as well this week as well.   I don't know if you knew that.
JEONG JANG:   Of course I knew that.   It was decided almost together.

Q.   You did?
JEONG JANG:   Yeah.

Q.   Did you all talk about that much?
JEONG JANG:   We talk about, because you know, she's the only one out here with the kids, the Korean players.   So we talked a lot and we share with the kids' stuff.   But we talk about a lot.   It's just too tough.

Q.   Do you want to make the cut this week?   I mean is that a goal?
JEONG JANG:   Of course.   Of course.   You know, I'm not just kidding.   To see if I can.   I want to play Sunday in the last group.   I want to try, but of course I want to make cut.

Q.   Any second thoughts golf wise if you did do that?   Would you be like, oh‑‑
JEONG JANG:   You know, last group would be good, but I want to say I want to just finish with Top 10.   That would be nice.
