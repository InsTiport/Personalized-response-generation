   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Still a runner-up finish but it was a heartbreaker.  
 JEONG JANG: Actually, yeah. I was really happy with -- until 18 hole. I can't catch her. She had a really good -- hit a really good iron shot and driver every shot today. I was going to keep going and try to be like myself, 2nd place. Second place wasn't -- doesn't work, but I hit a great shot there.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Questions?  
  
  Q. 12-under is quite often good enough to win here. Can you just kind of talk about when she's playing like that, is it hard to chase her?  
 JEONG JANG: Today was. She hit it perfect iron shot every single hole and she make -- even when she missed a couple short putt on the back 9, hit awesome shot out there today. I think so.  
  
  Q. She looked like the Annika of old to you?  
 JEONG JANG: What was that?  
  
  Q. Did she look like her old self to you today?  
 JEONG JANG: Not really. Not really. I think she just really -- was really focused on golf and like, you know, I learned a lot from her and she just -- I just want to say she's awesome. Annika is back.  
  
  Q. Talk about your four days. Pretty happy, especially given the wrist?  
 JEONG JANG: I'm taking off next week. I'm really proud of myself and played good last two week, this week and last week.  
 I'm going to be really happy to rest at home next week and my golf game better, that's really good news. Just get more focused on my short game and more better.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Any other questions for JJ? Thanks for coming in. JJ, still a great tournament. Congratulations.  
 JEONG JANG: Thanks.
