  (Press conference in progress) 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  (Indiscernible.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I was a little disappointing with my chipping.  The chipping was really hard like, you know, today of the green and, you know.  Like supposed to make like par from there, but I didn't make like the easy pars. 
 So I was a little disappointed with my short game today.  Putting is going really well, so I think I'm going to be good position though. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Questions. 
 JEONG JANG:  What do you mean? 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yeah, I missed like last couple putts.  You know, like 17 was pretty hard, but 18 was pretty good chance to make birdie.  But that's a lot golf.  And I make a lot of long putts, so that makes kind of even. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Actually, you know, the wind is better than yesterday.  Not really windy.  But greens getting harder, so you have to make really good swings otherwise you not going to have that spin. 
 The fairway getting harder and so I can hit the driver.  That's good news. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No, I never play with her before and I actually never heard her name before.  I know that last year was her rookie year.  We never play junior tournament together, but I heard she's really good, strong player.  She was like money leader a couple years ago on Future's Tour and really good player. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Two years ago when she finished the first the Money List of the Future's Tour. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I did a couple times the front 9, but I was pretty busy the back 9 and missing a lot of greens.  I didn't watch the back 9, but I did the front 9.  Doesn't really bother me today.  I like to watch, otherwise I can't concentrate. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No.  I try to do the same thing as yesterday.  And actually, I did like same practice in starting.  Everything was really good.  Driver was really good.  Iron was really good. 
 You know, I can miss a couple greens, but I didn't go up and down, so more short game today.  Be better tomorrow.  Yeah. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  You mean the last time I won? 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  The second one wasn't.  Rochester I didn't do that.  My first win the British was. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I think I made more putts and more straight driver.  What I think -- I still remember when I won the first time.  I couldn't sleep day before, but hopefully I can have better sleep. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yes.  The gallery makes me very good (indiscernible) first time I won.  Pretty good gallery out there.  Just, you know, I didn't win last year, so it makes me nervous a little bit. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Of course, of course.  I think so.  Because I really want it and I been waiting long, long time. 
 So I can wait to be, you know good finish. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I think so.  I think so.  That's really very important.  This course can make like a lot of low score, so I have to pay attention more and can't give up. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  They ask a lot of question about it, but they didn't give me pressure.  They make -- like never make like be like pressure because I know I played good last year and I know I'm getting better.  It's going to happen soon. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yeah.  You know, some media guy, Korea media guy, they always call me the Ultra Super Peanut whatever, something because I'm smaller than her, but I really don't like it. 
 Everybody call me JJ, so JJ is more like nickname.  But bigger, definitely bigger.  Everybody think I'm bigger than her. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, a couple years ago me and Kimmie, Allison, in the club we play together.  And she, everybody say like that we the giant group. 
 Allison is pretty small, and I think (indiscernible) is pretty small.  She's pretty small, too. 
 Yeah, she is in Korea.  She is small, too.  But she hits it far. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yes. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I think half and half.  Really good for drivers.  Sometime I need to make spin more but I can't.  I really trying to, but I don't know -- you know, sometimes a little low, so sometimes like half and half with my iron shots. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I keep thinking about it, you know, like this is (indiscernible), and I don't want to think about Annika because I think I play with Annika.  I don't want to think about Annika; I don't want to think about any galleries. 
 This is the first round, and then like four shots nothing and, you know, I was keep thinking myself, I want to focus golf and myself, and it worked. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, a little different course than the British course because everybody can make a lot of birdie here.  So I need to go for it more here because we need a lot of birdies. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all very much.  Good luck.
