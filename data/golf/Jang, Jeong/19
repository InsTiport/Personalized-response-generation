PAUL ROVNAK:  JJ, thank for coming in and talking with us.
JEONG JANG:  Thank you.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You've been playing great golf recently, and you have a runner up finish this week going into a major next week, so that's a good sign.  Talk about your day today.  You had a lot of birdies.
JEONG JANG:  Yeah.  I want to talk a little about last day.  I was little bit disappointed about day, and that Sunday I had four over.  And even though different I finish second, never does four like better help for next week.

So everything was really good, and putting was awesome today.  I'm going to give hundred points to my game staff.
Q.  Hundred points?
JEONG JANG:  Yeah, hundred points.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Perfect.  Take questions.
Q.  I just wondered if you could talk about the seen with Seon Hwa at the end of her round.  Are you guys friends?  Have you been friends for a long time?
JEONG JANG:  A little different Korean relation style.  We're kind of friends, but we can't be friends because she six years younger than me.  So like she always call me like older street.  It's different.  We never play golf tournament together.
Q.  Did you have any idea when you started out that there were going to be that many birdie opportunities out there?
JEONG JANG:  No, not really.  I just think about like I want to make every putt.  I play and Sherri Steinhauser yesterday and she make every single putt.  So I just want to be same like her today, but I think I did.
Q.  When you were out there and you saw Seon Hwa, you know, just making birdie after birdie, what was going through your mind?
JEONG JANG:  Looking at scoreboard, every single hole, and especially back nine.  And after 17, made birdie, and I walked to 18 green, whatever, and look at scoreboard and it says 15 under.  Oh, God.  So I say, maybe not.  I just want to be second, like by myself, but no.
Q.  How good is she for a 20 year old?
JEONG JANG:  I think she's really good.  You mean like Seon Hwa?
Q.  Yeah.
JEONG JANG:  She's really good.  She hits far and she can putt.  I think she's going to be really good.  She's really young.
Q.  And where did you get the Budweiser?
JEONG JANG:  I went to grandstand and I ask one lady, "Can" I get beer?"  And I went to the like snack shop to get champagne, pay $20.  When I had win last year at British her caddie give me the same thing, so I just try to be happy.
Q.  The guy in the green shirt was the your caddie?
JEONG JANG:  Yes.
Q.  Do you know what his name is, or how to spell it?
JEONG JANG:  L e s l i e, Leslie.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Oh, wait, his last name?
Q.  Yes.
JEONG JANG:  L a u r k.
Q.  And you got on the champagne at the snack shop?
JEONG JANG:  Yeah.  Right next to the
Q.  I didn't realize they sold champagne.  Thank you.
JEONG JANG:  Yeah.
PAUL ROVNAK:  JJ, you want to take us over your scorecard and tell us about all those birdies today?
JEONG JANG:  This is tough part.  First hole, I had 52 gap wedge, and 25 putt, or 30.

2nd, I have 5 iron, about 25.

3, I have a little chipping and get on 3, three feet.

4th hole, I have pitching wedge from fringe.  Didn't get on, and 15 feet and
PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you chip in on the 4th hole?

A.
I used the putter.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You used the putter from the fringe, so your second shot was the pitching wedge.
JEONG JANG:  I'm talking about 4th hole I make putt from fringe.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Okay.
JEONG JANG:  And I made bogey seven.  Missed the green with 5 iron, and missed a chip.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you miss the green, right, left, short?
JEONG JANG:  Left.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And chip?
JEONG JANG:  Was 15 feet.  Missed the putt, bogey.

No. 9, I had 9 iron.  No. 9 is Par 5?
PAUL ROVNAK:  Yes, it is.
JEONG JANG:  Sorry.
PAUL ROVNAK:  That's fine.
JEONG JANG:  Sand wedge, and from 18 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 10?
JEONG JANG:  Pitching wedge and five feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Bogey 11.
JEONG JANG:  I have 9 wood over the green, left side, and had a bad chip in 15 feet.  Missed the putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  13, birdie.
JEONG JANG:  13, I think 9 iron and four feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  17, Par three.
JEONG JANG:  Pitching wedge, 18 feet.

18 hole I had 3 wood and almost fringe, and putt it from there.  Missed the eagle putt in two feet, like that.
PAUL ROVNAK:  How far do you think your eagle putt was?
JEONG JANG:  There was fringe.  I'm going to say 50.
PAUL ROVNAK:  50?  Mike, go ahead.
Q.  Did you watch the leaderboard much during the day?  It was a little crazy at times.  A lot of players were trading the lead back and forth, so I was wondering how much you watch the leaderboard.  And second, did you go to McGettigan's (phonetic), the bar, to get the champagne?
JEONG JANG:  Yes.
Q.  How much do you watch the leaderboard during the day?
JEONG JANG:  I think almost every hole.  I think not every hole.  Like they have four or five big screen, the scoreboard, I think I watch all of them.  And if not, I can't concentrate because I want to know.  So I watch everything.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do we have any more questions?  Okay.  Thank you.
JEONG JANG:  Thank you.
