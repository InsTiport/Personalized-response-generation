   JEONG JANG:  I want to start with bogey. 
 PAM WARNER:  Okay, you bogeyed on 5. 
 JEONG JANG:  3-putted from 35 feet. 
 PAM WARNER:  Okay. 
 JEONG JANG:  And bogey on 10.  I hit it right rough and missed it.  Just punched out and I four-and-one putt over the green from the third. 
 PAM WARNER:  So the third shot was over the green? 
 JEONG JANG:  No.  Third shot was over the green.  Still not on. 
 PAM WARNER:  What club? 
 JEONG JANG:  Sand wedge. 
 PAM WARNER:  So third shot was sand wedge over the green. 
 JEONG JANG:  And then chip, and was maybe like ten feet.  That was bogey.  That was really great bogey. 
 PAM WARNER:  So that was which hole? 
 JEONG JANG:  10th hole.  And then birdie on 9, and I was just right -- I mean left fringe and just chip in one putt and made it. 
 PAM WARNER:  What did you chip with? 
 JEONG JANG:  56. 
 PAM WARNER:  How close was it? 
 JEONG JANG:  Almost made it.  Just right next to the hole. 
 PAM WARNER:  So in two? 
 JEONG JANG:  Yeah.  And then 18 I hit it 5-wood from the second shot and over the green.  Was just before the bunker and I chipped in with a 56 and maybe like ten feet. 
 PAM WARNER:  You made that? 
 JEONG JANG:  Yeah. 
 PAM WARNER:  Can you just talk about how you played today? 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, actually really tough out there and windy.  Greens more bumpy than yesterday, so hard to figure out which way wind.  I had a really tough time with my tee shots. 
 PAM WARNER:  So was your putting working though? 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, putting was good.  But still I hit it like kind of tough with my tee shots, so I just remember I had a tough time with driver. 
 PAM WARNER:  Have you played well here in the past? 
 JEONG JANG:  Actually, I played good last year.  Top 10.  Finished tied for 8. 
 PAM WARNER:  So do you think this course plays well with your game? 
 JEONG JANG:  I this so.  Pretty tough and pretty tight.  Greens kind of small, so good for me. 
 PAM WARNER:  How are you feeling going into tomorrow?  You're two shots off the lead. 
 JEONG JANG:  You know what, actually kind of pressure.  Not pressure more like nervous.  I only have one more round so I need to be like best I can, so I'm kind of nervous but I'll be all right. 
 PAM WARNER:  Next week you're going to St. Andrews. 
 JEONG JANG:  Yes. 
 PAM WARNER:  You've won the British Open before.  Are you excited to go and play at St. Andrews? 
 JEONG JANG:  I think so.  I never been there.  I heard about it, but I know what it looks like.  So I'm kind of exciting that, you know, kind of like great course so everybody want to play there.  I can't wait to go to play there. 
 PAM WARNER:  Great.  Thank you very much.
