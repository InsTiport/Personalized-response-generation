   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Can we go over your scorecard?  How far away was that last putt? 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, four feet.  But I don't know, you guys know that story.  I missed that putt in playoff for Korea and Japan. 
 DAN GROSS-RHODE:  When was that? 
 JEONG JANG:  Second week -- I think first week of December.  We were tied, so I won both match, the first and second match, and then we went to playoff.  They picked a five player, and they play one each hole one by one.  I was the third person go playoff, and I lose that three-feet putt and we lost it. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Oh, no. 
 JEONG JANG:  And I keep reminding, No! 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Well, today you made your putts and you are runner up.  I know you were leading.  You had a hard-fought match today. 
 JEONG JANG:  I played really good today, I think.  Needed more, you know, more -- didn't make any birdie, Par 5, and should make birdies on Par 5 and didn't. 
 Otherwise I played not so bad and I'm really proud of myself.  It wasn't mine, so maybe next time. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Can we go over your scorecard.  It's a pretty good-looking scorecard.  Starting with the bogey on 2. 
 JEONG JANG:  I hit driver on the left side bunker, and then hit a 6-iron there, short.  6 feet, 2-putt. 
 3, birdie, gap wedge, and it was just right there, pretty much only four yards.  So I made it from 12 feet. 
 9-iron and ten feet. 
 14, driver and 3-wood, and I was just right fringe and 2-putt from there.  Maybe 25 feet, 2-putt. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay. 
 JEONG JANG:  And then maybe a foot and gap wedge. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Questions for Jeong Jang? 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, she's a good putter, and when she find out and she has like feeling, she's going to make all.  You know, I never think about, okay, this is mine.  Because she keep trying and trying and she missed by like this much, all the putting on the back 9. 
 I know she's going to be good, and I just need to make my birdies.  But I didn't do it, so it wasn't mine this time. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Um, no.  I think maybe I want to try Par 5 again.  I think otherwise I'd say really good.  She just maked a lot of birdies, and I think I played pretty good today.  I like it. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yeah.  You know, I really want to.  And actually, everybody want to, especially that I was -- it was by one shot.  I really want to because I been waiting a long time and I have great feeling and I know I can do it. 
 But someone's better than me, so maybe next time I will try better and harder. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  My putting getting really good.  The putting really like kind of surprised myself.  I had putting lesson this winter from -- I don't know if you guys know Harold Swash from Yes Putter Designers.  His name on the Yes putter. 
 I met him actually a couple years ago and we know like a little bit of relationship.  He give me lesson two hours.  I was kind of like, you know, nervous and scared last year like inside five feet. 
 Then I had two-hour lesson and getting better and still getting better.  I can putt better, so it feels like I know good feelings coming. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Yes.  Right after the PGA show in Orlando. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  No, 17 I missed the right side, the high side.  Actually, my caddie told me the left, and I said, This is kind of down.  I want to kind of dive in.  He said, Okay, and he laughed even.  I thought it was really good. 
 And 18, bad wedge, the first one. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  As soon as she hit it everybody was clapping, and I say, How far?  She made it?  And he said, No, she just passed the hole a little bit.  I said, Okay. 
 She got down and putt whatever, but I know she's not going to miss it because she have really good feeling with the putter.  So I am like, Okay, I need to make birdie.  So maybe I have a little bit of pressure on the last shot.  But I hit a pretty good shot.  Wasn't that bad.  She just better than me. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I had 152 and 8-iron. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Her putt? 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  I had almost 30, 30 feet. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  Actually, I don't know how she hit the ball, because, you know, hard to see.  You know, when you hit the green and you can see the white ball, and hard to see the pink.  Then when you can even find it in air, I don't know how she hit it, but she look good with that. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 JEONG JANG:  You know, I don't think I want to try it.  No, I couldn't see.  Actually, I have bad eye.  I had Lasik couple years ago.  My eye getting bad.  Kind of I don't know what happened.  I did maybe too early. 
 So I couldn't see and I ask him like how far, if she made it, and he said, No. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you all.  Congratulations JJ on a great tournament.
