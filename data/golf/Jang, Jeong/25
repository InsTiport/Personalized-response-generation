Q.  Do you feel like you controlled the match?
JEONG JANG:  I had really good shots on the front nine, so I felt kind of easy.  But, not really.  She just was getting closer and closer, and a lot of pressure on the back nine.
Q.  On the 18th hole, did you feel pressure?
JEONG JANG:  I didn't feel pressure, just kind of nervous.  I was nervous when she putted, not with my putting.  I made four or five birdies today, and she had really good play on the back nine.
Q.  Does she have a strong future in competitive golf?
JEONG JANG:  Yes, I think so.  She has really good putting stroke, putting and short game, very good.
