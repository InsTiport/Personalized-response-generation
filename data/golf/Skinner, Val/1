JOHAN DAHLQVIST:  We'll say hi to Val Skinner, the captain of the Ping Junior Solheim Cup team for the States who lost today against Europe at Bokskogens Golf Club.  Val, what do you have to say about the competition.

VAL SKINNER:  Well, we had a point difference in our match tally at the end of the day, which I think speaks to how well-matched these players were.  We had very close matches actually all three days.  I think we were only a couple of points up after the morning matches going into the afternoon.  And then after the afternoon matches we were one point down going into the morning.  Today we basically tied all the matches.  So the one point difference going into today was really the difference in retaining the cup.  The course conditions the first round for the 36 holes were very difficult.  The wind was up about 35 miles an hour.  The kids were definitely struggling with the wind and the greens were very, very firm, so there were some interesting shots being played.  But for the most part the Americans were fairly well-rested.  There was a lot for them to adjust to in the period of time that they were here.  Just the whole situation, being excited and being up about being in Sweden and all the different things that affect them when they go away from home.  So I think that piece of it played into their emotional draw, what they had to draw on.


Q.  Was there really a big difference in time when the Europeans went to America last year, did they stay longer in the States?

VAL SKINNER:  I'm not sure when the Europeans arrived.  I know the team got here Saturday.  So they had a day extra to try to adjust a little bit to the jet lag.  Most of them got through that pretty good.  We had some parents come and some family members came, and so there was some support for them in that perspective.  And I think that helped.  They played well.  It wasn't that they didn't.  They probably just didn't play their best today.  And they all knew that.  They struggled a little bit here and there.  Some of our better players that normally perform a couple shots better just didn't have a great day today.  That made all the difference in winning or losing.


Q.  Do you have any comments for the European team, any special player?

VAL SKINNER:  A couple of things I really want to say about first of all about the Solheim family and their support of the Solheim Cup, but also the introduction of the Ping Junior Solheim Cup.  I think it's really important internationally and in the U.S. for the golf fans, the golfing public to really understand the impact of the competition like this particularly when it starts with the young players that are the future stars and the future talent of our sport.  The opportunity that Ping and all the different sponsors here at the Solheim Cup have given these young women is really an incredible opportunity.  They are very lucky.  They are very, very lucky to have this going for their future.  The other thing is that, having watched the players from Spain and knowing what I know about the past Swedish Federation of Golf, what Pia has started in your country and what it has evolved into is really terrific.  And the tradition that she has set is starting to happen now across the continent.  Marta Figueras-Dotti was the co-captain for the Solheim Cup and she did a fantastic job with Helen Alfredsson and introduced a lot of players to this competition and I think that made a huge impact on the competition.  That element I think made a huge difference in how they performed in the end result.  It's nice to know that the future in women's golf is safe, not only with people like the Solheim family, but with the young talent that we're seeing come from all around the world and what that's going to do ultimately for the women's game.  Annika is an obvious talent, as many American people are familiar with.  But to see so many countries start to get involved in this sport is really awesome.  And I really saw that watching the European Junior Team.  And I congratulate Helen and I know this is a very big win for her in Sweden.  I know she's very excited and I'm happy for her that she was able to experience this in her home country.  And I wish the American team luck at Barseback.  And I know that Captain Sheehan has a big job.  Having been captain of these juniors told me a lot about what goes through her mind:  What do I say, what don't I say, how do I approach this?  And with youngsters it's an interesting experience.  It brought back a lot of memories about competing in my youth, and I really appreciated that.  So I had a great time and we are proud of the Europeans and the American girls that came and the sort of competition they put on in Sweden.  It was an honor and a privilege to coach them and to be part of their experience. 


Q.  The weather wasn't that great today.  Did you have many spectators?

VAL SKINNER:  We did.  People hung in there for a while, but it rained almost this hard most of the day.  If we had to finish any matches  -- if we would have had the four ball and alternate shot today, we would have had no chance of getting done.  Hopefully this weather will not continue through the weekend for the event here.


Q.  Play was rather slow yesterday.  Were there any more rulings?

VAL SKINNER:  No.  Fortunately we were able to work that out.  We felt it was important to really set strong priorities.  We had a couple of discrepancies that were uncomfortable, I think, for the youngsters that we hope that everybody sort of got on the same page.  And we did today.  So we hoped after yesterday that we were able to work that out, and we were able to sort that out.


Q.  Was it just unfortunate that you got penalized for yesterday and you lost one point and one match?

VAL SKINNER:  Actually it was one match and it was actually both of the Americans and the Europeans.  On one particular hole the American player was penalized, and a couple of holes later the European player was penalized.  So it was a  -- the circumstances were difficult yesterday and in the best ball or the four ball as you call it, you're making a lot of decisions on the greens so play got a little backed up right off the tee.  So it evened out.


Q.  Have you spotted any future superstars out there?

VAL SKINNER:  Oh, yeah.  They are the future superstars.  I think from America very impressive player Paula Creamer handily won her match today 6 and 5.  She has another year from what you see in players that age, I think.  She's a very formidable player.  Taylor Leon really, really held steady all week.  I think she'll be a very, very good player in the future.  All of these young players are good.  I don't want to single anyone out, but today they played for Morgan Pressel.  They were upset that, unfortunately, Morgan had had a loss in the family and was unable to compete on the Solheim Cup team.  So today was a special day.  They wanted to dedicate that to her.  I was very proud of them for that.  I had a little 14-year old today that played against Louise, really held her own for most of the match and ended up having to call a ruling on herself.  And just did it with honor.  It's so good to see that in golf.  They're all good in their own way and they're all future stars in their own way.  Whether or not they continue with golf in the future, it will be up to them.  Because they certainly will have that option.


Q.  What happened to the 14 year old?

VAL SKINNER:  Louise had asked her to move her ball.  She had moved the ball  -- she was 2-up in the match.  She had moved her ball and forgot to move it back.  Everybody missed it.  And then she went on and played like her 7th hole and realized on the green that she had forgotten to move it back on the last hole and called the penalty on herself and lost the hole.  I'll tell you what, I was so proud of her for that.  We don't need to be proud when we follow the rules, but that's the kind of statement for junior golfers that you want to make that this is a game of honor.  This young woman had the biggest match of her life right there.  That was very commendable.  We were all sorry that she wasn't able to pull that match out, but Louise is also going to be a big future star.  There's no question.  She's an exceptionally good player.  Emma  -- I don't know how to say Emma's last name.  There were about three Europeans I thought were really talented, really outstanding.  I think they were a little bit older.  I can say their first names, but I can't say their last names, I can't pronounce their last names.  There was just a lot of talented players on both teams.


Q.  Was there any Dutch players? 

VAL SKINNER:  There's a gal from the Netherlands, very good player.  Hits it a long way.  She can't be more than five feet, and she just bombs it.  It's great to see.  It's great to see.


Q.  Who was the youngest player on your team?

VAL SKINNER:  14 was Esther Choe.

JOHAN DAHLQVIST:  At least the person that Val is talking about is a Swedish player and is ranked number one in Europe.

VAL SKINNER:  She's a very good player.  I think she's going to go to the U.S. and go to school I think at Arizona State.  She's very good.  She must have been watching Annika's videos.  Probably read all her books.  I'm pretty sure.


Q.  Thank you, Val.

VAL SKINNER:  Thank you.
