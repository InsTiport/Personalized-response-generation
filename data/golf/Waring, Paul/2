Q. How pleased are you with that 2-under?
PAUL WARING: A little disappointed. Just didn't quite hit it close enough during the day and putter was very cold today. Obviously to finish top five in such a prestigious event, that's a real bonus. That's a good thing. But I really felt like I gave myself a chance of winning this week and a little disappointed right now.
It's only positives for me. Nice to continually play well and kind of been in this form now for most of the season, so looking forward to getting on with it next week.
Q. How much more special is it finishing at the Old Course at St. Andrews?
PAUL WARING: Yeah, it is. Obviously you walk up there and kind of in amongst it and then you make your way back into the town and everyone starts sort of -- hearing a few more claps and a few more cheers. It's a special place to walk up, especially 17 and 18.
Q. The Pro-Am format the three different courses, are you looking back to nor malty?
PAUL WARING: A little bit. To be fair, I've had a great partner, Tony, he's been absolutely fantastic. We had a lot of fun out there, especially the first three rounds. I probably got a little bit serious today and probably tried a little too hard. It's nice and different for us. We go through 72-hole stroke play under pressure all the time, and it's a bit more fun like this. It's a great week.
