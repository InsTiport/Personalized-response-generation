 Q.   Beautiful golf out there today, you really played very nicely in my eyes, how did you feel about it?   
PAUL WARING:   Very good towards the end of round.   Obviously started a bit poorly, didn't hit it quite close enough.   But holed some nice putts the end of the day, so feels pretty good, two ahead, see what happens tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   We were commenting about that swing of yours, your coach is doing a great job, you've been doing some fine work.   How hard was it to get the swing where it is now, after the injury problems you have had?   
PAUL WARING:   To be honest it was probably a little bit easier because I had over a year off.   So I had a bit of time to almost start again with it, and it's still a work‑in‑progress.   It's not all about pretty golf swings.   We work so hard on the scoring side of things, chipping and putting, especially pitching with the wedges.   You know it's a full sort of complete system really, not just a golf swing but it's been long and hard but it's worth it.  
   
 Q.   It's a great game, you haven't won yet on the European Tour; are you ready tomorrow?  
PAUL WARING:   We'll see.   Don't know what's going to happen and you don't know what happens with the other lads or what anyone else is going to score.   You can't control those sorts of things.   All I can do is control what I can control and do what I can do, and add them up at the end and we'll see what happens.
