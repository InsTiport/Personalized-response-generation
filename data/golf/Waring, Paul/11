Q.   Been a good week, you've taken care of a lot of things? 
PAUL WARING:   Yeah, obviously I had a disastrous start but had a great Friday and two 5‑unders on Saturday and Sunday, it's a nice way to finish the week.

Q.   What were you thinking stood on the 18th tee? 
PAUL WARING:   I didn't know‑‑ I didn't actually look at any leaderboards or anything, so I didn't have a clue to be honest with you.   Just try and make three or four, really.   A shame I hit a bit of a loose tee shot, but you don't know when your bad swings are going to come. 

Q.   16, any chance? 
PAUL WARING:   16, yeah, I hit it into ten, 12 feet, something like that for eagle, had a good chance and then nearly holed it on 17, as well.   Quite happy. 
Yeah, 16, I don't know, to be perfectly honest, we'll have to wait and see.   There's some birdieable holes on the way in.
