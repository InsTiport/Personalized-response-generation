Q. 18 is always famous for drama, and you showed us why.  Overall a fantastic day.
PAUL WARING: Very much so.  Struggled with the putter all week to be honest with you.  A funny one, I've hit it brilliantly all week and did a bit of work again after Saturday's round and sort of got it to click a little bit and took some chances.
Like you say, 18, that's a lovely shot I hit in there.  But I'm more than happy with the day.
Q. Oddly enough, we see guys win for the first time on The European Tour, there's a drop of form and we've not seen that with you, but things seem to be coming around.
PAUL WARING: Winning for me was such a massive thing.  I put so much emphasis on it; once I finally achieved it, sort of the energy drained out of me a little bit.  You kind of look back at what you did well at the time, and over the winter I've gone back and looked at those things and worked at those things and come out the first two weeks and played great.
Q. What did you do over the break?  Do you put the clubs away or are you one of the guys putting until the wee hours in the living room?
PAUL WARING: It's a nice combination of putting and red wine, actually.  Red wine and a few beers, too much food.  I think I'm swinging it better because I put a bit of weight on.
I kind of put them away for a few weeks and then started to build it up from there, really.  Spent a time abroad and with my coach, as well, which was nice.
Q. What do you have your sights set on this year?
PAUL WARING: I'm just taking it week-by-week.  In the past I put so much emphasis on winning and trying to achieve certain things, and when it got close, trying too hard to achieve that.
I'm just focusing on daily things I'm trying to do and looking at my stats every week and seeing how I can improve my stats relative to the field and go from there.
