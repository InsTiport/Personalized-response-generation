 Q.   How happy are you with a blistering round like that?   
PAUL WARING:   Very happy.   I hit it close a few times, convert a few putts.   Left a couple out there which is a bit frustrating, but that's what go, that's what happens.   You hole a few longer ones, miss a few short ones, that's the way it goes.   I feel really good.   Put myself into contention again and hopefully we can push forward over the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Nice habit to have, because you're capable of this; we don't see you shoot a low one for days and days and days, and suddenly you're firing?  
PAUL WARING:   Yeah, I felt like I've been swinging it well for a few weeks now.   So it's nice to put it all together in one round and obviously kept me up the leaderboard a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Something about playing in the morning when the greens are pristine like this?  
PAUL WARING:   Yeah, the greens were absolutely lovely, especially the first nine.   Obviously we were second group out.   Wind didn't get up till the back nine, as well, so it was very, very scorable.   
The rough's a bit sticky in places but it's not too bad.   If you keep control of it, you can get at some of these flags so it's generally quite scorable.  
   
 Q.   Clearly not a bad first round by any means but were you conscious of what can be shot here and the need to move up?   
PAUL WARING:   Not as such.   I wasn't trying to put myself under too much pressure to be honest with you.   I was just sort of seeing how we‑‑ you know, taking it one shot at a time, the old clichÃ© from sports, just trying to control the controllables and all that sort of stuff.   But you hear all good sportsmen say it, because you actually do it, so it's one of those things that I feel leak I managed both well.  
   
 Q.   And once the first birdie goes in, another one round the corner, the mood lightens and confident increases?   
PAUL WARING:   Definitely, I know it sounds a bit negative, but you get farther and farther away from the cut mark, that becomes insignificant and you just carry on pushing forward.   You're under no pressure.   The only day two.   You're just trying to go as low as you can.   It's a nice way to be.
