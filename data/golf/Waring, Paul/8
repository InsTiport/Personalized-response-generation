Q. How was that?
PAUL WARING: Really good actually.  Finally got the putter working.  Struggled with it over the last few weeks.  But felt like it was coming.  The golf game's been good for, like I say, the last couple of weeks.  Yeah, really happy, no bogeys, no real mistakes so very, very pleased.
Q. How is the course playing out there today?
PAUL WARING: It's quite wide open obviously with no rough, which is a good thing for me because I didn't really see the fairways with drive in hand today, which is a bit awkward at times.  It's quite funny because the putting's gotten better and the driving's gotten a bit worse.  The greens held out well considering all the traffic on it the last couple days.
The golf course is playing lovely as usual.  They have done a good job with it to get it to where it is.  A little lack of rough but didn't really affect me too much today because I was wider than that half the time.
Q. Would you say putting was the key today?
PAUL WARING: Yeah, finally got it rolling nicely.  Roll your fair shares and rolled it enough to create chances, as well.  Very, very happy.
Q. Good position and ready for the weekend?
PAUL WARING: Definitely, it's nice, fourth week back after quite a prolonged injury to get my somewhere near the mix, very, very happy with it.  It's a nice challenge to sort of test myself against now.
