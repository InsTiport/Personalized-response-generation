 Q.  You're the first person in the clubhouse; how does that feel? 
 PAT HURST:  Feels good.  First out, we played pretty quickly and that was kind of nice.  We don't usually get done on 16 so it was kind of nice for me. 

 Q.  Were there any holes that you felt you had the advantage, you were kind of 2-up, 3-up most of the day; was there any hole out there where you felt you took over? 
 PAT HURST:  I would have to say the 14th.  When I made birdie there, I took a three-up lead.  I felt -- it wasn't done.  Obviously anything can happen out here.  But I felt like that lifted a little bit of pressure off. 

 Q.  Just being the first one done, that kind of gives you an advantage, a little bit of time to rest; what's your outlook now? 
 PAT HURST:  Like I said, we're going to the Yankees game, we're just getting ready to go to that and we're going to go and enjoy.  It's nice to play just 16 holes.  So we've got the rest of the afternoon and we'll play tomorrow.
