Q.
Kind of a tough day out there.  Talk about a little bit.
PAT HURST:  I made a lot of good putts and they just didn't fall.  That's just the way it goes.
Q.  Talk about how the match went for you.  Was that kind of discouraging?
PAT HURST:  You know, once you get down quite a bit, it's hard to come back, but you never know about the momentum.  We were hoping the momentum would swing and it never did.
Q.  What about playing with Christina, what's that like and what does that do for you confidence?
PAT HURST:  I played with her yesterday, and it's fine.  I play my own game.  I don't let all of that get to me.  I let her do her own thing and I think that really helps the two of us.  I'm pretty easy.  It doesn't really bother me.
