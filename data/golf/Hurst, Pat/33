Q.  I'm with Pat Hurst, who had a stellar performance at the Solheim Cup.  I know this is one of your favorite events.  It has to be exciting.
PAT HURST:  Definitely.  The team has been playing great and we have had a terrific time with the tournament.  What more can you ask for?
Q.  Your whole family was here with you this week, both your children, your parents, and Jeff, your husband, but the bigger family is your PING family, the Solheim family.
PAT HURST:  I have been with them for ten years and they have supported, not only me, but women's golf, the LPGA, for many years.  They used to sponsor at least three events at one time, and now we have the Solheim Cup and, you know, what more can you ask for?  Look at the people.  We're all having a great time.  You know, both sides, Europe, us, and the fans.  So what more can you ask for?
Q.  Congratulations on your tremendous play.

Thank you.
PAT HURST:  Thanks.
