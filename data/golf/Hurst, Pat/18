Q.   Good time to make a putt.

PAT HURST:  Not too late, but I kept pushing and didn't make any putts out there today, and that was probably what kept me back.
Q.  You putted so well during the whole championship.  This let you down just a little bit today.

PAT HURST:  Yeah, definitely.  If I could make some putts out there today, it would have been a little bit closer and put a little pressure on her, but she played great and played steady, down the middle, on the green and made some putts here and there.
Q.  What are your emotions right now?

PAT HURST:  I'm tired.  I just want to get in and put my feet up.  Emotionally I'm spent.  Just got to get going to the next tournament, and we'll look forward to that one.
