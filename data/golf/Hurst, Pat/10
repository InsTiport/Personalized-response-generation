 Q.  Pat, U.S.A. behind going into the singles, it's important to get some red on the board early.  You've done your job.  How pleased are you with that? 
 PAT HURST:  Anytime you can get some points on the board early, it's always good.  So, you know, we've got a lot of red on the board.  It's looking good for us.  But there's still a lot of golf left to play. 

 Q.  You hit some magnificent iron shots all week.  You're striking it about as well as you ever had. 
 PAT HURST:  I'm hitting the ball pretty good.  You know, it's showing good.  I'm hitting the ball good.  Putting is a little shaky at times, but overall, you know, it's coming around after working hard at it, and, you know, I was working hard for this event. 

 Q.  Very difficult week sort of from the conditions point of view, right? 
 PAT HURST:  Definitely.  With the wind and the rain, you know, it makes it that much harder.  But, everybody has got to play in it, so you just kind of -- got to put those -- you know, the elements aside and just go out and try to play some golf. 

 Q.  Fabulous score. 
 PAT HURST:  Thank you very much.
