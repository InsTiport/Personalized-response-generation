 ANGELA STANFORD:  Great.  It feels great to play with Pat.  Happy to get in the win column. 

 Q.  3-up early on.  How difficult emotionally? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  After the wind is blowing, so, you know, it's going to happen.  You have to push through it and stay focused.  Once I knew we got the momentum going back our way, you know, it's tough to stop.  So, you know, as long as we kept it going, we were okay. 

 Q.  What's best thing about Pat as a partner? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Just very clear.  Goes for the next shot.  Love that. 

 Q.  How do you rate this team? 
 PAT HURST:  You know, every team has been great, each team I'd played on.  This team with the veterans, we've got the young girls and we all jell pretty well.  The bond is great.  It's just been so much fun so far. 

 Q.  Congratulations.  Well played. 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Thanks.
