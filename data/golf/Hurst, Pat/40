Q.  Christina, first of all, it was a tough match in terms of letting it slip away there at the end.  You seem like you were absolutely right in your element out here.

CHRISTINA KIM:  You know, this is a totally different type of golf, in all honesty.  It's like the Super Bowl, is the way I put it.  You have the same people who come out to the regular LPGA event, but they're on something, I don't know.  They're loving everything.

You can feel it and it's coursing through your veins, and I think that's what helped me at least finish out the round.
Q.  Now, Pat, a 3 up lead, and then the momentum can change quick in match play?

PAT HURST:  That's the way match play is.  We've got to learn to close the door.  We played well and they played well and, so that's all we can do.
Q.  Thanks.
