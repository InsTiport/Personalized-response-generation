Q.  Aside from the results, you had a pretty close match?
PAT HURST:  We did.  We were going back and forth, especially on the back side, but it felt like I had control on the front, but you know how match play is.  Things can turn around and I think she won two holes in a row, or maybe even three holes in a row.  But it was a fun match.
Q.  What was the biggest margin at any one point?  Was she 3 up at one point?
PAT HURST:  I think I was.  I was 3 up at one point.  And I was playing pretty good, just playing pretty consistent, and then just made a couple of mistakes on the back side.  Like I said it was a fun match.
Q.  Can you describe the last hole, was that a par save?
PAT HURST:  I was in the right rough and then, you know, I thought she had the better lie of the two, but hit it in the bunker and got up and down, you know, just got it up and down and made par and I guess that won the hole.
