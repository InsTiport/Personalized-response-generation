Q.  Right now, Pat Hurst is getting some hugs from some pretty special people.  Pat Hurst, you came in here playing perhaps the greatest golf of your career.  Is this Jackson?  That's such a cool name.  And the other one?
PAT HURST:  This is Riley.
Q.  I'm sure they're proud.  You came in playing the best golf of your career.  Nancy leaned on you a lot, and you proved you're worth it?
PAT HURST:  Nancy asked me if I wanted to go 36 yesterday.  I said, if there is someone that is only playing 18, put her in, but, you know, if there is anyone to go 36, I want to be the one.  She did it.  She's been great.  What a great Captain.  We had a great time.  The team bonded really well, and it's been such a joy this week, and it's been so much fun.
Q.  Congratulations.
PAT HURST:  Thank you.
