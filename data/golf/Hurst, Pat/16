PAT HURST:  I feel pretty good.  I went out and played and did the best I could.  Didn't get off to a good start this morning.  When you play better on the back nine, it feels good to end.
Q.  A lot was made going into this tournament about the size of these greens here at the London Hunt and Country Club.  What were your thoughts coming in and how do they respond to your game at this point?
PAT HURST:  They're definitely big out here, which kind of surprised me because the London Hunt Club has been around for so long, but I guess the golf course hasn't.  But yes, they're definitely big.  No. 10 here is probably 60 long, so you've just got to realize you may have    one day you may have an 8 iron and the next day a 5 iron on the same hole.
Q.  Scottsdale, Arizona, where you call home is a hot bed for golf.  When you came to London, did you expect the response here and the hospitality that has been greeted to not only you but the rest of the players and the caddies and people traveling with you as well?
PAT HURST:  Every time we come play in this tournament, everybody is treated really well, not only the players, but the caddies.  It's always great to come back here.
