Q.  The red up there early, what's it like to see it?
PAT HURST:  It's awesome to look up at the board and see the red.  These boards over here are really tough to know what's going on, but when you see these boards over here and see all the red, it just pumps you up a little bit more.
Q.  You had such    your record, if you look at your record, they would say, eh, but you played really, really good golf this week, you ran into
PAT HURST:  You mean Annika?
Q.  Yeah, her, too.
PAT HURST:  I played well.  I have been playing well, it's just been a great week.  I don't know what else to say.
Q.  Talk about Paula taking out Laura the way she did, how much did that carry up?
PAT HURST:  Looking up at the board, after 9, I think she was 6 up.  She's a rookie and she played awesome this week.  She's a great player.
Q.  Did she have to, given what she said, even though she said it the way she did at Wendy's?
PAT HURST:  She didn't have to, but she knows she can back it up, and that's probably why she did say it.
Q.  After the team stormed back yesterday, can you talk about your confidence level coming into today's singles action.
PAT HURST:  We've always played pretty well in the singles.  We felt pretty good, especially when we got it back to even.

But, you know, you just never know, so we all try to go out and take it one match at a time.
Q.  Marvelous job, congratulations.
