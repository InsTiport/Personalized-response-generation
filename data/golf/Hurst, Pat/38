Q.  Michelle, come on over, can you    Pat, stay right here.  Pat is a little bit out of it right now.  Can you believe that you guys turned this tide around and won this match?

As devastating as yesterday's morning loss was, you guys did the same thing to Annika Sorenstam and Catriona Matthew.

PAT HURST:   On the par 3, on the 6th, Nancy came over and talked to us and gave us a couple words of wisdom.  You're talking about a Hall of Famer that knows what she's talking about.  She helped pull us there.

Michelle played great.  She hit the best iron shots that I've witnessed in a long time.
Q.  There was a lot of cynics, some of us commentators included.  You were called in at the last minute.  You were shaky at the start.  How did you turn things around?

MICHELE REDMAN:   Last night I got a lot of sleep.  Thursday night I think I got two hours.  Nancy coming out and talking to Pat and I after number 5, it was huge for us, I think.
Q.  You made a poor pitch there at 7 and you slammed your club in your bag.  That seemed to fire you up.

MICHELE REDMAN:   I think there was a couple things my caddy and I needed to talk about, and I think that got me focused.
Q.  Huge, huge victory for you guys today.  Congratulations.

MICHELE REDMAN:   We can play foursomes, we can play.
Q.  You sure can.
