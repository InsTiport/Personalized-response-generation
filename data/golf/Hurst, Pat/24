Q.
Tell us about the day, and basically how the wind affected you.
PAT HURST:  We started off at 7:44 this morning, so there wasn't that much wind to start out with.  Coming in at the end it started picking up.

I think the afternoon is going to get a little bit more than we had in the morning.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PAT HURST:  Yeah, you're not getting any roll out there.  It's just pretty much hit.  You're getting a little bit of mud on the ball.  But it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be when I first came out.  They moved the tees up on a lot of the holes, which really helped.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PAT HURST:  Definitely.  I was ready to go out yesterday, and couldn't see anything, but I was definitely ready to go out yesterday.  I'm glad we got in today, because waking up at 2:30 with the boomers crashing down on us, I thought we were in trouble again.  I'm glad we did get out and play 18 today.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PAT HURST:  You know, I have no idea.  I'm not good at predicting scores.  I basically try to go out and do the best I can, and wherever that takes me, great.  I know if I give it 100 percent that's all I can ask from myself.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PAT HURST:  Oh, I got to 3 under, yeah.  I just    I bogeyed No. 8, I hit it a little right off the tee, and I was in the rough.

So just    actually chipped it up pretty good and made a good stroke on the ball. Made a lot of putts out there.  I had a lot of solid putts, I hit them right where I wanted to.  Unfortunately they didn't all go in.  The putt that I made on the last hole really boosted my confidence for tomorrow.
