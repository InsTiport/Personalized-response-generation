PAT HURST:  We were tough out there.  And I don't know, I didn't play yesterday afternoon so I don't know how they were in the afternoon, but, I mean, if you look where the pins were, they are not in the easiest spot.
Q.  A couple of great up and downs by the Euro team in your match on 17 and 18, the putt on 17 and then the chip on 18 had to be tough to handle, too.

PAT HURST:  You know, we just didn't play well, and when you are playing best ball, I think we had maybe two birdies out there, so we will put this behind us and look forward to tomorrow, go out and play with all of our heart.
