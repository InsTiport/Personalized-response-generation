 Q.   Very good day today.   What do you think was the key to your round?  
HARU NOMURA:   All in all my putting was on.   My shot was really good.   The condition was really great.   So everything was perfect today.  
   
 Q.   Have you played this course before?  
HARU NOMURA:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Couple times?  
HARU NOMURA:   Maybe, I think two times.  
   
 Q.   This is your second time?  
HARU NOMURA:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   What do you like about the setup that works with your game?   What's the thing about the course you like?  
HARU NOMURA:   The condition of the fairway is good.   
   
 Q.   This year did you have any goals kind of set in mind?   You've been playing fairly well.   Anything you set in your head that you wanted to achieve this year?  
HARU NOMURA:   To win one of the tournaments is my goal.  
   
 Q.   So win one.   I like that.   And you've been just kind of middle of the pack.   Is there anything you've been working on that you wanted to get over the hump, to get into the Top 10, get a Top 10 finish or anything with your game?  
HARU NOMURA:   Up to now I'm getting better, and if I continue with my round like today, then I think I can get into the Top 10 in no time.  
   
 Q.   So putting more rounds together, back to back.   Do you feel more comfortable out on tour?   You've been out a couple of years.   Do you feel more comfortable playing in LPGA events?  
HARU NOMURA:   I love it.   I really enjoy the LPGA circuit, very, very much.  
   
 Q.   What would it mean for you to win this week or even this year?   What would it mean for you in your career?   What would it mean to you?  
HARU NOMURA:   My main goal is to obviously win a tournament, but winning this tournament is not going to change my altogether goals for the future.   
   
 Q.   What about any changes from today into tomorrow?   Anything that you wanted to maybe improve on?  
HARU NOMURA:   The only difference from today and tomorrow will be obviously I have morning tee time tomorrow.   The pin placement will be different, but everything else should be the same.  
   
 Q.   You want to keep everything the same?  
HARU NOMURA:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What about and you played with Mi Hyang for the first time in a while.   How was that?  
HARU NOMURA:   I enjoyed every minute of it.  
   
 Q.   Does that help a lot with your game when you're playing with someone you're comfortable with?  
HARU NOMURA:   When I play with somebody that I know I just enjoy the atmosphere.  
   
 Q.   And you usually play better?  
HARU NOMURA:   Sometimes.   Not all the time.   Depends on who it is, I guess.   
   
 Q.   All right.   I think that's it for now.   Awesome job.
