 Q.  So you were one shot away from winning in the end, were you trying to make that eagle chip?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes, yes.   
 Q.  How did you feel shooting so low, but still one shot back?  How did you feel about how you played?  
HARU NOMURA: Today I played good.  Still 5-under.  Today, Anna, 7-under.  Yeah, my play today is good.   
 Q.  Do you hope to keep the momentum up for next week?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes, I think so.   
 Q.  How did it feel to get back on the right track after having to drop out last week?
