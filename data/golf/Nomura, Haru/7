 Q.  Take me through the eagle on 3.  What did you hit?  What happened there?  
HARU NOMURA: Tee shot, driver.  Second shot to the pin, 200 yards.  So I was 5-iron, eight meters.   
 Q.  So with a withdrawal last week, what was going on?  Injury?  What was happening?  
HARU NOMURA: Cold.  Sick.   
 Q.  How long was that going on?  
HARU NOMURA: Almost eight days, ten days.  So I can't take drugs because of blood test, Olympics.   
 Q.  You didn't want to take any medicine; just play it safe?  
HARU NOMURA: Just take some fruits, eat some hamburgers, french fries, very important.   
 Q.  So the hamburgers and the french fries did not help your cold, okay.  Did you play any rounds last week?  
HARU NOMURA: No.   
 Q.  How important was it to take a rest with the schedule now, so busy; you knew you needed rest?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes.   
 Q.  This course, missed the cut two years ago.  Did you have expectations to play well?  What's your thoughts on the course?  
HARU NOMURA: Maybe a little bit different weather.  Two years ago, very windy.  But now, no windy but tomorrow coming windy.  Maybe different position now.  I'm comfortable now.   
 Q.  So you think now with the two wins under your belt, everything's kind of going easier a little bit?  
HARU NOMURA: Just I'm trying just my play.  So mind is different from two years ago.   
 Q.  Trying too hard, or confidence, and now you know you can do it.  
HARU NOMURA: Confidence.   
 Q.  Three birdies in your last four holes.  
HARU NOMURA: Yes.   
 Q.  Obviously strong finish going into Sunday.  How much will that play a role with momentum going into the final round?  
HARU NOMURA: Maybe tomorrow very bad weather, so like Swinging Skirts last day.  So I keep my patience tomorrow, too.  Everybody is the same, everybody is in the same conditions, so I'll try to play.   
 Q.  How much did winning at Swinging Skirts in bad weather, how much will that help you tomorrow?  
HARU NOMURA: Just I'm having fun.   
 Q.  How important is it to play well here this week going into a major next week?  
HARU NOMURA: Obviously exciting next week.  So next week, I think just major, long, tired, big trees, long, but like I think Swinging Skirts, exciting now.   
 Q.  What's been working well just this week overall with your game?  What do you think has been good?  
HARU NOMURA: Yeah, everything good.  Driver, woods, irons, putting not bad.   
 Q.  Have you been working on anything in particular?  I know you had a couple of not great finishes recently.  Just keeping it the same?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes, yes.
