 Q.  First 11 holes, all pars.  Did you have to stay patient with that or did you try to force anything there?  What was going through your mind?  
HARU NOMURA: Today very windy, so I thought today's best score even par, I think.  So I keep my patience, so I'm so relaxed, and a couple putts in, and that's it.   
 Q.  How were conditions when you started, not that bad but just windy, just windy?  
 Q.  No rain for you?  
HARU NOMURA: No rain.   
 Q.  So you got a couple holes?  
HARU NOMURA: Just three holes.   
 Q.  Light drizzle?  
HARU NOMURA: Yeah.   
 Q.  I know yesterday you said your win this year has given you so much confidence.  How good are you going to feel going into this weekend with the lead?  You've kind of been there before and you have closed out tournaments.  How good do you feel, much different?  
HARU NOMURA: Not much different.  I will keep my mind now, so I will try and keep the patience this weekend.   
 Q.  Anything today that you need to work on for the weekend, or is everything pretty much in place?  You thought everything was pretty good?  
HARU NOMURA: Yeah.   
 Q.  What about scores going into the weekend?  The weather looks pretty nice.  How low do you think you'll need to go to stay in contention or have a win?  
HARU NOMURA: I think 13.   
 Q.  13-under?  
HARU NOMURA: I think maybe.   
 Q.  How much would it mean to you to get the second win?  I know the first win meant so much to you, but to get two wins is a huge deal, too.  How much is No. 2 on your mind?  
HARU NOMURA: No. 2?   
 Q.  How important is the second win?  
HARU NOMURA: I'd like to have as many as I can, so the second win is pretty much a big deal.   
 Q.  Do you think once you get that second one they will start coming?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes.   
 Q.  Who is your biggest golf inspiration?  
HARU NOMURA: My grandma.   
 Q.  Did she play golf?  
HARU NOMURA: No, never.  She don't know golf.  My grandma wasn't coming here at that time, and she didn't play golf, but I was pretty much sports -- was really into my kind of sports, and grandma put me in golf because at that time Se Ri was really big.   
 Q.  So you were good at all sports but she was like, you're going to go golf?  
HARU NOMURA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Smart lady.  
HARU NOMURA: She was right.
