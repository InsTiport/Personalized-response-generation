 Q.  Congratulations on your good play.  
HARU NOMURA: Thank you.   
 Q.  Lots of birdies to move up the leaderboard.  What was the best part of your game today?  
HARU NOMURA: Today shot is good and putting good and chip good.  So everything not bad.   
 Q.  Was the wind very difficult for you?  
HARU NOMURA: Greens very firm, so second shot numbers very difficult, I think, yes.   
 Q.  Hard to figure out what club to hit based on that?  
HARU NOMURA: Yes, every shot.   
 Q.  3-under par on a difficult golf course with difficult conditions at the U.S. Women's Open is a difficult thing to do.  Are you very proud of that, what you did today?  
HARU NOMURA: This is the U.S. Open, so I thought, yeah, windy and greens are firm, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think you could have had more birdies and had a lower score than 69 today?  
HARU NOMURA: This is the U.S. Women's Open, it's only two days.  It's the best of two days.  It's going to be more confidence, more comfortable to play well the next two days.   
 Q.  How much pressure will you feel over those next two days?  
HARU NOMURA: If I think it's getting too hard, everybody think it's getting too hard, too.  I just did what I did, my patience, my own skill, everything, what talent I use today.
