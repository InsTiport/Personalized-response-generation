 Q. Talk a little bit about today's round first off. 
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, unfortunately I've not been hitting the ball great, but I was hitting the ball okay. I wasn't being able to recover when I missed the greens, like the 7th green. And then I've been being too ambitious. I really was too ambitious. 
 I made double bogey because I wanted to hit the 52 for the second shot to stop the ball easily and make a comfortable birdie if I can make a good second shot. And I pushed my driver and I make double bogey. 
 So after that I was fighting to catch a little bit the wave, because if I make birdie at the 15th I would go 6-under and I would be okay. But, I mean, I'm not going to lead the Tournament, but I would be fighting up there tomorrow. 
 After making double bogey everything was done. I couldn't make birdie at the 15th. So yes, I will fight. Tomorrow will be a different day and hopefully I will improve my score. 

 Q. What is your plan for tomorrow?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously I would like to have a good round tomorrow and play a little bit better just to shoot a good score to improve my position, that's all. 

 Q. What's your schedule through now and the Open?
 ALVARO QUIROS: I think I will play TPC, U.S. Open, the Invitational and PGA. 

 Q. What about in Europe between now and the U.S. Open?
 ALVARO QUIROS: In Europe, Spanish Open, Wentworth, probably Wales, but I can't say anymore now.
