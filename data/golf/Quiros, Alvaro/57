   ALVARO QUIROS: I played really bad today, probably the worst side of my game was the putter. 13, I was almost holding the trophy, and after three holes, almost without a chance. And 17 looks like with a birdie, I still am having my chances and I miss again the putt.
 And 18, I tried to make eagle and this is when I make bogey. But that's it. That's all.
