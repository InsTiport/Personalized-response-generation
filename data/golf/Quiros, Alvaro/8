Q. Your thoughts on finishing in such style?
ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I have to say that I'm very happy today.  The last two rounds were great.  The putting level has been unbelievable, too.  And the most important thing was the proper fight that I had with the course, so great.
Q. You had a proper fight with the course which puts you in a lovely position now.
ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously I'm not going to finish at the top but whatever happens, is great, especially because the last two rounds, they were the -- I can't remember the last time that I played with such heart and passion to finish and do the things well, and the score is matching, which is the most important thing.  Sometimes I put all that I have and the scores doesn't came good, and today it's been working great, too.
Q. Lovely to see, but why is that?  Why has it clicked here this week?
ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I mean, the putting level has been the best, by far, from the last four years, and that helps a lot.  At the end, that's the key.  I'm still hitting very bad shots today, but I was able to fix it with the putts.  That's at the end, when the game is good, make it great; and when the game is poor, made it good.  So that's the key, I would say.
Q. We should just enjoy this moment but presumably this is good going forward, as well, isn't it, gives you heart and confidence about other events?
ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, and a little bit of faith.  I haven't lost the faith during this period, but it's difficult when you work harder than ever and the scores are worse than ever.  So I would like to think that this is the beginning of a new start.
