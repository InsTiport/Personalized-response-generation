   MARÃA ACACIA: Your thoughts today.
 ALVARO QUIROS: I haven't played today great. Obviously it was a good score because I get the point that I was fighting for it. But Paul didn't play well. 
 I haven't played here. So it's a good concept, when it's my point, but I know, too, that tomorrow, if I still play like that, probably I'm going to lose.
