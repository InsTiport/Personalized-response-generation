  Q. Yesterday you were making a lot of putts to save pars. Today, birdie putts?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I didn't hole a lot of putts for par. I was chipping close to the hole, then holing putts. The longest putt I holed yesterday wasn't long. They were always short putts. But at the same time it was a lucky day because I recovered many, many shots easier.   
 And today was completely the opposite. I think I hit 16 or 17 greens, and the putts just became better on the last five, six holes. But it's a good round, of course. I have to be focusing on what I do well. I was hitting the ball better, so I'm happy.
