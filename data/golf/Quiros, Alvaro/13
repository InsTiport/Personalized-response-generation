Q.   Ãlvaro, you just finished your round.   You kept your second place tie at 4‑under.   How did you feel coming into those last two holes today? 
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Unfortunately I left 2 putt in a row short in the middle of the hole line.
But at the same time, you know, the day doesn't start like yesterday.   It's nothing almost about wind.   So if the weather is still like that, the 4‑under is not going to be as good as looks now.
But it's a good round of golf for me having in consideration of how windy it was yesterday.   And that's all.   That's the most important thing. 

Q.   How was last night for you?   Do anything special?
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   No, nothing at all.   It was special just because I had to wake up again 4:45 in the morning.   That was the only reason. 

Q.   Were you thinking about those last two holes? 
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   No, no chance.   I mean, I've been already seven years in the European Tour; I have six victories.   You know, one average or good round of golf is not going to mean anything.

Q.   Any plans for the rest of the day?
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Going to depends, because if we are lucky ‑ hopefully we are lucky ‑ we will be able to play I would say couple of holes at least.
I guess it's the best thing for the tournament.   Hopefully the weather stays like that and we are able to squeeze a little bit of tee times.
