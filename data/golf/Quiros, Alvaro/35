  Q. Reflect, if you would, on a terrific first round victory?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously, it's a point, which is always important. But I didn't play well and Paul obviously didn't, either. So the most important thing, as I said, is I get my first point in my first match, and tomorrow I'm going to have the chance to fight again solid and go through.   
 As I said, it's just one point. We were speaking, my caddie and me about it, I lose tomorrow against SÃ¸ren and Paul beats SÃ¸ren, so it would be equal score, and it's going to be probably sudden death. So it's just a good first point and that's all.  
  
  Q. So what are these misgivings about your game? What's going wrong? What isn't right?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously I'm not compressing the ball properly. I'm not hitting the ball -- a lot of shots, they were okay, because they were playable at the next shot, but they were not on the target. And obviously I wasn't hitting long. I was just putting the ball in position. But sometime it's the only thing that you need in match play, just to be in position or just to be in play.   
 In Paul's case, as I said, he didn't play well, either, so we were both of us in the same situation.  
  
  Q. As a local boy, did you actually know this place at all?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: No, to be honest, I played just two rounds, the two practise rounds that I played here before, so I know the golf course as the others, unfortunately.   
 But I know the windy conditions so, this is a good thing.   
  
  Q. What do you think? What are your impressions?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I mean, the golf course is in perfect shape and it's a good design. Hopefully the weather improves a little bit -- not that much either, for the people that hits the ball bad like me, it's not worth it, but we will see.
