 Q. Tough day out there with the weather?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yes it was, very hard conditions. I played well but I still had the feeling that I left a lot of shots out there. Similar a bit to the last round last week. I had chances but I didn't take them and when I made a mistake I made a bogey. But one under is not that bad when you consider the wind.

 Q. You talked about your swing changes the other day, it must be particularly hard to put those into practice when you have to battle wind like that?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Very much so. I missed two or three drives out there today because of that. I started well enough but when the wind started to get up I felt I really had to battle to keep my swing and my game together.

 Q. That aside, the good thing is that you are one under par?
 ALVARO QUIROS: That is definitely the good thing about today. With the way the weather is today I can't see the leader finishing much better than four or five under par so I might only be three or four shots behind going into the second round. At the end of the day, that is the positive thing and the fact I am in red figures is what I should look at.
