  Q. Congratulations, it's been a long time coming and we all knew you had the talent; did you enjoy it?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, just sometimes. It was a tough day for me today, but, it's okay. We are last in the first position so that's the only thing that matters.  
  
  Q. You don't look that excited, and your fans are all going berserk; you've got to be pumped?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Of course, I'm very happy, but three minutes ago, it was time to finish my score. I was trying to finish my card today, and I have to be focused until the last moment, otherwise it would be a bad thing.  
  
  Q. The golf course set up very well for you this week the way you drive the ball and you putted well; so it was a good mixture?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yes, I was hitting the ball very well from the tee to the green, putting very poor on the first three rounds. But today was amazing. Basically it's the best club today and with a lot of luck, I have to say that I had a lot of luck putting.  
  
  Q. Where do you go from here, your second win on Tour?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: I have no idea. The main target was to try to qualify for the Volvo. This is the most important thing for me. The Volvo Masters, it's the last edition in my practically hometown. It's not my home club, Valderrama, but it looks like it. It's a great satisfaction.  
 Physically, I'm tired, but you know, I have to.   
  
  Q. So you'll just go back to the hotel tonight and go to sleep at 8:30?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: No, I'm going to come back to the girlfriend's house and after this, I think, I don't know what is going to happen. Probably I'm going to rest.
