Q.   Tell us about the hole‑in‑one, if you would, club and distance?
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, first of all, Anthony Wall was hitting before me.   We saw the ball landing like a meter away from the hole.   It was a good shot.   When I hit, I hit three quarter of 8‑iron 150 meters, something like that.   We see the pitch, but we haven't seen the ball really get into the hole.   We find out the ball was in the hole once we were over there on the green.   The sun was straight ahead into the face, so it was difficult to see it. 

Q.   And nobody around to celebrate? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   Nobody around.   It was too early.   Unfortunately that's what happened when you don't play that good the first three rounds.   There is no people to clap.

Q.   But I take it brought back good memories because the victory included that wonderful hole‑in‑one?
ALVARO QUIROS:   You're right, and the most special thing is that I have finished with a 64 which is always nice, free of bogey, that's the second round in a row and that's the most important thing for me.

Q.   When you consider it's still early in the year, that probably is a good sign?
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, obviously there are a lot of things to change and a lot of things to improve, especially between my ears.   I think this is going to be a good push in the proper way.
