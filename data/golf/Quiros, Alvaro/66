   Q. 65 today, why do you like this golf course as much as you do? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: Probably because you have all of these chances to make birdies. I mean, except out of a bad lie in the rough, normally you have chances to recover and make a lot of birdies. It's a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. In my case today, it's been an easy day to play. I just had one bad shot on the par-5 5th, but a little bit of luck and I dropped, and the rest was everything good chances to make birdies. 

 Q. Does it feel special because you are defending champion or is it just a normal week?
 ALVARO QUIROS: No, it's a normal week. I mean, the defending champion is something that I mean, for me, it means a great thing. I won last year here, but it was a great feeling. But from last year to here, that is one full year of many different things happens and so it's a very different situation.

 Q. What time did you get up this morning?
 ALVARO QUIROS: SIX o'clock again. 

 Q. Was it too early to have a shave?
 ALVARO QUIROS: It was too early to have a shave, that's it. I will do it tomorrow, for sure. I have to tee off later, so I will do it tomorrow.

 Q. 11-under par after two rounds, satisfied with that?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, I mean, and if it's not satisfies, it's what I have, so I have to be happy with it. It's been difficult, the last few months I've not been putting great and in the last two or three days I've holed two or three good putts. The driver is working very well and the long irons, too. 
 So just I hope to hole more putts Saturday and Sunday.

 Q. When do you hit long irons? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: The par 5, second shots.
