 Q.   Good playing today, maybe just what did you do well out there as a team.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   We are doing well like a team, like you say.   You know, it's nice my partner makes five birdies and I make two birdies, and we not make any bad holes.   
It's a little bit slow in some par 5s.   We have some possibilities for birdies on the 11th and 12th that we both missed from close on both holes.   But, you know, we are happy.   We make 7‑under par on this course is very good.   We're happy.   
   
 Q.   You've played in quite a few of these events, and obviously a lot of Ryder Cups, but he's new, he's fresh.   What do you see in him as far as a team player?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's a fresh spirit.   It's nice to be a fresh guy and power, and it's good.   It's nice.  
   
 Q.   Can you teach him anything about a team event?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Not much to team now.   He already has a few years, and it's nice, we are almost neighbors in MÃ¡laga.   It's fine, we know each other very well and it's nice to play with him.  
   
 Q.   What do you like about the course?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The course is very good. It's very fair.   All of the bunkers are in play, the golf course is very good.   It's long, a little bit too long for me, but it's long and it's nice.   I think it's in great condition.   Very nice, beautiful golf course.   You can see everything from the tee.   You don't have any surprise.   
   
 Q.   And with it being extra long, it doesn't hurt having him as a partner, right?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's nice.   I hope tomorrow we can use that.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   It was good.   It was good, obviously, because we have been playing a good course.   Unfortunately I think we felt a little bit stuck for a few holes, and we were not lucky with the putting and suddenly, after 13, we start to hole putts again.   
But a solid day.   I would say from 6 and 7 until 14, we have been making pars with good chances for birdies but didn't make it.   It's a good round of golf, anyway.   
As everybody knows, Miguel is 47 years old, I'm 28, so it's a bit different between two persons but at the end he has a great experience in the World Cup.   He knows how everything works.   So I'm a little bit of a soldier.   Somebody has to be the boss, and everybody knows who is the one.   
   
 Q.   Presumably there's a lot of discussion, though, regardless of who might the captain be?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   No, the captain is always Miguel and he is the better player than the other one and he has the more experience than me.   
   
 Q.   He tells you what to do.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Not exactly, but if I have a doubt, obviously we discuss.   We speak about it and then we take a decision.   
On the final putt, for example, it was the only putt that I hit without being agreed both of us.   He thought it was straight, I thought it was left edge.   It was the only putt in 18 holes that I say, okay, I like the left edge and I holed it.   I was lucky.   I was right, by once.   (Smiling).  
   
 Q.   Makes you feel great at the end?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   That's what he said, just make a decision and try to be happy with your decision, and this is what I make.   By 14 I was lucky, and I read a proper putt.   
   
 Q.   Tell me your thoughts on playing in the World Cup.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   As I said on Facebook, I put it on Facebook, it was something I'm looking forward to from a long time ago.   I'm very proud, and especially with Miguel, somebody who has a lot of experience, I think we have good chances if we play good and we are lucky with the putting.   
It's a tournament that we used to be always in contention, as I see in the past winners, Seve, JosÃ© Maria CaÃ±izares, Antonio Garrido, a lot of players have one won it, so for me it's a very special tournament to represent my country.   
   
 Q.   A wonderful tradition, I presume growing up you're aware of the competition.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   There's no doubt.   It's a shame that the World Cup is not inside the World Ranking, because from my point of view, it would be another push for other players to come and fight for it.   
But then we are still playing a good tournament.   Every single World Cup I think you have‑‑ if you don't have the best players, you have the top 5 best players of each country, so this is the only thing matters.  
   
 Q.   And the feeling in the Opening Ceremony walking behind your flag?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   It was funny, because the girl who was holding the flag, I was watching and for a moment I thought I'm going to kick her leg.   So I thought, what happens if I put her in the lake?   It would be funny, with the Spanish flag (laughing).   
   
 Q.   Are you smoking cigars?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Oh, no, no, this is something that I'm trying to fight it, because it's very easy with Miguel.   He thinks that smoking cigars is like an act and drinking wine is the same.   So it's a difficult thing to keep myself in the healthy way.   
   
 Q.   When you win on Sunday night, you can light up a big cigar?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   We will see.   We will see.
