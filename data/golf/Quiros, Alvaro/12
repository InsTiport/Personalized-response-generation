THE MODERATOR:   Alvaro, thanks for being here.   Talk to us about your round today.
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Well, my third round has been good.   Made a couple key putts, and at the same time I am happy because my short and long game have been good overall.
The third round has been better.

Q.   Talk to us about the course conditions.   How did you find them today?
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Well, the course is in spectacular shape considering how much it's rained.   It's tough to think that we can play a four‑round tournament with all the rain that we've had. 
It's playing longer.   I had the opportunity to play here in 2008, and it was different conditions back then.   I can say that it's just playing longer.   I'm sure the PGA staff is being very observant about the conditions and the wind overall. 
But I'm just happy.   It's a spectacular course.

Q.   How about the weather? 
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Well, the climate is great.   I can't say I'm happy that it's rained so much, but the temperature is great for playing golf.   Since I come from Spain, and the warmer part of Spain, I can say that I love the heat and I prefer that to the cold.

Q.   How have you felt with your game today? 
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   The second round was a shame.   From tee to green it was great.   I missed a few key putts and there was a couple where I panicked. 
The good news is that I did finish the second round worried about my putts, but the third round has been completely different.   I've been able to play at the same level and hole some putts, which is the good news.
Hopefully tomorrow when I resume I'll be playing at the same level.   It's kind of a shame that I had to stop.   You know, hopefully I'll be able to resume that level of play.

Q.   Did you notice any difference today or any momentum that you were losing along the round?
ÃLVARO QUIRÃS:   Well, yes, it happened during one hole where we had to wait for a group to go through.   I tee'd off and hit it to the right. 
You know, I would like to think that tomorrow I will continue the same.   I haven't changed.   I'm still the same person.   Hopefully my level will still be there, my putting level will still be there. 
THE MODERATOR:   All the best tomorrow, and thank you for joining us this evening.
