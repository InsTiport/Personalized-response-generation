 Q.  Thoughts on the week?  
ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I shoot level par.  I was struggling a lot I would say tee-to-green today compared with the last three rounds, and my putting, it's been very poor lately.  So in that way, it's so difficult to be competitive.  I have to recognise that the last few holes, I holed a couple of putts, which gave me a bit of life, and for the opportunity to finish second, that is always better than third.   
 Q.  Do you feel like it's an opportunity missed?  
ALVARO QUIROS: No, not really.  Not really.  Because I was conscious about how good I was hitting from tee-to-green, and I was conscious about how poor I was putting the first three rounds.  So I knew that my long game level has to stay where it was, and it wasn't.   
So I knew that I was going to struggle, and I didn't have luck to be honest, putting, otherwise, I would be -- not cruising, because the word is not cruising, but it would be easier to be contending.   
 Q.  But overall, a positive week?  
ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, no doubt about it.  Second position is by best position for the last 11 months, so I can't complain.
