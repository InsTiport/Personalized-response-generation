  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us, well played today.   Give us your assessment of the round.   Strange day on the golf course I think.
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, I played good.   I hit the ball great from the tee and to the green.   But the putting was very, very poor.   I mean, we have had a really humble match about putting, speaking between Rory and me.   It's difficult on this golf course with this speed and how the greens are becoming that firm.   It's going to be difficult I think to shoot really, really low. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   You keep telling us how uncomfortable you are here, but you must be getting comfortable on this golf course now. 
ALVARO QUIROS:   (Smiling) I'll tell you tomorrow.   Tomorrow I will let you know if I feel comfort or not. 
But honestly, if you analyse the tee shots, they are not for a fade player as me.   The second tee shot, height, very narrow fairway.   I'm playing always, you know, almost to an impossible tee shot. 
Then the third hole is a very good chance, and every single day, I'm pissed off when I arrive to this tee because I'm not able to hit my 5‑wood or my 3‑wood to the green.   Then I have to lay up with a 9‑iron or 8‑iron.   I'm really pissed off after this shot. 
But the 8th is another hole that I don't like a lot.   Today was the first time for me to play the 9th tee completely forward so we have a chance to reach on one, but it was a completely new situation for me.   I was a little bit afraid about the distances, and I blocked it a little bit to the right, and I have a birdie chance, a high birdie chance, far away, and the rest of the green, the back nine, I think I feel more comfy, even when I have to lay up to the 12th hole, the 13th, the par 4, I feel better. 

Q.   You've talked about what you've struggled with so far; what's worked for you then, out on the course? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   Obviously my length is always an advantage.   If I'm able to hit the fairway on the second hole, I have great chances to make a good birdie, an easy birdie, when the others, probably they are struggling a little bit with the tee shot and then with the second shot. 
I have to recognise that I made three fives on this par five, and I've been hitting on two every single day.   This is one of my strengths.   I think I have the chance even when I miss the shot. 
And then I'm controlling very well the pace on the greens.     I've been‑‑ today I think I've been two or three times only, I need to hole long putts, like a metre and a half on 16 was one, and the rest of them was always chances for birdie and the longest ones were gimmie after that, and I think this is one of my strengths.   Looks like it's not easy for me to make 3‑putts on this golf course, even with the grain and the speed. 

Q.   How many times have you used your driver today?
ALVARO QUIROS:   Four times. 

Q.   Would you try to hit No. 3 with a 3‑wood or 5‑wood tomorrow? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   It's going to depend on the weather conditions.   Obviously all of these days have been blowing right‑to‑left.   So it's making more difficult even to turn and hold the ball on the green.   So it's going to depend on the wind direction. 

Q.   I think three times you've had the lead going into the final round, and you've won twice.   Would you consider yourself a good frontrunner?
ALVARO QUIROS:   If I'm not wrong, the time that I was leading, and I didn't win, was in Dubai two years ago, when Lee and Miguel Ãngel tried to fight for the title after the playoff, if I'm not wrong.   So, yeah, the statistic says that once I'm leading, I'm a good player to win a tournament. 
But as I said, too, most of the time, the golf courses were different.   They were not that tight, or whatever you want to call it, I don't know how to call it.   It's just a number. 

Q.   The winning score has been a lot lower compared to this year.   Would you rather have a birdie shootout tomorrow or play like today, three birdies, and then a low score will pick up the trophy? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   Yes, this is what I would like to have, obviously as tougher are the conditions, I think it's going to be better for me.   From the tee to the green, I'm okay.   So it means that I'm going to struggle a little bit less technically. 
So if the day becomes more difficult, the people are going to have less chances to make birdie, so at the end, as you said, it's going to be a short number to win the tournament. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Alvaro, many thanks.   Hope the golf course is king to you tomorrow.
