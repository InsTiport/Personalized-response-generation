Q. Your overall assessment of how today went for you?
ALVARO QUIROS: Well, clearly the day was a completely different day in respect to yesterday, a little more windy.  The early tee times are completely different, but in general, I guess the golf course is going to be playing more difficult than yesterday.
So pleased to finish with the score that I have finished.
Q. You started birdie bogey birdie bogey birdie, was that a little bit frustrating?
ALVARO QUIROS: No, the truth is, the bogeys that I have made today, I 100 per cent deserve it, so there's no regrets in that way.  It's true, too, that I haven't holed many putts.  I believe I held a couple of putts and then I make another two or three greens, I 3-putt.  They are -- sometimes they are playing too slow for what we are used to, and plus the wind, it's always difficult to calculate long putts.
Q. There's a good chance you're going to have the 36-hole lead.  Does that change your mind-set going into the weekend?
ALVARO QUIROS: No, clearly not.  As I said yesterday, I really believe your mind-set could change when you have two or three holes to play in a final round.  Before that, there's a lot of things that could happen, so no, not going to change anything.
