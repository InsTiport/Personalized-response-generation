  Q. Five under through 12, how did you feel about finishing with a 69?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: A little bit disappointing but that is how it is.  
  
  Q. How did you find the greens?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: In the afternoon I thought they were a little bit slower against the grain so always I was finishing short with my putts against the grain. But they are in good condition.  
  
  Q. This is supposed to be pressurized - you look like you are having fun?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I was enjoying it yes at the start but things did look like they were getting a little bit desperate after I made the bogey at the short hole and then missed a birdie chance at the next too, the 16th. But it is like it is. I am happy to be in the position I am but it could be better.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised to be this high up the leaderboard in your first stroke play tournament in America?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: If I am honest, the golf course is set up a little bit for the long hitters, the rough is not that heavy, so I am not really surprised, especially after the round of yesterday.
