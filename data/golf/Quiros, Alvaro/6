Q. Give us your overall assessment of how today went for you.
ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I have to recognise that it was a great round of golf.  The score is good, but I will say that the level that I displayed today from tee to green, it's been unbelievable.  I know that five under is a very good score, but it looks like it's a little bit short for the game that I have displayed today.
Q. Four birdies for your first ten holes.  Could you have asked for a much better start than that?
ALVARO QUIROS: You know, I don't want to sound cocky, but to be honest, the first ten holes, I missed just one green and I pitched the ball two metres away from the flag.  So I have had a lot of chances to shoot lower in the first ten, and then I didn't squeeze the paragraph five nine with a very good shot, pitching two metres away from the flag.
But this golf course is like it is.  The greens are difficult to read.  It's always difficult to finish really close to the flag.  It's a good round of golf.
Q. Looks like you're going to be joint leader overnight in round one.  Does that change your mindset going into tomorrow at all?
ALVARO QUIROS: Unfortunately it's only the first day.  I would love to say that it's the third round and I'm going to face the possibility to win the tournament.  In that case, I will agree with you, probably my mindset will be a little bit different.  But no, tomorrow is going to be a completely new day, and it's only the second round of a four-round tournament.
