   ALVARO QUIROS: I've been very lucky, I holed a putt of 30 metres almost on the 9th again like last year. I had a chip two times in, so I have to be very pleased. 
 But at the same time, you know, I have chances and I didn't take it, and the last putt was a shame, too, because I finished short, when the only thing that really, really mattered was to hit the hole. 
 Anyway, it was a good score and good to finish Top-5, so have to be happy.

 Q. As a defence, a spirited one, did you feel you were coming into the week in good form and that you were able to give a good account of yourself and the things you've been working on recently? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, I played good, and I was with chances. The thing is, the windy conditions on Thursday put me out a little bit, and I played just okay. Like I told you before, I chipped two times in, and I holed a very long putt, so I have to be thankful, too.

 Q. And looking forward to the rest of the season now, what you've done here and the way you are playing, you must be looking forward with a great deal of optimism to the weeks ahead?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, Dubai is a nice golf course I like a lot. So I mean, I would like to keep my performance like this. I mean, my score is going to come down, still changing it and working on the change over the winter break and see what happens again.
