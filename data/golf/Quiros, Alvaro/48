  Fourth Round 67. 13-Under. 275 Total.  
   
  Q. What was going through your mind over that eagle putt on the 18th?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I was watching the leaderboard just on the right edge, but I was conscious that I needed to make the putt to make eagle and try to force the leaders to make some birdies. But after watching the line of the putt, it was good, and didn't break as I was expecting.  
  
  Q. What will you do now because 13-under has still got a chance?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I was going to hit the fairway and Karlsson hit the fairway, too. I think after that, or both ever them or one of them will make birdie so it will be 14. And Poulter has three holes ahead, so I don't have a chance. But it's a good tournament anyway.   
  
  Q. You won your National Championship this year, so it's been a very proud year for you anyway, hasn't it?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, obviously I'm happy because I won again. It was a good season and to finish Top 15 in The Race to Dubai, too, and Top-50 in the world I set as a target to be exempt in the Masters next year, so happy.
