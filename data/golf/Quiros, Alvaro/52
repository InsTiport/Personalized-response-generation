  Q. Happy?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: It was a good round. Unfortunately I made four putts at the short par 3 13. But today I played better than the last five months, so it is something good. I still have a lot of problems with the confidence in myself in some of the shots under the wind, but we will see.   
  
  Q. Is that Ryder Cup pressure gone? Is that going to help you come back?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously the Ryder Cup was something in my mind, but I tell you, it's not -- nothing has changed after The Ryder Cup. I still hit the ball the same as I used to do it. My head is still messed up. I think that's the reason why I started to play bad.   
  
  Q. Did you watch The Ryder Cup?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I watched just a little bit on Sunday -- on Monday, a little bit the singles, because I was in a wedding, so --  
  
  Q. Your own?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: No, with my girlfriend. So I haven't time to watch it a lot. I was checking the Internet obviously.   
  
  Q. Great victory.   
 ALVARO QUIROS: For everybody, especially for Europeans, obviously, but the main thing is, the team work, Colin Montgomerie was a good captain and all of the vice captains, and this is great news.
