 Q.   Just talk about the day, I guess up‑and‑down kind of day?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   Yeah, I've been hitting the ball well all day long.   I mean, from the beginning until the end, I've been hitting good shots, proper shots.   
Unfortunately on 18, without hitting a really bad shot, I shoot double‑bogey 6.   But I'm happy, 3‑under is a good score.   It's not great but it's a good score to be fighting tomorrow again and hopefully finish the week in a decent position.   
   
 Q.   And obviously you're happy because the tournament is a little different when it's four days, not having to worry about tomorrow.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Yeah, it's something very positive in your mind to have that you are going to play four rounds of golf.   Because even in the end if you are not playing well, you are going to have the chance to fight to find out something on the swing after two bad rounds of golf.
