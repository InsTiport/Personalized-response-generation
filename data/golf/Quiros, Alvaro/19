 Q.   A good finish to a great day.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Yes, the weather was great.   The course is in good shape and I played well.   Probably the key was the putting, it was way, way better than the previous four or five months.   So, even happier.   
   
 Q.   Have you been doing a lot of work on your putting lately?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, yesterday I have good work, a good, 15, 20 minutes with John Jacobs, just a few tips.   He helps me every single time he watches me.   And with the Callaway guys, too, we changed the putter from today.  
   
 Q.   Do you see him quite often, John?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   No, this is the only week that I watch him, and I have him as a friend more than as a coach.   He's been working for the Spanish Federation for a while, at the same time that I was an amateur over there, so.   I have a good relationship with him.   He's a very nice person.   
   
 Q.   What tips did he give you?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, it was nothing great.   It was just release the putt in the proper moment, that's all.   It's not just that tricky.   
   
 Q.   And you must respect what he did for the Tour; he pretty much founded the Tour.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   There's no doubt about it, John personally speaking is a very important person.   And as a person, he's great.   As a golfer or as a teacher, he's been, as you said, the beginning of The European Tour.
