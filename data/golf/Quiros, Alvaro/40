  Q. Can you describe what it's like to shoot 65 in the first round of the Masters?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, it's something difficult to believe. In consideration my favorite, favorite rounds. The best score here was 75. Obviously I played well. I played very well. And the best part of the bag was the putter.  
  
  Q. You drove the ball very well and very, very long. How big an advantage is that here?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, it is everywhere, but especially here against what we have. We really need to put the ball in position. And with long drives it is an advantage.  
  
  Q. When I spoke to you last in Malaga you were struggling with your swing. Have you found something?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, yesterday I wasn't hitting the ball well, so I mean, today was a good round of golf. It's just the first round of a week. Tomorrow will be a different day. Nobody is going to be bringing anything, so hopefully I can come preserved with the same level of game.   
  
  Q. How do you explain today? Fantastic round compared with your previous rounds here.   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, the key was the putter, there's no doubt. I mean, I holed out, one-putt on 17. If I don't catch the hole, probably I would have been chipping for par, and I make obviously a good putt on 17. I holed many good putts, so obviously that was the best club.  
  
  Q. It's going to be a very, very satisfying evening, isn't it?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, it's just a fact, nothing else. It's a detail. It's one day. Hopefully I can play well tomorrow, make the cut, and it will be an improvement after the two previous years.
