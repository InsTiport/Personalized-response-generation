  Q. Alvaro, sum up your day.   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, it was a desperate day, because I played more or less, but when I had my chances, I didn't take it. I mean, short putts, I have some mistakes, I didn't hole any putts at the end.   
 So it's easy to finish how I finished if you make nothing special the last round of a tournament.   
  
  Q. And you're obviously aware of what's going on, the leaderboard was changing almost every minute, wasn't it. You're aware of what's going on, all the moving?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: No, because I wasn't playing well, so I didn't expect to be on the leaderboard. I watched it just after 15 and just after finishing 17. I knew that I had to make -- I thought that I had to make a putt at the last to shoot 7-under. That's why I hit the shot that I hit it, I thought that I had to reach the green.
