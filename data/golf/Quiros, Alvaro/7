 Q.  Disappointed with the bogey at the last but you must be pleased with your round today?  
ALVARO QUIROS: Yeah, I'm very happy.  It's a very nice round of golf again.  Portugal last week was a nice week because I have another three good rounds, so this is the continuing.   
 Q.  What was the key for you today?  
ALVARO QUIROS: I have played well.  I have putt probably very nicely, too.  I have had a very nice level in all the different stages of my game today.   
 Q.  Obviously massive crowds out today.  How were they feeling out there?  
ALVARO QUIROS: We haven't had that massive crowd.  It was too early in the morning.  Probably the guys that are teeing off today will have it.  Obviously they are expecting a very nice atmosphere, so I'm very pleased to be in the tournament.   
 Q.  Good steppingstone for the week, your round today?  
ALVARO QUIROS: Yes, it's a good beginning.  Obviously I prefer to start shooting this score than shooting a bad one.  It's another good round of golf after the three that I play in Portugal.
