 Q. Congratulations, excellent final round, especially in these windy conditions, gusty conditions. Tell us, are you pleased with your final round?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Obviously, yes, yesterday I was thinking I was going to finish Top-5 and I'm going to finish second if I'm lucky by myself. Unfortunately I made 3-putts on 15, and I made a stupid bogey on 17. So after that, it's going to be tough to reach him. But anyway, I'm very pleased to be where I am. 

 Q. Looking back at these final three rounds, you keep playing very solidly, you keep looking to next week's tournament in Dubai does that give you some further motivation?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Yes, if I'm not wrong, I finish without bogeys in the last two rounds. This round it's been really tough, wind conditions and pressure until the end. So, happy. Obviously it will be great because I'm going to have a good jump in the World Ranking points and this is what I need.
