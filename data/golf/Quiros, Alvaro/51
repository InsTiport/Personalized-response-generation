 Q. You said yesterday was the best you'd played in months. How was it today?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I survived better than the last five months. I have to recognise that I was lucky sometimes but this is a links golf course, so happy for the score. 

 Q. How special to be out there playing this famed out links with your father?
 ALVARO QUIROS: It's fine. It's good fun, but unfortunately he's playing bad, but I'm having fun watching him. Because it's the first time that he has been on a place like that, St. Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns, so it's a very special thing for him.

 Q. How much of The Ryder Cup did you see? I know you were at a wedding?
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I watched some of the moments. Obviously I was following the tournament by Internet, but I watched the singles most of the time, not everything. 

 Q. You made a big charge to try and get on the team this time around; how big of a goal is it having seen it again and seen Europe win to make the next team? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I mean, right now, the next Ryder Cup is far away. I have to be focusing, trying to regain my old position in the World Rankings and my game. I've been probably suffering a lot of no confidence, and I wasn't hitting the ball that it bad, but when you are hitting the ball regular, and the confidence is not great, I mean, the scores are average, poor. Not enough to get on The Ryder Cup Team. 
 So hopefully I will learn for the next one.
