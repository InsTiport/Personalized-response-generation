  Q. Alvaro, 1-down and three to may, that was a good match to win, tell us how it feels?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, obviously it's always difficult to win. But this one was a tough match. Obviously going up to the last hole -- it's a good feeling.  
  
  Q. How do you approach those last three holes when you are down and he's playing so well?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, unfortunately, I gave him two holes just starting, so it was a big gap.   
 Suddenly I recover. I was 1-up, once 2-up. We were even on a lot of holes, and suddenly after winning the 13th, if I'm not wrong, I had a good chance for birdie on 14. Really, really poor play on 15, I lost the hole again.   
 After that one, I'm thinking he has to miss. It's not going to be only in my hands. He makes bogey, feel lucky. And on 16, a great shot on 17. And he got a great shot to make birdie on the last hole. Well, any -- not him, not me, found the fairway. Good shot for me. The second shot it was okay, difficult shot, and fortunately he miss it.   
  
  Q. Martin Kaymer this afternoon, thoughts on that one?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Unfortunately Martin Kaymer, yeah, you're right. Well, he's the No. 3 of the world if I'm not wrong, former No. 1. And a friend. So it's going to be difficult. Hopefully I improve my game and I can try to beat him.
