  ALVARO QUIROS:   Unfortunately it's going to be a little bit short, the score.   We have played good.   We have not holed a proper put until 16 for two, and this is why the score is going to be a little bit short.   
But I mean, we played good.   
   
 Q.   You stayed in the mix there, only three or four shots away.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   I haven't seen the board.   The score is just a little bit short because of the putts.   We didn't make a putt until 16 and this is why.   
   
 Q.   Your first World Cup, how are you enjoying it?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   It's nice.   Obviously with Miguel, it's always very special.   He has been playing, I think this is his 13th World Cup, which is unbelievable.   He has the experience and he knows how to manage with the situation, and especially the foursomes, because that is the typical format that you are struggling more.   
   
 Q.   He is like your mentor.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Not that much, but he is the captain.   (Laughing).
