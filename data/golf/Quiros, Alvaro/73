  Q. How do you feel about 71?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, poor, but at the same time, lucky, because I'm not hitting the ball well. So, you know, this is golf.   
  
  Q. The 18th hole, a bit of good fortune there coming off the grandstands, tell us about that one?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I hit it into the grandstands into the left side. I wanted to cut it and the ball goes directly left. After this I had a very good eagle chance. But at the same time, 3-putts off the 7 tee with an easy first putt, and 3-putts on 16. So I think one for another.   
  
  Q. Was that pilot error, or are the greens difficult to get the pace of?   
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, that's it, you know, suddenly I start to feel the greens quicker, I don't know why. Probably it was just my feeling.   
 On 16 it was uphill, and I knew that it was going to be quick, and anyway, I finished like three meters over the hole.  
 And 17 was the same story.   
  
  Q. How different are playing conditions this morning to yesterday?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I think we played very close. The speed of the wind was very close I think. The only difference I think was the humidity on the greens, today the greens was a little softer but very, very close to yesterday. I think we play very similar two days.  
  
  Q. Some practice this afternoon if the swing is not feeling quite right?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: The thing is yesterday on the driving range, looks like I found the key, but today in the morning it was completely out of on the green. I'm going to try to improve a little bit on the driving range to see what happens tomorrow.
