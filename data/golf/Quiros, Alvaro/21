 Q.   Alvaro, how do you feel about the win?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   It's a win, obviously it's a completely story about yesterday and my putting was way, way better.   Playing this way, I felt today, a little bit more confident.   
   
 Q.   Looked like you got into a nice groove.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Today, yes.   The game yesterday was similar, really close.   I hit a few shots yesterday the same.   I probably did a change grip on the putting, and hopefully I can keep going the same way with the putting.  
   
 Q.   You had a really thick grip, and you released it‑‑  
ALVARO QUIROS:   Now I'm doing the typical one I did for a long time.   It looks like it's working, at least today.   
   
 Q.   Does it breed confidence when you hole one putt, do you feel that much better in the next one to come?  
ALVARO QUIROS:   It's not difficult to believe it but I've been struggling with the putting for five or six months, even in the victory in Dubai, I was shaking.   But my long game was that good that I was able to win.   From the beginning of the season to now‑‑ yesterday since Sergio, starting a better level of putting.   If I hole two or three good putts, I will be probably with a victory.   
   
 Q.   Now you just have to wait and see what happens with Sergio this afternoon.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   That's good.   Wait and see what happens.
