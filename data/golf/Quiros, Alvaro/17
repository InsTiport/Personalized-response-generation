  ALVARO QUIROS:   Obviously going to depends on the weather conditions after we finish, because it looks like the day has improved a lot but it was a good round of golf for me anyway.   It's the first tournament that I really feel I'm saving and I'm hitting good shots.   So happy to be where we are.  
   
 Q.   We spoke in India, was it, when you had your first one back after the surgery, and it's taken a little while to get to this stage.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Yeah, not related with the injury, I have to recognize.   It's all just the game.   I don't hit the ball as good as I want, and sometimes even when I fight with all my heart, it's not enough.   Obviously I'm not a special one; I need to play well and fight properly to be in decent scores.   It didn't happen until maybe this week.   
   
 Q.   So what is it that's clicking this week?   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, I mean, I have a few things in my mind, a few tips from different people, and it's not 100 per cent, but at least it's closer.   
   
 Q.   And certainly this is in trying conditions, as well.   You've had all sorts of things to contend with across the week.   
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, I mean, we know every single time that we came to the U.K., it's going to depend of the weather conditions; Ireland, Scotland, England, wherever we go, the weather can change so quickly.   
So at the end, your big efforts in the morning in the rain and a little bit of windy conditions, it could be a great round of golf, but suddenly if the situation changes, it's not going to be that good.   But in the end, it's going to happen.
