Q.   Couple questions.   The round was just canceled for the day.   First question is how do you feel about that? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   Well, unfortunately we have had this terrible weather.   Professionally speaking I'm happy.   My score is okay.   I'm okay.   I'm going out third, so I can't complain.   My game is good.
I guess everybody has to deal with these kind of situations.

Q.   How did you feel out there? 
ALVARO QUIROS:   I'm good.   I'm happy.   I've been playing good.   I've been hitting good shots.   No complaints.

Q.   Any expectations for tomorrow?   Does this delay have any effect on what you think your game is like?
ALVARO QUIROS:   Obviously I would like to keep enjoying the round.   That's my main target this week at Mayakoba:   Try to look for the old Alvaro Quiros that I used to be, somebody who has fun on the golf course and don't worry too much about the score.
