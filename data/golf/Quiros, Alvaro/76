  Q. One under par through 25 holes and then you went mad - what changed?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, nothing especially, I just holed some putts and my long game improved. I used a new driver today because I cracked mine in Arizona and I am still looking for a good one. Yesterday I played with one and today I played with a different one which was a little better.  
  
 Q. Did you think the course suited you when you first saw it?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I think the long hitter always has an advantage and especially here as the rough is not too big and too hard.  
  
  Q. How big an advantage is it to have somebody of the experience of Dave McNeilly as your caddie?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: I don't know if it is an advantage really......no, I am only joking!! He has a lot of experience around the world, here, at the Masters and it is a great help of course because he can help you have a clear idea a clear picture of what you are trying to do.  
  
 Q. How big a boost for you was it that he took your bag when he was offered bags like Retief Goosen's?  
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, I am a little bit younger although it would be easy to be in good positions with Retief Goosen. But maybe he is looking for a little excitement and it is definitely exciting with me because he sometimes visits all the bushes on the golf course and sees part of the golf course he never would with Retief Goosen! Maybe that was behind his decision!!
