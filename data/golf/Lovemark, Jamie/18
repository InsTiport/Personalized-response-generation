Q. 2-under on the card today, you're at minus eight heading into the weekend.  Your thoughts on how things went today?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Not as good as yesterday.  Slower start but in decent position.  I'm sure I'll be at least a handful back starting the weekend.  Really early morning.  Didn't see a ball take off until I got to my driver.  It was pitch dark early.  The course plays tough in the morning.  Plays long and the grass is wet, so it makes things more difficult.
Q. 13, you bombed one down the middle of the fairway and ends up in a divot.  Is that just the way it goes sometimes?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, it happens.  All that for nothing, huh.
Q. Your thoughts on the scoring conditions today.  Was it any different than it was yesterday afternoon?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I think the pins were a little different, a little tougher.  No winds, greens were still soft and fairways were still firm, so it's playing short.  Yeah, it's a short-ish course right now with soft greens, so guys will attack it pretty well.
