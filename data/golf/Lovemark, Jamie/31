Q.   You played well today. Let's talk about first what happened there at 18. I know you got it to 10‑under and then you found the water.
JAMIE LOVEMARK:   Yeah. Sort of an awkward tee shot for me, kind of in between 3‑wood and driver, and probably tried to fit a driver probably where it shouldn't, and tomorrow I'll be hitting 3‑wood. Overall it was good.

Q.   I know you put yourself in position here with the way that you played today. What did you feel like you did particularly well?   Maybe it was a couple things.
JAMIE LOVEMARK:   Well, the first couple days I hit it really well, didn't make any putts, and today I didn't hit it as well and finally made some putts, so it's been a good mixed bag. Hopefully I can combine the ball‑striking and putting tomorrow.

Q.   Now you've got the opportunity here to win the Canadian Open, you put yourself in position, right?
JAMIE LOVEMARK:   Yeah, definitely. It was my first event as a pro back in '09, so it's special to me, and I'd love to win here.

Q.   First bogey since Thursday. Comment on your comfort level on this golf course.
JAMIE LOVEMARK:   There's a lot of bunkers I can fly, which is huge for me. I feel like it's a long hitter's course, although the leaderboard doesn't show that. It's pretty soft, so you can be aggressive off the tee and hit a bunch of drivers. I like the course.
