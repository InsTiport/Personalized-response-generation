   JAMIE LOVEMARK: I'm not rooting against him, but wouldn't mind having a three-way playoff.  
  
  Q. Absolutely. That would be a lot of fun. What a great performance. You obviously feel comfortable out here on the PGA Tour.  
 JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, it's taken a little while. A little more comfortable now that I'm a professional, and I feel like I fit in a little bit more than being an amateur.  
 But, um, yeah, it's a good start to my career.  
  
  Q. What about you plans as far as Qualifying School and where you are on the Money List.  
 JAMIE LOVEMARK: I need, I think, $537,000 will give you temporary status and get me past first stage.  
 And as of right now, I'll do first stage next week. I'll fly out tonight on a red eye and tee it up Tuesday for the first round.  
  
  Q. What do you think so far?  
 JAMIE LOVEMARK: I'm thumbs up right now definitely. Waiting to see what happens, but I'm happy that I finished. Really don't have too much more (indiscernible.)  
  
  Q. What about the nerves out there? Did you have any?  
 JAMIE LOVEMARK: Not so bad. I thought it was gonna be a lot worse. I'm more nervous right now than I was when playing, which is kind of weird.
