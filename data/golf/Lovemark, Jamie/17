Q. When you look back, I think last year was the first time you made it to the Playoffs, very successful year, how much confidence did you take from that?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, a bunch.  It's always great to play well.  Especially over a prolonged period of time.  I felt like I did that from this part of last year.  I had a stretch where I didn't putt so well and hit it pretty mediocre, so that kind of made the season a little different for me.  So I've just been hoping to maintain my consistency a little bit more.
Q. You mentioned putting.  You missed the short one but you are leading the field in putting.
JAMIE LOVEMARK: That's cool.  I've been putting well.  I putted well all fall.  Feels good this week.  Doesn't feel like I'm making everything but I'm putting nice obviously.  If I can drive it a little bit better, I'll be in good shape for tomorrow.
Q. Being one of the Nike guys, it doesn't look like you made too many changes in the off-season to your bag.
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I've tried.  Working my way towards stuff.  This thing holds up, I'll keep it in for a long time.  I just like the way it fits my window and fits my shot shape.
Q. When did you actually put that in the bag?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I played a different club for the Playoffs and the Fall Series, and at Sea Island, finished sixth or whatever it was.
Q. Did you change anything else?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Just Titleist wedges and Scotty putter.  Stuff is good.
Q. You felt comfortable with it?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, it's not broken, so why fix it.
