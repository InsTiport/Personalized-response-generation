Q. Assess your week.
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Good.  Very good.  I think not the best of final rounds, but my first time in the final group, so wasn't sure what to expect and now I know.  So I'll go from there.
Q. But doesn't that give you a lot of confidence going forward?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, it's a good solid week.  Hit it good, hit it well, short game was good, so a lot to build off of.  I got along year ahead of me, so I got to move on and move forward.
Q. How about this California swing and looking ahead?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, no doubt.  Going home next week to San Diego, that's awesome.  Haven't been there for awhile, unfortunately.  And then a couple more events in California.  So looking forward to the next four.
Q. Does it give you a little built of home court advantage down there, do you think?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: You would think so.  It's a great place to play.  Lucky to go there.
Q. How did the course setup or the course conditions today versus the first time?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Firmer, faster.  A little hotter today, ball was travelling, better pins, it was a few shots harder for sure.
Q. Any holes out there in particular that stick in your mind where you might have dropped something?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Three doubles.  Those stick in my mind.
Q. What do you feel like you might have learned today?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Tendencies.  Tendencies when I'm under the gun, a little nervous, unsure.  I hit it a lot better coming down the stretch.  Tighten some things up on Tuesday and get after it again.
Q. It really does make a difference experiencing this kind of pressure.  Next time you really should know what to feel, right?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Definitely.  I'll be all set.  So next time I'm there, hopefully next week I'll finish it off.
Q. How would you rate your form overall right now?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Very good.  Very solid.
