 Q.  Good start today.  5-under.  Just a few comments about the day.  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, it was a good day, definitely.  I'll take 5-under any time around here.  First time I shot under par the first round for awhile.  So I've been kind of coming back from tough starts, but today was a good start.   
 Q.  How about the conditions?  Pretty soft?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, super soft.  Ball wasn't up today, so a lot of mud balls.  But the greens were soft and the fairways were wide, so it played pretty easy.
