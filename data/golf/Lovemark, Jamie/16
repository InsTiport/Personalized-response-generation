 Q.  Just give us a recap of your round.  Looks like you did some good scrambling this 36 holes?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Less so today.  Scrambled yesterday to a good round.  Today hit it much better.  Pretty conservative going into the greens.  Just gave myself a lot of looks.   
 Q.  What did you think the first time you played here?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: You've got to be conservative off the tee.  You have to be conservative off the tee.  The fairways are pretty wide.  But the greens are so fast and slippery that if you short side yourself you have no chance.  25-footer is not bad, though.   
 Q.  You had a couple of top-10's early in the season.  Played good at the Byron, are you coming into some form?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: It hasn't been that far off the whole year.  Just small things here and there like we all do.  I don't think anyone is too far from being close to playing great.  So I feel the same way.   
 Q.  Jason is so far out in front.  Do you think about it?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Not today.  That might come around Sunday if he comes back a little bit, if we shoot a good one tomorrow.  He's five clear of second or whatever it is.  He's got an eight stroke lead on me.  It's a tough course.  You can make a lot of ground or you can lose ground, you never know.   
 Q.  Do you feel like your time is coming?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I hope so.  I'm 29.  Yeah, everything feels great.  No complaints.  I'm in good health.  Playing on the PGA Tour.
