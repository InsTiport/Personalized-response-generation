Q. Not the finish you wanted, I know?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, finish cost me a couple shots.  So I'm bummed about that, but other than that, it was good, yeah.  Played well, played really solid, nothing crazy, hit a lot of really good shots and soft conditions this morning, nice greens.
Q. Was the wind up when you started?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I had four holes with no wind, and then it got to 10, 12 miles an hour.
Q. It's pretty downwind favorable?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, 17 is playing way tougher.  I hit a good driver and then 5-iron, and the par-5 16th, I hit 9-iron into, and probably should have hit a wedge.  It will pick up this afternoon and probably get firmer, so guys will be hitting sand wedge into 18, probably wedge into 16.
Q. I don't know if you addressed this already, but how long did it take you to make the decision just to throw it into the bunker with your third shot there?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: About two seconds.  Yeah, no one wants to hit it really, kind of a bad break with the cart path.  But, yeah, just a bad way to finish, honestly.  It's going to cost me at least two shots, maybe two and a half.
Q. The mindset, when you have early tee times, what is that mindset when you have it going?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yes, birdies or best on a course like this.  In the morning it's easy.  Lot of good scores are available for you, so, yeah, just try to keep the pedal to the medal.
Happened on 18 too, didn't work out.  But, yeah, I think some easy pins.  The par-5s are easy, so that will be the key to scoring this afternoon.
