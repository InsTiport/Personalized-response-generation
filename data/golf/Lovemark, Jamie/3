Q. Can you tell us what went well for you?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Around the greens was really good.  Really good start, three birdies early on and then kind of lost it for a little bit.  Course is tough.  You're going to miss fairways.  You're going to miss greens.  Just a long, penal course with long rough and it's pretty breezy, too.
Q. Do you feel like with the way the rough is, do you feel like you can be aggressive on this golf course?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: I guess so.  It's so long, you're forced to hit driver most places which is fine, I enjoy that.  You're going to miss fairways.  The fairways aren't super wide, a lot of dog legs, a lot of crosswinds, stuff like that.
Q. How important to have Chris Como with you here this week?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: It's good.  It's good to have him here.  It's a good time to have help at any event, especially first round of the Playoffs.  Going to do some stuff this afternoon and hopefully strike it better tomorrow.
Q. You've seen guys make runs in the Playoffs before and have turned their season around.  Have you had that in the back of your mind?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Oh, yeah, we've seen guys come from 125, 125.  In you're in the Playoffs you have a good chance to get to East Lake.  Just got to be in it to win it.
Q. You had some issue with your back a few years ago --
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, body feels great.  Been in good shape for a handful of years and feel really good.
