JAMIE LOVEMARK: Jay me love mark.   
 Q.  We'll assume we're not going back out today.  Obviously, a lot of starts, a lot of stops, but you are still in great position.  Just one back.  Some assessment on what you have been able to get to happen on the golf course so far.  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: So far it's been awesome.  I'm only one back, so we'll see how that turns out tomorrow.  Maybe get hot and play 36 tomorrow, if not, come finish Monday.  So, it's nice when you're playing well to play a bunch of holes in one day, kind of get hot and stay hot.   
 Q.  You're a professional golfer, you know the deal with rain and this stuff happens.  Given that you are 11 under, have you been able to kind of assess what is going right?  Have you been able to play enough consistent golf this week to know what you're doing right to get to 11?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, got to keep driving it well.  This course sets up well for me off the tee.  Basically, 14 drivers out there.  Maybe a 3-wood here -- 13 drivers.  So, stay aggressive off the tee.  I hit it pretty high so I carry it a long ways, as soft as it is, that's huge for me.  So keep being aggressive off the tee.   
 Q.  There's been quite the extensive delay.  What do you tend to do what you're experiencing delays like this?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Just eat.  I've been eating, Snapchat, hanging out, put on some weight.  It's nice to have a day off, honestly.  It's a long year, a long week, so no worries having a day off.
