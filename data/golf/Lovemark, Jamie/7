Q. 17 of the 18 holes, very good golf for you today.  How would you describe round three?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, just like that.  Just one bad swing, really.  It's going to happen to the best of us.  Just moving on.  Played easier than at last couple days, a little less wind but still a good test.
Q. What's the mind-set as and approach into Sunday, knowing you made a lot of great things here in the third round?
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, just keep doing the same thing.  This is a place where you just kind of play against the golf course.  Not a ton of birdie opportunities out there.  Take it hole-by-hole and let the course come to me.
Q. How do you try to knock down the door on the PGA TOUR?  You can stay in the moment and have your plan, but knowing this might be your time come Sunday.
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, hopefully it's one of many.  Give yourself a chance, that's all you can do, give yourself opportunities and see what happens.
