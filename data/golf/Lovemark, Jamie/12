 Q.  Nice playing.  Just get some comments on your round.  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, I mean, first off, green are grated.  Not much breeze to speak of so conditions were perfect.   
Did everything pretty well.  No big complaints so far.   
 Q.  Nice way to finish.  Two birdies on your last two.  Just take us through those two holes.  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, 17's par-5 hit a really good drive and then hit a 3-wood on the fringe and 2-putted.   
Then 18, up-tee, up-pin, just a little wedge to, I don't know, ten feet and made it.   
Yeah, good way to finish.   
 Q.  Obviously trending in the right direction.  Are you feeling confident you can keep putting yourself in position?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Yeah, I think so.  Just got to make sure I keep putting well.  The putter has been letting me down this time year; it's usually my strength, so who knows?  Could be (indiscernible.)   
Just got to putt well this weekend.   
 Q.  Anything that you've worked on specific to try to get back to the level you're used to?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Fundamentals, setup stuff.  Nothing seems that far off.  Just a mix between some stroke and bad speed probably correlated, but shouldn't be too far off.   
 Q.  Almost try and forget about it in a way?  
JAMIE LOVEMARK: Sometimes, yeah.  Well, I mean if it's so bad that you try to work on your stroke a little bit and you get down the rabbit hole of trying too hard.  Putting is a fickle, fickle part of the game.
