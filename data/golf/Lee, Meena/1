Q.   Okay, Meena, talk about your round today.   Second round just as good as yesterday.   What was working out there? 
MEENA LEE:   Well, it was tough out there because it's a little bit windy today.   I hit it really good today, but I had a couple missed putts.   We'll see two more days.

Q.   I know you mentioned the wind created a big challenge today.   What is your plan tomorrow going into Saturday and Sunday and what is the big strategy? 
MEENA LEE:   Okay, well, I think my play into par‑5s is make a birdie.   So I'll try to make more birdies on the par‑5.   That is my plan.
