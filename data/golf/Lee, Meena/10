  Q. Just take me through the round a little. How were you able to make so many birdies out there?  
 MEENA LEE: Yeah, I make nine birdie. It was my swing really good or my putting working on it today really good.   
 Yeah, everything is good, yeah.  
  
  Q. This is your career-low round.   
 MEENA LEE: Is it? Yeah.  
  
  Q. Yeah. I mean, when you have rounds like this, do you just feel that everything is working?   
 MEENA LEE: Yeah, just today I just -- well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I just want try every day (indiscernible), but today everything is working.  
  
  Q. Is working well.  
 MEENA LEE: Yeah, uh-huh, you know.   
  
  Q. As the birdies kept coming, do you think about how low of a round you can shoot, especially knowing where the leaders are?   
 MEENA LEE: I never think about anything. When I on the green, I just make the birdie. Not much, yeah.  
  
  Q. Lexi has been playing really well. She's up near the top in the lead. Is this a course where you have to shoot pretty low to be in contention?  
 MEENA LEE: Think so, because greens little bit high and very fast and sometimes a little bumpy. So she doing really good.  
  
  Q. Pretty pleased with where you are heading into the weekend being up near the top of the leaderboard again?  
 MEENA LEE: I try, but I don't know. I try, yeah. I do my best at weekend, yeah.  
  
  Q. You had the bogey on 17?  
 MEENA LEE: Yeah. I hit -- the driver missed the right side and then I got the layup. So, yeah, that's where I made bogey. Miss it right side.
