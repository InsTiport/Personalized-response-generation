   THE MODERATOR: Thanks for coming in and joining us today. Tied for second this week. Can you just talk about your round?   
 MEENA LEE: It was such a good round. This morning I feel a little bit good. I hit good.   
 But I can't try to go in, but it's playing really nice, so, yeah.   
 THE MODERATOR: All right, questions for Meena.   
  
  Q. I know you're probably disappointed, obviously. But you played a great tournament. You had a great round. Just talk about today. And obviously 17, I know 17 was a tough hole. Can you kind of walk me through that hole and what happened?   
 MEENA LEE: I talked to my caddie and my iron was a little bit short to the green, and I hit little bad. So it was a problem on 17.   
  
  Q. The chip looked like it was a good lie. Did you hit it just a little too hard?   
 MEENA LEE: Too hard, yes, uh-huh.   
  
  Q. You looked at the putt for a while. It was a long putt, and it was a downhill putt. Talk about how tough was that?   
 MEENA LEE: Yes, a little bit downhill, little bit tough for me. So it was a good putt, but little bit past.   
  
  Q. Did the conditions get a little tougher in the afternoon? We saw some low scores in the morning today because of the wet conditions. But none of the leaders were really able to pull away on that back nine?   
 MEENA LEE: Last night the weather a lot forced a little problem.
