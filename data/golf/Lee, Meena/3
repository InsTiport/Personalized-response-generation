Q.   Here with Meena Lee.   Talk about your round today.   You shot 1â€‘under par.   You sit at minus 9 for the tournament.   Tied for the lead going into the final round.
  MEENA LEE:   Overall it was really good.   I'm happy, and I'm happy with how I played.
Q.   And then you're tied for the lead.   You've won on tour before.   Do you think having a couple wins on your belt will give you some confidence going into tomorrow?
  MEENA LEE:   My last one was 2006.   It's been a while.   I'm very excited and kind of nervous, but I'm enjoying definitely the moment.
Q.   You played really good all week.   Can you kind of talk about how this week can help you build on the rest of the season going forward?
  MEENA LEE:   I gained a lot of confidence this week and then we have one week off next week and then we still have four tournaments to go after that.   So I'm very excited and happy in what I can do.   So excited.
Q.   What do you think the biggest key is going to be for your game tomorrow?   Will it be putting again?   I know you said yesterday that putting really helped you out in your really good round.
  MEENA LEE:   It definitely is going to be the putting.   I didn't really take advantage of a lot of birdie chances today, so I want to make more birdies tomorrow and see how it goes.
Q.   And then finally, there's a lot of people within two, three shots of the lead.   Does that change your approach any way going into tomorrow or do you just keep playing your game?
  MEENA LEE:   Yeah, I try not to think about how other players doing.   I'm just going to focus on what I'm doing and just do my best.
