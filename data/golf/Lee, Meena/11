 Q. You birdied hole 18. Can you talk about the last hole? 
 MEENA LEE: I hit the driver and the 4 rescue about 33 feet and I made it.

 Q. That's a long putt. 
 MEENA LEE: Yes, it is. 

 Q. So now you're at 10-under, and I believe now Masson is at 11-under, so currently tied for second, possibly you'll be tied for the lead going into tomorrow. What do you think about going into tomorrow's round? 
 MEENA LEE: I mean, today I was really good, but I have a lot of chances but I didn't make them today. But tomorrow, getting better, my putting, working on it tomorrow. Hopefully I'll do my best tomorrow, yeah. 

 Q. What about the course today? Was it windy or no wind? 
 MEENA LEE: I played the front nine a little bit windy, but the back nine was okay but really nice weather today, but I heard tomorrow is really good weather. The other players are really good because the weather is so nice, and the course is really good, too, good shape. 

 Q. How many birdies did you have today?
 MEENA LEE: Five, but then two bogeys. 

 Q. Is there one birdie that stands out the most, maybe the last hole? Does that stand out as most important or most significant birdie? 
 MEENA LEE: Yes, uh-uh, last one, because tomorrow more confidence I have.

 Q. Right, finishing with a birdie helps for confidence going into the weekend?
 MEENA LEE: Yes.
