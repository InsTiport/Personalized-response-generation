   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Meena, thanks for coming in and joining us today. You are the leader in the clubhouse at 12-under par. You shot a 7-under Par 65 today, 5-under yesterday. Obviously, you like this golf course, and you're playing well. Can you just tell us how you have been doing the past two days? 
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) Because of the rain, the course overall was a lot softer today, especially the greens was very soft, so it was easier to hit the iron shots today overall.

 MEENA LEE: Hit driver and 6-iron.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. . Questions for Meena?

 Q. I saw that I think you're ranked like maybe 100th in putting but you've really been putting well this week. Have you been practicing a lot on your putting and putting in extra time at the putting green? Why do you think you're putting a lot better?
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) I had change the putter this week.

 Q. Why did you change the putter? 
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) My coach is here this week and he made the suggestion to change the putter just to kind of give me a new feel, and it's been work out so far.

 Q. Were you wanting to do that, or were you a little resistant? 
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) I had the same thought.

 Q. I saw in your bio you didn't start playing golf till you were 14 years old. Why didn't you start until you were that old, and how did you get so good so fast do you think? 
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) To answer that question, I started playing piano when I was five, somewhat forced by my mom. But I really started to play golf just because I didn't want to play the piano, and I think that just kind of how I worked out for me.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Any more questions for Meena?

 Q. I saw you've got two wins on the LPGA Tour, one in 2005 and one in 2006, and you haven't won since then. Why do think that might be, and is there anything you need to do in particular to get that win that you haven't had for a couple years?
 MEENA LEE: (From translation.) Started last year, as you have pointed out my putting wasn't really working well. I wasn't putting the ball well. And, secondly, was my stamina. I was getting tired towards the later end of the season. 
 So what I really feel like I need to particularly focus on is to strengthen myself stamina wise and to putt the ball better.

 Q. Does Meena use a regular putter or a belly putter? 
 MEENA LEE: Regular.

 Q. You changed from a regular to a belly putter?
 MEENA LEE: Yes. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Any more questions? Thanks, Meena. 
 MEENA LEE: Thank you.
