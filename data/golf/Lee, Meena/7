Q.   Meena, very good round.   Minus one on a tough golf course with tough conditions.   What did you do well to get to the minus one?
MEENA LEE:   I was really just able to hit the fairways and greens, and I think that's just the reason why I was able to keep the score as low as I could.

Q.   Go for even par score and if an under par score came you were happy with that?
MEENA LEE:   I was really shooting for even par.   I think I played better than I expected today.

Q.   What was tougher about today, the greens or the conditions?
MEENA LEE:   I think the conditions was and it was just too hot for me.

Q.   How many bottles of water did you drink?
MEENA LEE:   Five, six.

Q.   The scores that have been played you're only one stroke away from the lead.   That must make you feel good. 
MEENA LEE:   I know that there's a lot of golfers still to go and this is the U. S. Open, so I know anything can happen.

Q.   Can you talk about that beautiful shirt?   What's the significance of what you're wearing?
MEENA LEE:   No special meaning.   It's just a shirt. 

Q.   You said that it was really hot out there today.   What did you do to stay cool and did you drink a lot of water?
MEENA LEE:   I basically had a tower over me the entire day. 
I think that's what kind of kept me cool through the day.
