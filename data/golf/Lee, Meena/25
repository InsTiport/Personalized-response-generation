Q.  Did the two close finishes help you today, being in the pressure earlier this year in The Corning in the match play?
MEENA LEE:  (Through interpretation.)  Winning, I was really -- I feel free at the beginning.  A little half, I was getting over, very intense.
Q.  What does the victory mean to you by itself?
MEENA LEE:  (Through interpretation.)  I'm LPGA rookie, and I feel confident, and I'm looking forward to future game to be the good scores.

I'm really happy.
Q.  You were not looking at a scoreboard, television monitor, when Janice was playing on 18?  You heard what happened as opposed to seeing it?
MEENA LEE:  (Through interpretation.)  Caddie was watching.  I was not watching, but caddie was watching.  He was explaining to me how Janice was doing, so I know.
Q.  I think it was your mother that you saw after finding out that you won.  If it was, could I get her name?
MEENA LEE:  (Through interpretation.)  I was looking for my mother, but she was not anywhere.  Last name Lee, first name Keon Soon.
