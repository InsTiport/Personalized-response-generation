 Q.   Just really tough ending there at 18.   Just take us through what happened.   
MEENA LEE:   I tried on the second shot, but a little bit downwind.   (Wind disturbance.)  
I try to go to the pin, but I don't (indiscernible) and made a 3‑putt.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your day.   
MEENA LEE:   Yeah, really good day, so I'm working very good with my caddie on the distance control, and club selection is really good.  
   
 Q.   How good did it feel to be in the hunt to get a win?  
MEENA LEE:   Well, I tried, but I don't know.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel the atmosphere was out here?   (Wind disturbance.)   
MEENA LEE:   Same condition.   I like this golf course.   Really good condition.   Almost same.   
   
 Q.   Is it safe to say that when they announced that the LPGA would be coming back do it course you were one of the happiest golfers on tour to play here again?  
MEENA LEE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How happy were you with the start of the round?   I think you were in a pack of about five golfers.   Did you feel like you had to be aggressive to start out and make that jump early?   
MEENA LEE:   Yeah, was really good putting and iron shots, so eventually I'm going to make good‑‑ the three birdie in the row first nine holes, so was really good day.   
I mean, really good iron and putting.
