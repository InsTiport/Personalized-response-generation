   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Meena, thanks for coming in and joining us today. You're a past champion here at this event, and today you were bogey-free, one of the only bogey-free rounds so far. Can you just talk about your round? What went best for you? 
 MEENA LEE: I'm not all that satisfied with my swing today, but I took advantage of my birdie opportunities and then made a couple of really good saves to round out the round today. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Let's go over your scorecard. Birdie on 10, your first hole? 
 MEENA LEE: Yes, driver and 3-wood and 52, maybe 18 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 18? 
 MEENA LEE: Driver, 3-wood and 52, maybe nine, ten feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 2? 
 MEENA LEE: 3-wood, 52 again, one foot. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And birdie on 7? 
 MEENA LEE: Driver, 7-wood, maybe nine feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Questions for Meena? 

 Q. As a past champion of this event, do you feel a different reaction from the crowd? 
 MEENA LEE: I think so. I think a lot more fans recognize me here, and I did recognize that. 

 Q. Several people talked earlier this week about expecting the scores to be close to par, but scoring seems to be very good today. Do you anticipate that it will remain that way, or do you foresee a possibility that things will get a little tougher as we move through the weekend? 
 MEENA LEE: I don't think the trend of today, of 4- or 5-unders, are going to continue the rest of the week. I like this course, this is a great course, but at the same time it's a really difficult course. I don't think we're going to see 10-, 11-under at the very last day, and maybe 7-, 8-under maybe will win it. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Meena, thank you, good round today.
