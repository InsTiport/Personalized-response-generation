PAM WARNER:  Meena, thanks for coming in and joining us.  You came in at 7 under.  You're currently tied for the lead.  Just talk about your day.
MEENA LEE:  I had a great day.  I played very good on the first nine, but I played better on the back nine.  Everything worked out.
PAM WARNER:  Let's go over your scorecard.  You started on the back?
MEENA LEE:  Yes.
PAM WARNER:  The bogey on 16.
MEENA LEE:  9 iron to 120 yards, it went to the right of the green, 56 approach, and it was short, four steps, nine feet.
PAM WARNER:  Did you make that putt?
MEENA LEE:  No, i missed putt.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 17.
MEENA LEE:  Driver went to the right side of the bunker, 98 yards, pitching wedge, 18 feet.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 18.
MEENA LEE:  140 yards, 7 iron to 18 feet.
Q.  You had your streak of five straight birdies.
MEENA LEE:  5 wood, it was about 28 steps.  It was on the green, but it was 28 steps.  It was really far.
PAM WARNER:  5 wood short of the green?
MEENA LEE:  No, over the green, but it was on the green.  That was No. 2.  And two putts.
PAM WARNER:  From how far was the first putt?
MEENA LEE:  28 steps, so that's like 70 feet.
PAM WARNER:  3?
MEENA LEE:  7 wood to about 15 feet.
PAM WARNER:  Hole 4?
MEENA LEE:  Driver, 9 iron to two feet.
PAM WARNER:  5?
MEENA LEE:  Driver, 5 wood, 109 yards, so 9 wood to about six feet, two putts.
PAM WARNER:  Birdie on 6?
MEENA LEE:  5 wood, 9 iron to 12 feet.
PAM WARNER:  And then the birdie to finish?
MEENA LEE:  7 iron to six feet.
PAM WARNER:  We'll take questions for Meena.
Q.  Last year finishing second, how much confidence does that give you coming into today.  Obviously you had a very good round.
MEENA LEE:  Since I came in second last year I feel more comfortable playing this course and I feel more confidence playing well this week.
Q.  The course conditions, how are the course conditions?
MEENA LEE:  Because there were a lot of rains and it was cold, I think the fairway is a little softer than last year.  The greens are the same as last year, very soft.  The course condition is excellent, like last year.

Since last year, all the tournaments in 2006, the scores have been lower than previous years and this tournament is going to be lower than last year's scores.
Q.  Do you have a ballpark of where you think the winning score is going to be?
MEENA LEE:  Last year was 15 under?  At least one or two more, so 16 or 17 under.
Q.  How do you feel about the lengthening of hole No. 12?
MEENA LEE:  If the players are long drivers, there would be a possibility of putting it two on.  But a player like me and the player who played with me today, last year we always lay up and then play, so it really wasn't affecting much.
Q.  What were your thoughts when you had the five straight birdies in a row?  How were you feeling?
MEENA LEE:  I believe that everybody should have gotten a birdie on the two hole, and I did.  I didn't see No. 3.  Somebody told me I hit the pin.

And then No. 4 hole was a short par 4, and I got really close to the pin.

And I think that there is    the par 5 on No. 2 and then No. 5, it's easier to get birdies straight because you are able to get birdies in the beginning and continue on.
PAM WARNER:  Thank you very much.
