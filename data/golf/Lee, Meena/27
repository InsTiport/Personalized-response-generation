PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks for coming in and speaking with us.  Congratulations on your win.  You're in the semifinals now.  So if you want to give us an opening statement about your round and advancing to the semifinals and then we'll take some questions.
MEENA LEE:  After I played 18 in the morning I felt a little tired in the afternoon but I also feet a certain confidence in myself.  The 18th hole, she made a mistake and I felt very lucky for that.
Q.  I was wondering what you did last week during the U.S. Open?
MEENA LEE:  I had such a long stretch of tournaments that I played in the tournament before in Rochester, so with my parents I just went shopping and rested in general.
Q.  Did it feel better    inaudible    in your rookie season; right?
MEENA LEE:  I actually feel more comfortable because I am a rookie.  Everywhere I play, I really have nothing to lose in playing a veteran, so I was very comfortable playing today.
Q.  Where did you go shopping last week, and what were your expectations coming into the tournament?
MEENA LEE:  I was in Rochester.

And my expectations, looking at the draw sheet, I said, let me just finish, get through Friday okay.  The first round I played Hee Won Han and then I went to extra holes, so that was very difficult.

I thought the second day, the second match that I played with Kim Saiki, I was actually more comfortable playing with her in the second round.
Q.  What kind of challenge do you expect tomorrow?
MEENA LEE:  People say in match play you have to play aggressively.  I think it depends on the hole.  You can play both aggressive and play safely, and it depends on the situations that I'm in currently.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
