   THE MODERATOR: Welcome, good round today.
 AI MIYAZATO: Thank you. 
 THE MODERATOR: Just talk a little about it.
 AI MIYAZATO: I played really good, because it was kind of one of the tough days I think, because the wind just keeps switching around. And it was tough to make a decision on every single shot, but I had very good focus. I'm very happy. I played good today. 

 Q. Being such good friends with Lorena, what would it mean to you to win her event?
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, that would be great. But you never know what's going to happen, because with the top ten players, it's getting really close right now. So I need to be like playing good and just need to be patient I think. 
 So one more day, you know, just having fun. 

 Q. In MÃ©xico you seem to have really good rounds, you won earlier this year, and now you're in contention; can you talk about that?
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, I love MÃ©xico, especially the Mexican people are very nice to us and at the tournaments, they always treat us nice. 
 But I just don't know why I'm playing so good in MÃ©xico, but -- because it's tough because, you know, the greens are different. But this week is very special. I think we have amazing weather the whole week, and really enjoyable. So I'm really enjoying myself. 

 Q. You've said that it's very close at the top and there are five players that are very, very close to each other. What do you think is going to be the defining factor to determine who is going to win tomorrow?
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, for me, it's not -- it doesn't matter the other players playing good or not. I just need to focus my game. It's really tough, because you know, the World Rankings and the money rankings, everything is coming up in my head. It's starred to control myself. But I think if I stay focused on my game, I have a chance tomorrow.
