  THE MODERATOR:   Ai Miyazato with a round of 2‑under par 70.   Started play on the back nine.   Went one over par at the 11th hole and two over par at the 15th hole and bounced back with four birdies.   So we'll go over those clubs and the length of the putts in a moment.   But first, how did you feel about the way you played today.  
AI MIYAZATO:   I'm very happy with my round today.   It was really tough out there because of the heat.   And you know, the golf course is always tough conditions at the U.S. Women's Open.   But I kept hitting the fairway and kept hitting it to the greens.   So overall I'm really happy with my round.   
THE MODERATOR:   What provisions did you take for the heat?   
AI MIYAZATO:   It wasn't easy, but I had an ice bag in my bag, so I used that a lot, especially last five holes, and I had a sun umbrella and trying to drink lots of water and take some vitamins and just trying to get used to it, but it wasn't really easy out there, but I'm very happy that I started in the morning.  
THE MODERATOR:   And you wear those socks.   Tell me the advantage of the socks and why you still wear them despite the heat.  
AI MIYAZATO:   I think most people think I'm crazy, but it's not really hot, though.   Trust me.   
This is like sun block socks, too, so it's not hot either.   So it's actually helps my muscles, too.   So it's really good socks.  
THE MODERATOR:   And how do they help with muscles?   
AI MIYAZATO:   It's not really compression socks, but sun block, so you won't get tired.  
THE MODERATOR:   Oh, okay.   All right.   Good.   All right.   Questions for Ai?   If not, we'll go over your card.   Bogey on No. 11.   Missed the green.   Your second hole of the day.  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I had a three‑putt.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then 15?   
AI MIYAZATO:   15 I had a three‑putt, too.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then started coming back on No. 1.   What did you hit to the green?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Pitching wedge and it was like one‑footer.  
THE MODERATOR:   Okay.   And No. 5.   Birdie.   The par‑3.   Excuse me.   Par‑4.  
AI MIYAZATO:   Par‑4, yeah.   I hit it into seven wood, second shot.   And it was on the first.   It was like ten meters.  
THE MODERATOR:   Okay.   30 feet?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yeah.   30 feet.  
THE MODERATOR:   And No. 8, birdie?   
AI MIYAZATO:   8, I hit into hybrid 4, which is like three irons, and birdie putt was 10 ‑‑ no, 12 feet.   
THE MODERATOR:   12 feet, and then your final hole of the day you birdied, No. 9.  
AI MIYAZATO:   I hit 6‑iron second shot and it actually hit the tree but stayed on the green.   But it was like six meters.  
THE MODERATOR:   It hit the tree?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Tree.   And then stayed on the green on the right side.   So I was lucky.  
THE MODERATOR:   And so you were within about 18 feet of the hole?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   And you made it.   Good putting round except for 11 and 15.   On 11 when you three‑putted, how far away were you?   
AI MIYAZATO:   It wasn't far.   My par putt was only like three‑footer.  
THE MODERATOR:   But I mean to start with.   Were you 20 feet?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yeah.   15 feet.  
THE MODERATOR:   And then on 15?   
AI MIYAZATO:   15 I was in the front of the green, but then it was like 10 meters, I guess.  
THE MODERATOR:   And you three‑putted from 30 feet?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   So your position is a very good one.   For now you are tied for first.   Is this what you dreamt of when you came to this Women's Open?   You thought maybe this would be a good place to be after the first round?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Oh, definitely.   I'll take it.   You know, always the low score on the green is really good.   But tomorrow it's going to be another day.   So you never know what's going to happen.   But like I did today, I'm trying to do the same thing.   Just playing it simple, and just trying to hit fairways and trying to hit the greens and make some putts.   But if you get in the wrong position, then it's going to be really hard.   So you have to think about every single hole.   
But like I did today, just to try and save my energy out there, because I know it's going to be really hot tomorrow, too.   So I just want to control myself really well tomorrow, too.   
THE MODERATOR:   And we have a question back here.   
   
 Q.   Beatriz was saying that since she's not a long hitter, she is used to hitting long clubs into fairways.   Would you say that that is the same for you and could that be ‑‑ if you're hitting fairways, is that an advantage for you at a very long course like this?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yeah.   I think it's pretty same feeling with her.   But today fairway was pretty firm, firmer than I thought.   So I hit pretty long, longer than usual.   So I used lots of irons today with my second shot.   So because of that I didn't feel it wasn't that long.   
But you know‑‑  
   
 Q.   It didn't feel like 7000 yards?  
AI MIYAZATO:   No, it didn't.  
THE MODERATOR:   A lot of players might have said at the beginning of the week that a long player would be favored because it's a published 6900 yards.   They might not have given you much of a chance because you're mostly known for your approach shots, your fairway woods and that sort of thing, but I guess you showed them, didn't you?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes.   I think so.   If you're on the fairway, then I think you can hit to the greens.   So even though irons or hybrid, it doesn't matter, I think.   So if I could ‑‑ you know, my swing tempo is really slow, slower than any players, but if I can keep my good tempo, then I think I'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions for Ai Miyazato?   All right.   Wonderful round today.   Thank you.   Good luck tomorrow.  
AI MIYAZATO:   All right.   Thank you.
