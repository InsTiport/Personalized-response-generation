  Q.  You had two big putts today on 17 and 18.  Talk about that.   
 AI MIYAZATO:  17, yeah I hit a good putt but I was so nervous, so my hand was shaking a little bit.  But it was really good concentrate, so it was just really good playing.   
  
  Q.  How far were those two last putts?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Three meters, so about nine feet.   
  
  Q.  And 17?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  17 was about three meters.   
  
  Q.  Does it feel like Friday at all to you?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  It feels really different because last year I was leading the first two days, but this year I'm in a playoff with Annika and Natalie.  It was so different, but really good experience.   
  
  Q.  So you're really happy they're wiping the scores out there year as opposed to last year?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Yeah, really happy, yeah.   
  
  Q.  You said you're good friends with Annika and Natalie?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Yeah, exactly.  I idolize both of them.   
  
  Q.  What will it be like tomorrow do you think?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Well, I'll just go for it.  Well, it's a different thing tomorrow, too, but I'm going to play with Natalie again, so that will be fun.   
  
  Q.  Have you thought about the million dollars at all this year?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Every day (laughter).
