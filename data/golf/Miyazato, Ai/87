  Q. You finished birdie birdie, and you are tied for second here. How does that feel?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I was just able to concentrate on my own play, and I am just going to do the same tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You are out there on the leaderboard with Karen Stupples and you are tied with Lorena Ochoa. Is that intimidating?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I know how great she is, but we are really excited, so hopefully, we can still be on the top of the leaderboard towards the weekend.  
  
  Q. And does this take a little bit of pressure off, coming out here and shooting 4 under, or is there still a lot of pressure tomorrow, even, because this is a Major?  
 AI MIYAZATO: (Inaudible) said there is no pressure, but it's always, you know, every tournament thing.
