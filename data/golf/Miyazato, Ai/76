 Q. 3-under, you have to be happy with that. Talk us through today?
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, I thought this golf course is really tough, and you know, it was pretty windy today. I had good patience out there, so I'm happy about that.

 Q. Birdies, any memorable holes? 
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, I got two birdies out there. But the 16th, I think that was a really good birdie, because I missed the right side and it was a really difficult chip-in, and I had really good chipping and my putts. 

 Q. Do you feel like your win from last week, you're still in that form?
 AI MIYAZATO: No, no, I'm ready for this week. So it's already past it last week, so I have to be careful. 

 Q. But you're still feeling that form? 
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, I have good feeling still.
