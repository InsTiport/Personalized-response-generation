   MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ai Miyazato into the interview room. Ai, thanks for joining us.  
 AI MIYAZATO: Thank you.  
 MODERATOR: You're coming off a great tournament at to the U.S. Women's Open. How do you feel about your game coming into this week?   
 AI MIYAZATO: I'm feeling good. Like you said, I play very good at the U.S. Open, and my confidence is coming back. I'm in good shape.  
 MODERATOR: What was the biggest difference for you in that tournament, because you seemed to put everything together?  
 AI MIYAZATO: U.S. Open? It was really hard work. You know, like always just setting up-wise it's very difficult.   
 But I just trying to be really simple, like try to hit the fairways and the greens, like almost same I did the tournament, so it worked.   
 MODERATOR: You won your first ever LPGA event here at Evian. What are your thoughts on this golf course and memories when you come back here?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I have such a great memory from this tournament. I can't believe it's already past two years. But I remember everything since couple years, and it's still like yesterday.   
 You know, this golf course is really good shape always and nice views and the food is good and the people treat us very nice. You know, it's always nice to be here.  
 MODERATOR: Talking with some of the other players, everybody always talk about how this is one of their favorite places to come.  
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah.   
 MODERATOR: What makes it so special?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I don't know. Just feels like atmosphere is probably different than other tournaments, you know, it's nice and relaxed.   
 As soon as tournament starts, it feels completely different because everyone is getting competitive. It's always good balance, like nice and relaxed, but in the tournament you need really focus when you play on this golf course.  
 MODERATOR: Thank you.
