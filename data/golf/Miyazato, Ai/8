Q. So you deliver what you said yesterday.  Your time is coming.
AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, I played well today, especially in this wind.  You know, it was getting stronger towards the end, but I didn't have any mistake.  I mean, my shot was really solid out there.  I had so many birdie chances.
My putting was good, too.  It was good round.  I'm happy.
Q. You talked yesterday about being comfortable having played 11 years out here.  Does that factor into a day like today with the conditions?
AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, exactly.  You know, I'm playing this tournament since five years ago and I know how to play in the wind, especially on this golf course, so that experience helped for sure.
Q. What changes for you going into a round knowing it's going to be windy?
AI MIYAZATO: It's actually nothing change.  You know, because over here you know it's going to be windy for some point.
I was actually expected this weather, you know, but first couple days wasn't really windy.  So I'm like, Hmm, I need wind.
I grew up in Okinawa way and Okinawa is really windy place, too.  So I kind of grew up to playing in the wind.  I really like it.
Q. Any specific holes you think you experience?
AI MIYAZATO: Like No. 9, I think.  Tee moved forward today but I missed the fairway.  Rough was pretty thick on the right side.  I just laid up.  You know, I didn't want to go for it because it was too risky.
The pin was on the right side right in front, but I played that pin so many times, and if I laid up I knew I'm going to have a chance to get up and down.
So that was really good decision.  I got up and down.  So like little things, but you know the greens and you know how to hit to the next shot.
So that was huge.
