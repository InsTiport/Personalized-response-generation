  Q.  Can you just give your general impressions of the morning round?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  It was a beautiful day today so I think just having fun.  I was playing really good and I thought I still had a chance, it was a great start this morning.   
  
  Q.  Talk about going into this afternoon.  Will you rest a little bit right now?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Yes, just get ready with my game and try to start off with a birdie and keep it going.   
  
  Q.  Was there any key holes that stood out today?   
 AI MIYAZATO:  Actually I missed a couple putts, birdie putts, but you know, just trying to win each hole and then she missed it.  So I'm not sure, maybe 16, the last hole.
