  Q. How did it go for you today?  
 AI MIYAZATO: It was a bit up-and-down. I had many bogeys but I had also many birdies out there.   
  
  Q. How many birdies?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Not really many, but I had three bogeys and four birdies I think. So it was pretty good.   
  
  Q. So you're very solid now, do you think you're going to push ahead tomorrow?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, again, it was really difficult out there. So I'm going to need to be patient tomorrow, too.   
  
  Q. Are you still confident, with only two shots between you and the leader?   
 AI MIYAZATO: I'm not really thinking about the winning score, I'm just playing my game still.
