Q. You've been thinking about this for about a year.  You made the decision about a year ago and you announced it publically earlier this season and you've been thinking about it.  How did it live up to your expectations today?
AI MIYAZATO: I didn't have any expectations today actually.  I just want to keep my routine and do the same thing, and just to be myself because I know it's going to be so much happier after I finish today, and when I see all my friends behind the 18th green, it almost makes me cried.  So I tried to not watch them.
You know, having this flower from Mr. Gary Player means a lot to me, too.  This is such an honor and it made my day, too.  I'm just very happy right now.
Q. You've been out on the Tour since you were a teenager.  What are you going to miss the most about playing professional golf?
AI MIYAZATO: Oh, all my friends, I think all the people from the LPGA and all the fans.  I met so many people through playing golf since 12 years ago, and that's something that I have made in my career.  I'm going to miss all my friends, that's for sure.
