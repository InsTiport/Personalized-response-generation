 Q. I know you enjoy playing with Lorena, were you comfortable out there? 
 AI MIYAZATO: I was. She was having a not very good day today, but I really enjoyed playing with her. 

 Q. Were you feeling any pressure out there to win a major?
 AI MIYAZATO: No. I was a little bit nervous today, this morning but that nervousness actually turned into a positive, so it was good. 

 Q. Driving the ball a little bit better?
 AI MIYAZATO: I think I was very concentrating through out the round, so maybe that had an effect, as well.

 Q. How long have you known Yuri Fudoh; did you look up to her at all? 
 AI MIYAZATO: Maybe she was the leading money winner in Japan for six years in a row and she's a very good player. 

 Q. But she hasn't really been in contention in a major in the past. We're kind of unfamiliar with her playing at her best, but do you think it's hard to transition from the JLPGA to playing over here? 
 AI MIYAZATO: The course here is very similar to the courses we see in Japan, so maybe it makes it more comforting for the Japanese players here. 

 Q. In what way is it similar? 
 AI MIYAZATO: The trees, the tight fairways and small greens -- they are not that small but lots of undulations. The trees and the greens and the stuff. 

 Q. What's her personality like? Is she a quiet person? 
 AI MIYAZATO: She's a very quiet person. She knows how to compete and she doesn't make that many mistakes. She plays very simple and you can tell that from watching her, and maybe her personality is like that, too. 

 Q. Was there one thing that stood out in your round today? 
 AI MIYAZATO: I think No. 6 I had a really good up-and-down today. I hit a good second shot. 
 I was racking up birdies before and getting a par there kept the round going.
