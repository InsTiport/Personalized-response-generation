 Q.   Another very good round out there and gave yourself a very good chance going into the weekend?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes, I think so.   17 was a little bit disappointing, but I know I learned something for tomorrow.   All in all, it went well.   I'm very happy.  
   
 Q.   Hopefully the pin won't be in the same position.   Obviously you were not in the bunker but there are some difficult pins out there.   Are they on the greens or on they on the fringes?  
AI MIYAZATO:   That was on the green.   You're right, there's a few difficult pin positions out there.   But I hit the ball well, and my putting is really good.   So you know, hopefully I can shoot a low score tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   This is without a doubt Asia's Major for women's golf, and is it a golf tournament you particularly enjoy?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes, definitely.   I just love to be here.   I just love the atmosphere of the tournament, and the people are really nice.   I'm just enjoying every single moment.   I have two more days, so very excited.  
   
 Q.   You played with Jenny Shin today, and she had a wonderful round.   
AI MIYAZATO:   She had.   She's only 19 years old I guess.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel old‑‑  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes (laughing) she's like a baby.   But she played really well today, and I really enjoyed playing with her, and hopefully we can play together again.
