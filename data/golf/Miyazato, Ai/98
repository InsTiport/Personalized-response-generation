PAM WARNER:  Thank you very much for coming in.  Ai is a rookie this year on Tour and last year at this tournament, it was her first LPGA event.

So why don't you talk about coming back to the first time you played on Tour and what's all happened in the past year.
AI MIYAZATO:  I'm very happy to come back here and I'm looking forward to this week and because I did great last year.  It was very exciting.  It's more competitive tournament.  So I'm looking forward to it.
