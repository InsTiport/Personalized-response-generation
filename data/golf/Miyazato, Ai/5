AI MIYAZATO: I'm gain miss so many things, but I think mostly my friends and all the people from the LPGA and sponsors.  I met through playing golf so many good people on the tour, so I'm definitely going to miss them.
Q. What are you possibly going to do to fill up your time once you retire?
AI MIYAZATO: It's still up in here.  Now I have the time to think about it, you know.  First I just want to settle down and have maybe a normal life a little bit.
Maybe going back to Japan rest of the year and stay in my hometown and maybe hang out with my friends and see how it's going to happen in my future.
Q. Talk about Portland golf and what this tournament has meant to you being a former winner in 2010?
AI MIYAZATO: I mean, it's been tremendous week for me.  On the last hole I got really emotional because I didn't know that the (indiscernible) was bringing flower for me.
But including, that I have so many great memories of this tournament.  This is my favorite city forever now, and the people are so supportive of this tournament.  It's just really enjoyable tournament, so I'm glad I'm playing this week actually of my last year.
Very happy.
