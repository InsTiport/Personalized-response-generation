Q. Here with Ai Miyazato, playing her last official event as a full-time member on American soil.  (Regarding retirement announcement.)  Did that announcement and emotions you're going through because you're retiring have anything to do with your inspired play this week?
AI MIYAZATO: Um, well, you know, I'm glad I made the decision, though, actually.  I was kind trouble to make the decision last few years.
Even though after I announced my retirement I been really happy and, you know, I been really positive about my game and trying to enjoy best as much as I could out there.
I been playing really good, so it's not surprise me these scores today.
Q. (No microphone.)
AI MIYAZATO: No.  (Laughter.)  No.
But like I said, I'm enjoying my game.  This is so much fun for me, especially this tournament.  You know, I won 2010 and I have such great memories and I love this tournament and I love all the people.  They are very supportive.
Hopefully I can keep it going.  I really want to play well this week.
