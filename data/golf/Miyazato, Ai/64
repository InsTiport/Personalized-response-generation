   AI MIYAZATO: I'm pretty satisfied about today, because I been sick since last week. I stayed calm and like just let to happen. So it was all right.   
  
  Q. Yesterday you talked about the greens. You get a better feel for 'em today?   
 AI MIYAZATO: It actually rolls well today, so I think it's better than earlier this week.  
  
  Q. How is the wind playing a factor? Today it's down a little bit.   
 AI MIYAZATO: Towards the end it was pretty windy. It's like almost just a downwind and into the wind, so it was like easy to adjustment with my distance.  
 So it was okay.  
  
  Q. They said that the wind here could really make or break your game as far as the way the course is built. Can you identify with that?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, I think so, because especially green is really big this golf course, so it's makes a huge difference with the wind, you know, second shot.   
 I think I still need to be careful.  
  
  Q. You've got quite a following here. How does that feel to have all these folks come from your country and follow you all over?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I feel very honored with that. You know, it's a good motivate for me, so feeling good.  
  
  Q. Is it a lot more pressure?   
 AI MIYAZATO: No, no pressure. It's been a while. You know, they are following me since like when I play in Japan. They are really nice to me.  
  
  Q. How does that translate to you? I mean, does that kind of make you want to amp up the game a little bit more?  
 AI MIYAZATO: No, not really. I have many fans in Japan. So, again, like I said, it's a really good motivate.  
  
  Q. When you're in Japan do you have even more than this?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I think so. I never counted.  
  
  Q. So this is nothing?  
 AI MIYAZATO: No.   
  
  Q. Any surprises today on the course?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Not really. Like I said, green are really rolls well today, so that's a good things, I think.  
  
  Q. Any changes you plan to make for tomorrow and the rest of the tournament?  
 AI MIYAZATO: No, nothing. Seems like really low score, like many players shooting like low scores, so I think trying to make birdies out there. That's it.  
  
  Q. You always do that though, right?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah. But this golf course is especially wide open. Greens are big. Just try to make some birdie opportunity, I think.   
  
  Q. Good luck.   
 AI MIYAZATO: Thank you.
