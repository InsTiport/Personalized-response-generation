   MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome our leader, Ai Miyazato into the interview room. Congratulations on your round today.
 AI MIYAZATO: Thank you.
 MODERATOR: We talked yesterday about how well you're playing. Kind of go through your round today and what was working well for you today. 
 AI MIYAZATO: Nothing change, but, again, I hit the really ball well today, and my putting was really good as well. I was really calm out there, so that's why I didn't have a bogey I think. 
 So I'm very happy with my round today.
 MODERATOR: Do you change anything going into a final round when you are the leader? 
 AI MIYAZATO: No, nothing. Two-shots leading is still nothing on this golf course, I think. Still so many players can shoot low score tomorrow.
 So I just need to stay my game.
 MODERATOR: I was going to say, when you do look at that scoreboard, there are a lot of names piled up there. Knowing how this course plays, do you expect it to be pretty tight at the end, that a lot people could go low tomorrow? 
 AI MIYAZATO: I think so. It seems like happens every year everyone is playing really solid on Sunday, so that's why, like, everyone is getting close. 
 But I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I'm feeling in good shape. So if I stay focus my game, I think the results are following tomorrow.
 MODERATOR: I know we talked about this earlier in the week, but you got your first win here and you feel comfortable on this golf course. Have you just felt that way all week, very comfortable and enjoying playing this golf course? 
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, I mean, I love this tournament. Since couple years ago I have such a great feeling, you know, at the other tournaments, too. So I have a great memory from my first win. Hopefully I can get the trophy tomorrow, too. 
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. How were the weather and course conditions today compared to the first two rounds?
 AI MIYAZATO: It's still wet on the fairway, but the greens are really receptive. Still you can be aggressive. 
 MODERATOR: Any more questions? All right. Thank you very much.
