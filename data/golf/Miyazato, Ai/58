  Q. Take us through your round. How did you play today?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I played really well. I hit the ball well today -- actually yesterday. Especially with my driver. I just missed one fairway yesterday, so I played really good.  
  
  Q. How you gonna pass the time? You may not play later today, may not be until tomorrow. What will you do with the rest of the day?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I may practice a little bit and go back to the room and maybe take a nap few hours and just relax.  
  
  Q. Did the course change at all with the rain, or was there not enough to really make an impact?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Not really. I thought the green was really soft yesterday, and this morning was pretty much same. So nothing different.  
  
  Q. Given the way you finished up, how much do you want to get back out there and play again today instead of waiting 24 hours?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Well, I can't beat the weather, so if I could start few holes, you know, later on, that would be great.  
 But, you know, I will take whatever.  
  
  Q. Stopping and starting, is that hard?  
 AI MIYAZATO: It is hard. It is hard to make rhythm. But it happened almost every year, you know, at the U.S. Open, so I'm kind of used to it.
