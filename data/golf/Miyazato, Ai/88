   MIKE SCANLAN:  Let's go through your scorecard quick. 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Okay, No. 3, I hit 8-iron to 13 metres, made it. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  How far out with the 8-iron, do you remember? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  127, yeah. 
 I hit the 6-iron with my second shot, and I made six metres for my birdie putt. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  How far was the 6-iron? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  167 yards. 
 And No. 10, I made bogey.  I missed the green with my 7-iron, hit in a bunker, and I couldn't get up-and-down. 
 11, I hit a 6-iron with 160 yardage, and I made eight metres. 
 12, I hit a utility, 4, and I was actually 187 yards, and two metres.  I made it. 
 15, I hit 8-iron to one metre. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  How far was the 8-iron? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  133. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  How far was your putt? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  One metre. 
 And 16, I hit the driver for my tee shot, and my second shot was 15 yards.  I got a good up-and-down. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  How far was the putt? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  It was one metre. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Great round today, 5-under par.  Had to feel good to come out, especially against 77 other of the world's champions and shoot 5-under.  How did you play today? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  My putting was good today.  I maintained my rhythm with my putting, and everything just kind of clicked together.  That kind of a day today. 

 Q.  Were you surprised to shoot so low because the last couple of weeks have been tough? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  The last couple weeks I still played good because my driver shot is getting better, so I'm trying to get my confidence 100 per cent, but I'm still working on it.  It was a great start today. 

 Q.  Do you like this course? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  I like this course, yes. 

 Q.  What do you like about it? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  It's pretty tough, though.  The fairways are narrow and the greens are slopy, but the good thing is I can concentrate on hitting my shots.  The shots felt really nice. 

 Q.  You played really well last year at HSBC Match Play, and although this is not the same event, it was still HSBC sponsored.  Is there something you like about HSBC events? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Yes, I like HSBC tournaments, absolutely.  Maybe they have something similar to each other that makes me play well. 

 Q.  In your previous answer you said the driving had improved and it was just building your confidence again.  Do you feel that this is the last phase, confidence-building is the last phase, before we get Ai Miyazato back? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Hopefully.  Honestly I do feel like I'm better than last year, and things could change depending on how I play tomorrow.  But I do feel that I'm getting back to my normal state, faster than what I expected. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Thank you very much.
