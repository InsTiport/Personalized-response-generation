 Q.  Talk about your play today, what did you do particularly well, and what was the turning point of the match? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Well, it was so hard today because it's windy and tough conditions.  I played well but she played well, too.  Actually No. 15, she hit got on the green and she hit a birdie putt, and my second shot lot of the green, too, but kept it on the green.  Sherri's third shot went in the bunker and impossible to get up-and-down. 

 Q.  What were you doing particularly well today? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  My putting is good, still good from yesterday.  So I had to keep good concentration. 

 Q.  So your focus has been really good this week; why is that? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Well, I played twice in this tournament the last three years.  So I had a good experience.
