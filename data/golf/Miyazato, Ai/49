   THE MODERATOR: We have Ai Miyazato here. Welcome to Carnoustie. Congratulations on last week. You must be feeling very confident coming in here.   
 AI MIYAZATO: Yes, I have very huge confidence right now, but right now I'm just very happy that I could win last week, and now I'm ready for this week.   
 THE MODERATOR: Have you had a chance to play the Carnoustie course yet?   
 AI MIYAZATO: No, that was the first time that I played today, and it was an amazing golf course. I'm really happy to be here, and it was really fun to play.  
 THE MODERATOR: What did you particularly like about the golf course?   
 AI MIYAZATO: The greens are really slopey. You need to really commit with the tee shots, like almost every single shot, every single hole. But everything is going to be different almost every day, I think. But it's really interesting to play.   
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what you did to celebrate after winning on Sunday?  
 AI MIYAZATO: I didn't have time to do anything actually because I need to stay in London Sunday night. But it was nice to have my family over there, you know, my friends over there. We had a very short dinner on Sunday night, but it was really great.   
  
  Q. And have you decided yet how much of your winner's check that you are going to donate? I know you had talked about that on Sunday.   
 AI MIYAZATO: I'm still thinking about it, but I'll donate some of the money.
