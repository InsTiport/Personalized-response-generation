PAUL ROVNAK:  Ai, congratulations, now you're in the third round.  For those of you who have any questions in English, we'll take those now.
Q.  How is playing on the LPGA Tour different from playing on the Japanese LPGA Tour?
AI MIYAZATO:  It's totally different because we are in a different can you try, and also, the level of the LPGA Tour here is much, much higher.

And especially playing in match play, you play one on one, so you feel the difference and it's very competitive here.
Q.  What about the fans?
AI MIYAZATO:  It's totally different reaction from fans and gallery.  I don't know how to explain it in a better way, but what I see is all of the fans around here, they understand the game of golf and if I shot like a good shot or a bad shot, they all, you know, give me applause.  You know, no matter what nationality you are, they all cheer you and encourage you, that's one of great things about here.
Q.  I was just curious how this victory over a Hall of Fame are ranks in your career so far.
AI MIYAZATO:  I feel like I had a good day today.  The first time I saw her I kissed her hand, after that I felt like she was a big wall, it's hard to climb up.  But for me it was just play my best golf, that's what I did today, and I had just a little bit (more) of luck than her today.
Q.  I wanted to ask you about the attention you receive, is it hard to deal with sometimes?
AI MIYAZATO:  When I'm in Japan, I get more attention, and it's really hard.  But here, I don't get that much attention, so I don't have much pressure.
Q.  Who is bigger, Hideki Matsui or you?
AI MIYAZATO:  Matsui.  (Laughing).
Q.  Will you go to Q School this year?  Are you planning on being on the LPGA Tour next year?
AI MIYAZATO:  I will qualify this year, yeah.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
