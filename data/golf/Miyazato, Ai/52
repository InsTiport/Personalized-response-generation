   MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Ai Miyazato into the interview room. Congratulations your round today. Take me a little bit through the round, and coming off yesterday's strong round, another solid round.
 AI MIYAZATO: Finally we have a good weather today, so I'm really happy with that. I played really good today also and hit the ball well and my putting was still really good, so I'm very happy with my round today.
 MODERATOR: Going in now you're two shots off the lead. Going into the weekend, how do you feel about how you've been playing? 
 AI MIYAZATO: I think I my plan is just keep making birdies out there. But also, I need to stay in the present and just to focus my game. 
 You know, the greens are still soft, so everyone can shoot a really low score out there. But I just take one shot at a time and see what can happen.
 MODERATOR: Angela said the pin placements out there today, they were pretty easy pin placements. Is that kind of what you noticed when you were out there?
 AI MIYAZATO: Well she made almost nine birdie today, so that's why she felt that way. 
 But anyway, yeah, some pin position was pretty easier today. But, you know, this weekend it's going to be really hard. You never know what's going to happen.
 MODERATOR: The conditions without the rain, did it make things at least a little easier for you out there today not having to carry the umbrella? 
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, definitely better than yesterday. You know, usually we having this weather, so it was kind of unusual yesterday. But it was really nice today.
 MODERATOR: Thank you.
