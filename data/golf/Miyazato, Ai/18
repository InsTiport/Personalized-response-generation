Q.   So obviously not the ending that you hoped for today.   You guys came into the day at the top of the leaderboard.   What happened out there?
AI MIYAZATO:   Well, we tried our best, but it just didn't happen.   Obviously, it's so disappointing and this is not what I expected for the results. 
But overall this week, we played really solid and the teamwork was like fantastic.   So I'm so proud of my team and I'm really happy that I'm part of this team, too. 
It's going to be good for next tournament, I think.   Everyone's kind of motivated for the next tournament.   It's not the team events, but individually, everyone is really pumped up after this week.

Q.   First International Crown.   Your overall impressions from the week, the event, what it was like to represent Japan. 
AI MIYAZATO:   Wow, it was just an amazing week.   We haven't had something like this tournament since eight years ago or something.   I played in the team event when I was 20 over there, and it has been a long time.
But representing for my country is an amazing feeling, and also at the same time it's so much pressure.   But we like to play under the pressure and we know we can do it.   It just didn't happen.   It wasn't our week, but still we made 10 points and which is good for us and it will be good for the future, I think. 
It was an amazing experience this week.
