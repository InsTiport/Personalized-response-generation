 Q.   So you finished at 3â€‘under; so you had a good back nine?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes, I had a good come back.  
   
 Q.   Is it nice to be back on a course where you've won before?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes, I think so, because I have good memories from a couple of years ago and I love it here.   The golf course is always in good shape.   It's pretty difficult but it's kind of challenging me, so really nice.  
   
 Q.   So lots of happy memories?   
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes.   Even this heat.   But it's the first day, so I still need to be patient out there and try to make lots of birdies and focus on my game tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   The course is looking good to you, lovely condition again?  
AI MIYAZATO:   Yes, definitely.   Just worrying about the weather come, but I can't control about it.   Just focus on my play out there.
