 Q. Talk about your round today. 
 AI MIYAZATO: Today? Which round? 

 Q. Just the craziness. 
 AI MIYAZATO: Oh, my God, it was such a long day. But the third round? I couldn't make some putts. My putt was 36 putt, so it was a lot. Just a little bit tough. 
 Overall I played really good, so, you know, I wish I could finish today, but I can't beat the weather. 

 Q. Have you ever been in anything as crazy as this tournament overall with delays every day?
 AI MIYAZATO: Um, that was the longest week I've ever had, I think, this tournament.
 You know, like I said, I can't beat the weather. It's gonna be a good experience this week. I will take it.

 Q. Are you excited to get up tomorrow and not have a whole tournament? You're right there. 
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, yeah. I have only five holes left and I have been have really great experience this week, so I need a good finish.
