 Q.  How do you feel, you won your first match and you're playing tomorrow.  You're playing Sherri Steinhauer tomorrow. 
 AI MIYAZATO:  I was pretty nervous this morning because becky is a really good player and she's like my size.  She has really good putting and chipping.  So I just try to keep concentrating on my game.  And I played really good today.

 AI MIYAZATO:  Probably four birdies and one bogey. 

 Q.  So do you feel pretty confident with your game? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Yeah. 

 Q.  What's the strong part of your game right now or does match play suit you? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  I like match play.  I get the results right away. 

 Q.  Your strategies for tomorrow? 
 AI MIYAZATO:  Tomorrow, just try to make birdie and don't make any bogeys. 

 Q.  How have you done in the past, what's your match-play record?
