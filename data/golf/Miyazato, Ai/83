   DANA GROSS-RHODE: You had a great round. Moving into second place today. How does that feel?   
 AI MIYAZATO: I feel great. I mean, this is my sixth time at Evian, so I have been playing here for years. I'm very happy with that.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What were some key holes for you today? You only had one bogey.  
 AI MIYAZATO: Um, well, I think my first birdie was No. 3 today. That was pretty long putt, like six meters.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What club did you hit in?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Pitching wedge. That was a really good stroke. It was really tough spot to birdie. After that I could like keep it going after that birdie, so it was good.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. Questions.  
  
  Q. I guess this year do you feel like everything is coming together? You have been out here five years. I know it's been a little bit of an adjustment. You've learned a lot. How has that changed? Anything you're looking at this year?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Not really big different, actually. I had really good experience last few years. It's more comfortable now, so I can like concentrate my game like 100% right now. I have confidence, too.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing for you? What's suiting your game very well right now?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Oh, what's good for my game? My game is getting really simple now. Like hit the fairways and hit the greens and make some putts. So that's the most difficult to do, I think.   
 But most comfortable is my putting. So that makes really good.   
  
  Q. How long have you had your caddie?  
 AI MIYAZATO: Fourth year, I think.  
  
  Q. Everything still going good?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Yup. I'm playing good. (Laughter.)  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Can we go just over your scorecard real quick?   
 AI MIYAZATO: Yeah, and I hit 3-wood and was a pitching wedge again.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay.  
 AI MIYAZATO: And my birdie putt was like three meters. And 10, second shot was pitching wedge again, and it was a seven meter.   
 11, I hit 9-iron and was like four meters.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay.   
 AI MIYAZATO: 13, it was 9-iron, too, and three meter again.   
 15, I hit 3-wood my tee shot and 3-wood second shot and third shot was 7-iron, but I missed the green and I couldn't get up-and-down.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: When you hit on, how far was the putt?   
 AI MIYAZATO: No, just like off the green with my third shot -- no, no, fourth shot. Yeah. And then got up-and-down.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: From how far?   
 AI MIYAZATO: My bogey putt was like two meters.   
 16, I hit 5-wood for tee shot and pitching wedge again second shot and one meter.   
 18, 7-iron on the second shot, and the third shot was 60 yards with 58 and two meters.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What was it like playing with Karrie Webb in your group today?   
 AI MIYAZATO: I mean, it was always fun to play with her, because I played with her at the U.S. Women's Open as well in the first three days. (Translated from Japanese) We had good chemistry, atmosphere.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: How much of your game or improving your game is skills and also the psychology, a balance?   
 AI MIYAZATO: I think 50/50 right now.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. Perfect, that's all.
