Q. What were your emotions today coming to the course for your last time in the final round of a U.S. Open?
AI MIYAZATO: It was nothing changed.  I actually have like a normal routine, like usually I do.  I wasn't really emotional out there because this golf course is so much tougher than you think, especially on the green.  I haven't made some putts since the first round.  A little bit of stress and frustration on the greens.  I was able to play my best out there, so I really enjoyed it.
Q. When the season concludes and you do retire, what are you going to miss most?
AI MIYAZATO: I think I'm going to miss my friends, for sure.  I have so many friends on this Tour.  This is like part of my family, big family.  I have been traveling with them since several years ago.  I'm definitely going to miss my friends especially.
