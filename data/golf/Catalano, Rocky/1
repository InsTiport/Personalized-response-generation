  Q. This is your first Senior PGA Championship. Thoughts about your experience?  
 ROCKY CATALANO: A great event. It's a great event. I had a great time, even though that's the worst golf I've played in years, but I just couldn't get used to the greens. They're just firm and fast and I'm not used to playing greens like that, to tell you the truth.  
  
  Q. You played much better today from yesterday, what do you think was the difference in your mind?  
 ROCKY CATALANO: Probably the wind. The wind's not -- the wind's not as bad today as it was yesterday. I still didn't putt well, but better than yesterday.
