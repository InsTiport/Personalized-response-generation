Q.  What was the difference between today and yesterday?  Besides the obvious score, I guess?
DANNY EDWARDS:  Well I just didn't play very well, didn't score very well, and just didn't play very well.
Q.  Any particular thing that didn't go right, putting, driving?
DANNY EDWARDS:  Oh, a little bit of everything.  Didn't drive very well, didn't play very well, didn't putt very well, just didn't score very well.
Q.  Expecting to make the cut, 5 over, is that right?
DANNY EDWARDS:  I guess I'm total 5 over.  Yeah.
Q.  What are you hearing at this point?
DANNY EDWARDS:  I haven't heard a thing.
Q.  Do you think you can come back and play a little bit better tomorrow?
DANNY EDWARDS:  Well I hope so.  I would like to.
