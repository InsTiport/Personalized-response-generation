 Q.   Congratulations, you're one of the last guys in the hunt to be playing on the weekend.   
KEVIN PHELAN:   I haven't seen any leaderboards yet.   I hope it holds up.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about your second round.   You were 6 over after Round 1.   2‑over now.   The course is playing harder.   What was your key to success at being 2‑over?  
KEVIN PHELAN:   For today?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
KEVIN PHELAN:   I holed a few kind of key putts, 5 or 6 footers the first few holes.   And it definitely helped.   It was pretty soft yesterday.   I made a couple of really good shots on 17 and 18 and gave myself good birdie chances.   I didn't hole them but they were easy pars.   
And I made hard work out of 18.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the fact that I think the cut is going to be at 8 and under.   Three amateurs in for the final two rounds.   What does that mean?   Did you enter the tournament thinking you had a good shot to make it for Saturday and Sunday?  
KEVIN PHELAN:   Just put my attention on each shot.   You have to focus on what you're doing.   It doesn't surprise me that hopefully three amateurs made the cut.   It's great competition in Irish golf and college golf.   
We're all kind of sharp, as well.   We've had a lot of competitive play on tough courses, not as tough as this, but still tough courses.   I think that certainly helps to keep the eye sharp coming in here.   
   
 Q.   Good feeling to be playing the weekend?  
KEVIN PHELAN:   Yeah, yeah.   I'm quite happy to be playing on the weekend.
