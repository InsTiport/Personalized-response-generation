  KEVIN PHELAN:   I was playing well for a while there and going along nicely.

Q.   Few putts to share the lead?
KEVIN PHELAN:   I wasn't thinking about that.   I was just trying to hole the putts.   It s obviously a tough course, so I was just trying to take the chances when I could and give myself birdies chances and take them.

Q.   You played two years ago as 19 year old?
KEVIN PHELAN:   I learned more in that week than the rest of my golfing career combined.   It was a huge help today when I just wanted to stay patient.   When I made a couple of mistakes, my experience of Pebble served me well.   I went back to the patience.
Last week was a tough week as well, playing match play against the Americans in the Palmer Cup.   It was a good standard of golf.   I'm not really thinking about making the cut.   I'm just thinking about hitting each shot as it comes.   That was my only goal this week.   It s not easy but I think I'm doing a good job so far.   It s always nice to be able to compare yourself to the best in the world.   It is the first time I've been anywhere close to them.   But there is a long way to go and I'm just plodding along.
