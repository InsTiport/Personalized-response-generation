Q. 36-hole career low.  How does that feel?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Cool.  Feels good.  I was playing well, so nice to put two good rounds together before the weekend.
Q. To see your name at the top of the leaderboard like this is, what's that feel like?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I'm excited, excited for two more days.  Golf course is great, so really looking forward to it.
Q. What's the course playing like?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   It's playing tough.  It was pretty windy the last two days.  The greens got a lot firmer and faster as the week went on, but it's a lot of fun.  Greens are definitely tough.
A little bit open off the tee, but I'm enjoying it.
Q. The open nature off the tee fit you pretty well?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I think so definitely.  Nice to hit driver pretty much everywhere and have some shorter clubs in, especially with those greens.
So that's been nice.
Q. What's the level of nervousness or comfortability heading into the weekend with your position?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I feel pretty comfortable.  I've played this course before.  I live just about 40 minute way, so nice to sleep in my own bed.  My mom is here, so just enjoying it.  It's nice to be at home, and that's helpful and relaxing.
Q. Did you move down here?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I did, a little over a year ago.
Q. Okay.  What city?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   In Tampa.
Q. Right in Tampa?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yeah.
Q. So you're a local favorite then.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Somewhat.
Q. Kind of.  So you played it just once?  A few times?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   My coach, Justin, is out here, so I come here to practice.  Only played 18 holes once but I've played a few holes here and there.
Q. So you know it.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yeah.
Q. Your way around.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yeah.
Q. Hi.  You moved to Tampa.  Was that to be closer to Justin?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Somewhat.  Just I'm from Chicago so needed a warmer place.  Some friends here and found a good golf course to practice at, and then started working with Justin, too.  So it all worked really.
Q. What is your home club in Tampa?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Avila.
Q. Oh, yeah.  You and Brittany.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yes.
Q. How much of an influence has Brittany been your career?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   She's been very helpful.  She introduced me to Justin and kind of helped me get settled here a little over a year ago, so she's been a really good friend.
Q. I assume you like living in Tampa then.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I do, yes, definitely.  I've been enjoying it a lot.
Q. How is like -- I mean, like I don't want to say it's a home field advantage, but do you feel like the course is changing from day to day?  You were talking a lot about the greens and whatnot.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   A little bit.  Definitely a big difference from Monday to Wednesday.  Not as much from today and yesterday, but a little bit just from the start of the week.  But it seems pretty consistent since Wednesday.
Q. Is that something you feel like you have to adjust stroke for stroke?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yes, definitely.  It was nice to see it playing a little different on Wednesday in the Pro-Am, and just adjust as we go.
Q. Justin said you had a long list of things to work on a few months ago.  What was the most important thing on that list, do you think?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Oh, boy.  I think they all were.  I think there were 17 things we had to work on, so it was a long list.
Q. Wow.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yeah.
Q. What you have trimmed it down to?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Just a couple thoughts.
Q. Seventeen to two?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yeah, just a few.
Q. What are the two?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Just some setup things.  So still kind of feels a little bit uncomfortable with that.  Just have to think about it and it's good.
Q. What's the best part of your game right now?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I'm putting really well.  Made a lot of good putts today, but my chipping probably saved me a lot around this golf course, especially yesterday.  So my chipping has been great.
Q. What did you do during the three weeks off?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   I was here.  Just kind of relaxed.  I didn't know I was going to be in the event.  I was an alternate until last week.  So just kind of practiced, relaxed, got ready for this, and I think I got into the event on Friday.  So, yeah.
Q. And making the most of it.
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   Yes, definitely.  That's the plan.
Q. Have you found any good spots in Tampa, places you like to go to or eat at or anything like that?
ELIZABETH SZOKOL:   It's been hard because of COVID.  I feel like I couldn't really enjoy that part of it as much.
