 Q.  What was that hole in one like?  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: It was pretty awesome.  It as actually my first st hole in one, so that was pretty great.  Landed just past the pin and spun back.  It was pretty exciting.  So great that $20,000 is donated for that.   
 Q.  For you, what was going into the mindset there?  Was there a discussion between you and your caddie?  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: A little bit.  We knew it was soft just with all the rain, so had to land a little bit past it.  Worked out perfectly.
