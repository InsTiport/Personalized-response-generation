 Q.  Ending the day 10-under, what was it like for you in the beginning there, a string of pars, and then take me through the eagle that led to some momentum there.  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: Yeah, I was hitting a lot of fairways and green. Hitting the ball well. Putts just weren't falling.   
And then that eagle on 8, just a par-5. Just had I think another over 225 pin, which was playing about 210, and hit a hybrid just to tap-in distance, so that was great.   
 Q.  What was it like preparing for a whole other course? This a grueling process. What is the mentality you have for this week?  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: I think it's kind of fun playing a different course this week. It's totally different than last week; f bent soft greens, so definitely a different golf course. A little bit tighter off the tee for me. Just being ready for it I think was the best.   
 Q.  You were a 2019 rookie here on the LPGA Tour. What did you learn about yourself and your game to prepare you for a moment like this?  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: Yeah, I learned a lot throughout the year. It was kind of a rough first half of the year and played well the second half. So just kind of learned how to play out there and prepare better, and that's definitely been helpful.   
 Q.  What's the improvements maybe to be made for the rest of the week, and how do you keep from letting it get too a hold of you?  
ELIZABETH SZOKOL: Yeah, I'm just really just trying to chase the top of the leaderboard. I see Muni is playing really well, so just trying to go after that number.   
But just keep hitting fairways and greens and keep staying patient. We still have a lot of golf. Been a lot of golf and a lot of golf left to play.
