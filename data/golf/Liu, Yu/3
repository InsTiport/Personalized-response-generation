  Q. Can you talk about your round today?
 YU LIU:   Yeah, I think it played probably one of the toughest, weather condition-wise.  It was a little breezy on the back nine and it was pretty chilly, so I think I'm very happy about the scores today.
 Q. There's been very few rounds under par today, very few, maybe like 12 or 13, so you must be really proud, pleased with yourself to get in under par, with conditions tough today?
 YU LIU:   I think regardless of the condition, any round under par is good with the setup of this golf course.
 Q. Are you thinking the pin positions are hard, as well?
 YU LIU:   Yeah, the last two.  I think today was pretty normal but the last two rounds were really tough.
 Q. You played the first two weeks, so this is your third week back out.  What were you doing before?
 YU LIU:   I was in Florida at the time.
 Q. So has it been a good first few weeks?
 YU LIU:   Yeah, good first three weeks and really, really appreciated to have the sponsors supporting us and giving us the opportunity to play.
 Q. Do you enjoy playing on a links golf course?
 YU LIU:   Oh, yeah, it's definitely one of my favourite type of golf courses to play, especially Scotland.  This week, it's a very nice layout.  It's not completely 100 percent links.  They say it's kind of American style, but I really like the layout.  I think it's a fair golf course.  If you play well, you get your game there, you're going to shoot a low score.
 Q. Good preparation for next week, as well?
 YU LIU:   Oh, for sure.  Next week, I checked the weather forecast, it's supposed to be challenging weather.  I hope the weather stays like this, maybe just one more day, and then finish off this week first and see how it goes.
