Q. So how has your week been so far?  How has it been doing all the media and having...
YU LIU: It's a blast.  Best week so far, especially it's my first week playing back in home country.  Just everything been great so far.
Q. Is it the most like media attention you've gotten before?
YU LIU: Yes.  Yes, for sure.  I don't got this many in the States.
Q. How was today's round different from yesterday?
YU LIU: It was a lot more inconsistent.  I had to scramble a lot.  I think I did pretty well.
And then towards the end I started to get my shots back, ball striking and everything, so it was all good.  Very happy with the score I turned in today.
Q. Looking forward to the weekend, do you feel like you're ready for posting a good result?
YU LIU: Yeah, yeah.  I just feel like the experience playing with Sung Hyun really helped me, especially with all the fans.  Korea has a lot of pretty crazy fans.
And then just playing with the best players and really helped me prepare into this week.
Q. So you played with her today?
YU LIU: No, no.  Last week.
Q. Last week in Korea?
YU LIU: I played with a lot of very top-tier players, like world Top 5 players.
Q. Oh, really?
YU LIU: Yeah, because I used to not be very comfortable playing with someone that's so high ranked.  Now it's just all about experience.
Q. So you feel like you're in a place where you're comfortable being on the big stage?
YU LIU: Yeah, yeah.
Q. And playing with the best?
YU LIU: Yes.
Q. Becoming one the best players?
YU LIU: Hopefully.
Q. Hopefully.
YU LIU: Yeah.
Q. So you played with Sung Hyun in Korea?
YU LIU: Sung Hyun and Minjee with all their fan clubs.
Q. What was that like?
YU LIU: I was just kind of spaced out the entire round.  I couldn't really concentrate on any part of my game.  My routine was off.  Everything was a little bit off.  Not too bad.
Q. The whole round or just for a little while?
YU LIU: The whole round.  I start off kind of wild and I couldn't get it back.  It was tough course, too.  You have to be really focused on what you want to do.
Q. So maybe you think that helps this week?
YU LIU: Yeah, for sure.
