Q. Okay, 4-under par to start.  Good round out here a little Kingsmill.  How was your day?
YU LIU: It's been a great day for me.  Definitely happy about the scores.  My shots weren't very solid actually, but my putting pulled me out a little bit today.
Just one shot at time and really carry momentum from last week over.
Q. Yeah.  Talk about your best finish of your career at Texas, and then you got off to a great start at Kingsmill this week.
YU LIU: Yeah, it was pretty magical last week.  I didn't expect me to finish that high.  I would be very happy with a little top 10, but never expected a 3rd.
Really happy about it.
Q. Do you feel like that's carried into this week?
YU LIU: Definitely.  I feel a lot more comfortable out there.  Just (indiscernible.)
Q. Yeah.  Are you happy to have gotten your round in this morning before the rain?
YU LIU: I felt like I got a good tee time, a good wave.  Because I kind of knew it from yesterday we're probably going to get a few holes in at least.
I'm glad I got my entire holes in and pretty good score.
