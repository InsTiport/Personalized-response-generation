Q. Yu Liu, 2018 LPGA rookie; back in your home country of China.  How does it feel to be back here?
YU LIU: Oh, it's very exciting for me to be competing in my home country.  For the start of the season like playing in all the Asian swing tournaments was a goal of mine, and now that I have that completed, just very happy to be here.
Q. What has this rookie season been like for you?
YU LIU: It's pretty tough, to be honest.  There is some ups and downs, but overall I'm happy to be where I am right now.
Q. What are you looking forward to most this week playing here and being in China?
YU LIU: Just the competition in general.  So first of all, I haven't been competing in my home country since Blue Bay last year.  This is my first tournament back this year, so just having the opportunity to meet my childhood friends and experience real authentic Chinese food and play this amazing golf course, I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
Q. Welcome back and good luck this week.
YU LIU: Thank you.
