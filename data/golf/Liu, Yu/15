YU LIU: Even par is not a bad score, here, at Blue Bay, especially against such strong wind. But you know, I had a great chance to have a really good score today. I was 3-under par for the first eight holes. I lost my focus then. This golf course is a real monster that can bite you anytime. I need to learn from this and try my best to put together two better scores for the next two rounds.
Blue Bay tests your every aspect of game. You must be long as well as accurate off the tee. Approach shots also need accuracy because of so many slopes on those greens. The rest is your putter. I missed many putts for some reason today.
