YU LIU: You know, I am pretty happy with this score because I just played the pro-am without a single practice round. More practice, more comfortable for me.   
I found out my driver broken in the pro-am with two holes to play. This resort is far away from the Chinese biggest golf markets and I couldnât find the replacement at once. I should thank my sponsor Callaway in Guang Zhou which did find the same club. And I also thanked Lin Xi Yu who came here with the new driver.   
You werenât able to play this golf course with driver. Itâs so long. I had two 3-putts today but you know it could be worse. Last night, we worried about this.
