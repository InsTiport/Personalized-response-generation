Q. How does it feel to put three good days together and put yourself if contention heading into tomorrow?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, honestly I feel like the scores were a lot higher than expected before the week starts.  So this golf course is pretty tough to score.  Yeah, three 69s, very happy about how I handled my shots these three days.
Like my long game hasn't been 100%.  I just scrambled pretty well and made some putts here and there.  Happy to be where I am.
Q. What have you been working on between rounds this week?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Nothing.  Just putting.
Q. Just putting?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.
Q. And do you sense that you're improving day by day with that?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: No.  (Laughter.)  First day I putted the best, and then seconds day a little worse.  No, second day was pretty good; today a little worse.  Yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine too much so I wasn't as concentrated, and today I didn't putt as well.
Q. How will you spend your time until tomorrow's round?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Just putt again without talking to anyone.  Just go to the same restaurants past three days and get a good night's sleep.
Q. You've gone to the same place every night?  It's your favorite around here?
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah.  They took me to the restaurant.  It's a big chain restaurant.
