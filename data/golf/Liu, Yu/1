Q. Yu, what a great round today.  What worked the most for you today?
YU LIU:   Chinese?  Oh.  Yeah, I thought I played pretty steady in the rain, because it was raining quite a bit for the first nine.
Then I was just really taking advantage of all the par-5s and when I hit it close, and I was able to convert all the short birdie putts, yeah.
Q. Compared to last week, what did you work on since last week?
YU LIU:   You know, it was supposed to be a pretty quick turnaround for us, but luckily we got one more day because of the smoke, and I was able to do some swing changes actually.  I just feel like ever since we came back from our break I've been just grinding it pretty hard to find my forms back in terms of long game.
So the last few days was just about doing some tweak to my swing.
Q. You've been almost in nonstop competition mode since we came back from the pandemic.  How have you been relaxing and keeping yourself mentally healthy?
YU LIU:   Honestly I'm just really happy to be back.  You know, especially experiencing that long of a break.  I knew just being back out here it's something that I don't take for granted.  I love playing tournaments.  I love traveling.  Just really enjoy being out here, and it's -- it hasn't really been a problem for me.
Q. That's awesome.  How does it feel to be playing this event and this event still happening despite all the worry that we had earlier this week because of the air quality?
YU LIU:   Oh, man, I just really appreciate all the hard work that's done by the staff and the volunteers this week.
I knew it was very challenging situation, but luckily the weather helped us a little bit by the rain a little bit today.  So, I mean, it's a really pure golf course.  I'm just really happy to be out here, yeah.
