 Q.  5-under round on Friday. What went well for you?  
YU LIU: It was pretty solid compared to yesterday. Yesterday I wasn't hitting a lot of fairways, to be honest. Today was just fairways and I hit plenty of greens.   
It was pretty windy coming in, which made the front nine really tough. It's really gusty. It's hard to judge the club selection sometimes, but I think I did pretty good. Stayed patient.   
 Q.  Did you make any adjustments from yesterday to today?  
YU LIU: Yes. I actually just figure out something on the range about my driver, so I think that's what I just had the little tip on my mind throughout the round.   
 Q.  What was the tip?  
YU LIU: Just something about my swing plane, something technical.   
 Q.  Are you a technical person?  
YU LIU: Yeah.   
 Q.  You are?  
YU LIU: Yeah. I know my swing pretty well.   
 Q.  Does that make it easier for you then to make adjustments if you have a round like yesterday where you're a little off?  
YU LIU: Yeah, definitely. I think it's very crucial to know your swing out here. I mean, it's so competitive that you have to be able to constantly be consistent; knowing your swing helps.   
 Q.  What else have you learned this season? You've runner-up finishes, in contention at majors; what have you learned about your game or maybe yourself?  
YU LIU: Yeah, I would say I improve a lot this year from last year. I had a pretty nice rookie season, but I knew this year I just really want to achieve something higher.   
So, yeah, I worked pretty hard this off-season. Just nice to see my work paying off.   
 Q.  Did you set a specific goal? Get a win or just to be more consistent?  
YU LIU: Yeah, just top 25 on the Money List.   
 Q.  Okay.  
YU LIU: I'm right in the borderline. It's pretty tough I would say.
