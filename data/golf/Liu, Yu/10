 Q.  Maybe not the ending you wanted, but overall your experience here this weekend?  
YU LIU: Oh, it was amazing week for me.  First time being able to play in the final round, first time being in contention.   
Didn't handle the way I wanted to, but feel like there is always room for improvements and a lot of events left this season.   
 Q.  That was a big final group.  What was it like playing against Carlota Ciganda, especially in this final group?  
YU LIU: Carlota, I played with her few times before.  She's very consistent and very long off the tee.  She's been finishing pretty much top 10 week in and week out.   
It's a pretty star packed leaderboard.  To be able to finish pretty high up really gave me some confidence.   
 Q.  Were you looking at the leaderboard as you were coming through or were you more focused on your own game?  
YU LIU: I was looking.  On the last shot I didn't know what to expect because I don't know exactly where I stand, if I needed to make birdies or just save par and get to playoff.   
So I wasn't as focused as I would've liked.  I think that's why I made bogey.   
 Q.  You did have someone waiting for you down here at 18.  Who was that?  
YU LIU: Shanahan.   
 Q.  What did she say to you?  
YU LIU: She was just being very caring.  She said I still have chances left, still early in in the season, a lot of events left.   
 Q.  What was it like to come off 18 and see someone like her waiting for your?  
YU LIU: She's always been a great role model and big sister for all the LPGA players out here.  She's very caring.  When we have problems we can always reach out to her and she's always give us very nice advice based on her experience, based on her like very successful career out here.   
So it's just great to have her out here.
