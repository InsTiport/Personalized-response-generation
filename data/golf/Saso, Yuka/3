Q. Start off as the medalist and then you win 6 and 4 yesterday, 3 and 2 this morning, and 5 and 4 this afternoon.  You're cruising.  How are you feeling right now and what about your game is so on?
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I'm happy that I won three matches now.  Actually didn't expect the result.  It's better than I expected.
I don't know.  Just I'm surprised everything is going well.  But it's match play.  Everything can happen.  So just trying to focus and be ready.
Q. Yeah, now with three matches under your belt, are you becoming more comfortable with match play and the format?
YUKA SASO: I'm not sure about that.  I would like to say yes, but I'm not sure, so...
Just trying to be more comfortable with match play.
Q. Yeah.  You've played in a U.S. Open and some Amateurs before and your fourth Junior now, U.S. Junior; do you think that experience has helped you more than some of the other girls out here?
YUKA SASO: Yeah, like I played few tournaments coming into summer and this is my fourth U.S. Junior, so those tournaments helped me a lot obviously.
Q. Yeah, the win at the PGA, too, obviously.
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I keep learning every tournament, so I think that helped me.
Q. What do you have to do tomorrow now to keep it rolling?
YUKA SASO: Just maybe try to stay on the plan, stick to my plan for tomorrow, like since the first day of the tournament, and enjoy and have fun.
