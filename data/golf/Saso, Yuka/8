So I think it was an exciting round, double bogey all the way to an eagle.  Tell me how you feel?
YUKA SASO: I feel thankful because my shot on the front nine was really bad, but on the back nine I was like refreshed and hitting a good shot.  And on the par-5, hole number 8, that was a really good shot.
Q. Is that where you had the eagle?
YUKA SASO: Uh-huh.
Q. Can you tell me about what happened on that hole?
YUKA SASO: I hit a hybrid for the second shot and then my putting for eagle is like one pin, then it went in.
Q. So your putt was about a flag away?
YUKA SASO: Yeah.
Q. How are you feeling going into match play?  You've done well in stroke play, but it changes now.
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I feel really thankful because my goal this week was to get into match play and I did.  So for the next goal is I think to win the match if I can.
Q. Have you played a lot of match play before?
YUKA SASO: Not really.  I played just Girls this year two weeks ago, and I played there and I lost in round two.  So I want to win more this week.
Q. Do better than that?
YUKA SASO: Yeah.
Q. Are you on the National Team in the Philippines?
YUKA SASO: Yes, yes.
Q. What's that like?  Do you guys travel around a lot?  Tell me a little bit about that?
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I actually travel a lot more than my teammates.  Because they actually just travel when we have team events, but I joined a lot of Asian tournaments, like Singapore Open or something.
Q. Do you enjoy it?
YUKA SASO: Uh-huh.  I really enjoy it.
Q. How long have you been playing golf?
YUKA SASO: Six years.
Q. And you have fun?
YUKA SASO: I love it.
Q. Good.  It looks like you have a big smile on your face?
YUKA SASO: Thank you.  Thank you.
