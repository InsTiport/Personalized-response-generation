Q. So you said you were a little bit nervous about match play.  How did it feel today?
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I was nervous.  I'm just happy for today.  Struggled on the 9th hole, but good thing I got my momentum back on hole 10.
Q. Do you feel like there is any pressure being the medalist?
YUKA SASO: I didn't really think about it.  I'm really happy to be the medalist with the U.S. girls, and being in match play is a little bit different.
Q. Yeah.
YUKA SASO: The tournament is like a different tournament from today.  So just another tournament I guess.
Q. You get to get some rest this afternoon.  How are you feeling?  You've played a lot of golf recently.
YUKA SASO: I'm kind of tired, so I might just rest for today.  Long day tomorrow.
Q. Right.
YUKA SASO: If I ever win the match.
Q. Yeah.
YUKA SASO: So just want to give myself a lot of rest and be ready for tomorrow.
Q. All right.  Good luck.
YUKA SASO: Thank you.
