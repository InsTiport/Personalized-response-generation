Q. Talk us through your play today.  How did you feel?
YUKA SASO:   I felt okay.  I missed a couple birdie putts, but still managed to finish zero, so I think I'm happy.
Q. What will you do to prepare to go back to the Cypress Creek for the next two days?
YUKA SASO:   I'm not planning to change anything.  I'll just do the same.  The golf course is similar, so just do the same.
