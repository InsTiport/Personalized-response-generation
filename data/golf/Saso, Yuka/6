 Q.  Fantastic round out there, congratulations, 69, lowest score of the day.  How do you feel?  
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I'm very happy.   
 Q.  Your birdie on 18, what was the putt like?  
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I was a little bit nervous, but yeah, I mean, I wanted a birdie.  I'm really happy.   
 Q.  What was it like teeing off on the first hole of Augusta National?  
YUKA SASO: Yeah, I was a little bit nervous, but I was just thinking, I want to enjoy this day.  I still have like five more hours here in Augusta, so yeah, I'm a little bit nervous, but it was okay.   
 Q.  Did you sleep well last night?  
YUKA SASO: Yeah.  I was tired.   
 Q.  What was your favorite hole out there today?  
YUKA SASO: Probably 18, because I birdied it.   
 Q.  Did you watch the Masters every year and?  What would be your favorite memory?  
YUKA SASO: Favorite memory, last year when Rory almost win, he's my favorite player.  I'm always watching him.   
But my No. 1 memory of the Masters is 16 where Tiger would chip in.  That's my favorite memory.   
 Q.  Who are you picking next week, Rory?  
YUKA SASO: Rory.  Yeah, Rory and Tiger.
