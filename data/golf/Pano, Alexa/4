 Q.  It's not how you start, it's how you finish.  You birdied your final two holes.  Feel good after everything you've been through?  
ALEXA PANO: I struggled the entire day with everything, and kind of at the end, like, did what I was trying to do the whole week.  So that felt pretty good, to finish on a high note.   
 Q.  I don't think people understand how young you are and how much you can grow over the next couple years.  What do you take from this experience?  
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, I mean, I'm really happy I was able to qualify for this week and even just to be here.  It was a super good experience for me.  Hopefully I'll be back next year and many more years.   
 Q.  What did you learn?  What are you going to take away from this?  Anything in particular?  
ALEXA PANO: I've got some stuff to work on, obviously, fundamentally and stuff like that.  Definitely, just go home, practice harder, and hopefully come back next year.   
 Q.  How wild was the weather sequence this afternoon?  
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, that was really interesting.  I mean, the lightning, we were by the window, and it literally sounded like it was on the front patio.  It was insane.   
 Q.  Did you find yourself kind of struggling to get back in the swing of things after almost a two-hour delay?  
ALEXA PANO: Not really.  I mean, the USGA gave us plenty of time to go warm up again.  I just came back out and, like, made pars, bogeys, and birdies again.  So, I mean, not too big of a struggle.   
 Q.  Just summarize this whole experience in one word.  Pick one.  
ALEXA PANO: I'm going to have to say just awesome.  It was super fun for me, and I'm so grateful for this experience.  I have so many positives to take from this week.   
 Q.  Considering that you competed well above your age level, what's your schedule like for the rest of the year?  How is this going to help with your confidence when you actually do compete with players of your own age?  
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, so my schedule, I do have a couple more USGA events lined up.  I have a Symetra Tour event I'm exempt for next week and obviously a bunch of junior events.  This will definitely help me to prepare for those.  This is the highest level of golf, and it definitely gave me a lot of good experience going into the next events.
