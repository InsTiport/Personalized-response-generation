Q. It was a long day, obviously, but you were fortunate that you got done yesterday, so you really only had to play two regular matches today.  Was that easier that you had a regular routine today?
ALEXA PANO: Definitely.  I'm just so happy that we got it in.  I know a bunch of my friends, I felt awful for them.  They're going to be playing three rounds.  But it was really nice to be able to just come out, relax, do a regular routine.
Q. I know on 16 she had a pretty good putt for birdie, then you obviously came back on 17.  Talk a little bit about that swing there.
ALEXA PANO: I mean, she'd been playing insanely well the whole day, and I felt like it was just one of us on top of each other.  Definitely I think putting was a struggle for me the whole day as my ball-striking I felt really confident with, but I just couldn't get those putts in the hole.
Q. On 17, what did you hit in there?
ALEXA PANO: I hit a choked-down pitching wedge.
Q. To six feet?
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, just about.  That was a pretty nice putt in there, too.
Q. Your thoughts about -- this is your first you've ever gone to a USGA championship, right, quarterfinals?
ALEXA PANO: Yes.
Q. Thoughts about now moving forward, you'll have a regular day, obviously, tomorrow, two rounds, if you can manage to win your morning match?
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, I mean, I'm super excited.  I don't think I'm nervous at all because I think this is going to be one of the toughest matches that I could have.  She was so consistent and so pure out there, and I think if I just keep playing the way that I did today and make some more putts, I'll be pretty good.
Q. The quarterfinals gets you exempt for next year, as you know.  Yeah, so excited for that.
