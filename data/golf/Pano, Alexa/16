Q. That's 19 holes, a little bit of a nail biter there, huh?
ALEXA PANO: Yeah, especially when I was 1-down going into 17.
Q. How did you pull this out?
ALEXA PANO: I mean, I played well basically the whole day, and she played well, as well, so I knew something was going to come positively towards me.  It started on -- what's the hole over there?  I believe it's 13.
Q. You bogeyed 13?
ALEXA PANO: No, No. 12 then, yes.  Everything started on No. 12 just positively when I stuck a shot, and then No. 13, I ended up bogeying, but I still felt like really good, and then it just carried on until the finish, and I birdied the playoff hole.
Q. You hit a nice shot here on 18; how long was your putt?
ALEXA PANO: My putt was probably about 16 feet from what I walked off, I believe.  I couldn't really go straight at the pin, but I was still pretty happy with that shot, and then just left the putt about three inches short.
Q. What do you have to do to get ready for this next match?  What do you have to do better maybe?
ALEXA PANO: I felt my putting was a little shaky in the beginning, not bad in any way, but I feel like if I played the same way that I did on that match, I'll still pull through.  I'd just like to see a few more putts go in, so it's not as tight of a match.
