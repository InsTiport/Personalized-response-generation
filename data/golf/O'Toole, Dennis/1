  THE MODERATOR:   All right.   We'd like to welcome back Cristie Kerr into the interview room.   As we were talking about yesterday, Cristie has a lot of exciting things going on off the golf course, different initiatives.   And we have her here today to talk about one that she's got going on with ShopRite and Coca‑Cola and community partners.   So I'm going to pass it over to Cristie and let her talk a little bit about what's happening today and the check presentation that just took place.  
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah.   I just want to say thank you to ShopRite and obviously Coca‑Cola and Glaceau.   They're my sponsor.   And through ShopRite's LiveRight program we've developed a campaign where you will see pop‑up ads in the stores, pop‑up me actually, cardboard cutouts of me, and different fitness tips and recipes, and you know, kind of little secrets of what I do to stay healthy and hydrated and happy.   
And you know, we've partnered with ShopRite on their LiveRight program, and they've donated a portion of every Vitamin Water or Smartwater or Powerade Zero that is purchased, and they've raised $5,000 for the Cristie Kerr Women's Health Center, so thank you to ShopRite, and it's a pretty exciting program.   And ShopRite's been a long‑time sponsor of the LPGA, and it's great to be able to kind of coincide on this great project.  
THE MODERATOR:   Can you talk a little bit about what it means to have Cristie as a partner and to kind of get this message out?   
DENNIS O'TOOLE:   Sure.   We all know Cristie has a lot of credibility in the health and wellness face, fitness and activities, and we partnered with our brands that fit perfectly with the healthy and fit lifestyle, Smartwater, Fuze, Powerade Zero and Vitamin Water Zero and as Cristie said, part of the proceeds in the display programs that we have in the ShopRites and that we advertise in the circular proceeds from those sales during the month of May went back as a donation to the Cristie Kerr Women's Health Center.   
So we're happy that we can partner with Cristie and bring a program to ShopRite that fits very well with their LiveRight program, so it's a real win‑win‑win program for everybody.  
THE MODERATOR:   And Cristie, can you say just a little bit about what it means for you to be a part of this?   We all talk about how important it is, the healthy lifestyle in your life and what you've done.   What does it mean for you to be associated with this and to help others learn about the healthy lifestyle?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, it's tremendous for me.   Obviously it's been well documented that I was pretty heavy when I was younger, you know, I decided to really dive in and change my lifestyle to become healthy, and through the end of my high school career, if you can call it a career, through the first couple of years on tour I really struggled with my weight and decided to really change my eating habits and my exercise.   And you know, over the next two and a half years I lost over 70 pounds.   
And it doesn't get any easier.   It definitely is a daily struggle, and I tweet about different healthy lifestyle things, and people can go on there and see that, but it's great for ShopRite to have integrated this program, you know, and roll it out during the ShopRite LPGA Classic because it's important for fans to be able to connect with players.   
It's important for fans who shop in the supermarkets to go and be able to feel like they're a part of what we're doing, and you know, to get access to things that can benefit them and things that can make them healthier, whether it's recipe or training tips or fitness or health tips, whatever.   
And you know, with ShopRite's strong base in New Jersey and the Cristie Kerr Women's Health Center being in New Jersey, it's great synergy.   We've treated over 10,000 women in the last 18 months.   So it just works.   It just works together.   
THE MODERATOR:   It's a tremendous effort in the fact that you can use this partnership and benefit that health center which has been so tremendously successful.   If you can talk a little bit about what it's meant for you to see that from the starting point of the women's health center to now treating so many patients and what it's been a part of that effort.  
CRISTIE KERR:   It's crazy.   I never thought I'd be in health care.   With my mom getting diagnosed with breast cancer really changed my life.   And it's kind of put me on like a lifelong quest to do everything I can to try and beat this disease for not only myself, my family, but for other people.   And the health center's only been open for just under two years, and we're going to have treated 10,000 women this year, basically a thousand women each month now, and our receptionists were two receptionists in kind of like a little closet area and now there are six people and now looking to expand.   
So it's pretty crazy in the short period of time that we've grown so much, and it's things that we do like this with our sponsors that really get the message out and bring awareness and let the women know, and men do get breast cancer as well, but let people know that they can go to the Cristie Kerr Women's Health Center, whether they have money or insurance, they get treated or not.   
DENNIS O'TOOLE:   I think everybody that shops in ShopRite knows that they pride themselves on being able to deliver value, and Coca‑Cola we pride ourselves on being able to refresh people's lives.   
Well, the nice things about this program is it really does both when it kind of culminated just this past May in some of the stores we had the Cristie Kerr Women's Health Center mobile testing unit in parking lots of some of the ShopRites where we actually delivered real‑life value to consumers who maybe couldn't afford health insurance to get health screenings for free.   So I think that was really a good sign of a partnership working for everybody.   
CRISTIE KERR:   And my last comment is it's great to know where your money is going.   Anybody that wants to go visit our center can go and take a walk through, see what we're doing; and funds that are raised, like ShopRite's helping us to raise funds, they go to buy new equipment that's for diagnostic and testing, like the stereotactic biopsy machine which we're getting ready to purchase.   We rent it out twice a week now.   
But those are the things that really save lives, and even things on a very small level add up over time, and it's great to be able to not only play for myself on the golf course, but for these different reasons.  
DENNIS O'TOOLE:   And as Cristie had mentioned before, on the ShopRite LiveRight website we're going to be delivering health tips and healthy recipes of Cristie's to consumers.   So every month they can go and log on there and find great recipes and health tips, so it's just another way to deliver value.   And thank you and your trainer.  
CRISTIE KERR:   And I also answer questions on Twitter.   People tell me their inspiring stories of weight loss and healthy living, and it's great to be able to interact with those fans and have a one‑on‑one kind of virtual reality conversation.   And they ask me, what do you do?   Is it hard every day?   Are you tempted to eat badly?   And to answer those questions makes you real.   We're not just professional golfers.   We're people.   
THE MODERATOR:   Well, thank you all for joining us today, and thank you very much for sharing this wonderful partnership.
