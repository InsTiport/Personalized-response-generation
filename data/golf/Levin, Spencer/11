Q.   Birdies, something out of the ordinary, long putts, a chip‑in? 
SPENCER LEVIN:   Not really.   I made a long putt for par on 14 which was pretty cool.   That was nice.

Q.   What was the distance on 18? 
SPENCER LEVIN:   I hit my first putt way by, I probably made about a 10‑footer for par. 

Q.   Yesterday we talked that you had this new hope to make the Match Play, thinking about that today and do you find out tomorrow? 
SPENCER LEVIN:   I don't know, I'll find out after everybody finishes, but it's going to be pretty close so we'll see.

Q.   That was definitely a goal? 
SPENCER LEVIN:   Absolutely.   That putt, if I missed that putt on 18, there's probably no chance, but now I think I was tied for 10th with a few guys.   We'll see how guys finish.   I don't know what I had to finish but I'm sure it's got to be pretty close. 

Q.   I think you were among the few guys, maybe the only guy that has four sub‑par rounds?
SPENCER LEVIN:   Oh, really?   Didn't even think about it.   That's cool.   So that's good. 

Q.   Next week, Northern Trust and then you have to wait to find out?
SPENCER LEVIN:   Probably find out tonight after everybody's done.   I'll find out tonight but I'll play next week and hopefully get into that match play, that would be cool.
