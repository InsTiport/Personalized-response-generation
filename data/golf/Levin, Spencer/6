  SPENCER LEVIN:   You know, you make a lot of birdies out here.   A lot of guys shoot low rounds here, but for some reason, I don't know if it's a mental thing or not, but like I said, it seems to be a place where I usually get my low round of the year.   63, you can't ask for anything more.   I was 1‑over through three, so to shoot 8‑under is pretty cool.   
   
 Q.   Was it frustrating to go even par in that opening round, to know what was out here and know what other players were shooting?  
SPENCER LEVIN:   You know, kind of.   I made a couple nice putts on my 17th and 18th hole, which kind of make you feel a little better.   I didn't really play that bad, I just didn't putt well yesterday.   I probably played a little better today tee to green, but not much.   It's just the putts went in today.  
   
 Q.   You really wanted that last 22‑footer on the final hole.   It looked like it hung on the edge there for just a moment.   
SPENCER LEVIN:   Yeah, it's one of those days that it's going good it'll fall in, and sometimes if it's not going good, then it doesn't.   Yeah, it was a good day.   Things are going good, and you know how this game goes, so hopefully I can keep it up, and 10 birdies I'll take.  
   
 Q.   You've been through a lot in the last three years with physical and personal issues, as well.   Do you feel like you're past everything and you can concentrate on golf?  
SPENCER LEVIN:   Yeah, my hand is better, which is good.   My hand is better, and my attitude seems to be getting better, and I'm starting to enjoy playing golf again.   Anybody can enjoy a 63, but in general I'm enjoying playing golf, practicing and getting out here.   Hopefully I can keep it up, and it's nice to be out here, and it's fun to be playing golf again.
