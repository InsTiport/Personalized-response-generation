Q. Nice clean round of golf today.  Really good playing.  What was working for you out there?
SPENCER LEVIN: I putted really good today.  I made a lots of putts.  And that kind of what makes you play good, right?  So, my putter has been good the last couple days, and that's why I'm playing well.
Q. Is there something about the greens?
SPENCER LEVIN: I don't know.  I really like them.  I don't know if there's a particular reason I'm making putts so far.
But yeah, I like them.  They're a speed you can be aggressive on and, yeah, that's why I've been playing well, because I've been putting well the last couple days.
Q. Obviously, a lot of low scores out there.  Is that something you think about?  Do you feel like you have to keep pace?
SPENCER LEVIN: Oh, yeah, you're looking at the board there, and you know guys are going to keep making birdies.  And I feel like every time I made a birdie, the other guy was making a birdie, too.  And that's kind of playing the TOUR's like that.
If you're making a lots of birdies, there's somebody else who is, too.  So, you just got to keep going and that kind of seems to be the theme this week.  You're going to have to shoot, who knows how many under to win.  So you can't really get comfortable with whatever score you got, you just got to keep trying to keep making birdies.
