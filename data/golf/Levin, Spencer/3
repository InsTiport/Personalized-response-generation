Q. Being in that position, you've been there before, did you take that momentum into this week?
SPENCER LEVIN: I just think I kind of -- I felt since I had a good last round, I was able for me to take it into this week.
I wasn't really expecting to shoot what I shot last Sunday.  It was kind of a bonus.  Like I was telling them, it's kind of nice to not -- I didn't feel so much pressure.  I felt kind of relieved.
So it was nice to not play with any stress.  Haven't done that in a long time.  But yeah, you know, it's just a good round is all it is.  There's three more days.  So hopefully we can keep it going but it's just one day, yeah.
Q. Is there less stress, because even though you're outside, you're still trying to play your way into another bubble, but after that bubble last week --
SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, absolutely, this is a nice stress to have.  It's a lot better than having to go back to Q-School.  Yeah, I'm really happy.  The last few days have been good, since Sunday.  There's up-and-downs in this game.  I'm happy with where I am right now and who knows, maybe I can keep it going.  That would be nice.
