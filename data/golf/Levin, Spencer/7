  SPENCER LEVIN:   Two were bogey and one was a double, so it was‑‑ my driver was the whole deal.   I made bogey on 12 with a bad iron shot, but a bogey is not going to kill you there.   13 was kind of‑‑ I just didn't even hit that bad a drive there and got kind of a weird bounce up in the rough, and I hit the same tree I hit yesterday, and actually on that chip shot, I know I hit it in the bunker but I thought I hit it perfect because I had to land it right on the front and I spun it so good and it missed literally by this far.   To make 6 there was tough.   But I bounced back and made birdie.   That was a buzz kill.   I was still in there after 12, even though I was 2‑over on the back already.   If I would've just somehow got that ball on the fairway on 13, it was probably going to be a different story.  
   
 Q.   What's your takeaway from this as a learning experience?   It's a tough one.   
SPENCER LEVIN:   I don't know.   I just got to find a way to get a little tougher there on the back nine.   That's it.   I've just got to find a way to trust myself a little more.   The mind starts wandering, and it's easy to do.   I tried my hardest obviously, it just‑‑ just got to drive it better.   That's the bottom line.   Today if I would have drove it well on the back nine, I would have had a chance to win.  
   
 Q.   When you say trust yourself more on the back nine‑‑  
SPENCER LEVIN:   Maybe just a couple of doubts here and there in your swing once in a while.   But yeah, I don't know.   I didn't have it on the back nine.   Everything was fine going to 10, and bad swing on 10, bad swing on 11, still made par, bad swing on 13, bad swing on 12.   Bad swing on 17.   
I mean, I knew Tiger was going to play good today.   He always does.   And I knew Rory would play good, too, and Rickie.   I figured everybody would play good like they always do.   I'm not naÃ¯ve.   I knew I had to play good to win.   If I would have shot under par today, I would have won.   I mean, the course is hard, but I knew I was going to have to play well, and under par today would have been a really good round.   That's just the way it is out here.   You've got to have one real low one and then two good ones or play every round good pretty much to win out here.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
SPENCER LEVIN:   Yeah, yeah, man.   I guess so, yeah.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
SPENCER LEVIN:   Yeah, I'm going to try and go get some sleep.   I didn't get any sleep last night, so I've got to try and go get some sleep today.
