 Q. Bad way to finish. But you had it going there in the middle round. A lot of birdies in the middle stretch. 
 SPENCER LEVIN: Did good, did good, made a couple good putts, couple saves. Threw it all away there, but --

 Q. What was the deal on 7?
 SPENCER LEVIN: That was weird. I don't know what happened there. I just came over it, I guess. Pulled it. And 18 I had a perfect drive. And, you know, I was trying to hit the left side of the green. I looked up and the ball was going right in the lake.
 Had about 250 yards to miss left there. And I didn't. And it only cost me a hole shot, which is one shot, not that big a deal. That's a joke, by the way. 
 But it's only a hole shot. Other than that, it's all right.

 Q. Your thought process going in, would you always, given that same shot, would you 100 percent of the time always go for the green?
 SPENCER LEVIN: You gotta. You have to. If you pull that shot off you have the chance to make an eagle. So, yeah, absolutely.
