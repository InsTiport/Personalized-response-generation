 Q. Good start out there today: 4-under, 66. Tell us about your round. 
 SPENCER LEVIN: I played solid today. Got a few good starts. Made a couple good up and downs and putted pretty well all day. You know, that's about it. 

 Q. You got yourself in a pretty good position last week. Certainly had to give you confidence going into this week. 
 SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, it was weird. I mean, I was playing well last week, hitting it great, and just had a weird last day. Just a weird deal. 
 But all in all, I feel like I'm playing pretty good. So I just try to focus on the positive and see if I can put four good ones together.

 Q. Sitting 38th on the Money List. Any more pressure on yourself for that?
 SPENCER LEVIN: Not really. I know I gotta play well. It's not like I gotta hold on. So try and move forward and, you know, trying and keep making birdies and see if I can't put a good full tournament together, not just a couple rounds.
