  Q. Just kind of take us through that last hole.   
 SPENCER LEVIN: I hit a bad drive. That's pretty much it. It's tough when you go in the trap. I hit a bad drive and a bad third shot.  
  
  Q. And thoughts on the day in general? You made a great comeback, got into a playoff. You've got to be happy with at least you're playing great this year?  
 SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, obviously right this second I'm not very happy, but yeah, overall it was a good week. I'm happy about it.   
  
  Q. You've been playing a lot this year. Are you playing Honda next week?   
 SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, I'm going to play Honda, then take Puerto Rico off, I think.   
  
  Q. I know it's tough right now, but talk about being out there with your dad, putting yourself in a position to win. Can you just talk a little bit about that?  
 SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, it's cool. He's taught me how to play since I was a kid. I wish I could have done a little better. But yeah, it was cool having him here.   
  
  Q. You played well. How do you feel about the way you played?  
 SPENCER LEVIN: Yeah, I feel great the way I played. Like I say, I'm a little disappointed this minute. When you have a chance to win and you don't, it's kind of tough. But hats off to Johnson; he had a great week, he's a good dude, and good for him. I'm glad he won; it's good for him.  
  
  Q. When you look back, what's been the strongest part of your week, putting, chipping?   
 SPENCER LEVIN: I played pretty solid. I putted well today. I got off to a good start, which got me in the tournament, which was good. I knew I was going to have to shoot 6-under anyway kind of thinking starting the day. Yeah, I mean, my strong suit this week was probably my putting. I putted pretty well.
