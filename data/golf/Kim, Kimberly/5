MODERATOR:  Okay.  Kimberly, congratulations.  That was a tough battle out there.  First of all, did you feel a little more motivated today from the first hole on than you did yesterday?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah.  I wanted to win from like last night.
Q.  Did you?  What were you thinking about this match?
KIMBERLY KIM:   It was like she's 15, I'm 14.  So like if I lost some 20 year old, it would be like, oh, she's just 14.  But she was 15.  So I really wanted to win.  And I knew her from before.
Q.  From
KIMBERLY KIM:   AJGA.
Q.  We understand the 9th was quite a turning point.  Lindy explained how she putted way past the hole and actually 4 putted.  Did it feel like a turning point for you?  You went 1 up there?
KIMBERLY KIM:   That was just like    that was her mistake, though.  So that kind of gave me the hole.  But I gave her a couple of holes, I think.  I 3 putted on the par 3.  I gave that one to her.

And I missed a lot of birdie putts.
Q.  So you're talking about No. 5 you 3 putted?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah, so par 2.
Q.  To you, what was the turning point of the match?
KIMBERLY KIM:   There was really no turning point, because after I'd go 1 up, she'd always like get it back.  Like she hit it from the bunker.  That was a great shot on her part.
Q.  So she was a pesky little thing there today, huh?  Just staying in there?
KIMBERLY KIM:   She's a great player.
Q.  How do you feel about it?  Now you're going to be the youngest finalist in the history of this championship, which goes back to 1895.
KIMBERLY KIM:   I feel proud of it.  It feels good.
Q.  You'll be playing Katharina Schallenberg tomorrow?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah, I played with her in a practice round.  She was really nice.  It should be fun, I think.
Q.  Questions?

Tell me on 18, you really nailed that second shot.  What did you hit, 3 wood there?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Actually, like hit  the hustle.  It went dead straight.  So it was like that was bad.  That was great.  Actually we stayed best in the naich (nation), but oh well.
Q.  What did you use to chip there?
KIMBERLY KIM:   I used a 56 degree.  But then I missed the chip, and it landed short of the green.  And I still had a 5 footer.  Oh well.
Q.  What were you thinking about standing over that putt?
KIMBERLY KIM:   It was like, oh my gosh, she made her putt.  It was like I can do it.  I can do it.
Q.  Boy, you did.  That's terrific.  Well, are you tired today?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah.  In my mind I'm tired.  But I'm just really excited right now.
Q.  How tired physically are you?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Well, I don't want to move, but oh well.
Q.  How much sleep did you get last night?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Very little, because I was stressing out about this round.
Q.  I had somebody pass me a question.  Does Michelle Wie have any influence on your golf?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Not really.  But I'm really happy that she's playing great.  Like maybe I want to be    I don't know.  Well, maybe I just want to like get where she is.  But I'm going to like play junior golf and then college golf.  Then hopefully I'll make it on the Tour.  But she's a great player.

I wish I was that rich.  15, a millionaire.
Q.  Have you ever played golf?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah.  I played junior golf with her a little bit.  Then she moved.  She didn't move, but she went up there.  And at the Pub Links I ate dinner with her one, my sister did.  And at the U.S. Open I played a practice round with her.  I haven't seen her in two years, I think, until the Open.
Q.  Okay.  Now this is your fourth USGA championship.  This year you played Girl's Junior.  Women's Amateur Public Links, and the U.S. Women's Open.  How does this championship stack up in your experience?
KIMBERLY KIM:   I didn't know it was that big of a tournament until last night on the Golf Channel.  It had its own commercial.  I went wow, this is a huge tournament.
Q.  Have you seen the trophy?
KIMBERLY KIM:   No.  Well, I know it's like a shining thing.
Q.  It's the most beautiful trophy in golf.  It's right behind the receptionist desk outside.
KIMBERLY KIM:   I'd like to take it right now.
Q.  No, you gotta play.  What are you going to try to do tomorrow?
KIMBERLY KIM:   I just hope just focus on my own game, like I remember playing against Tiffany    I played great but I just couldn't do anything.  She was playing better.  So I just hope I play good.  But I can't help it if she does better than me.
Q.  So in your mind what's a big tournament?
KIMBERLY KIM:   It has its own commercial.

(Laughter).
Q.  Outside of this event?
KIMBERLY KIM:   I don't really watch golf.  I was just looking for myself last night.  But they never showed me again.  So I was asking people what I looked like and stuff.  But I never got to see myself.
Q.  That's a shame.
KIMBERLY KIM:   I know.
Q.  Do you think the Women's Open was bigger than this?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Well, there's more camera on me here.  And I think at the Open, they didn't have one of those towers at every hole.  They had it about like every three holes, I think.  So actually this tournament has more cameras.
Q.  That makes a big tournament in your mind?
KIMBERLY KIM:   Yeah.  But at the U.S. Open when Michelle Wie was get viewed at the end, on national television it was like three seconds off.  So that was pretty cool.
MODERATOR:  Any other questions?

Congratulations, that was really a great match.  Good luck tomorrow.  We'll see you in here tomorrow.
