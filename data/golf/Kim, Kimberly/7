Q.  What do you take from this week?  You came into this championship playing pretty well, you qualified for the Women's Open, you had a pretty decent round of stroke play and you beat some pretty great opponents to get to the final.  Talk about that this week will do, not only for next week, but maybe for the rest of the summer?
 KIMBERLY KIM:  Well, I definitely had a good start this summer.  I came from Rolex girls and I came in fifth there.  So I had a good start and I hope that this whole summer I can keep going, no breaks.  The longest break is a three daybreak, so hopefully I just go the whole summer and play my best game and do well.
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Kimberly.  Good luck to you next week at the U.S. Women's Open.
