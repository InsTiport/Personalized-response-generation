THE MODERATOR:   Brittany, 1-under 70 on Jackrabbit.  How did you feel the day went?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I felt like it was really good until the last hole, obviously.  Literally the U.S. Open you can just lose your concentration for two seconds and then make a double within like two seconds.  Super bummed to finish that way.  I felt like I played smart all day, never took a risky chance, always hit it in the middle of the green when I needed to, and overall under par at the U.S. Open is really good, so can't complain, but obviously that last hole is going to hurt.
Q. Talk a little bit about tomorrow; you're going to play a different golf course and where your mind is with that.
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, I'm glad that they moved up tee times.  Hopefully we can get a few more holes in before the weather gets here.  Obviously that golf course seems to be a little bit more challenging than Jackrabbit, so have to be even more patient, even smarter.  Obviously rain is not going to be helpful.  At least it should be warm, which is nice, but the rain really like screws with me.  One little drop of rain on my club it like drives me crazy.  So Missy, my caddie, is going to have to do a really good job of keeping everything dry.
Q. Did you think there was an advantage at all to which course you started on today?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Probably starting on Jackrabbit was an advantage because you could go out and shoot a good score and get something under par and kind of give yourself a good confidence boost going into the harder of the two golf courses, so I think Jackrabbit was definitely a nice way to start.
Q. Not to bring up bad times, but what happened on the last hole?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I just hit it left off the tee and then I proceeded to hit it left again, then short sided and didn't get it up on to the green and it rolled back to me, and then obviously that next shot you don't want to leave it short again, so then you hit it too far and I had like 20 feet to save par.  Just like escalates quickly.
Q. Where was the mental lapse in that?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Just hitting it left off the tee.  My miss is always left, and I had hit a few drives a little bit left, nothing like got me in trouble, so I should have known and my caddie just said I was really quick, just looked like I tried to hit it too hard, which I didn't need to, but it's me.
Q. How have you learned to not push too hard at this event because every American wants to win this one?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Oh, yeah.  I know.  It only comes up once a year, so it's so hard to not put too much pressure on yourself to want to win it so bad, and it only comes around once a year.  But yeah, you just literally got to take it one hole at a time and just kind of see what happens really.
