   JASON TAYLOR: Welcome to Kingsmill. Thanks for coming into the media center. You've had a pretty nice season so far. You won the first major of the year, the Kraft Nabisco Championship. If you would, talk a little bit about the year and being here this week.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's great to be here. We really look forward to this tournament every year, maybe more so the parties or going to Busch Gardens on Friday. But obviously the golf course is always in great shape. It's fun to be back here.   
 My year, started out a little slow, and then obviously with the win, it's kind of motivated me a little bit more to see how far I could take this year and see how good I can actually play. And I'm really excited to win so early in the year, because I have quite a bit of tournaments left to see how much more I can do.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the difficulties of playing well after a big win?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It is really difficult. I haven't really figured it out quite yet. Normally I have a win and the next few weeks don't go as well. It's definitely really hard and something that Annika and Lorena have really, really mastered the art of; they seem to play great every single week, week-in and week-out.   
 I don't know if it's just practicing more or really what it is, but they really know how to do it, so I need to go maybe sit and talk with them and figure out how they do it maybe.   
  
  Q. You talked at the win about Vision 54. How did you find those guys, and what exactly did they do for you?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: There's quite a few girls on Tour who actually have gone to them, so just hearing other players talk about it and just how positive they seem to be and how great they were playing at the time.   
 Marcy Hart was actually the final person that told me, she said, "That's the only reason I made it through Q-School was going to Vision 54."   
 Angela Stanford and I had talked about going and we were looking at our schedules to see when we could go together. And finally I just told her, I can't really wait any longer, I really need to go. And lo and behold, I win the week before I went. It was funny, even if I when I got there, they were like, "We didn't think you would come now that you've won."   
 It was a huge learning experience. There was a lot of information. I talked to them the week that I won and it was a few key points, and when I went to the school it was a lot more information on those three key points really. They are just very positive. When I'm on the golf course and I hit a bad shot, I get really down on myself, and they just have taught me ways to pick myself back up and not really think about the last shot and get focused on the next shot.   
  
  Q. The singing, did that come from them?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It did. Singing, counting, really anything to take your mind off of that bad shot; anything that you personally really like to do that's kind of what you think of. And for me, I love singing, and so does my caddie, so it kind of works out really well.  
  
  Q. Do you have a favorite artist or song?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Lately it's just been country. I've been really big into country like Sugarland or Kenny Chesney.  
  
  Q. What did winning that major do for you mentally?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was a huge mental boost. Obviously you know how I played the last year, and it didn't go very well.   
 So to finally see some of my hard work in the off-season paying off, it was great, and makes me -- even that last shot, just to know that I can it do that on a Sunday under the pressure, to be able to pull off a shot like that and to be able to make that little putt, inside it made me feel really good.   
  
  Q. You talked about fishing in '08.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I did fish. We looked forward to the off-season so much that I just took way too much time off. I took like two months off, which was way too long.  
 So this off-season, I only took about two weeks off and got back to it. I changed coaches at the beginning of the year, didn't go fishing as much; or if I did, I practiced really hard in the morning, and went really hard in the afternoon. So I kind of managed my time a little bit better than the previous year.   
  
  Q. Any swing changes?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: There was a few swing changes, yes. We kind of looked at it as if I was going to have a bad year, do it now and get it out of the way so that down the road, I would not be switch my swing around and getting it ready for Sunday under the pressure that I would be early in my career; so get it out of the way.  
  
  Q. Was that a testament to it?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, swing changes, get everything out of the way, so I won't have to worry about it for years to come.   
  
  Q. What was the big adjustment?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's still the same now, takeaway. I tend to get it a little laid off. So just trying to work on little things like that that just seemed to be -- grip; grip took forever. Now it's a little bit better.   
  
  Q. I guess with the way things have fallen, it's been now two tournaments since your win, does that disrupt the flow or any momentum?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was nice to have a week off after my win, and then it was kind of nice to have just one week where I knew everybody was going to come congratulate me because we didn't have a week after my win.   
 So it was just a lot of girls on Tour congratulating me and just kind of still living on cloud nine for one more week, and then obviously another week off and then got back to it this week. It was kind of nice to have it there and not have this tournament kind of bump back up to it, because I don't know if I would have been able to focus as I need to be going into such a big tournament. It was kind of a blessing that we had the week off and then we only that one week that row.  
 Going in -- I had the worst attitude. We knew going in, if I played well, great. And if not, it was not a big deal. I was just going to kind of embrace the moment and take away as much as I could from it.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about this tournament and what it means?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: This is an awesome tournament. The golf course is always in good shape. I hope it stops raining. I know how much hard work they put in this week to get the golf course ready, and it's heartbreaking for players to see how much rain it's taking in and how hard they are having to work on top of the hard work they have put in for the whole year to get it ready.  
 Hopefully it stops raining. And it's just a great golf course, it's a great place to be. It's a great little town. The fans love to see us come. We love coming and seeing the fireworks show and going to Busch Gardens, and the purse obviously is a huge factor for us to come. It's just the people; it's the town; everything about this tournament, I would never miss this tournament for anything.   
  
  Q. The fact that it's such a great field, everybody likes a challenge, I guess, right?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely. Myself personally right now, I'm trying to get Solheim Cup points, so the stronger the field, the better my chances are if I actually play well; then the more points that I get.   
 So the stronger the fields, the better.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Thank you.
