Q.   Another very good day.   How happy were you to match yesterday and continue? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   It started really bad.   I was 2‑ or 3‑over pretty early in the round and thought it was going to be one of those days because I was in between clubs on a lot of the holes and just wasn't getting the bounces that I had got yesterday.   So it was nice to just calm down a little bit, made a couple birdies and then the back nine I felt like I played really well. 

Q.   So what happened in the slow start?   I know you had two bogeys. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Just a couple errant shots here and there or just 3‑putted one of the holes.   Just bad approach shots and then a bad chip to be on top of it, you know.   But yeah, I felt like the wind today was not as strong but it was a different direction in the beginning, which made it more challenging.   I wish it would switch back tomorrow, because the last couple holes played‑‑ no, that's not true. 
They were easier, I guess, coming in than the first.   The first couple in the opposite wind was very challenging. 

Q.   How big was the birdie on 18?   Obviously to finish is big?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I was super nervous going for it.   I feel like 18 is normally a very short hole and I hit 3‑wood, a little grip 3‑wood, which I knew was going to go long.   When I got there, I thought it was in the rough but it was in the bunker. 
The bunker shot to that pin is not easy but luckily everything came together at the end and the bounces kind of went my way because it landed in the rough which slowed it down enough to just roll it up there to a foot.   But if that would have been the first couple holes today, I probably would have hit it in the water. 

Q.   How far was this putt, just a foot, tap‑in? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yes. 

Q.   Weekend approach? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Hopefully the good breaks keep coming and the wind switches back to yesterday's wind.   But I've played it both ways and I feel like I'm ready for either way.   
But I felt like 15‑under par was going to win the tournament, but it doesn't seem to be going that low, which is good.   I like tournaments where not too many, maybe like five or 10‑under par wins, so just keep doing 2‑under each day, and I'm right there.   I just need that one really good like 4‑ or 5‑under a day.
