Q.   We're here with Brittany Lincicome, congratulations, a great 5‑under round putting yourself right back up there.   Kind of anxious waiting to see how the leaders play out?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, I'm not sure what to do exactly.   I had a great finish.   They're coming in.   I started slow again today.   I don't know why I'm getting off to such slow starts.   If I made a couple of birdies, it would be greater.
I had a great time with Han, and I made a lot of putts today.   It was nice to see the putter working.

Q.   That back nine you got things going.   What was the biggest key, and what got you going on that birdie on the back?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   It was pretty much putting.   I had a lot of eight‑footers to save par.   I was getting up‑and‑down from everywhere.   I was making everything.   So it was not one shot here or there, it was just the putter kind of saving me hole after hole after hole.   Keeping me in contention which was nice.

Q.   You talked about earlier in the week, 54 holes are kind of your thing.   Did you seem to like this event?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Absolutely.   I could dread thinking about tomorrow.   Hopefully we're moving on and we'll see what happens.

Q.   Next week, you're defending champion?   How nice is it when you go back to events like that?   What is the feeling like when you go back as defending champion?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   It's a little different.   Obviously, a different golf course this year.   I feel like I'm playing well.   I played well this week.   Hopefully we can keep it going.   I never defended and won that event the following year.   So that would be really cool.
