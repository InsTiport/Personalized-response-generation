 Q. Overall you've got to be pretty happy with what's happened the first two days. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, more happy about what happened yesterday than today. Just couldn't get anything going. I had 32 putts out there, which kind of means you weren't hitting the second shots close enough or I just wasn't making anything. Hopefully going into the next two days, now we've made the cut, let's keep moving up the leaderboard and keep it kind of close.

 Q. Are you surprised by the way this golf course has been set up?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, because I mean, they're anticipating bad weather, and it's been such a beautiful time since we've been here. Only yesterday was a little bit of rain, but other than that it's been really weird actually. It's really pretty. It's set up the way that the wind and the rain, they're anticipating, but it's just not coming. So the golf course is right there in front of you. It's not easy, but it's not super difficult, either. The greens aren't really fast. So we'll see.

 Q. When you look at your score and you don't look at the leaderboard, would you be happy or unhappy with how you sit?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh, I would be happy, especially going into the weekend. Any time you go into a British Open, all you're thinking is maybe a 71 or a 70, a couple under each day and you should be pretty close, anticipating the wind and the rain and everything. Under par for two days, that's pretty good.
