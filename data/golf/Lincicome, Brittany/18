THE MODERATOR: Welcome back to the Bank of Hope Founders Cup media center.  It's my pleasure to welcome in eighth-time LPGA winner and two-time major champ, Brittany Lincicome.  Brittany, how are you today?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I'm great.  Thank you.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Let's get started.  I understand you have a special announcement you would like to make this morning.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.  I was just notified that two of my sponsors, CME and Diamond Resorts, are going to honor my contracts, even though I obviously won't be able to play a full season, which is fantastic.   
I mean, I never thought in a million years that they would do that.  I feel so honored and blessed to be represented by two great companies that are going to do this.  It's just fantastic.   
THE MODERATOR: What have these past few months been like for you finding out you expecting a little girl and finding out this news from CME Group and Diamond Resorts.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it's been crazy.  Obviously we've been trying for a while, so to find out that we were pregnant again, obviously super excited.  I found out two days before Christmas and told my husband on Christmas Day, which was pretty cool.   
Yeah, I have just been trying to take it easy.  Obviously didn't go overseas.  Trying to do all the right things to make sure we have a healthy girl at the end of this.   
Yeah, my two sponsors, they are just incredible, I'm and truly blessed and honored.   
THE MODERATOR: We've got quite a few moms on tour this year.  Have you sought any of them out this week for any advice?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, because the million dollar question that everybody asks is how long are you going to play for.  I have no idea.  I've never done this before.   
So the consensus is everyone played until they were about six months, give or take.  That'll be through San Fran.  I would love to play Kingsmill.  It is one o my favorite events obviously, my sponsor event, so I would love to play that one.   
Then after that, who knows?  I'm going to play as long as I can assuming I'm healthy.  Just see what happens.   
THE MODERATOR: You played at Diamond Resorts to start off your season, then you have had quite a lengthy break.  What have you been up to?  Have you been playing much?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it's like two off-seasons really because obviously not playing since CME and playing Diamond Resorts.  I have been playing as much as you would think I would play (laughing.)  Just at home with some buddies.  I have done some outings here and there.   
But, yeah, I feel good.  I've been driving it really well.  Which is great especially on a course like this where you can hit it long and keep it out of the desert.   
Just the putter.  Worked on the putting today.  Hopefully comes around.   
THE MODERATOR: I think last week you had the opportunity to spend a couple days at the THE PLAYERS Championship.  What was that experience like for you?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, I got my photo with Rory, so pretty sure I brought him luck.  Hopefully he brings me a little luck this week.  It would be cool to win on tour being pregnant and represent for the moms.   
But it was incredible.  That golf course is so pretty.  There wasn't one blade of grass out of place.  Just to see all the fans and the hospitality tents, gosh, it was incredible.   
But, yeah, it was really cool.  Did a bunch of media stuff there.  Hung out with the First Tee kids and had a great time.   
THE MODERATOR: And this week it's your ninth start here at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup.  What makes this tournament so special?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I love this tournament.  Everyone is so great to us here.  There is something about desert golf, especially when you see it from the aerial view.  The beautiful green grass and the yucky desert, it just makes it look so s beautiful.  Obviously it's a little drier here than normal, but obviously we do drink some water.   
But I love everything about Phoenix.  The golf course is so pretty.   
THE MODERATOR: That's pretty special to see the Founders on their perch finishing on 18.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: That's that like?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's so cool.  Obviously when I was a rookie my goal was to leave the game better than when I started.  This is my 15th year.  To see those ladies, hopefully we're doing them proud.  It's just so cool to see them when you come off 18 and give them a little hug and thank them for starting this wonderful organization so many years ago.   
Obviously having them still come out, it's incredible.   
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up to questions.   
 Q.  Obviously you've had a very successful career.  Can you just speak to what it means to have sponsors support you when paychecks aren't coming in, especially for other players who might not have been as successful as you who want to be moms and are trying to figure out they are going to financially do it all?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it's incredible.  Like I said, I knew I was only going to be able to play a very small amount of tournaments.  When I was speaking with my agent about it they were like, Oh, probably just prorate it and that's how it'll be.  I was like, Okay.  It is what it is.  Obviously we've been trying for a while and you can't time it perfectly unfortunately.   
Yeah, to have them do this, it's definitely a relief.  Obviously I've saved my whole life and we're in a good spot, but just to have a little extra money coming in is truly incredible.  Means I'll enjoy my off-season even more.   
 Q.  Another one, unrelated.  Obviously you won't be playing if the Solheim Cup for good reasons.  I'm curious, there might be some new faces on the team this year; I was thinking about Nelly Korda specifically.  Can you talk about your impressions of her game and what kind of Solheim Cup player she might be?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think Nelly is going to kill it.  She is such a good player.  She is competitive.  She has the whole game:  she can hit it far; has a good short game.  I was actually over in the fitting looking at all the cool clothes just being sad that I'm not going to be able to wear them.   
Yeah, I think the team is in good hands.  I've already been to a couple meetings or dinners and Juli is gracious enough she invited me to the next practice that they're going to have after San Fran just to let me be a little bit of a part of, which is really cool.   
A lot of new faces, but whoever is playing good at the time, I mean, they're obviously playing good for a reason and they deserve to be on the team.  I feel like it's in pretty good hands, especially with Juli as captain.  I mean, she'll lead anybody to the finish line.  She's so great.   
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Brittany?  Okay, thanks very much for joining us, and congratulations on the exciting news with CME Group and Diamond Resorts.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you very much.
