BRITTANY LINCICOME

 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I don't know, you know, I honestly don't know, just one of those days, where I really wasn't thinking, I just tried to hit the ball, and play some golf and try to have some fun.
Q.  You seemed pretty relaxed, were you getting a kick out of everything that was going on?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yeah, a little bit.  There was so many people over there.  I'm just taking each moment at the moment, just having some fun.
Q.  You talk about the eagle, what was going on there, and then the shot, what was going on at 18, those two instances?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  The eagle, I don't even know.  I hit it through the fairway, hit 5-wood in the practice round, and decided to hit 5-wood, it was into the wind or whatever.  And then my second shot, we were just trying to get it on front of the green, it was up in front.  I wasn't trying to hit it over.  And I started crying and everything.

18, I was so nervous coming up the 18th, I was trying to guide it into play, I'm not that kind of player, it was all or nothing, but I hit it left.
Q.  How far was the shot on 15?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I was hitting a punch 7-iron, because I had to hit it under the tree, I don't know how far it was.
Q.  Do you make many eagles?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  No.  Par-5s, I come close, just because I'm a long hitter, but never on par-4s.
Q.  This is your first time trying to qualify, this was?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yes.
Q.  Why did you wait?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I waited just because I was ready.  I didn't want to come in and not play my best golf.  I wanted to wait until I was absolutely ready, which I thought I was this year, obviously.
Q.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, how old are you, where are you from?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I am 18, I play out of Bardmore, it's in Largo, Florida.  I like to fish.
Q.  What school do you go to?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I actually did home school.  I just finished my senior year a couple of weeks ago.
Q.  Do you have any theories on why so many teenagers qualified for the Open that are doing so well?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I don't know, junior golf is really becoming really large, the AJGA is really a good place for junior golfers to go and learn golf, and play against some of the top juniors in the world.  It's really getting big.
Q.  (Inaudible).
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I'm going to turn pro at the end of the year, I'm going to skip college.
Q.  Anything about the way you've been playing or the golf course make you feel that something like this could happen?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I did, you know, I did two practice rounds, which I normally only do one.  Yesterday's practice round I didn't play as good as yesterday, I'm only a one person practice round person.  But if you keep it in play and I hit the ball a long way that I was going to score.  I didn't think I was going to score this well, but I figured it was around par or 1-under.
Q.  Was the course tougher than you thought it was going to be?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  If you hit it in the rough it's going to eat you up.  I think I missed three or four fairways.  And when I did I was in the first cut, so it was okay.
Q.  (Inaudible).
