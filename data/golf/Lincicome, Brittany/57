Q. Talking about you got some momentum going last week.  All those miles didn't stop that.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, gave me a head cold of some sort.  My throat is really hurting.
Other than that, the golf course was really narrow, like I said, so I had to drive it very straight.  Unfortunately I didn't get to hit driver one time at all last week.  I think only three times out here.
But just to hit it straight and learn how to hit it straight for a week.  Then to come out here, the golf course seems a little bit more open.  Then I was putting really well last week, which is great to have it continuing this week.
Now I'm bummed that we have no more tournaments after this week.  It's finally starting to click and we're in November.
Q. How does it feel to get in the hunt?  Been a little while, right?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It has been a little while.  I haven't talked to you guys in forever.  It's nice to be back kind of near the top of the leaderboard and playing well.
Obviously I have a lot of family here being a Florida girl.  I think just their support and cheering me on.  And we rented a house this week so we have been cooking and just hanging out with them.  It makes you feel at home and more comfortable, I think.
Q. So what would it mean to finish strong and end your year with something big?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's been pretty yucky, so to finish even in the top 10 this week would be a pretty fantastic way to cap off the year.  Obviously my sponsor this week, I'm sure they're rooting on me to do well, and I obviously want to do well for them.
Any time I can stay near the top of the leaderboard is going to be a great finish to the year.  One more day.  I just need to kind of get it done and then enjoy the off-season.
Q. How was the Taj Mahal?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was amazing.  It was so pretty.  We had a tour guide and he told us so much stuff we never would've known if we didn't have?  The tour guide.  Definitely worth the trip.
Q. One of the, what, seven wonders of the world, right?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It is, yeah.  Six to go now.
Q. What day did you see that, the day before the tournament?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I did.  I actually couldn't fly in until Tuesday.  Didn't get in until Tuesday night; played the Pro-Am on Wednesday and we went to the Taj Mahal on Thursday and then tee'd it up on Friday.  So I didn't even play on Thursday.
Q. When did you get back here?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Monday around noon.  Flew into Tampa and then drove over.
Q. You had one really cool shot out of the divot on (indiscernible).
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.  I made birdie.
Q. Is that the kind of thing that can keep a round going?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, luckily the divot was pretty flat so it wasn't too bad.  When you're thinking, Oh, man, I just want to make par off this hole and then you turn around and make birdie obviously that's pretty exciting.
Any time you can make birdies out here it's great.  Yeah, it was nice to hit a great shot.  Hit it to like a foot and tapped it in.  Stress-free.  That's nice.
