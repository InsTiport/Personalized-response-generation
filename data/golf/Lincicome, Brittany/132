   MODERATOR: Pretty decent round out there, I think. 11-under, 61. That's the lowest round on tour this year, your lowest as a pro. Tell us a little bit about it. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, the only time I looked at the scorecard was when we made the turn. I knew I was 5-under at the turn. I did not look at my little sign there or scorecard or keep track of anything. When I get done I had to look to see what I had shot today. 
 I was making everything. I think I had 24 or 25 putts today. I think it was 24. It was pretty crazy even for myself. So, I mean, I was making everything, 30-footers, 5-footers. Even when I wasn't -- I mean, you're always trying to make a putt, but even when it was my turn I was kind of rushing a little bit and not reading it and kind of walking up and it and he was making 'em. 
 So just one of those days everything was going my way and I couldn't do anything wrong.
 MODERATOR: You mentioned the 30-footer, and then the up and down on your 18th hole, the 9th, was a tough one. Anything else stand out? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I hit 3-wood like 250 on 18. Flew to the green? I was trying to miss it long just because it's easier from the back of that green because the pin is all the way back there, but never thinking I was going to be up in the gallery trying to hit that chip shot.
 Yeah, that was the kind of putts that I made all day. It was crazy. It was fun.
 MODERATOR: That was like a 12-footer? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.
 MODERATOR: Where was the 30-footer? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I don't know. There was 11 of 'em out there. 
 MODERATOR: Just kind of a haze? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. I mean, it started off on my second hole today, 11, the par-3. I made like a 30-footer and then Morgan made hers. I mean, it was pretty crazy.
 MODERATOR: I mentioned on the way up here that you're 18-under in your last 36 holes. You made a run at it last week on Sunday. What's going so well for you that you're putting up these number? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Putting, I guess. Even last week I felt like -- obviously, I mean, you have to hit the fairway and then the second shots. My second shots were pretty awesome last week to give me the 5- and 10-footers for birdie so I could make 'em.
 So same thing today. I mean, this golf course is way harder than last week. Last week I felt like off the tee you could hit it anywhere and you were okay; this week you have to be more precise. 
 So I was driving it really well, which obviously helps. It's not too long of a course, so I have kind of mid-irons and wedges out there, and I was just hitting everything really good. 
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. I know you birdied all of the par-5s. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Except one of 'em. I didn't birdie one of 'em. It was my only 5 on the scorecard today.

 Q. Did you go for all of 'em? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Um, no, because the one -- yeah, 18 I went for. There was one of 'em where I pushed way -- No. 5 I pushed it had way right and I was in the rough and had to layup.

 Q. Is the putting something you've been struggling with?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, actually, I mean, this year on tour I've been putting really, really well all year. Not like this. This is you just step up and hit it and they're going in.
 Haven't been working or had a lesson in almost a year now. It's more kind of my buddies at home. I found a couple guys that I've been practicing with. Just to play with the guys, I mean, they're so much better than us girls normally. 
 It's great to practice with somebody that motivates you and wants to make you better. It's been great.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Today all I was thinking of was Val Skinner. I had dinner with Val Skinner last week, and she said, My low was 61. I'm like, Oh, well, excuse me, you know, since my low was only 64. 
 So that's all I was thinking today. I'm like, All right, come on. We get to beat Val. (Laughing.) 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I don't remember. I actually just had to look that up to see. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: This is the best by far. This was pretty crazy.
 MODERATOR: Going all the way back to juniors? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I was thinking Annika, like 59 or something. That would have been sweet. That's pretty crazy.

 Q. Did you have any par saves?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No. Par saves? I mean, I didn't really have any that were -- two feet was probably my longest.

 Q. Did you have any pars where you could've had birdies?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Not really. I mean, they were all pretty -- I mean, other than the par-5, parring that one par-5, I mean, that was probably the only mistake I made all day. 

 Q. Saves for birdie? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I mean, I hit it in the fairway bunker on 18. It was our 18th because we started on the back nine. 
 But I hit that to like 15 feet and made it.

 Q. (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. 

 Q. How do you play those?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I mean, you just kind of adapt to 'em pretty early. I mean, we kind of noticed that yesterday that things were releasing a little bit more than normal. Normally, especially if I have a wedge in my hand, I can suck it back about five feet, and they weren't doing that. So obviously I learned a lot from yesterday's practice round, and just played for it today. Just played for everything to kind of release today. 
 I think I say the last month or whatever I think I've been struggling because I've been above the hole so much lately that I've been trying to keep it below so you have the uphill putts and you can be more aggressive. 
 It's helping. 

 Q. It seems like a strange question, but in our area we have a guy named Lincecum who is pretty well revered.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I wish we were related. That would be awesome. Free baseball for the rest of my life.

 Q. You're seriously going to go play tennis?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, we played tennis twice already this week. We've been playing a lot of tennis on tour. There's a lot girls. I can't even name one because there's more than one. We played in France this year. 
 It's just more cardio, to get out and run around for an hour or two hours. We all hate working out. It's boring. So we kind of more just go and run around. I've taken actually two lessons now, so I'm getting pretty good.
 MODERATOR: In Bell Micro you are Homerun Derby champion.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yes. 
 MODERATOR: Think you could hit Tim Lincecum? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No. Probably not. I keep saying to my local Rays, because I'm a huge Rays fan and I know a couple of the guys. I'm like, Will you please pitch to me this off season? They're like, You're not going to be able to hit it. I'm like, I can at least try.

 Q. You've never met Tim Lincecum?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No. That would be sweet though, because then I wouldn't have to change my name. It's pronounced the same. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, his is spelled like one letter or two letters different but pronounced the exact same. It's crazy. I guess there is a writer, Bernie Lincicome, in Chicago maybe.

 Q. Denver. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I'm not related to him either.

 Q. He spells it the same way. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. That's funny. 
 MODERATOR: Anything else? 

 Q. How do you approach tomorrow?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: That's a great question. I mean, just going to go out and try -- I don't think I've ever led this early in the round. I'm going to have to do some research or call Val. She can help me. Just a kind of what do you do? You play so well the first day. 
 Obviously I'm going to go out tomorrow and try to do the things I was doing today. Not going to anticipate making 11 birdies. Just try to go out and make birdies when I can and not make mistakes. 
 Fairways and greens are going to be key. 17, I drove the green on 17 yesterday. If it's downwind I can hit 3-wood; if it's into the wind I hit driver. 
 Today I'm like, We're playing too well. Let's layup. So I'm learning how to get smarter in the way that I think on the golf course, which is good. It's only taken six years. 

 Q. You hit the ball a long way. Have you always done that?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. Always hit it far, yeah. Been naturally blessed. That's with tennis. I just want to hit it hard.

 Q. If you were playing baseball you would be a pinch hitter.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, absolutely. I'm too slow. I played boys' baseball growing up. From home plate to first base I'm not very fast. That's the truth, though. 
 Thank you, guys.
