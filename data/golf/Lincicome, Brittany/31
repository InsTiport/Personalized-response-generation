 Q.  Brittany, we've talked a little bit about what you're going to be up to next week, playing in the championship.  How are your preparations for that week?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know me, so pretty much the same.  I did a lot of fishing last week, and playing here at the Marathon Classic, getting ready for it.  But it's pretty much the same.  I'm trying to take it as a normal event and not putting too much extra pressure on myself.   
I'm praying for no rain.  That's about it though.  But I'm just going to go and have a good time.   
 Q.  We heard a story about Lizzie Win, the little girl you've been staying with all this time.  She's not a little girl anymore.  She's out here playing in this event.  How much of an inspiration do you think you've been to her?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh gosh.  This is my 12th year staying with them, and it's so cool.  She was like six or seven years old playing junior tournaments when I first came into this event.  Now to watch her finish high school and onto college and finally get an exemption into this event, it's like a dream come true really.  She's been following me for so long, and now to be playing with her in this event, it's pretty cool.
