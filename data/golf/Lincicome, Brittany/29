Q. How good are you feeling going into the weekend with where you've put yourself?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know, my goal going into yesterday was to shoot 68 each day, and I think I've done that two days in a row now, so I guess it's going the way I wanted it.  But I started out so hot on the front nine, and then to kind of clam up a little bit and not make any birdies on the back and one bogey is kind of disappointing.  But under par on this golf course is really good for me because I don't get to hit a lot of drivers, and it's sneaky tight, so I'm pretty happy with that.
Q. What was working for you early here today?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Everything really, driving it in play, hitting it fairly close, making a few putts here and there.  Made a few putts to save par actually, which kept the momentum going, which was nice.
Q. Do you think the afternoon groups will have a tougher time or easier time today?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Probably a little tougher.  Later in the day the greens get a little more bumpy and a little more firm.  If you can't land it short, you're in trouble, so I think it'll play a little tougher.
Q. Do you think it'll play like that this weekend?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Probably.  Firm and fast, I like that.  Yeah, especially coming into the greens, you have to really be careful and land it short on a few of them and then kind of play for the bounce.
Q. Did you get the chance to talk with Lizzie last night about what her experience has been like?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know, I didn't talk to her all that much.  When we come home, we don't really talk golf.  We ate lasagna, and somebody gave her an Edible Arrangement, so we kind of devoured that and just hung out.  If anything, I would just tell her just to have fun with it.  This is her first time.  I can't even imagine the pressure that tee shot had to offer, and it's kind of a cool feeling, though, so good for her getting through it.
Q. I want to ask you about next weekend.  How much are you looking forward to that?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Super.  Super nervous but really looking forward to the opportunity.  Obviously getting a sponsor invite really means a lot for them to think of me, and just going to go have fun with it.  I'm playing well this week.  I don't think I hit very many drivers unfortunately to kind of get ready for next week, but that's my favorite club in the bag, so I think I'll be all right.
Q. What did you think of (indiscernible)?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh, my God, incredible.  I was watching it, and all these negative comments on Twitter about, oh, the golf course was too easy.  You still have to get the ball in the hole.  Like 31 birdies doesn't happen by accident.  I think it's amazing.  I thought it was great.
Q. How did this thing come together to play in the Barbasol?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, Tom Murray, the owner of Barbasol PureSilk, called me a couple months ago and was like, hey, I have a sponsor invite; I would love for you to accept it.  I thought about it for a day or two and finally told him yes.  Yeah, so it was kind of out of the blue.  It wasn't something I kind of went looking for.  He just kind of thought of me, and I feel very grateful.
Q. Is it something that you maybe thought about five years ago?  We've seen other golfers do it.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, you know, definitely always in the back of my mind but never did I think that I'd actually have the opportunity.  Like I said, I've never actually told my agent to pursue it or go find something to let me do it, so when it came my way, I was excited but super nervous.  Obviously I've seen Annika and Michelle do it, and now everyone is like, oh, you're going to be the first one to make the cut.  I'm trying not to put pressure on myself, but that would be pretty cool.
Q. Back-to-back 68s; you said you'll take that any day.  How do you feel as you're sitting pretty close to the top of the leaderboard?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I would take four 68s.  This golf course is sneaky hard.  You look at it and you're like, oh, the length isn't too bad.  But you have to keep it in position off the tee, and there's a lot of angles and you've got to carry some stuff or maybe lay up short on some stuff, so keeping it in play is definitely key on this green, and I just got lucky and I made a few putts today.
Q. You've been here a lot.  I think I heard perhaps 12 consecutive times.  Tell us the story about the young lady you're staying with, Lizzie, and some excitement in her life this week?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I think this is my 12th year staying with them and coming to this event, so I know this golf course like the back of my hand, and it's so great for Lizzie to get to play.  I tried to get her a sponsor invite last year, talking to Judd and kind of put it in his ear a little bit, so for him to give her a sponsor invite this year, it's pretty cool.  Like I said, I've stayed with them since she was six or seven years old, so she's been following me or being my standard bearer the last couple years, hanging out with my group, but now actually getting to play inside the ropes, I can't even imagine how stressful that first tee shot was for her.
Q. We don't want to look too far ahead.  You've got two more rounds to go, but next week you're looking at Barbasol.  When you get to take on the boys, are you going to be a little nervous?  How do you feel going into next week?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Super nervous but excited for the challenge.  I've been so much of my career, and this is just another exciting thing that I get to try, and just looking forward to hitting some drivers and trying to keep up with the guys.
