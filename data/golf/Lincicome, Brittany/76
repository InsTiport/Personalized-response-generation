Q. You gave her a hug and kiss, and you're all smiles right now, but you have to be emotional inside?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Super emotional.  Gosh, we've played that so many times.  The first time it felt fairly easy because I thought I was so far out of the tournament, that I never had a chance.  Hitting the 5-iorn into the hole the first time, I wasn't nervous at all.  I'm standing here, physically shaking like a leaf still, and it's over and I'm still shaking.  So it's just how nerves get to you.Q. The second playoff hole you had a chance to get there in two and you didn't, why?BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's getting colder and a little into the wind back there.  The only club I could hit was 3-wood, and that would go over the green.  My wedges have been so good all week, that I hoped to wedge it up there close and make the birdie then, but didn't.Q. Is it tough beating one of your best friends?BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's tough.  Obviously, it would have been nicer to make a birdie and make a par, and set our ways that way.  But she's won so many times and it's nice to be out there with her playing the hole over and over again.Q. It's time to get your team together.  Everybody choreographed and take your leap into history once again.BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you.  It's going to be cold.
