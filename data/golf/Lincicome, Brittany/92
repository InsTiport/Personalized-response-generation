Q.   Some other players were saying the pin placements were a little harder, but what did you see on the course that gave you such a nice round today? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   You know, I was putting well.   I made a lot of good putts out there.   I think I had 27 putts today, which is always good.   Anytime you're in the 20s it means you've probably had a good day.   I hit a lot of greens and the few that I missed I had little putts just off the greens, so didn't have to stress about chip shots or anything.   Hit the rough a lot off the tee, but overall I was hitting it closer today than yesterday and putting it pretty well.

Q.   Did you notice much of a difference in yesterday's round in terms of like on the course?   Was it soft still? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   No, obviously playing in the morning as opposed to the afternoon.   The greens are a little fresher, more fresh.   So I think that's obviously an advantage.   The earlier you can play, being one of the first ones out, the greens were a little better, but the fairways and everything were the same.

Q.   They asked you before the mindset coming in from last week, great tournament overall.   What was your mindset heading into yesterday and today? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Just to try to keep it going.   Obviously, when you play well, you want to keep it going, and not backtrack a little bit.   Obviously, there is a little bit more attention looking at you than normal just because you did play well the previous week. 
So it was nice to get a good round in today, because yesterday was just kind of I felt like I was having a great time.   I felt really confident when I stepped up on the first hole and just nothing really kind of got going.   It was just a very smooth kind of day.   So it was nice to get some putts to fall today.

Q.   Overall level of confidence right now? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Really high.
