  Q. How did you feel after today's round?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yeah, you know, the first tee my hands were shaking.  It was an awesome feeling.  It was fun to go through.  Tried to get the first match out of the way.   
  
  Q.  You were disappointed?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yeah. I wasn't hitting the ball well.  I was working on some things.  Felt a little bit off all week.  Kind of all fell apart.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you'll pick it back up together?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  We're going to go back out and cheer everybody on and head out to the range.   
  
  Q.  You're heading back out with the rest of team?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Looks good on the board for you guys?
