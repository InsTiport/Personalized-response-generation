Q. So what factored into your slow start?BRITTANY LINCICOME: I hit almost every single fairway today and if I didn't hit the fairway it was like this far off the fairway.  It was just the irons, was not hitting the greens. We went into the back nine and started our $5 birdie game and my caddie said, "We are just hitting the greens."  She said, "You are 1-under hitting the green on the second shot.  So we are trying to focus on hitting the green regardless how far away it was from the hole and we're just going to focus on that the rest of the day."Q. What was your $5 birdie game?BRITTANY LINCICOME: On the front nine Korda and I were like, this is ridiculous, let's start a $5 birdie game.  We were both 2-over.  So we could sing the $5 foot-long song from Subway.  We were like, the purse is probably like $500,000 but we don't care about that. She birdied the last two, so we were even.  And then we shot 3-under so we were like, oh, okay.  I don't know if that's a strategy for tomorrow.  Weird out here, superstition.Q. So you had some cool things leading into the event, the NASDAQ --BRITTANY LINCICOME: And then the Mets.  I don't think I'm ever going to be invited back to do anything fun.  It was a great week. Obviously we do golf every single day and to go away from the golf course, to go to the NASDAQ, to go throw out the first pitch, what an incredible experience.  It's like a dream come true.  You play golf every day, why not get to go see a little bit of the city and get to walk around and see the chaos down there and do some cool things while you're there.Q. Who did you meet from the Mets?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Michael Cuddyer.  He caught my pitch.  And the jockey.  It was crazy, we walked by him and I'm like, oh, look at that little kid.  We got to go the owner's suite which was pretty amazing.  The owner (Jeff Wilpon) knows a couple of the girls and he was asking if I knew hem and of course, I knew all of them.  Baseball and golf just goes together.Q. How did you figure out he was the jockey?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Somebody had mentioned it to me actually.  Molly over here said, "Who is the kid you took a picture of?"  When I had walked by him, the guy had taken me down stairs like in the players' locker room in the bullpen to practice before I threw out my first pitch because I was so nervous. He came out and was like, that's so-and-so.  And I was just like, it's not like me to normally ask for like an autograph or take a picture or anything, but I thought it was so cool.  So he walked by and I was like, can I get a picture.Q. Did you watch the race?BRITTANY LINCICOME: I didn't.  No.  My mom flew to West Virginia to have a party for my grandmother, though.  Like a hundred people came over to her house but I missed it.Q. So how was your first pitch?BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was right down the middle.  I got done and my hands were shaking.  My fiancÃ©e is like, "What is wrong with you?" I was like, "There's so many people there."  And Juli Inkster was there, they were all there watching, and if I would have thrown it in the dirt or not thrown it from the mound, I would have never heard the end of it.  So it was more pressure from my own people than the 30,000 people watching.Q. What was the crowd reception?BRITTANY LINCICOME: They loved it.  Especially when I went to the mound they are like, oh, God, this is going to be bad.  But they thought it was cool.Q. When is the last time you had thrown a baseball prior to that?BRITTANY LINCICOME: I've thrown out the first pitch five or six times now.  So it seems to be pretty regular but each time before that I'm always home.  So I go and train at a baseball rehab facility, and they have a mound out back and I always practice.  This time I didn't do any practicing so I felt really nervous.Q. How did those nerves compare to the playoff at the ANA?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Pretty darned close, which is so silly.  Just the way my brain I guess works, you know.Q. What do you think of this event, this venue?  It's something completely new?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it's pretty incredible.  The golf course is awesome.  It's in great shape.  It's a major and playing long and fast which is right up my alley.  I feel like I'm in pretty good shape right now.Q. Some of the players are saying that the course was playing kind of slow earlier this week.  Has it sped up?BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think we got some rain -- like the fairway speed I guess?  They are not racing super a lot I guess.  That would be accurate, yeah.  Green speeds are fast.
