Q. Tell us about the bunker shot there on the playoff hole?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know, it crossed my mind that I could hit it thin and it could go in the water, but it was plugged, so I didn't really think I would catch that much ball.  I thought I would hit it fat and hit it on top and have like 180 to the hole.  But apparently I'm better than I thought I was because I caught it really clean.
So it was one of those things.  It was either try to get it down on the bottom or hit it in the water.  So I was happy to make a par though.
Q. Talk about the emotions of this week?  What was this week like for you, and how disappointing is it to come off not having the win?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, you know, it would have been really cool for Lizzie Win to get in the field and be my housing and for me to get the win, but I haven't been in this position since the Bahamas really.  So this was kind of cool to feel the nerves again.
That putt during the first round I was shaking so bad.  I had to take so many deep breaths.  So it's kind of cool to have those nerves, but learning how to play through them after 12 years of being a pro -- 14 years of being a pro, I still haven't figured it out, so that's a little disappointing.
Q. Are you going to be thinking about that putt on 18 in regulation?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, I mean, it caught a lot of the hole, so I feel like I hit a pretty good putt for how nervous I was.  I really haven't seen one that aggressive in a long time, so that was just unfortunate really.
Q. Did you feel the crowd behind you on that playoff hole?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, for sure.  I felt like all day I was kind of talking with them, trying to be chatty.  Anytime you can get the crowd on your side, I feel like you have a better chance.  So everyone here is so friendly.  I see so many familiar faces because I've been at this event so many times.  So definitely having them on my side really helped.
Q. No matter how many times you win or how many majors you win, are nerves still there?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I was thinking about it today, those last couple holes coming down the stretch for the men's event next week, I can't imagine how nervous I'm going to be if this is how nervous I am in Toledo, Ohio.
Yeah, it is what it is.  Juli Inkster told me if I wasn't nervous, I'm not human.  So you just don't care.  I still have the drive.  I still want to compete.  I still want to be the best that I can be.  And I guess if I didn't have the nerves, I should probably give up the game.
Q. So are you going it straight to Kentucky or what are the plans?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I have to go to Chicago for an outing right now for tomorrow.  Then I get to Kentucky tomorrow.
