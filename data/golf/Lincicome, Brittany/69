Q. It was a match between long hitters.  You guys are a dynamic match to watch today.  Michelle, first time playing with Brittany as a team.  What was it like for you out there and what needed to be a little bit better?
MICHELLE WIE: I thought we made a really good team.
Q. It seemed like Team Europe always had a little bit more control.  You guys were always trying to fight back to get in the match.  Is that perhaps the difference?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was.  We needed one or two more putts to go our way or one or two more kicks.  We're definitely not getting the number of bounces out there.  But it was really close.  We had a great match.  We both fed off each other's energy very well.  We drove it well.  Hit a lot of good putts, just didn't go our way.
