 Q.  Tough finish here, obviously.  But what worked really well for you, it seemed, Angela, you had a couple of big putts there, especially on 16.  How good did that feel?  
ANGELA STANFORD: It felt good to see one go in.  But I watched Bam make a few earlier.  I knew if I could just get it rolling on line, it would go on.  She did great today.  We fought to the end.   
 Q.  Angela mentioned you had a couple that were rolling.  How good did it feel out there for you, particularly?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it was nice when we finally got on a little bit of a roll and got a couple back-to-back there, which was nice.  Because it kind of started out really slow in our favor.  It was nice to get it back little bit.  We brought it on 18, when we were 3-down at one point, so that felt good.  But obviously it didn't go our way.   
 Q.  Finally, headed into the afternoon, what do you think, USA strategy?  
ANGELA STANFORD: I think now we've got nothing to lose.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I get to play every hole, I'm excited.
