   BRITTANY LINCICOME: Kind of a waste of a round to an extent. Felt like I was playing really well, hitting it really well, and then just one bad swing kind of put the kink in things and then you're worried you're going to hit it right again, going to hit it left again, so you kind of guard against hitting a bad shot.   
 So had a bogey and a double and a bogey all in a row, so it was nice to kind of finish with the eagle and the birdie on the last two to kind of at least get some good positive energy going into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What was the one bad swing?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I three-putted one -- well, it was technically off the green, but it was a putt. So I three-putted 11. And then 12 was a par-3, and I'm not going to say the word shanked, but it was pretty close.  
  
  Q. Off the tee?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. Par-3. Tried to hit a really little 6-iron instead of just pushing it with a 7 full and ripped it up there. But it was right in the tall stuff and then I hit it in the bunker and I hit it over.  
  
  Q. Very uncharacteristic shot.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
