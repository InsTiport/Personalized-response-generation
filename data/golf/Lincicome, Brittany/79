 Q.  What can you do to get those putts to start dropping?  BRITTANY LINCICOME: That's a good question.  I'm not a big practice person, and I keep going to the putting green, taking a few extra putts at the end of the round, just trying to figure it out, and maybe today's strategy is just to go home and do nothing.  But definitely hitting it well, which is fun.  When you know where the golf ball is going out there, it obviously makes the day a lot more stress-free, and just a couple shots here and there.  I felt like it was really close.  It could have been a really good round, missed a couple out there, but all in all, a really good round.  Under par on the weekend is good.   Q.  You've been in this situation throughout your career.  What do you take from those experiences into tomorrow?  BRITTANY LINCICOME: Especially here, just, I mean, it's a golf course that I really enjoy playing, and since I'm hitting it really well, there's no reason why I can't be standing on 18 holding that trophy come tomorrow.  I'm just going to go sleep on it tonight, just tell myself we're going to keep the confidence and the patience.  Obviously there were a couple times out there where I was trying to get ahead of myself.  I was in between clubs on every single shot out there, which is obviously very frustrating, especially when you have wedges.  You hit 300-yard drives down there and you have a wedge in your hand but you're in between clubs and you have to take the longer club because you don't want to put it in the wrong spot and it's 20 feet from the hole.  So just don't let those kind of get to me and take par as it is and make the birdies when we can.
