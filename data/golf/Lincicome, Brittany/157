   MIKE SCANLAN: Brittany, great round out there. You finished at --  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: 66.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 66. 6-under par. So clubhouse leader, and it's gotta feel really good right now. Just talk about your round.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was surreal, really. Ji, the girl I was playing with, it was like Match Playing, nine holes straight. She was on the 31 birdie and I would top. I would make one and she would come on top of mine. So it was really just a fun day.   
 I was hitting the ball really well, keeping it in play, which has been a little bit of a struggle lately, and then putting, I was making almost everything I looked at.   
 It was downhill and we were lagging, and the greens were getting fast towards the end. So it was fun to be in the leader circle and be here with you guys.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Questions?   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: The greens are really good. They're really, really pure. They're starting to get a lot quicker.   
 The putt on my last hole was straight down wind, down green, and my caddie was sitting there, and we were just hoping it would breeze on in and see what happens. They're getting pretty quick. They're holding pretty good actually.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think -- obviously I don't know what the afternoon is going to do, but I would say the afternoon might not be as slow because they're starting to get a little bit firmer and they're really fast.   
 But who knows. We'll see. I didn't feel like there was a problem with taking it at the pin or flying it to the hole. They were really receptive and just downhill to watch out for.  
  
  Q. How difficult has it been to get through the stretch?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's been tough. I switched coaches. I just yesterday I'd already signed up to go to the Vision 54 school and I calculated yesterday, and I just needed one size going into the next day four days. Next weekend and work with them a little bit.   
 So just -- it's really getting out of my own way. If I hit a bad shot, it takes me five holes to recover and get it back to where I'm calmed down and relaxed enough to make another birdie. So I'm finally hitting it really good and thinking positive, which is really helping.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Today was just really breathing, trying to take a long, slow breath and stay relaxed, and if I felt like I hit a bad shot, I kind of went to a happy place, like a positive spot, a pet or my fishing. Or my caddie, we would start singing, anything to keep my mind off the bad shot that I just hit.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, not with 66. But really anything around par. Obviously it's a major, so it's going to be playing long. The rough is going to be thick. Even par or one or 2-under I would have been completely satisfied.   
 If you would have told me that this morning, I would have taken it and ran. Really that was pretty much it. Just hit one shot at a time, and try not to get too mad at myself if I hit a bad shot and kind of work on that a little bit.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible question).  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: "Biker" is my dog, and I'm into country right now, so it was really anything country.   
 Sugarland is my favorite though.   
  
  Q. What kind of dog do you have?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Rottweiler. He's my 100-pound lap dog.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible question).   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. Last week I felt like I was hitting it really well. There was a little bit more open last week than this week. So you could kind of miss it a little bit more, but I felt like I really hit my driver well, and just worked on putting this week to get ready.   
 And Angela Stanford and I did quite a few putting drills to get ready, so -- (laughs). Which really helped out today, so hopefully we're going to go do those in a minute.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: All right. Now we have to do your scorecard.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Do we have to do that on the mic? One was eight feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Are you starting on 10 or 1?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: One. Sorry. No. 1. One was eight feet. Two was about eight feet. Three was a bogey. I three-putted from like 25 feet.   
 Number four I made like a 20-footer. Number five, par-3 was 12 feet.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Are you making these up?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: No. 10.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I'm not good at really, I know what hole it was.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: No. 10.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No. 10 was my first hole of the day. That was like eight feet. Number 11 was the par-5. That was probably 10 feet.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey on 14, par-3.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I hit it over the green. Tried to hit a flop shot and it was like 20 feet.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: 15, birdie.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Was 15 feet.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: 18.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: 18, I was on the green in two and was probably 20 feet.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Two-putt?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Two-putt, yeah.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: What club did you hit in, do you remember, on 18?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I hit a hybrid.
