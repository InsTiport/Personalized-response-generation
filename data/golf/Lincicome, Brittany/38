Q. Brittany, the music started, and you've got good reason to celebrate with a round of 65.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was great out there.  Me, Jess, and Brooke just had a good time.  We were feeding of off each other's energy and just having fun.
Q. Between you and Jess you were 17-under par.  You shot a 65 and you're four off the pace going into the weekend.  How tough is that?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: That is tough, you know, but it's fun.  We're just having a good time out there.  It's fun to see all the circles on the scorecard.  I made an eagle today, which is really fun.  Actually missed a three-footer on the 1st hole for eagle.
But, yeah, it was fun.  You know, it's just nice to see the ball going straight and the putts going in.  To be the second event of the season, that's pretty cool.
Q. Excellent.  And you can take the putter to bed with you.  It's been your weapon this week.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, for sure.  Only hit 13 greens today, so definitely need to hit more greens tomorrow.  Take a little stress off myself for making all the wonderful putts, and hopefully we have more birdie putts.
Q. I think you deserve some mango sticky rice after this.  Have you been loving it this week?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely.  It's just so fresh.  It's so much better than the States.  I can't get enough of it.
Q. Foot massage, mango sticky rice coming your way.  Keep playing brilliantly.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you.
