  THE MODERATOR:   Good afternoon, thank you very much.   With two players on Team USA who are making their fourth trip here.   Brittany Lincicome and Morgan Pressel.   You're surprised by that Morgan? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Way to make us feel old.   I said I finally feel old because this is the first time that I don't really know anybody on junior team. 
(Laughter.)   The first year I haven't known anybody.   So‑‑ but I mean because this is my eighth year on TOUR and we're at Solheim Cup so it's great to be here.
THE MODERATOR:   There was a little bit of jumbling out there of the pairs in the practice round today.   Can you give us a sense of how the course is playing and who is playing with who and how it's all working out right now? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Wouldn't you like to know.   We can't spill our secrets.
MORGAN PRESSEL:   This is great.   This is the first chance I got to play the course.   The course looks great.   It's really a great golf course.   Especially it's all about the second shots on this course.   The fairways are fairly generous, but it just get it most of the time in the middle of the green and you keep it below the hole and you got an uphill putt because they're very quick and you can get short sided and have a straight down hill chip pretty quickly.
So it's a lot about placement and I think it will be exceptionally exciting in match play.
THE MODERATOR:   Morgan, you made a big, big charge to make this team.   4th at the British Open.   Give us a sense of what that was like for you internally battling for a position to come play here yet again. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I wanted to be here, I didn't want to miss it.   It's nice to be healthy, to be able to feel like I can hit the ball where I want to and can hit shots that I'm comfortable with and I've just been gradually playing better and more confident and I think it's a good timing. 
THE MODERATOR:   Brittany, did you and the rest of your teammates not named Morgan silently root, saying, she went 4‑0 was unbeaten the last time and say we need her? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Absolutely.   I told Meg, she needs to be a pick, Solheim would not be the same without Morgan here.   We wouldn't have ribbons, any team spirit whatsoever.   So regardless of where she was on the list, I think everybody on the team was going to root her in or get her in. 
THE MODERATOR:   How much a part of all that is Solheim Cup week?   In other words, the rah rah, the team camaraderie, the ribbons and all that stuff is just as big as what happens on the course? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Absolutely.   I don't normally wear ribbons or face paints and stuff like that, so when it comes, this week, this week, every two years, I mean it's, there's nothing like it.   It's an honor to put on the red, white and blue and kind of the crazier you get the better and it's just, I love this week.   This is, if I wasn't on this team, I would be at home right now crying myself asleep because it's, I never want to miss it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Glad that's not happening.   Let's take some questions right here. 

Q.   Morgan, Meg said last week that your clubs didn't make it from Scotland to here.   How did that all play out? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Clubs, clothes, I didn't really get much.   So we were here for a couple days and I had actually left to go back home before my clubs made it.   And Callaway was incredible.   I got a backup set the day I got home.   And I actually left my clubs here so I didn't have to worry about them flying again.   I knew they were here and that I could get them when I got here.   So I am playing with my set that I've been playing with all year, but I was able to practice with a backup set that Callaway made overnight last week. 

Q.   The clubs stayed here all week?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Right.   And one of the girls who works with the event put it in my room with a bow on it. 
(Laughter.)   That was the best present I've ever got, so. 

Q.   Morgan, kind of a Denver question that may or may not bring back some memories, but Cherry Hills, how long did it take to get over that?   When did you learn from it?   And even now can you believe that happened? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   It was such a great week.   I think I've, after eight or I guess almost nine years past it, I don't really feel the same emotions that I did the week of.   And I just, it was a special week as an amateur to really have a chance to win a U.S. Open. 
And Cherry Hills is such a great golf course.   I was excited to many come back and play in Denver and the crowds were fantastic at Cherry Hills and I'm sure they will be even louder and stronger out here. 

Q.   And then as a follow‑up, beating Annika at the Solheim Cup, which I think was your first one, how big a moment in your career was that? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   That was a crazy match.   It was, to play Annika in Sweden in the singles of the Solheim Cup was and to play as well as I did was quite a treat.   Arguably one of the best, arguably the best woman to ever play the game and to take her on in Sweden and I remember I was so excited on Saturday evening when I saw that pairing and nervous at the same time, but excited.   There weren't, nobody had many expectations for me, so I was able to just go out there and play my game and was able to come out on top. 

Q.   Could you guys both talk about what was the thing as a rookie Solheim Cup player that most overwhelmed you? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   The feeling on the No. 1 tee that I was going to be physically sick.   I think that was probably a good one.   Sherri Steinhauer told me that and she was dead on.   That first tee shot, even to this day, I mean even come Friday it will be, there's nothing like it.   It's different than a U.S. Open, different than a Kraft Nabisco, there's just so many fans and you want to do so good for your team and for your country and there's nothing like it. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I didn't have to hit the first tee shot.   I was playing alternate shot with Natalie and she hit it.   So I escaped that in my rookie year, but it was playing over in Europe as Brittany and I both did on our first team it's so different than playing here so you're almost a rookie again when you come back to the states.   And you feel the rush of the crowd and everything else.   It's just, it's just a lot of fun. 
It's golf.   We all know how to play golf and we all know how to hit the fairways and make putts, but it's different because it's a team and you're cheering for each other and you study the golf course together and think about how you want to play the golf course and it's kind of like you've got 12 players who are the best in the country, all trying to get together and have the best game plan. 
Sometimes it's overwhelming, but we really feel like we have had a great time so far this week and I think that the rookies are adjusting well and it was funny because today on nine we were walking up I said, let's get the crowd going, and Jessica goes, okay, show me how to do it.   And I was just like, just ask them to get loud and they do it.   And it was a lot of fun. 
So that was kind of a cute moment as a rookie Jessica asking us, so how do I get the crowd into it?   But it was so mild out there today and she thought it was great.   The crowds were awesome, but it will be a hundred times better come the weekend. 

Q.   Talking about, you talk about it's a different experience playing in the UnitedStates.   What do you think both of you what do you think are the primary reasons why you've never lost on U.S. soil, the U.S. has never lost this event on U.S. soil? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Our fans?   I remember my first time and there was a handful of people cheering for us and then obviously when you come to the states and you have every single person in the crowd cheering for you I think it just gives you that little bit of extra push that you need and obviously we have a great team, every year we do and we just bring it and obviously the fans backing us, I think that really helps. 
THE MODERATOR:   Does the fact that you haven't lost on home soil add pressure or provide comfort? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   We lost last time, so that's going to be our motivation.   We want to get that cup back pretty bad.   Obviously being in the States it's just going to help us give us that little bit of edge that we need to kind of pull it through come Sunday.
THE MODERATOR:   You talked about the youth.   I want to throw out the experience conversation briefly.   25 years experience in the Solheim Cup for the UnitedStates, 17 for Team Europe.   Does it matter at all?   Over rated?   More experience.   You guys are more experienced on paper in number of Solheim Cup appearances. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I don't know that it really matters.   It sounded pretty when you say 15 to 17.
THE MODERATOR:   25 to 17.
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Well we have got rookies on our team too and sometimes the youthful fire is even more important than the veterans who have played out here. 
Cristie, I think this is her seventh cup, so sometimes the ones who are itching to get out there and who haven't experienced it before sometimes just hit shots that they have never hit before and it's fun. 

Q.   You don't get to play a team event or events very often, what adjustments do you have to make, to remember the rhythms of playing with a partner, the strategy, those kind of things. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I think it's great because obviously a lot of us girls are really close friends and we kind of know what makes each other tick and we know how the games that we play with them week in and week out. 
So we know what their, the shots that they like are, we know weaknesses and so we can help them out on the golf course.   Me on the golf course the more I talk the better I play.   So they know that.   So they will be chatting with me a lot, which will be good. 
We know each other's games good and we can give that extra motivation to say, hey, we're 1‑down, but we can still do it.   We're not giving up and just kind of give them that extra kick if we need it, I guess. 

Q.   Obviously Laura's not in the European team and Juli is not on your team and you got Lexi and Charley.   Does it feel almost like a new year that golf's women's golf's maybe getting younger?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I thought we were very young walking the fairway today.   I don't know about you.   But I know this is our eighth and ninth years on tour, but I swear it felt like just yesterday when I joined the tour.   So when I'm going off and fans are just asking for our autographs, I'm like, I remember just being a Junior Solheim Cupper a couple years ago and asking for people's autographs. 
So it is a bummer that both Laura and Juli are not here and I was hoping that the captains would do the whole pick both of them on their team.   That would have been really neat.   But I definitely feel like our teams are way younger each year that goes by they're getting younger and younger. 
THE MODERATOR:   Final question for each of you.   This is your opportunity to maybe look within and see what you have.   Let's start with you Morgan 7‑2‑2‑over all and I mentioned the 4‑0‑0 at Killeen.   Now that you're on this team what's the biggest thing you add to this team in your mind? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Hair ribbons, I guess. 
(Laughter.)   Hair ribbons and tatoos.   I don't know. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Sparkle. 
(Laughter.)
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I think I'm an easygoing person.   I feel like I can play with anybody.   I have a versatile game in that sense where I hit it down the middle and it's not going to go as far as some of the other girls, but I can keep it in play and sometimes that's important in both alternate shot and best ball.   You need that. 
So, I don't know, I love match play.   I love playing out here.   I love the Solheim Cup.   I love playing for my country and I think all that plays a part in why I've played so well in the Solheim Cup in the past and I'm looking forward to hopefully a great three days.
THE MODERATOR:   A lot of people will want to play with you, partner with you.   Bam Bam? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Love playing with people that make a lot of birdies.   It's kind of the same.   I love match play as well.   My first win was a match play event and being a longer hitter obviously some of the par‑5s out there I would love to try go for in two.   Couple of them are pretty long, but still, if my partner's kind of down there safe I would love to be able to try to knock it up there and do something crazy.   Match play's so great, if you make a big number on the hole you're still 1‑down you go to the next hole and try to get it back.   I think that just, like Morgan said, we're both kind of go with the flow, easy to kind of get along with and I think that will kind of help us going into the weekend.
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks for coming in.   We hear there's ping pong and corn hole. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Oh, I love ping pong. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I'm a photographer, I don't play. 
THE MODERATOR:   Well keep it going on Twitter.
