 Q.  There was some pretty epic scoring out there today.  What was the key to playing well in round one?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, I drove it well, which is obviously key on this golf course.  It's being a longer hitter, so I have some shorter irons into the greens.   
If you're not in position and in the rough, the greens are very challenging.  My putter was great again today.  I think I had 27 putts, which any time you're under 30 it's pretty great.   
 Q.  You've had a great start to the year.  What you did you do in the off-season to get yourself set, picking up a win early on?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Same old, same old.  Went fishing most days and didn't practice very much.  Just enjoyed the down time.  We play 27 or so weeks a year.  It's nice to go home and do nothing and hang out with family.  That's pretty much what I did.   
 Q.  And managing the heat this week, it is difficult.  What do you change in terms of your preparations in such hot weather?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Lots of sun screen, lots of Pedialyte, and definitely carrying the umbrella.  It's so hot that you just try to keep in the shade as much as possible.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about your approach shots into 15, 17.  Those pretty on pointe?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.  Again, it was just nice that I was hitting the ball straight and I knew kind of where it was going today, which is great.   
Obviously with the jet lag flying this far you never know how the first couple days are going to go, and I felt like my game was pretty spectacular.   
 Q.  Have you been sleeping all right?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Been sleeping great.  I don't seem to have a problem with that.
