BRITTANY LINCICOME: That was nice.  It was just a side lie, ball below my feet.  It was either going to go right or left.  I was praying it would go down the middle, of course, but I guess the ball has a mind of its own.  Was just happy to get it on the green, actually.
Q. Could you sum up the whole day for us?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: The whole day was good.  I'm driving the ball pretty well.  Some of these holes out here there are a lot of bunkers that are right in my way, right in my landing zone, so we're kind of being a little more aggressive than I feel like we probably should be.  But so far since I'm driving it well, we're just going to keep doing it.  I obviously have a lot more wedges in my hands than most girls, so I need to take advantage of those.
Q. Your clubs arrived (inaudible)?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It actually happened last year when we were in Canada, I didn't get them for like two or three days.  Luckily, this was only just one day.  But it was good.  I was debating on coming out and practicing or just taking the whole day off all together, and that kind of made my decision for me.
Q. When did they finally come?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Just the next day.  I was supposed to land Monday night and they came Tuesday night.
Q. You said yesterday that your putting at Solheim Cup had been some of the best it's been in a long while.  Has that continued into today?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It did, yeah.  There were a lot of holes out there where I felt like I putted pretty well.  You know, I seemed to be making the five-footers or the comebacks for par, which is really huge.  Kind of keeps the momentum going through the round.  Hopefully we stop knocking them that far by and we keep putting well.
Q. How is the course playing compared to yesterday?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: The course is great.  The greens weren't as soft as yesterday afternoon, so we tried to take advantage of that as much as possible.  But the course is in great condition.  It's so green, the fairways are so perfect.  The greens are perfect.  Everything is awesome.
Q. What is the game plan for tonight or between now and tomorrow?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, I'm going to go take a nap after I leave you guys.  Shocker, I know.  My caddie is going to make pizzas from scratch tonight, so we have that to look forward to, which is obviously very exciting.  We'll hopefully get to sleep in a little bit before my round tomorrow.
Q. Even though it's not the same course, you've won here before.  Do you get a good feeling when you come back?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I do.  The Canadian fans and the fans that come out to this event are just incredible.  They're always so cheerful and so supportive.  I try to feed off their energy.  I had a lot of little girls out today that were high-fiving me when I made good shots or walking from tee to green.  That obviously puts a smile on my face.  The airplanes that keep flying around, I keep staring at them all day, so it's kind of distracting me a little bit, which is good.
So with the fans, the little kids and airplanes, I feel pretty comfortable.
Q. What are you going to have on your pizza?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: That is a good question.  Normally I think sausage and pep Reno, and then this mascarpone, which is like a sweet cream which is super weird.  Everyone's like, oh, my gosh, what is that?  But it's delicious.
Q. It would be a contrast?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, my caddie found it at the British Open a few years ago, and now it's a whole thing.
Q. (Inaudible)?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: She's in a house, I'm in a hotel, so we'll go over to her house tonight.  That would be impressive in a hotel though.
