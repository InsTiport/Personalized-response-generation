Q. Very pleased to be with the Killer B's. You have made it around this golf course.  How pleased are you to be back in the clubhouse?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I only went through one glove today.  I felt like it was a win for us.  The golf course was really wet but we fought through and had a good time out there.
Q. Nice to play together?
BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, it's always good to play with a friend, especially on a crumby day.  The weather wasn't as bad as I anticipated.  Wasn't too wet, wasn't too windy.  Tried to hit when the wind was down and wasn't raining too hard.
Q. The rain started to come down a little bit more but that certainly hasn't deterred either of you.  You're very much in contention going into the weekend.  Was it great to wake up this morning and go, we're playing together today, because the weather is going to be atrocious, at least we have each other out there?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely.  We can feed off of each other and when things aren't going great, it's always nice to look over to a familiar face.  She always putts a smile on my face.  It was fun to kind of get through the round, and we're happy to be done.
BRITTANY LANG: It is.  It's always fun, you know, you're joking, walking up to the fairway; you're joking when she's tapping in.  It always is fun because it's not normal.  You don't normally play like that.
Q. A few birdies today, not as many, though, as when you played together in the Solheim Cup, where you were just ridiculous out on the golf course.  How good are those memories from Solheim?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I tried to feed off a few of those today but I only had one birdie all day.  1-under, even par on this golf course, I'll take that the next two days and go home very happy.  So it was pretty awesome.
