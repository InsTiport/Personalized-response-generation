   MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey 1, first bogey of the tournament.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I wanted it get that out of the way and not miss a one-footer, but I snapped it left and kicked back out into the fairway, but I had 175 yards to the pin under a tree. Had to go under a tree. Punched a 4-iron and almost got out of the bunker, but ended up in the bunker and hit it to about two feet and couldn't make it.   
 9, I was in the rough on the left and hit it on just the front of the green to like five feet and pulled the putt. With a 6-iron I tried to get out of the rough.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: 11-under par, one stroke off the lead going into the final round. If you would, talk about the day, even par, couldn't really get too much going, but do you feel satisfied with what you've done so far?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Not at all. Pretty crappy again like yesterday. I just could not get a putt to go in. I don't know if it's the greens or I'm over-reading them or not being aggressive or what it is.   
 But definitely going to the putting green after this and work on it, try to figure it out for tomorrow, because I'm hitting it good. I'm hitting it close, 10-footers, every once in awhile you should be able to make one, and it's not even touching the hole.   
  
  Q. Does it give you a feeling like you're a little stuck in the mud?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Kind of. I feel like I'm hitting it really good. Today I didn't hit it as good as yesterday but I know where it's going. It's rolling about five, ten yards; I'm hitting it good. And the putting, from Thursday to today, I don't know what happened.   
  
  Q. The fact that no one seems to be running into it, does that give you more confidence going into tomorrow, people shooting up and falling back?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's a hard golf course. I mean, the rough is really thick. So if you miss it by an inch, you're pretty much punching out. It's pretty difficult and obviously the greens are hard, too.   
 But I'm pretty thankful to shoot not very well on the last, but to shoot even par today and to still be near the top of the leaderboard is fantastic. Hopefully go out tomorrow and make some putts and play like I did on Thursday. Hopefully the weather is good. I hear it's supposed to be cold. I play good in bad weather.   
  
  Q. How many birdie chances got away on the back nine?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Nine? At least two; the par 5s, I should be able to get to both of them in two, and missed the fairway on both of them. I mean, it's just -- all you've got to do is keep it in the fairway and you can go for the green, both of these greens in two and 2-putt and get out of there.   
 I don't think I've ever parred 36 holes in a row, though, that was a pretty good accomplishment.   
  
  Q. What did you play the par 5s, even?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: 1-under.   
  
  Q. That's terrible.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No. At least two, if not three, are reachable, if they are downwind.   
  
  Q. So you feel like you should be taking a little bit advantage of your length?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely. My old coach and I always talked about par was 69, because if I could reach the par 5s in two, there's no reason should why I shouldn't be shooting under par. Hopefully take advantage of them tomorrow. I kind of said that today and it didn't happen. Let me go back to the putting green and see if we can work on a few things.   
  
  Q. 18, did you reach that in two?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it was the same yardage as when I eagled it. Wind wasn't as down, might have been the perfect 3-wood, I was just in the rough again.   
  
  Q. Since you won Nabisco, you're a major winner; do you look over your shoulder to see who is there?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Obviously it's getting tighter and tighter; if I keep shooting bad round in a row. So just go on and stick to my game plan. Like I said I'm trying to birdie all of the par 5s, maybe if I can up another one here or there and see what happens.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Brittany, thanks so much.
