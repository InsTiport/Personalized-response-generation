Q.  Talk about your round.
BRITTANY LINICOME:  It was a great round.  I did have a lot of birdies.  Don't know if I fell asleep or what happened but one hole, I picked the wrong club and ended up short in the bunker.  Was totally the wrong club either way.  Thought I hit it good but came up a little short.  Took all the momentum and everything out of me.  Took me a while to recover and I almost went back to even going to nine and she messed up a little bit and I went 2 up so I got it going on the right track after 9.
Q.  In general, you have to play in the afternoon now.
BRITTANY LINICOME:  I'm used to it now after playing last week at the Open.  I'm young, 36 holes isn't really big deal, so I hope to play the whole 36.
Q.  Any close putts?
BRITTANY LINICOME:  2 was probably ten feet.
Q.  And 11?
BRITTANY LINICOME:  I was right up in front.  I hit a driving iron right up in the front and chipped it up to two feet.
