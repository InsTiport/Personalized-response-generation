RHONDA GLENN:  Tell me how you played?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Terrible.
Q.  So what about that?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  No, I'm hitting the ball so good right now, I'm not scoring well, the putter let me down a little bit.  I'm going to go work on that.
Q.  You played a great round one, that was a bonus?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  That was.  I played a good round 1.  Round 2 let me down a little bit, but it was okay, because I was right there.  But today it let me down again.
Q.  Never mind about being let down.  Talk about being here.  You're playing the final round tomorrow.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I can't believe it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to be here.  Just to make the cut, I didn't think I'd make the cut.  First time I ever came here, I wasn't expecting too much of myself.  I'm excited.
Q.  Talk about the golf course.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  The golf course is hard, if you miss the fairway.  The rough is getting thicker, I don't know if it's possible, but, yeah.
Q.  As well as you played, which was a big surprise for you on Thursday, are you happy that you're still here or can you be disappointed in what you've done?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I'm very excited to still be here.  That was my first objective was just to make the cut.  But if I play better tomorrow I'll be happy.
Q.  What can you do tomorrow?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  What can I do?  If I shoot even par I'll be happy.  The golf course seems to be getting harder and harder, especially where the pins were, if I shoot even par I'll be happy.
