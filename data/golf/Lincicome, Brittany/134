 Q. Yesterday wasn't a great day. You shot a great round and came in second in this tournament. Your reaction. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I'm pretty happy. I played really, really well today. Couple here and there out there today, but more yesterday. 
 Shooting even par yesterday isn't going to get the job done. So maybe a few more yesterday, a few more today, I'm not really sure, but I'm pretty happy with second.

 Q. What was different? More confident today? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Just hitting second shots better, closer to the greens. I was putting better today. Made a lot of five-, six-, seven-footers for birdie, which was good. 

 Q. Were you glad to see Katherine win if you couldn't win.
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. She's one of my best friends. She's amazing, and it's cool to see her win. It was nice that I was here to kind of drown her in champagne. 

 Q. Was it champagne?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, it was beer. (Laughing.) 

 Q. What kind of beer?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Miller Light.

 Q. Were you glad to do that?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, it was fun. 

 Q. You hope she is going to reciprocate sometime?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely. She would be there for me, so... 

 Q. Wonderful. Well, congratulations on a great round. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you.
