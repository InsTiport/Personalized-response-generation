 Q.   First off, sort of what happened just before that putt?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Oh, apparently there is a camera in the media center that goes off every five seconds, and I thought it was a fan or something taking photos.   Yeah, that was kind of annoying, but that didn't hinder the putt.   It was straight downhill, and I didn't want to run it by too far and have that knee‑knocker coming back.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your round?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   It was okay.   I made a lot of 50‑foot putts, but not the five and ten footers like I did yesterday.   All four days under par.   I mean, I kind of went another day.   1‑under would have been a good score with how windy it was this morning.   It was not good enough to get it done, but top 10s are obviously very good.  
   
 Q.   So overall, you're happy?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Super happy.   I haven't been playing great the last couple weeks.   So felt like I played good at Solheim, obviously didn't pull it off there either, but felt like I was playing good though.   I kind of wish we had a tournament I was playing.   I'm not playing next week.   I wish I was now because I'm playing so good.  
   
 Q.   You're right up there.   It's kind of nice to know.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, especially this event where I've had success in the past.   It's great to come back to Canada.   The fans are always so welcoming, and the tournament, the people that run the tournament do such a fantastic job for us, which I really appreciate it.  
   
 Q.   Someone yelled at you too when you got up to the green about thanks for staying.   What is the history there?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I think that was my housing lady.   Laura Diaz rented a house this week. Me, Laura Diaz, Marcy Hart, and Kathleen Ekey all shacked up this week.   
   
 Q.   What do you make of Lydia?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Phenomenal, such a good player.   To be so young, hopefully she doesn't get burned out before she gets the chance to turn pro.   She's so good.  
   
 Q.   Looking at that last putt, do you think about this as the putt to win the first place money?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   No, actually.   I saw Karine got the 10, so I was hoping to make a tie at third, but I actually didn't think that.   I forgot about that.  
   
 Q.   Maybe that's a good thing?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   You missed on 12 you had a chance to sort of close.   Is that sort of where things maybe slipped a little bit?   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   What was 12?   
   
 Q.   I don't know if you lipped the putt.   You looked like you had it?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I three‑putted three or four times today.  
   
 Q.   No, I think this was for birdie?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Oh, for birdie.  
   
 Q.   It would have put you at minus 10?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Oh, shoot.   I don't eastbound remember that.   Sorry.   I mean, I missed a lot of short putts today, especially for pars.   Three to five‑footers for pars, which those obviously hurt.  
   
 Q.   What does this do for you leaving and heading through the rest of the season?   It's got to be really good for the confidence?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, it's great.   A new year for Solheim Cup as well, so getting points.   Which is always good.   Top 10 are great.   I feel like I drove the ball really well this week.   Being a longer hitter, it's nice to kind of know where the golf ball is going sometimes.   I felt like I did really well here.   
So hopefully stick around for the next couple events.   Only have a couple more.   It would be nice to get a win before the end of the year.  
   
 Q.   You seem to handle it all in stride though?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, well, I haven't been playing well all year, so to even come this close, that's pretty good for me right now.
