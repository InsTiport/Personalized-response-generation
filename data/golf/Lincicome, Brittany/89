Q.   Obviously some struggles early on.   Got to feel pretty good about regrouping and finishing on a better note. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, just looking at the leaderboard obviously one player is doing really, really well, and then there are a couple others that are fairly close to me. 
If I can shoot what I shot yesterday or the day before that tomorrow, I feel like it should put me back in the hunt.

Q.   Anything that went particularly wrong on the holes with the big numbers, or is it just... 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   You know, I don't know.   I feel like I did all the same things I did yesterday.   The first hole we definitely hit the wrong iron into the hole.   So obviously being above the pin I was dead.
Then obviously just chipped it too far‑‑ I didn't chip it too far, it was just really fast. 
Next hole was really bad. 
The bunkers, I mean, there is so much silly sand in these bunkers.   It's impossible to get it out.   Obviously had a struggle on that hole as well. 
But, yeah, no, I feel like I did the same things I did yesterday.   Got the same food last night.   Did everything the same.   It's just golf and it is what it is.   Hopefully tomorrow I can shoot a couple under par and see if I can get it back around first.
