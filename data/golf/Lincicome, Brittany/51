 Q.  Talk about your day a little bit.  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was great.  I think I hit 17 of 18 greens, which is always good.  I didn't make the birdies that I wanted to, but it was a very easy, steady couple under par, so I'll take it.   
 Q.  You've been very consistent; just talk about that, all week really.  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, just driving it well.  There's a lot of kind of dogleg holes out there where you have to kind of feed it around some stuff, and if I just keep driving it well and making a few putts here and there, I think I'll be pretty good tomorrow.   
 Q.  What is the key to staying consistent like that?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: That's a great question.  If I knew, I would do it all year.  It's just golf.  You know, it's just kind of hit or miss.  I have wonderful housing this week.  I've been in the same housing for 11 years, and we've just been cooking every night and we played Scrabble a couple nights ago, so I think just having a super laid-back kind of week just kind of frees me up to play some good golf.   
 Q.  Same mindset going into tomorrow?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, we're having hamburgers and hot dogs tonight.  If I can get the kids to play Scrabble or Scattergories or something with me, my night will be set.   
 Q.  A little bit of rain; did that change the greens at all?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It made them a little softer, yeah, for sure.  We knew which holes were going to release a little bit, but most of the holes you could really attack, which was nice.
