    DANA GROSS-RHODE:  You're coming off a great week.  You were tied for second.  You had a great round.  You had 8 birdies this round.  Talk about your round. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  It was consistent.  I was hitting a lot of good iron shots.  I was worried this morning because I hadn't been hitting driver good all week.  I actually snap-hooked driver left and had to take an unplayable.  Made bogey on 14.  Was kind of worried after that. 
 Started calming down after that and took a couple good swings.  Made a lot of long putts, a lot of 25-footers for birdie and a couple ten-footers for par.  Putting save me today. 

 Q.  (No microphone). 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I'd say probably three for birdies, yeah.  Couple more trying to lag up there and they luckily hit the hole. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  No.  I have probably the worst memory ever.  I played the scores a million times and I just don't remember. 

 Q.  Do you know how the course is playing compared to last year at this event? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I'd say the greens are holding better because of the of how much rain they got last night.  They were already starting to look dried out and didn't look like they were watering too much the beginning of the week. 
 They're definitely fast, but definitely slowed them down.  They're fast, don't get me wrong.  But they're a little bit slower than they could have been.  I think wanted them to be really fast today.  It's more fun, though.  We can attack pins and the ball is going to spin and hold.  We like to play it like that. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I think it's a fairly long golf course, couple of the holes are pretty long.  And then the greens being hard.  I mean, they're big greens.  If you hit it in the wrong spot a 2-putt is kind of hard actually.  It's windier today than it has been.  So I think the length, a little bit of wind, and just how big the greens are, if you're on the wrong spot on the green it's a hard 2-putt. 
 I had a putt on 1 and I couldn't get it in, and my second putt was like ten feet. 

 Q.  Any thoughts on Annika withdrawing? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I just hope she's okay.  I heard it's pretty bad.  I heard she flew out to Miami to have it checked out.  I'm sure she's pretty bummed. 

 Q.  Do you feel like you're in a pretty good groove right now? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I think so.  I played fairly well at the Kraft.  I seem to have this 130, 135 shot on every single hole and that's a club that I don't have.  And so it appears like every single -- I had it probably three or four times today.  But learning how to hit that easy 8-iron better this week than last week.  So a couple holes I really saved myself out there.  So just been playing pretty steady, which is good. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  A lot more than last year, I know that.  There's no rain in the forecast I don't think.  I think I'm going to have to shoot 4- or 5-under each day, especially with Lorena out there now. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I don't know.  They brought me a new set so hopefully it will fill in a gap.  I don't have a 130 club and I don't have a 170 club.  Those are two big gaps in there. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I did -- on the Front 9 and then we calmed down a little bit.  We made a few putts.  She had hit it to like a foot on the really long Par 3.  I did it like two holes later.  And I was like, I'm trying to follow you.  She did it again like two holes later.  I was like, How am I supposed to keep up with you if you keep hitting it like that?  She was like, You're just going to have to hit it better. 
 I was like, Golly.  Then I just started making like 25-footers for birdie and she was sticking it to like a foot.  So she's a lot of fun to play.  She hits a bad shot and still smiles, so it makes your day good a lot better. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  She impresses me so much every time I play with her.  I was telling my caddie all day, and he was like, Don't worry about her, worry about your own game.  One hole, the Par 3, I don't remember what hole it was, she choked on and hit a cut just to take some of the distance off of it and faded it right in there. 
 The next hole she was like --  told her caddie she was going to hit it dead straight and not play into the wind.  She didn't want it to ride the wind and get a little extra dip in. 
 She was going to hit it dead straight and it went dead straight.  Just how she controls the golf ball is so impressive to me.  She has the cut, the fade, the slice, the hook, all the shots.  It's phenomenal it watch. 

 Q.  Do you guys talk at all? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yeah.  Not really about the swing or anything.  Just, Hey, what did you do for dinner?  What are you doing tomorrow?  Girl, stuff:  Nails, hair, you know. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Oh, yeah.  Especially Annika is a great example, too, her and Lorena.  The shots they have.  Just watching it makes you want to learn a new shot.  It's like going to watch Tiger and seeing the shots he hits and thinking, I never even thought about that shot. 
 It's fun to work on new shots other than just the swings you always work on. 

 Q.  How are the long sleeves? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I got fried yesterday, so I thought I would save my skin and wear long sleeves.  With the sunscreen it's sticking.  Trying to prevent some cancer.
