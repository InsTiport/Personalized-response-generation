   THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have Brittany Lincicome having scored a 5-under par 67 including a backward nine of 32. Could I ask you for your thoughts on that round.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was really good. I mean, the front nine I felt like I was hitting the ball well, driving it well, and just not getting it close enough or not -- the birdie putts just weren't falling. Then kind of made the turn, and there was kind of three holes in a row that kind of got me going. I felt like I was playing really well. It's a course where you can take advantage of the holes when you can and then there's obviously holes where you need to kind of lay off with the 5-irons and 6-irons and you have to play conservative. It's just a great golf course, and it seems to fit my game very well.  
 THE MODERATOR: You had a nice start. The weather was perfect. Not quite so good later on. Talk about the weather conditions.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Conditions were perfect, especially this morning. You could have had on shorts and a short-sleeved shirt and been perfectly fine. Of course I have three layers of pants and Under Armor and jackets anticipating snow, but this morning it was beautiful. It was unlike the British Open actually. It was really pretty.  
  
  Q. Your thoughts about the golf course?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think it's great. Obviously this afternoon it seems like it's going to rain a little bit and be a little bit windier and play a little more tough, but this morning it was great. The fairways are good, the greens are rolling really well, and it's a good test.   
  
  Q. Just tell us about your birdies and your eagle, please.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I had a birdie on 2.  
  
  Q. What club did you use?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I knew you were going to say that. No. 2 I hit driver, just hit a really little gap wedge probably 15 feet or so and made it.  
 Bogey at 6, literally was about an inch from hitting it out of bounds, and I had to take a drop because I was up against the fence, and hit a great third shot, a hybrid, and kind of rolled into the back of the bunker. I was in two bunkers today and was penalised in one of them. I just made a bit of a silly bogey. In the practice round I had 8-iron into that green in two.  
 Birdie on the par-3, 8th, hit just a little 7-iron, it was probably a foot or so off the green. Had a huge putt probably 40 feet or so and made it. Just lucky.   
 Bogey on 10, I pulled an 8-iron and was going to try to putt it from off the green probably 40 yards or so and just didn't hit it hard enough.   
 THE MODERATOR: You then started a terrific run. Birdied 12.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Birdied 12, hit a driver and then a pitching wedge to a decent range and made it.   
 13, the par-3, I hit 7-iron, a little 7-iron to about seven feet or so.  
 Eagle on 14, hit an awesome drive. I didn't realise when I got up there how tight this hole was. It was the longest drive that I've hit on that hole yet, so when I got up there it was only about a ten-yard fairway, and just had a little 6-iron and hit it to about 10 feet and made it.   
 THE MODERATOR: Any idea what distance you hit that drive?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh, it was far. It was really far, close to 300.   
 THE MODERATOR: And birdied 17.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Birdied 17, yeah. Again, hit 4-iron off the tee and then 5-iron into the green and two-putted for birdie.   
  
  Q. What were your options when you had this ball only an inch inbounds? Did you think of playing it the other way around?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, because it was almost touching the fence. Even if I tried to hit it left-handed, it still would have just rolled down the fence line and it wouldn't have got far enough away from the fence, so I just took the drop. It's a short hole so I only had hybrid into the green so I thought if I took the drop and hit hybrid onto the green and two-putt and make par and keep going, but it didn't happen.   
  
  Q. Had you noticed the out-of-bounds in practice?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yes and no. It was kind of my thought was don't hit it right because there's a creek that wouldn't have been reachable today but just because the wind wasn't as strong as the last couple days. But yesterday I was only about ten yards short of it and I didn't want to hit it too hard and hit it in the creek. It was just a bad swing thought.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, and good luck tomorrow.
