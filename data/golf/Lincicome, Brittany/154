   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Brittany, thank you for joining us and coming in. It's a tight leaderboard up there going into the final round of a major, but your thoughts on being right there in the mix. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's amazing. It's really cool to see my name up there. It's been so long since I've been in contention, and to be a major and to be on the top of a leaderboard is a pretty cool feeling. 
 I'm just going to go home tomorrow and do the same things I've done the last three nights. I'm not normally superstitious, but definitely try to do the same things I've been doing the last couple of days. 

 Q. What have you been doing at night? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Other than one of the girls will either make dinner, or Angela Stanford and I made dinner two nights ago. Last night we ordered takeout at P.F. Chang's, and every night we have been take playing Spades; myself, Angela Stanford, Stacy Prammanasudh and myself, I'm sure there's a game at home. Actually Katy and I are partners, so it's 2-1 right now.

 Q. After yesterday, do you just try and put what happened yesterday out of your mind, because it was such a weird day, and how did you feel about coming in here and still in contention? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, yesterday was not a normal day, so I was looking forward to today, just because Thursday, it was so calm and today it was going to be about the same. Unfortunately I wasn't putting it as good. I felt like I was hitting it really good. I knew what was going to go in. My iron shots felt like I was hitting pretty close. I just wasn't reading them right, or the downhill ones, I'm so tentative because they are so fast that you really cannot get them on-line too much. Hopefully tomorrow I'm going to stay below a few more of them and get some putts to drop.

 Q. There were a couple of putts, your first putt on 11 and then 14 maybe, where you just didn't hit clubs the distance -- you had the line, but not the distance. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Exactly, yeah. There's a couple long ones up and over the ridge coming down the stretch, just didn't hit it hard enough. The one on 11, I thought it was downhill and it definitely was closer to level. 
 They are just getting so fast, that I don't want one to get away from me, but obviously I was too tentative. So kind of a Catch 22. 

 Q. I notice you're carrying the new Speedline driver; did that do you any good?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Oh, yeah, that's probably the best driver I've ever hit for Adams. I can't speak highly enough about it. 

 Q. What kind of shaft does it have on it?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I Â’m not sure. It's orange and says like Throttle on it. It's something new it's stiff. (Laughter) I'll show you later.

 Q. On the telecast they made mention of how you seem so much more patient than in the past; is this something you've been working on or something that's helped you? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It actually started this week. Two weeks ago, I signed up for the Vision 54 school, which I'm going to next weekend. The ladies were out this week and I went up to them. I just wanted one thought to get through the next four days, and then I'll see you next week. They have me working on breathing, and if you hit a bad shot you have to instantly forget about it and laugh about it. My caddie and I, she's doing such a great job: The second I hit a bad shot, she'll either tell me to start counting or tell me the silliest questions or what's your favorite song or start singing. 
 We were singing so much today; I think that might have been on camera a few times. If you see us singing down the fairway, that's what we are doing. Just trying to keep my mind off the bad shots obviously. I get really, really down on myself when I hit a bad shot, and I probably would never be in this seat right now if they had not told me a few things to kind of get through this week. I'm really excited about going next weekend.

 Q. What were you singing?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was really anything. It was a lot of country, occasionally we threw in some Britney Spears, but more like Sugarland, country.

 Q. What do you think when you look at that leaderboard and there are so many Americans on it?
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's really cool to see. I'm so proud of my girls. I am so American -- especially Kristy. Kristy is one of my best friends on Tour, Kristy McPherson, to see her up there is pretty cool. It's about time, probably all I've got to say.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you and good luck tomorrow.
