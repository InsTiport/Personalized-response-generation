Q. Seven birdies today for Brittany Lincicome.  Right at the top of the leaderboard after two days.  How are you feeling?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Feeling good.  I drove it well, which is obviously key on this golf course.  You can attack, but you have to be in the fairway.
So drove it well and made a few good putts here and there, which is nice.  Got off to a good start; only one small blemish on the day.  I'll take it.
Q. Tell us about the start.  I saw three in a row to get your day going.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: That's always a fun start.  You go to the range, eat the same food, you try to stay in the same momentum all week.  Sometimes you start really good and sometimes you don't.
It was nice to get off to a good start.  Playing with my two playing partners today, we had a great time.
Q. How good are you feeling at this point of the year?  Seems like you're off to a great start.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.  Started off really well, which is nice.  Had a nice finish in Thailand as well.  This stretch is one of my favorites for sure.  It's warm weather, good golf courses, and just going to take advantage of it and hopefully get a couple more good rounds.
Q. Had a pretty nice crowd today.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Michelle Wie helps with that for sure, and then Jin Young and myself, I think everyone was having a good time feeding off all the birdies.  I think our group had quite a few birdies today.
Q. Is anything different this year for you?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Not a darn thing.  I kept saying at the beginning of the year that I just want to be more consistent, but I don't know how I'm doing that.
Q. But you feel like you are doing that?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah.  Putting is really helping.  Today I only had 27 putts, and any time it's under 30 it's going to be good day.  Putter has been really hot, so it's been really nice.  Makes it a lot easier.  Stress-free, I guess.
Q. You're known for your long game.
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Uh-huh.
Q. How much have you worked on your putting and how big a deal is it?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Zero.  I mean, I just go and when I'm home I play a bunch, but I never go to the putting green.  I haven't even seen the putting green this week other than my five, ten minutes before I go to the tee.
I played with Angela Stanford this week, and she was like, How do you do it?  I hate you.  You never have to practice.  You're just like a natural.  Just go out and play.
Just super lucky, because if I had to practice -- like I cannot wait to go take a nap right now.  (Laughter.)
Q. How much different were the conditions today?  Was that what was responsible for this great round?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Night and day.  It was obviously a lot less wind than yesterday.  That was something that we're not used to here in Phoenix.
Yeah, we just went out, we took advantage.  My putter is so hot.  Obviously I drove the ball well.  Can't make birdies most times when you're in the rough here.  The greens are pretty firm and fast.
So drove it well, putting well; just need two more days.
Q. What will be the game plan?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Same.  I think the weather is going to sure nice.  Just same:  Keep it down the middle, especially on the par-5s.  I don't need to hit it far on this golf course.  I just need to find the fairway and then kind of get it up around the green.  My short game has been excellent.
Q. I think back to the very first year, 2011, you finished second to Karrie Webb.  We were kind of unsure if you knew where you stood coming down the stretch.  Will you be watching the leaderboard this weekend?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Never.  I never look at the leaderboard.  I think my caddie was talking to you in the Bahamas trying to figure out where we were on Sunday.  So she knows where I am, and she tells me but doesn't tell me what we need to do coming down the stretch.  I just kind of trust her and go on.
