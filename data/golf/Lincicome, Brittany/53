Q. What was going right for you out there today?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know, a little bit of everything.  Didn't feel like I was driving it very well, but made a couple really good putts and my iron shots were really good.
You know, I kept in in play, which was nice.  But if I can keep three more rounds like that, I would be very happy.
Q. What does it mean to be in the position you are right now?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: It means the world.  Obviously the last couple events haven't gone the way I would've liked them to.  Playing so well in the Bahamas, you know, I was hoping it was going to kid of keep going all year.
Golf is very up and down.  Missed a few cuts, and now it's just nice to be playing good again.
Q. The international field is so strong here and everywhere.  Do you feel like you got to raise the flag for the United States every once in a while?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Absolutely.  We go out and we try to play as good as we can, but there is just so many wonderful players on the LPGA Tour nowadays.  It just shows how wonderful this tour is.
Everyone wants to be a part of it.
Q. How is the course playing?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Incredible.  The new owners -- I mean, the golf course, I think it's best I've ever seen it.  The greens are so fast.  If you get above the hole you got to be really careful.
Q. Was it firm?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: A little firm.  Not bad though.
Q. You were fairly aggressive today, which was surprising given how firm and fast everything was.  Are you just that confident in your ball striking right now?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, like Jerry was just talking about, I was learning how it hit a cut last week.  So when I played, my practice rounds this week I can't seem to draw the ball as much as I normally have.
It's kind of a Catch 22 out there.  I'm waiting for it to draw and it doesn't draw, so I hit a few drives right.  Overall I kept everything in play, which is the name of the game.
But driver, I would like to see it turn over a little bit more left.  Maybe those cut shots are leaving it out.
Q. I've known you 15 years and never seen you hit a cut.  What are you doing?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I know.  I don't know.  My friend Kris Tamulis over there, her and I just worked really hard last week.  We figured it was time for me anyway to learn how to hit a cut.  We go to the U.S. Opens and these major tournaments, and those back right pins on a par-3 I just can't get to.
I'm 31 years old, been out here 13 years.  Should be able to hit a cut.  It was fun to learn.  Obviously today I tried to hit a few of them, and it worked out pretty well.
Q. I was watching you there on 9.  You started it over that bunker and ended up the middle of the green.  That's still your comfort shot, right?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, that one was a little bit more tricky because it was a right-to-left wind on a right-to-left downslope to a back right pin.
So I said, I wish I would've hit my drive a little more left and I could've really hit the cut in there.  Oh, well.
