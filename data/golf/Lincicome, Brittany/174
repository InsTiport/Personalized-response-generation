BRITTANY LINICOME:  It was an awesome round.  I think all of the crowd was following our match because she was making birdies like they were nothing and I was making birdies also, so it was a great match.  We didn't have any holes but two with pars so when you do that, it's pretty good.
Q.  The last two holes
BRITTANY LINICOME:  That one, I don't know, I just have to take one practice stroke and go and just hit it and not think about it.  The other ones, I was just over reading and trying to force them in instead of letting them happen.  The one on 18 does not get but halfway there.
Q.  Inaudible?
BRITTANY LINICOME:  Probably, yeah.  That was pretty huge.
