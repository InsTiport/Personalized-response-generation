 Q.   Yesterday, you did say it was easy.   And today as golf tends to be, it gets harder.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.   I don't understand why.   I did nothing right today.   I couldn't drive the ball.   I couldn't do anything right.   I couldn't putt‑‑ I had 32 or 3 putts today, which obviously is not good.   
I 3‑putted three times in the first 6 or 7 holes, I think.   That's obviously kind of frustrating.   You go out and feel like you did so good yesterday and had no idea what happened today.   
I felt great‑‑ maybe a little tired, didn't get as much sleep as I needed.   I have no idea.   
   
 Q.   Will you go and practice a little bit‑‑  
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I might try to putt for a minute.   It's so ‑‑ two ends of the spectrum.   I wouldn't even know what to work on.   
   
 Q.   That's sort of what I was thinking.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I might go putt for a few minutes in case I get a chance to play tomorrow.   We'll see  
Q.It was a little bit easier today, but still, it's not an easy golf course.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, not at all.   You get it in the wrong place here and there, and it's tough.   
   
 Q.   Thanks for speaking us.   
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.   Take care.
