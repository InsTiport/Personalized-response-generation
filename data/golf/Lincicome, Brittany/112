Q.   Just tell us about the round.   There still aren't that many under‑par rounds. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.   Today if you look at my card it was so up and down.   I started really well, got up to 2‑under and bogeyed two holes back to back, and to finish the last hole with a bogey just kind of puts a sour taste in your mouth.   Like I had done so many wonderful things out there.   I was putting so well, doing so many great things, and then to finish with a bogey is kind of disappointing, but it was a great round.   Better than Friday.

Q.   I was going to say, but for the second round might be ‑‑
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.   You get that round out of there, even 1 or 2‑over, it would have been a good championship.   But obviously that's ‑‑ oh, well.   Always next year.

Q.   What was the difference as far as the setup?   Were the hole locations very much different?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I thought yesterday they were actually harder.   A couple of the par‑3 pins were ones that were back left with the left‑to‑right wind were not easy to get to. 
But today I thought they were pretty reasonable.   I was hoping they would move up a couple more tees, the one hole par‑4 that should've been drivable, 14 I think, they never did.   And then a couple of the par‑5s I thought it would be fun if they moved them up, but obviously that's coming from a longer hitter wanting to get there in two.

Q.   And the wind wasn't probably a factor as well. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah.   It wasn't too bad.   Yesterday was kind of crazy.

Q.   Everybody has played kind of like you would expect them to play except for one.   What do you make of that?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Those Koreans players are unbelievable.   Na Yeon drives it straight, hits it straight, chips and putts, gets everything up‑and‑down.   What did she shoot?   6 or 7‑under yesterday.   I never saw that out there. 
Obviously she saw something that I didn't see, but she's just a wonderful player, wonderful girl, and I couldn't be happier for her if she wins.

Q.   Four or five, if she wins, would be in the last five years four Koreans winning. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Dang it.

Q.   There's something about this tournament that they like. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, I mean big prize money.   Good week to step your game up.

Q.   This is where it kind of started, too, where Se Ri won. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yes.   Pak Se Ri. 

Q.   Is there something that Americans can do to catch up a little bit or is there something they're doing a little differently, Koreans?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I have no idea.   Maybe I should spend a week with one of them and kind of figure out what they do.   Obviously they practice unbelievably hard.   They're not fishing on their weeks off like I am. 
Probably just work ethic.   They practice a little bit harder than we do, I guess.   Their short games are so good.   I'm not sure why their short games are different than ours.   But maybe they practice it more, maybe that's just why they're better.   She's getting it up‑and‑down from everywhere, I guess.

Q.   How do you see the future of American golf?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I mean our new commissioner, Mike Whan, is doing a fantastic job of building the tour.   Obviously he understands that us American players want to keep it in the United States as many chances as we get to play in this country. 
But obviously the money is out of the country right now and we have to go where the money is, who's going to put up a tournament for us to come play.   That's just the way it is right now.   But he has a lot of things up his sleeve, he's very positive and hopefully next couple years ‑‑ it's starting to grow.   You can see it.   We have a couple of new tournaments on the schedule even this year, so hopefully we'll just keep growing again the next couple years.

Q.   What's your schedule like?   What are you going to do the next few weeks?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Two weeks off I guess.   I have a couple of odds‑and‑ends here and there and just practice, get ready for Evian, try not to fish too much and practice.

Q.   Yeah, but last time you went you caught a 400‑pound grouper.
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   No.   I'm definitely going back out for those.   Probably not this week.   Maybe next week.   But I'll definitely go back out for those.   Yeah.   Try to practice after that.
