  Q. What was with all of this wind out there, and you guys played really great.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you. It was a great round out there. Brittany and myself played really well. (Indiscernible).  
  
  Q. And then you come back and get a 3 on the next hole, and after that (indiscernible).  
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah. That was a big turning point. That was my first birdie in The Solheim Cup. We were excited.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Very much so, very much so.   
  
  Q. First Solheim Cup point goes to the United States. How does that sound?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's great. We couldn't have pictured this to go any better than it did today. We played so great and we're just happy to come out on top.   
  
  Q. What kind of message does that send to the rest of the team?  
 BRITTANY LANG: We were just playing hard, playing well, playing hard. We were just trying our best.   
  
  Q. The first point of the Solheim Cup. Does that feel good?  
 BRITTANY LANG: It really does, yeah. It puts me at ease a little bit.  
  
  Q. How did you guys keep the momentum going?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I don't know. Making really good putts and hitting some good shots, and we were just feeding off each other.   
 I tried to help her, but it made me feel a little calmer trying to help her out there, and made me relaxed and hit some good shots.  
  
  Q. These crowds are incredible. How does it make you feel?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. Every time I hear them, I smile and it pumps you, it excites you. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced.  
  
  Q. How are you feeling about playing with Kristy McPherson this afternoon?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: She's one of my best friends on Tour, so it's really cool that we get to play together on a team competition like this. It should be a pretty good couple days out there.   
  
  Q. Great job today.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thank you.
