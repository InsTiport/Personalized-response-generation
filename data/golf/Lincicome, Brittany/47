 Q.  Brittany, 3-under par 68 today, little bit of a tough finish.  But how would you describe your day overall?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think it was pretty well, especially coming off such a high last week.  I was trying to get through those holes in the afternoon.  I've slept in the last couple mornings, so by the last couple holes I felt like I got pretty tired.  But drove the ball really, really well, which is pretty key on this golf course.   
It's nice having some wedges in my hand.  If I can keep it in the fairway, I think we'll be pretty good for the weekend.   
 Q.  You won the first tournament of the LPGA Tour this year, and last week was a tremendous result as well.  How much momentum, though that was a team event, how much it gives you for the balance of the season?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I felt like I played really well last week, especially my putter.  I felt like I putted the best I've putted in a while.  So it's nice to have this big event this week, and nice to play good the first day.  My dad always says you can't win it after the first round, but you can shoot your way out of it.  So it was nice to shoot a little bit under par, and hopefully it will keep moving through the weekend.   
 Q.  How were the greens out there today?  What are your assessments of the greens today?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, they are very fast.  You have to definitely be careful when you're above the hole for sure.  A little bumpy in the afternoon, but that's expected.  So tomorrow morning with fresh greens hopefully we can light it up.   
 Q.  Different conditions from this afternoon and this morning?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: I think just the greens maybe a little bumpier because they're a little soft.  But other than that, I think the speed was pretty much the same.   
 Q.  The wind wasn't too much?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, wasn't too much.  I was worried because it's a little chilly when the wind blows out there.  But tomorrow morning, hopefully we'll get it in before it gets windy, but it's going to be cold though.   
 Q.  Have you recovered from Solheim this weekend?  
BRITTANY LINCICOME: The last two or three mornings now I've slept in until 9 or 9:30.  So tomorrow will be rough getting up that early, I think.  I'll take a nap after, it will be all right.
