Q.
You were 4 up, how excited are you?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  The first two holes    I got it back with putting really good.  Like I would make everything, like 15 footers like they were nothing so that makes it a lot easier knowing you're going to be able to make it.  I got to be a little bit more aggressive so that was good.

Right after the first, I made a really good putt and just kept going from there.
Q.  Have you played match play professionally?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Just Canon Cup and Junior Cup.  The girls are a lot better.  You've got to make putts and hit shots a little bit better.  In Junior Cup you can miss some shots and still be okay.  The next couple of days are going to get a little harder.
Q.  What's your mentality going through?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I've been hitting a lot of fairways.  I only missed two or three fairways today.  Yesterday I didn't miss one fairway which says a lot because the rough is thicker than it was so the ball really buried.
Q.  How is the course?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  It's really good.  It's not long and it's not short but a couple of the par 5s are reachable today, it's drying out a little bit.  It's going to be good for the weekend.
Q.  Looking forward to 72 holes?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Hopefully, yeah.
Q.  Ready to go?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  If I'm there, I'll be ready.
