PAUL ROVNAK:  Brittany, thanks for coming in and joining us.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: No problem.
Q.  Great round today.  66, 6 under par.  Terrific round.  Talk about your day and we'll take some questions from there.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was a great day.  It started out really slow.  I started hitting bad shots on the first couple of holes.  Kind of got nervous because in previous years in Junior Golf when I had first bad holes, like if I bogeyed the first hole, my round normally goes to like 80.

So after like the third or fourth hole I calmed down a little bit and I started making birdies and they just kept falling after that.  I was making 30 footers like they were nothing.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll take some questions.
Q.  You said you started slowly.  Looking at the leaderboard, it looked like nobody really jumped out but toward the end of their round.  They're starting to post some pretty good scores.  Is it a front nine/back nine thing?  Is there anything to that, do you think?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: I'm not sure.  In the practice round, I was told the back nine was actually harder than the front nine.  But it seems to be maybe the people are nervous the first couple of holes and just trying to make pars and then let the birdies happen, maybe.

My first tee shot of the day, I hit it in the rough and then got it on the green and three putted.  When you start off like that it's kind of hard.
Q.  How were the conditions out there?  It looks like the greens maybe dried up the last two days?  Did it make it tougher to be aggressive out there?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Yes.  The first couple of holes were still a little wet because it was overcast, but after that you could tell they were starting to harden up a little bit.

The par 5, 7, I hit 5 wood into the green, even choked down on it, hit in the middle of the green and rolled all the way back.  So about the 6th or 7th hole it started to dry out and you had to be careful, because normally we're flying them right for the hole, just going right for everything, but they started drying out after, like I said, the 7th hole.
Q.  Was there a point in your round where you felt things were changing a little bit?  I know you said you started slow.  Was there a putt here or an iron shot there that kind of clicked for you?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: Not really.  Just the first birdie I made.  It kind of calmed me down a little bit.  If I shot even par I was going to be happy.  And then I started making 30 footers, like I said, which really helped me out.  Because to win a tournament, to shoot low scores, you have to make a 30 footer here and there, which helps.
Q.  (No microphone.)

BRITTANY LINCICOME: I have no idea.
Q.  Like 2 or 3 of them?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I had probably one on the front and one on the back.
Q.  Talk about how you felt last year.  Were you pleased with it?  And again the difference this year.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: The difference between last year and this year is knowing the golf courses, knowing how stressful the travel is, just little things like that.  As easy as it is this year, ten years from now it's going to be cake, basically.  It's definitely easier.  I think knowing the golf course has really helped.

In junior Golf we knew every single golf course that there was, especially my senior year, my last year.  So just learning the golf courses, the greens, that really helps.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Let's go over your the birdies and the one bogey today.  Start with No. 1.  You said you hit your tee shot in the rough.  Was that right or left?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: Left.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What did you do from there?

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Hit it on the green, in front of the green with a 7 iron    6 iron, I'm sorry.
PAUL ROVNAK:  3 putt?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yes.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: 50 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Par putt.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: Par putt was probably seven feet.  I just pushed it, never got it online.
PAUL ROVNAK:   No. 5, par 3.

BRITTANY LINCICOME: You'll have to help me.  I don't remember what No. 5 was.
PAUL ROVNAK:  The second par 3 on the front nine.  About 145 yards, around there?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: I had to make a 12 footer downhill.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you know what you hit off the tee?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: I hit 8 iron.  I was in between clubs.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 6?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: I was probably around 12 feet again.  I actually pulled my second shot and hit on the green.  Thank God.

BRITTANY LINCICOME:  146 yards and I hit 8 iron.
PAUL ROVNAK:  To 12 feet?

BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yes.

PAUL ROVNAK:  And then the birdie putt would have been?
