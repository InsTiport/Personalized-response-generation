   MODERATOR: Here with Brittany Lincicome, who fired a fabulous 65 today, the leader in the clubhouse after round three with a lot players still out there.   
 Can you run us through your scorecard. You made a bogey on the first hole, and then once you hit 8 you had a great stretch.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I hit it awful off the tee. Couple people were taking pictures, and kind of got out of my own little bubble, I guess, and kind of lost concentration. Hit a horrible tee shot.   
 It's not the first day that I've bogeyed that hole. I birdied No.2 the last couple days, so I knew it wasn't a problem. Just kind of take a deep breathe and kind of keep it going.   
 I was very consistent. I knew where the ball was going. I was hitting the fairways; I was hitting it close; my putter was working. It was just one of those days where everything was working. If you could play like that all year-round, I don't know what happens in this silly game, goes from one day to the next.   
 Yeah, was just very consistent. Hopefully I can keep that for tomorrow.  
 MODERATOR: You want her to go through her birdies?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, hit hybrid off of 16 tee into the left rough actually, and hit a little gap wedge. Apparently it landed short of the hole and just one-hopped in. I didn't get to see it.   
  
  Q. And 17?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: 17 was close. Actually hit directly behind the pin and rolled up to about a foot. So another foot and it would have been a hole-in-one. That would have been fun.  
 MODERATOR: How are the conditions of the golf course today.  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, for some reason the greens are still a little slow. With the rain, obviously they're gonna be a little bit slower so you can attack the pins , which is good. That obviously makes it a lot nicer, because a couple of the greens on Monday/Tuesday's practice rounds, you had to land them a little bit shorter and kind of run 'em up, but now you can fly them right at the pin and it's gonna stop.  
 MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
  Q. What happened on 1?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, she -- I felt really bad, because we really scared her. She kind of picked it up, and we were like, No, no; drop it; drop it. So we like totally freaked this lady out.   
 But she dropped it. We called the rules official over because we weren't exactly sure what we needed to do. None of us really knew exactly where the ball was. We thought we would just play it, but Janet Lindsay said we needed to pick it up and redrop it just because -- I don't know why.   
 But it was totally fine. I think we scared the lady more than anything.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, no. Absolutely not. My tee shot.  
  
  Q. You were in the rough?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, I was in the left rough. If you miss anywhere on No. 1, you want to miss left. I hit a 4-iron and kind of just ran it up on the green and just pulled it a little bit.   
 So I was in the rough just short of the green and hit a good chip and just lipped out my putt.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah. I think we scared the lady more than anything.   
  
  Q. What's your best year?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: My best year? So far, this is it. First couple years my dad caddying, bless his heart, we read everything breaking to Geneva, to the lake, and just kind of over-read it.   
 So when I finally got tour caddie, each year I kind of do a little bit better. I kind of know the golf course a little bit better. My caddie this week has actually been in a playoff here. He lost in a playoff a couple years ago, so he knows the course really well.  
  
  Q. Who is you are caddie?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Mike Hobbs. I believe he was with Jee Young Lee. He lost to Angela Stanford a couple years ago. Good guy.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yep. He's been my caddie since September.   
  
  Q. What's your dad's name again?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Tom.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: No, he's actually flying in Monday. He'll be in the British, in Ireland. I've never been to Ireland so I'm excited.   
 MODERATOR: Thanks, Brittany.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Thanks.
