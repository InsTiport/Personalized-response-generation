  THE MODERATOR:   It's my pleasure to welcome in our second round leader here at the Wegmans LPGA Championship, Brittany Lincicome.   4‑under, 60 today pushes you to 9‑under through two rounds.   An amazing week so far.   Just take us through the past few days and how you've been feeling. 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, it's been incredible.   I haven't been here in a while so it's pretty exciting anytime you can shoot under par especially at a major.   It feels really nice.   I feel like all year I've been doing a lot of good things, hitting well, putting well, chipping well, they just don't seem to all come together on the same day.   So it was nice to play the last two days and just kind of seeing like I was out there doing my thing and there was not too much stress involved.   Even when I had a chip shot that looked really bad, somehow I got it up‑and‑down and kept going.
THE MODERATOR:   You said you want to build off what you did yesterday.   What were some of the things that you thought you carried over well into today's round? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Just driving it well, especially on the par‑5s.   I can get it on the fairway and reach both of them except 9, and just take advantage of those holes.   Chipping in for eagle obviously helps.   But, yeah, just I was kind of in a groove and having a good time with my two other competitors and we had a good time out there.

Q.   Talk about the par‑5s here.   You're playing them at 8‑under so far this week, incredible.   You have the eagle on the back nine today.   How important is it even just so far in the lead but also moving forward to capitalize on those opportunities? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yeah, I feel like 9 is obviously really long, so if I don't birdie that one it's not as big of a deal.   But the other ones if I don't birdie them, I feel like I've lost one stroke on the field if not two.   So taking advantage of those is kind of the key to the week.   Obviously, I'm not trying to put extra pressure on myself, but I definitely got into birdie mode.   The par‑3s are crazy long, so I'm trying to literally get it on the green and two‑putt and get it out of there as quickly as I can.   Take advantage of the par‑5s, and try to make pars on the par‑3s and that's the goal. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Brittany? 

Q.   Nice round, it didn't start well.   What happened on the first hole, and then the second question is when you walked off the green, you looked like you were really not happy about what happened there.   Just what happened on the first hole? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   You know, somebody yesterday I think had tweeted, I think it was a young fan that tweeted that I didn't three‑putt any holes yesterday, and I think it was just in my head that I didn't want to three‑putt and somehow I hit it too far on the green and knocked it way by and three‑putted.   So it was more I kind of got in my own way.   I didn't put a good stroke on the second putt and kind of being in this spot, I haven't been here in a while.   It was one of those emotions where we're not doing this.   I've been in this position before where I've had a good day and followed it up with a really bad day, and was trying to go into the next hole with just you can do this, just be confident and do it and let's not shoot 80 today was kind of going into the second tee box.

Q.   Talk about you briefly referenced the struggles, but since your last win in '11, you haven't played really well the top 10.   There have only been 10 or 11 of them, and you're too good of a player to be in that.   So what's been going on these last few years? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   If you know, please tell me.   I have no idea.   I think my parents would say I'm dating a boy and that's probably why, poor thing.   Hopefully he's not in here.   Oh, he is (laughing).   But I don't know.   I feel like I've been doing a lot of really good things.   I changed equipment and I feel like I've been playing really well, hitting it really well, driving it far which is awesome.   But like I said, it's just not coming together, and I don't know what I was doing in '11, '09, all those other years that I won.   I feel like I'm doing the same things, it just hasn't happened.   So I have no idea.

Q.   Obviously, we talked about Lexi yesterday and her driver on this course.   She used 14 drivers.   How many did you hit in these first rounds?   Did you hit it every hole besides the par‑3?   Is that giving you an advantage this week in your length on this golf course? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Absolutely, there is no secret why Lexi and I are at the top of the leaderboard, both long hitters taking advantage of the par‑5s.   I think I hit two 3‑woods each day out there with some bunkers that are kind of in between yardages.   But, yeah, the more I can hit driver, the better.   So we go to a golf course and it takes driver out of my hand, I'm pretty bummed.   So here I'm excited.

Q.   Going back to Locust Hill, how did you attack that golf course in terms of how many drivers you could hit? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   That's a good question.   That golf course got so narrow I was wanting to hit pitching wedge off the tee to get it on the fairway.   I felt like it was pretty close.   2‑wood, 3‑wood, I think there are more drivers here actually.   That was just so narrow it was more positioning of where you wanted to hit it, and here you can kind of let it go and even if it's in the rough it's not too bad because I have a short iron to the green.

Q.   When you got here were you pleasantly surprised when you played your first practice round here at what you found? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Yes, my caddie actually told me last week she had been here to walk it one day this year, and she said it was definitely more open than Locust.   It was more like the tournament last we think we played at Grand Rapids, which is exciting to hear because I like to hit it far but it doesn't always go straight.   So it was nice that the fairways were a little more forgiving, yeah, I like that.

Q.   Talk about the thoughts and emotions going into tomorrow.   Holding the lead after 36 holes.   I know you're a great sleeper, but you do think you'll lose a little bit of sleep? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   No, that will not affect me at all.   I'm staying with Laura Diaz' this weekend, with her husband and two kids.   So I'm picking up pizza, and I should probably do that soon before she gets home.   And probably just watch a movie and hang out and do the same thing I've done the last two nights and try not to think about it.

Q.   You've had struggles the past two years and for a little while.   How special is it?   There is a lot of golf to be played, but to be at a major and also here the last year here in Rochester? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I think more so that it's the last tournament here in Rochester.   The fans are so awesome at this event.   I really hope the Commissioner can get us back in this area sometime soon.   There were so many spectators out there watching us and it was such a great vibe.   We went to Wegmans this morning to get a sub for lunch and people were like good luck.   Have a good day.   It's just great to see.   Most cities we go through they don't even know we're in town sometimes, so this community really comes together and loves the LPGA, and I would love to come back and get another tournament back here.

Q.   Can you describe that hole? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   Par‑5, had 6‑iron to the green, was trying to hit it to the middle of the green and pulled it.   The pin was like 10 on from the left, so pulled it and short putted myself, was trying to hit like a flop shot, which if it wouldn't have gone in, it would have only been like a foot.   It was actually a really good shot with the lie that I had which was really bad.   It was long and only three from the left, so it was perfect.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   I had lob‑wedge into that green.   I hit it like 350 yards off the tee.   The putt was like a foot.   What was the other one, 9?   Actually I made a long putt to like 25 feet, probably, and hit it in the rough on my lay‑up shot and hit like a sand wedge into the green.   10, I don't remember, sorry. 

Q.   Lexi and Inbee just finished and they're minus‑6.   So you go into tomorrow knowing you're 3 ahead.   Does that change your mindset knowing that you have a little bit of a bigger cushion? 
BRITTANY LINCICOME:   No, I am still going to go try to birdie as many holes as I possibly can, and with both of those players, especially Inbee, she can shoot 61 like it's nothing, so it doesn't matter how big a lead you have with her behind you and Lexi or Lydia even, gosh, you just need to keep your same game plan that I've had and try to take advantage of the par‑5s and just see if we can stay ahead of all of them.
