   BRITTANY LINCICOME:  But I have a lot of chances and hopefully (indiscernible).   
  
  Q.  I can tell you anything under par is especially good.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  That's good.  (Indiscernible) trying to keep it in the fairway, (indiscernible) make birdie when I can.   
  
  Q.  I guess (indiscernible) going through the weekend knowing where you are you have a good chance of winning?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  You're right.  I don't look at the leader board, it makes me more nervous.  Try to pay attention and go out there and do what I gotta do.   
  
  Q.  First major of the year, how is it going?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Going good, trying to keep it in the fairway.  Like U.S. Open course.  Pretty long.  Keep it in the fairway.  Try to hit the greens and take (indiscernible) when I can.   
  
  Q.  What's the key to mastering this course since it is played so much different than last year?  No one is going to shoot under this year.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I didn't play last year, so I guess fairways and greens, my iron shots into the greens aren't very good today.  I only made one birdie.  It was like a 30-footer.  Didn't hit it very close.  I'm going to go work on that.  See if I can get closer tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Do you have an advantage coming out here never having played a course never knowing what it was last year?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Possibly.  That might be to my advantage.  Par 5s have been killing me.  Hopefully tomorrow par 5s. First one I was playing on the green and 3-putted, hopefully get that.   
  
  Q.  What have you been working on this year and hoping (indiscernible) first time up here?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Just want to get it almost to perfection.  When you're coming down to the stretch on Sunday with a one-shot lead or tie, you need a swing that's going to hold up.  We're trying to figure out what that swing is and try to practice that.
