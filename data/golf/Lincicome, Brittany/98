b>Q. Obviously you came with a tie for the low round of the day.  How was it out there?BRITTANY LINCICOME: It was nice.  It was definitely not easy, by any means, but I felt like I was driving it better.  Obviously, finding the fairway and not hitting it in the native every shot, it makes it stress free.  Finding the fairway all day, and hitting it to the middle of the greens. On the yardage book we wrote down these little pink spots on where to hit it on each hole.  Regardless of where the pin was, we were just going to hit it to that spot and putt to it.  Obviously, I got lucky.  Like the last hole the pin was in my little pink area.  I made some birdies, that was nice.
Q. Over the last few days, do you feel like you're in the groove now?BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, we're not trying to play the first round over.  Just a couple of errant shots the first day.  Just made for a couple of big numbers here and there. But, yeah, the last few days have been nice.  Been driving it really well.  I think I missed one fairway yesterday, and maybe one today, which is unheard of at an Open.  Keep that tomorrow, maybe I can go a little lower.
