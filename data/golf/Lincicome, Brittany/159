  Q. How does it feel to stop now and continue tomorrow?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  It's getting dark out here.  It's necessary, I guess.  You know, we're trying to play as many as we could, but what are we going to do?   
  
  Q.  You're one point down now.  How does it feel for tomorrow?  Is it good to recharge your batteries for tomorrow?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I had no time in between my matches.  It's going to be nice to get a good night's sleep and come back and try to play as good as I can.   
  
  Q. Okay.  Thank you very much.  Good luck tomorrow.
