 Q.  2-under par 70.  Pleased with today's score?  
JORDAN SMITH: Reasonably, yeah.  It was steady.  Missed a few greens in the wrong spots.  Didn't get up-and-down.  Missed a couple of short putts, but no, I drove it well, and scrambled well, yeah.   
 Q.  After the eagle at the 11th, you started to really put a score together.  How important was that stretch?  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, obviously with that par 5 playing so short, you've got to take advantage of it.  Well, we all did.  And then the ones coming in, I hit a lot of good shots.  But yeah, just didn't quite convert all of them.   
 Q.  When you did drop shots, it's because you missed the greens.  How much do you get found out around this place if you don't hit a green?  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, there's a lot of run-offs, bowls and with the wind, as well, going into the green it's hard, so you tend to miss a lot more greens than usual.   
Yeah, I think the key tomorrow is fairways and greens.   
 Q.  How was the final group, three English boys?  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, it was good fun.  I get along with both of them well.  Me and Eddie use the same coach, so we stay at tournaments a lot together.  So yeah, it was good fun.   
 Q.  What do you need to get right tomorrow to give yourself a chance?  
JORDAN SMITH: I think I've got to chip-and-putt better than what I did today.  I felt like I drove it well.  Hit a lot of good iron shots.  Just missed it in the wrong spots.   
 Q.  What would it mean for you to win the British Masters?  
JORDAN SMITH: Everyone says it's going to mean everything, which it will.  For me, it will round off -- well, it will top my year.  It hasn't been quite as good as what I had last year but to get that win, obviously it would be massive, and to do it here with Justin Rose, one of my idols, sort of hosting it, it would be awesome.
