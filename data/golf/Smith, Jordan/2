Q. Your front nine, you came close to holing out?
JORDAN SMITH: I came close a couple times, including the last. The back nine, our front nine, just played really good. Hit a lot of shots close and made the putts when I needed to.
And then the front nine, our back nine, I think the wind got up and I still played okay. I just didn't make the putts. I made one or two silly mistakes but yeah, apart from that, it was a good day's work.
Q. Nice way to finish to take it into the final day?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, especially with a 3 on 8, nice way to finish.
Q. What's been the difference this week?
JORDAN SMITH: Sort of before Wentworth, I think I missed five out of six cuts. I think I got into a few bad habits with my golf swing. Me and my coach just sort of looked at it. I missed the cut before Wentworth, but I hit it really, really good and went into Wentworth feeling good and confident. Had a pretty nice week there, tied 24th, and yeah, it's just carried on to this week. The game is in good shape now.
Q. Going into tomorrow, St. Andrews close to or tied to the lead, what's the prospect of that?
JORDAN SMITH: It will be good fun that's for sure. Being in the last couple of groups going around St. Andrews would be great. Yeah, see how the conditions are tomorrow. We had a good day at St. Andrews on Thursday, so hopefully just take some of that good form into that.
