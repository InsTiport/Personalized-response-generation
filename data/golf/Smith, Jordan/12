Q. You dropped a shot early on but rest of the game looked solid and you almost sunk that birdie putt on the last?
JORDAN SMITH: I was a bit unfortunate on the second hole.  My tee shot ran up against the lip in the bunker.  Apart from that, really, really happy with the way I played.
Q. Obviously missing the cut last week.  How pleasing is it to have three very good rounds to start the tournament?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, I sort of bombed out on 17 at Wentworth, which wasn't the proudest moment but sort of bounced back from that and went into this week a lot more relaxed and seems to be working.
Q. There's been lots of low scoring this week and seems to be a golf course that everybody seems to enjoy, and the fact that you can be more aggressive with the softer conditions?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, exactly that.  Because it's softer -- well, I've been hitting driver on pretty much every par 4 and par 5.  You can attack the pins because it's so soft and you can't really short-side yourself.  It's just sort of attack, attack, attack.
Q. You're only a couple shots off the lead.  How nice is it going into the final day in contention in a Rolex Series Event?
JORDAN SMITH: It's awesome.  It's been a while but no, look forward to tomorrow.
