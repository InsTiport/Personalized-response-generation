 Q.  Just how tough a day was it out there?  
JORDAN SMITH: Absolutely brutal.  I'm looking forward to getting in the changing rooms, and yeah, just getting warm.   
 Q.  What's your intention at the start of the day, heading out there trying to win this golf tournament?  How did you plot your way around?  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, the aim was to go and win the tournament.  It was -- it was just -- I had to be patient.  I just had to take one shot at a time.  Hit fairways, hit the greens, not get too ahead of myself, and if I hit a bad shot, then so what, everyone is going to be hitting bad shots.  Just one shot at a time.   
 Q.  Pleased with the way you finished, tied for third?  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, it's a nice finish.  I didn't really want to leave myself that 4- or 5-footer there, but no, happy to at the moment be tied third, so over the moon.   
 Q.  Have you enjoyed playing here at Walton Heath, home crowd?  
JORDAN SMITH: I've loved it.  I've loved coming here, even for sort of U.S. Open Qualifying stuff.  Played a few amateur tournaments here, and I just think it's brilliant.   
 Q.  Week off next week?  
JORDAN SMITH: Pretty sure, yeah.
