 Q.  Your first major round.  Didn't get off to a great start, but a great finish out there.  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, I mean, I thought this could be a long day, but just went out and enjoyed ourselves and ended up playing some good golf again.   
 Q.  A lot of people go out and play the first hole like that and keep their heads down and feel like it's not going to happen this time?  
JORDAN SMITH: I knew the first hole was going to be tough anyway.  I knew there was going to be bogeys and doubles.  You have to take it like a par-5 and just move on.   
 Q.  Coming to the back nine, obviously you had a couple of birdies and bogey free?  
JORDAN SMITH: I hit a lot of good shots, couple of short putts I should have made.  The greens are tricky.  They are so quick.  I'm very happy.   
 Q.  Three shots off the lead.  A good platform for the rest of the week?  
JORDAN SMITH: Definitely.  Go out tomorrow, have fun and enjoy myself.   
 Q.  Your first major, what has been like so far?  
JORDAN SMITH: It's been awesome.  Loved every minute.  Nothing to complain about.  Just soak it up and take it in.   
 Q.  What is the biggest difference you have noticed?  
JORDAN SMITH: Just the whole setup.  You fly into the airport, you are given a car for the week, a nice house for the week, just the grandstands are much bigger, crowds are bigger, a lot rowdier and the course is tougher.   
 Q.  Might be different weather tomorrow.  Any thoughts going into tomorrow?  Any plan?  
JORDAN SMITH: Not really, no.  Just see what it's like tomorrow when we're playing and take it from there.
