Q. How pleasing to get the round back together around the turn, and it was pretty solid from there on?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, sort of in the middle of I hit some awesome iron shots a couple of feet every time.  Putter didn't quite work as well as it did yesterday but I'm happy with 4-under today.
Q. Obviously the 18th, that putt sailed right by and you were aggressive with that second shot, particularly?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, we were sort of in-between clubs, 3-wood and 5-wood.  5-wood was never getting there, so we just went with 3-wood long.  Got ourselves a bit off line.
Q. One shot off the lead going into the weekend, how excited a prospect are you of heading into Saturday, which is always moving day, of course?
JORDAN SMITH: It's a new situation for me in this tournament.  Yeah, go and enjoy it like I have the last couple days and see what happens.
Q. The scoring was low today.  Does that putt a little bit more pressure on you because you know in contention, you have to score low, as well?
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, I know I can take advantage of the par 5s, so I just have myself a goal of try and birdie the par 5s and try and knock a few putts in on the way around.  As long as I take advantage of the par 5s, should be fine.
