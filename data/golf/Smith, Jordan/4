 Q.  Got a few shots back on the back?  
JORDAN SMITH: It was tough.  I think everybody else found it tough, as well.  Didn't play -- yeah, it was -- like I said, it was just getting on the wrong side of the slopes and from there, you've got no chance.  But I'm still in the tournament, and still got some more days, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  How tough was it out there with the wind, not just club selection but where you're actually aiming the ball?  
JORDAN SMITH: Well, kind of find it tough.  You've got to hit it into -- try to run it to where the pin is and if you hit on the wrong side you have an impossible chip.  It was different.  It was a test, that's for sure.  But yeah.   
 Q.  How important were the birdies on the back nine?  
JORDAN SMITH: They were massive, like I played the holes as well as I could have.  I mean, hitting shots in that close was key.  Yeah, just apart from that, it was a little bit scrappy and yeah, just see how it goes over the weekend.
