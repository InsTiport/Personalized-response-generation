 Q.  Talk me through that round today.  
JORDAN SMITH: A battle, that's what it was.  Yeah, it was tough out there.  There was a lot of missed greens, a lot of 50-foot putts.  I was reasonably happy with how I played.   
 Q.  That round will probably look better and better as the conditions increase.  
JORDAN SMITH: Yeah, I would have thought so.  Hopefully it does, anyway.  I think the cut line should move down a couple.  But no, overall, I'm happy with two days work.   
 Q.  What was the most pleasing thing you saw out there in your game?  
JORDAN SMITH: The way I drove the ball.  I drove it really nicely.  I was just happy with that.   
 Q.  It's super impressive to watch you out here doing your thing.  How comfortable and how confident are you feeling about your game?  
JORDAN SMITH: I'm loving it.  I'm going out and enjoying each week and having fun really.   
 Q.  What's been the key to you coming out here and doing what you've been doing?  
JORDAN SMITH: I think just carry on that momentum from last year.  Carrying on the good golf and the consistent golf, so I've been happy with how it's gone so far.   
 Q.  Give me a quick idea of the ambitions for the season.  
JORDAN SMITH: Win an event.  So we'll see how that goes.
