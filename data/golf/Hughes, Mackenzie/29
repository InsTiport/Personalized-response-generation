Q. What does it feel like when you drove down Club Championship Drive for the first time?
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Well, it's not Magnolia Lane, but it's very cool.  I didn't know what to expect really coming here.  This is the first time, obviously.  Everything so far has been really, really cool and very fun.  There's a lot of people here, lots going on.  Just try and take it all in, trying to get my work done, but no, I'm very excited to be here, and I look forward to a great week.
Q. What do you think of the course so far?  How does it fit your game?
MACKENZIE HUGHES: I think it's great for my game.  Par is your friend around here, so if you went around here and made a lot of pars and threw in the odd birdie here and there, you'd be very happy.  Overall I'm just trying to figure out a game plan for the golf course and figure out where I'm going to try and be aggressive and where I'm going to lay back.  There's just lots to learn in a few days.
Q. 17, the big one.
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Big one.
Q. We always ask how many balls this year do you think will be hit in the water total?  Hopefully none from you.
MACKENZIE HUGHES: How many were in the water last year?  Do you know that number?
Q. Nope, not off the top of my head.
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Let's say 45.
