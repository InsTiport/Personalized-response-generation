 Q.  Third round in the books.  Not quite the round you were looking for.  Could you put it into words for us?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Frustrated.  Disappointed.  Those are the words that come to mind right away.  It sucks to play poorly anywhere you play but especially here where I want to do well so badly.  But that's golf and it happens, and you know, go out there tomorrow and try to shoot a low one.   
 Q.  Is there any extra desire to play here that gets in the way?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Oh, for sure.  I think playing in front of the friends and family makes it even more challenging.  I mean, you can feed off it and at the same time, you start struggling, it becomes a bit of a burden.  Sometimes you want to do so well for them, it can go both ways.  Today it was kind of going the other way, so it's tough.  But it's been a really fun week.   
 Q.  What's the best part about going out in a day like even when you are not playing well, can you soak it up a little extra?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Yeah, even there on 18, I played poorly all day and I was 3-over par, and still got an ovation on the last hole.  That's nice to see.  That make you feel good, at least finishing off.  Obviously wasn't the day I was hoping for but still had some nice cheers out there and good support.   
 Q.  What do you have to do to come back on Sunday?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Practice on the range, sort it out.  Doesn't feel like it's far off.  Just golf.  I just felt like it was good swings going in bad places.  The putter was a little cold and the putter's been quite good to me this year.  It hasn't been really -- actually the first few days, it hasn't been that good.  So try and get that sorted out and maybe a course record tomorrow.   
 Q.  Maybe not quite the day you were hoping for.  What happened out there?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Yeah, just doesn't quite have it.  It's a hard game and probably looked that way if you watched me play.  I found the rough off the tee a few times, more than I was the first couple days, and putter wasn't really cooperating.  So it's frustrating.  I wanted to do well and felt like I was primed for a good day but didn't happen.  So on to the next.   
 Q.  How quickly do you realize that maybe it's not going to click for you?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: I had a feeling kind of in the first six, seven, eight holes, that it wasn't quite there and it was going to be a grind.  And if I could have shot -- if I could have somehow shot 2-, 3-under par, it would have been a great round, given the way I was playing.  Couldn't quite manage to do that but a little time on the driving range, try to get it sorted out.   
 Q.  Is it hard to shift the momentum back after you've had a couple bad holes?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Yeah, in this sport momentum is a big factor.  Momentum was going the other way and I just couldn't quite get one to go in.  Kind of turned it around and just yeah, wasn't quite there.  It was an uphill battle the whole way.   
 Q.  The putt on 18 --  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: It was right in the heart and just died the last second.  Would have been a nice way to finish but that's kind of how the day went.   
 Q.  Was the course playing significantly different today?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: No, the course is playing, I would say pretty similar to yesterday.  It wasn't that hard.  There's good scores out there.  I just didn't play well.   
 Q.  Seeing guys go 10-under, does that give you confidence for tomorrow?  
MACKENZIE HUGHES: Yeah, I know those scores are out there.  They are hard to shoot but that's why we play four rounds.  You never know what can happen.  I'll give it my best shot tomorrow.
