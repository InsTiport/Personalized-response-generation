Q. You're the first guy in this week with two sub-par rounds.  How would you compare Thursday's 69 to today's?
MACKENZIE HUGHES:   I thought Thursday played a little bit more difficult.  I think there was a score to be had today.  Some of the guys earlier today shot some nice scores.  I think it's gotten harder as the day has gone on here.  Yeah, so I mean, I'm pleased with today.  I think it's playing a little bit easier than it did Thursday and Friday but still incredibly difficult.
Q. Do you have any sense for how about back is too far back tomorrow given how jam-packed the leaderboard is?
MACKENZIE HUGHES:   I feel like there's so many guys that are still in it.  I think that if you're better than 5- or 6-over, if you shoot 5-under tomorrow, you never know.  That round is out there.  You'd have to play incredibly well, but it's out there to be had.  So we'll see.  I think it's anyone's game at this point.
Q. Given your position coming into the week, is it difficult to keep the top-30 stuff aside and focus on the tournament tomorrow?
MACKENZIE HUGHES:   You know, this golf course is actually a pretty good distraction because it's so hard that you have to just focus on every shot so much that it's easy to just kind of get in your own world out there and just the task at hand, the task at hand.  So that's been kind of nice.
Obviously in between shots your mind wanders sometimes, but this is kind of where you want to be.  Obviously I would have loved to have locked it up by now, but I'm happy to have this opportunity and I'll go embrace it tomorrow.
