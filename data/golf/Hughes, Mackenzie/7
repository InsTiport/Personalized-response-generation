  Q. MacKenzie, how good was that 1-under par round today?
 MACKENZIE HUGHES:   Yeah, it was pretty good.  The golf course wasn't giving up a lot of birdies, and we had to be patient and play to the fat of the green and except that you were going to make bogey here and there, but the golf course is playing fantastic.  I think it's a really great test of golf.  You've really got to be coming out of the fairway to hold these greens, and if you miss greens, the up-and-downs are really difficult.  Yeah, 1-under was -- very pleased with that.
 Q. Did it feel like a U.S. Open out there to you?
 MACKENZIE HUGHES:   Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  This is about as hard a setup as you could have.  Firmness-wise it's really difficult to hold some of those fairways that are sitting on angles, and yeah, some of those first bounces into the greens, you're pitching it 15 yards short of the flag.  Sometimes even just looking front edge for back pins.  Yeah, very difficult test.
 Q. Did you feel comfortable out there with some of the shots or did it make you feel a little uncomfortable at times?
 MACKENZIE HUGHES:   No, I was pretty comfortable.  I think when golf courses become like this and pars are a premium, I think I'm almost more comfortable at times because you don't feel like you'll ever get left behind when you're running off a few pars in a row.  Like last week if you got off to a slow start and you were even par through six holes you felt like you were getting run over.  I think I'm almost more comfortable and more accepting of the bad on a day like today, and it worked out pretty well.
 Q. (On racial injustice:)
 MACKENZIE HUGHES:   Yeah, that's tough.  It's a very difficult topic, one that's been talked about a lot.  I think there's no question that there's a problem, and I hear both sides of it.  I do a good job of trying to listen to both sides and hear both sides.  We need to come to a solution for sure.  There's no reason for that much force to be used in that kind of situation.  I think we can all agree on that.  Yeah, it's just unfortunate that we're dealing with this in this day and age.
 I think things need to change.  There needs to be discussion to continuing, and yeah, I'm willing to talk to anyone about it and keep it going.
