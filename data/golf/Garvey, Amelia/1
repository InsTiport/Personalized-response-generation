Q. Great after the birdie on 14.  What went wrong after that on 16?
AMELIA GARVEY:   I was grinding all day with the swing.  The birdie on 14 was just a shock really.  Like I -- yeah, I talked to Jamie on, what was it, 13?  We were just trying to get around together.
I've done really well all day scrambling.  I was doing really well to be at 1-over at that point on 13.  Yeah, just made a horrible swing on 16, and then, yeah, obviously it's not an easy hole at all.  We were waiting on the tee for a little bit as well.
And then, yeah, just one bad swing and sort of compiled from there.  Wasn't playing easy coming in with this wind.  Yeah, happy with the par down 18 and hopefully it's enough.
Q. Overall you played brilliantly over the last two rounds.  It is just the reality of playing in a major that one or two bad swings can cost it?
AMELIA GARVEY:   No, I don't think so.  I just don't think I had it today at all, and I knew that kind of at the start.  Through nine holes was doing really well to be 1-over.
So it was just a grind out there.  When you're not swinging it well, be (wind interference) you're going to be caught out, and I eventually was really.
No, I don't think -- I mean, I was the same mindset as yesterday.  Just go out there and do the same thing.  Just today it just wasn't there.
Q. What do you take away from the week?
AMELIA GARVEY:   Yeah, yeah.  Just that I know I belong here, I guess.  Obviously first major experience, first proper tour competition.
So I know my game is there.  I just got to find my (wind).
