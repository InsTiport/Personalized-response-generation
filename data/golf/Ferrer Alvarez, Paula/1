 Q.  So this was the first year that the USGA did a qualifier in Mexico for the women's fourball championship.  How did you guys feel about that?  Were you excited to hear?  
ALEJANDRA FERRER ALVAREZ: Yeah, I think it's an easier way for us to qualify for this important tournament.  I think it makes us feel like good to play for our country for such an important event.   
 Q.  How are you feeling about it?  
PAULA FERRER ALVAREZ: (Indiscernible - external conversation)  ...easier for us to have an opportunity and to qualify for this tournament.  (Indiscernible) might not have the time or money for us to qualify here.   
 Q.  So what does qualifying for a USGA championship mean to you guys?  
PAULA FERRER ALVAREZ: For me, it's like excitement I think, because it's like a first time qualifying for such an important event, and getting into the field was so happy to come here to play with the 64 like teams.   
ALEJANDRA FERRER ALVAREZ: For me it's pretty excited.  This was my first, and could not have been better than to play with my sister.  You know, it felt -- well, I felt more secure and excited to share this experience with her, so I like that.   
 Q.  So who is the big sister?  
PAULA FERRER ALVAREZ: Me.   
 Q.  Nice, nice.  So are you guys going to come back next year?
