  MATTHEW ZIONS:   Got off to a good start, which I seem to be doing a lot of weeks lately.   It was just nice to kind of tie it all together today.   I hit a couple of‑‑ did everything good.   Drove it really well. 
The greens are pretty flat and the speed is good enough where you can be reasonably aggressive and they hold their lines without it running five or six past.   My speed was on perfectly, and I felt that if I just kept it on the green kind of anywhere, I had a chance.   Definitely the course requires a lot of accuracy off the tee, and I drove it very, very well today. 
Even though it was pretty blowy out here, I think the weather, we got pretty lucky.   The forecast wasn't good this morning but turned out pretty good. 

Q.   How are the greens in terms of control out there? 
MATTHEW ZIONS:   It's almost a little trickier because you're expecting the skids; especially if you miss the greens, you're not sure how it's going to skid.   Especially these greens, just sits on top.   But overall, didn't miss that many greens either so was just kind of, you know, just felt like one of those days where I could just pick the target, hit it there and make a shot, pick a target, hit it there. 
The course is brilliant, doesn't get any better.   The setup was brilliant.     The spectators are very well behaved and professional‑‑ courteous is the word I'm looking for, very courteous.   That makes it great, and just feels like you're playing a British Open, which the atmosphere is brilliant.   It's great to have so many people out here despite the weather.

Q.   And tomorrow, one shot off the lead? 
MATTHEW ZIONS:   It's a good start, and as good as I played today, I think I might have really hit a few really flush shots, but I had to hole a lot of good putts today.   But very good signs of things going in the right direction.
