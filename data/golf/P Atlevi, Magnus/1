Q. Four birdies on the back nine, you must be very satisfied with your start?
MAGNUS P ATLEVI: Yeah, I'm satisfied the way I came back, naturally.  Especially I mean, it's a hell of a course.  Very little margins, but very pleased I came back the way I did.
Q. You have a habit of doing well in the Senior Open, you've had some good rounds?
MAGNUS P ATLEVI: I have.  For me, links golf is the best.  And I think that shows, also, in my results, so hopefully, this is a good start but hey, three more rounds to go, so anything can happen.
Q. With conditions today, it's good to be under par?
MAGNUS P ATLEVI: Yeah, the wind was a bit more breezy the first ten holes, then when the heat came on, you really felt it was getting warmer, and then it calmed down a bit, but now it's a breeze again.  I mean, I think anything under par is good, but I'm sure someone can get a run and maybe get 5- , 6-under.  They always do.
