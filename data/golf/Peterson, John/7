Q.   Good scoring, good start for you today, after yesterday, you had no idea what to expect when you got today golf course today but were you able to get off to a hot start?
JOHN PETERSON:   Yeah, I got off to a great start of the it's always nice to birdie three of the first five or whatever I did, but, yeah, you can kind of put it on cruise control and fire at a few more flags after you get off to a start like that.

Q.   You put yourself in some goods spots in the middle of your round and couldn't get some putts to fall there.   Was it a speed issue because there were a couple that were just right in the jar. 
JOHN PETERSON:   Yeah, 64 is really good, but that one could have been freaky today.   It was, it could have been 12, I don't know, 10, 12‑under.   I hit it awesome.   I don't know how many greens I hit, I think I missed two, but every time I looked up it seemed like it was right at the flag stick.   So, I'm pretty pumped with the way I hit it, I just need to go roll a few.

Q.   Feel like a little justice there at 8 to get the eagle after having so many near misses on the front?
JOHN PETERSON:   Yeah, I did.   I hit a great shot, I thought, God, if I miss this one, this whole round is just a waste.   But, no, I made that one and it felt good. 
I really wanted to birdie 9.   I think a 63 would have been my lowest on TOUR, but didn't quite get it.   I'm still happy with 8‑under.
