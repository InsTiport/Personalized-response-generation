Q.   Went pretty well for you. 
JOHN PETERSON:   Yeah, was hitting it good.   Anytime your'e hitting it good at Bay Hill you're going to make some birdies.   I was able to hit it close today and thankfully made a few them.

Q.   What was the key to your round? 
JOHN PETERSON:   Ball striking.   I didn't really miss too many shots.   I missed the tee shot on the last hole, pulled it in the fairway bunker, made a good par and that was really the only time I was in danger of making a bogey.   So, it was pretty clean.

Q.   Got a little warm at times out there this afternoon.   How did the golf course play?
JOHN PETERSON:   It was hot.   The ball started going far, about 3, 4 p.m. it was going a long way.   It was playing a little shorter than Tuesday when I played the practice round but so far, you know, I'm pretty happy with it and I'm looking forward to the next three days.
