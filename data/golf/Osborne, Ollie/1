 Q.  What was that experience like today, regardless how you played, to be able to play your home course in a pro event with your brother on your bag?  
OLLIE OSBORNE: Awesome.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Just a perfect day, to be honest.   
 Q.  What do you think about the way it shook out?  
OLLIE OSBORNE: I played okay.  I wish I made a few more putts.  But it turned out okay.  Not bad.   
 Q.  Has to be kind of a whirlwind of a week for you thus far.  How has it been emotionally to keep in check, what's it been like for you?  
OLLIE OSBORNE: This week's been a little crazy.  First tee shot a little nerve-racking but just another tournament and try to treat it like one and just have fun out here.   
 Q.  Curious what the conversations are like with you and Stephen out there amongst a course you've played so many times.  
OLLIE OSBORNE: Just anything.  Normally we're talking about shots.  But in between, yeah, it could be anything.  Just talking with him and hanging out with him.   
 Q.  Got to give you ease to, have him on your bag what do you feel going in tomorrow that you're going to take for today?  
OLLIE OSBORNE: I hit a lot of good shots out there.  Take that.  Made a lot of good strokes and just kind of continue to do it tomorrow and hopefully shoot a little more under.   
 Q.  Played this course so many times, got in trouble out there.  (Indiscernible) was that played this course so well?  
OLLIE OSBORNE: Course helps a lot.  The breaks to the green probably the most important thing.  Yeah, it will definitely help.   
 Q.  What does it mean to represent, to Reno?  There's a lot of eyes on you, a group following you, friends, family.  Has to be kind of fun.  
OLLIE OSBORNE: Awesome to have a crowd out there help me go.  It was a lot of fun.  Excited.
