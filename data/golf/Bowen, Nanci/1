NANCI BOWEN: We're really having to drink a lot of water, Gatorade, so that's been key for us out there.
Q. How are you feeling?
NANCI BOWEN: I feel good.  I'm hot, but I feel pretty good.
Q. The conditions of the course from yesterday to today, about the same?
NANCI BOWEN: About the same.  I didn't really notice much of a difference.  Sometimes they would kick up on the fronts of the greens, sometimes they'd hit and they would take off.  Again, we were just kind of guessing on what it was going to do.
Q. Is this kind of like something that you didn't expect, as good as you're playing today, in these three rounds, or did you have some feeling that you were going to play well this week?
NANCI BOWEN: I didn't have any -- actually my back was kind of bothering me about three weeks ago, so I've really been struggling and haven't really been able to practice as much as I wanted to.  I haven't had any problem since I've been here.  It was a little stiff the end of the first round, but I haven't had any problems since then, so I'm happy about that.  Yeah, just taking it one day at a time and trying to enjoy it at best I can, but there were absolutely no expectations.
Q. How about the support out on the golf course?
NANCI BOWEN: A lot of friends and family, so that's real helpful, yeah.  Very helpful.
