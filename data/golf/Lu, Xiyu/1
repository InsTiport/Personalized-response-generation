 Q.  Who came up with the idea of wearing the birthday hat throughout the second round?  
XIYU LU: Playing with Kim today and her caddie, Audrey (ph), bought me this hat.   Just put it on and asked me to keep wearing it.  I play 11 hole with that and feeling fine with that.  Yeah.   
 Q.  You usually celebrate your birthday here.  Last year you had a hole in one; this year a party hat.  Nice to be in Pattaya turning 21, isn't it?  
XIYU LU: Yeah, I been looking forward to this days for long time.  And, I mean, it's going to be really long day here today, but I mean, I got all my friends celebrate with me.  I feel really good.   
 Q.  Last one.  Serious question:  What were conditions like out there this morning?  
XIYU LU: I mean, it was pretty hot at first.  Very, very humid.  The course is a little bit wet, so playing a little longer.   
But, I mean, still really amazing how like they been done after that heavy rain.  The course, the green and bunker out there all in good condition.  I didn't get much mud balls and stuff.   
So it's been really good out there.  Yeah.
