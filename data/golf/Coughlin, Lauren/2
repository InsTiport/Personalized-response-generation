Q. What did you do during the couple weeks off?
LAUREN COUGHLIN: I went down to Wake to see Kim and John, her husband.
Q. Oh, coaches?
LAUREN COUGHLIN: Yeah, so Coach Kim is my college coach and her husband. She's at Wake now, and her and her husband are still like my swing coaches. I went and saw them for a couple days. Had some good practices there.
Then I saw Brian who is my assistant coach. He does like any short game. Brian Bailey. He does my short game and stats stuff. Went ans saw him to make sure everything was looking good.
Went to a UVA football game, which was fun. Yeah, all of our -- all of my husband's room mates came in town and their wives, so we all went to football game.
Q. A reunion.
LAUREN COUGHLIN: Yeah, it was a little mini reunion. It was a lot of fun.
Q. Consistency didn't stop. Obviously carried that right here with you. Take me through just how -- I mean, you're a machine out there.
LAUREN COUGHLIN: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I worked on my swing last week with Kim and John and got it dialed in really good. Had some really good swing thoughts and just kind of kept that going here.
And then I putted really well as well today. I mean, I hit a couple long putts squirrely away and made some six, seven-footers coming back for par, chipped really well. I mean, everything was just going really well today. I kind of sputtered coming in just since I stopped hitting it close.
But, I mean, overall everything was going really well. It's just one round. Seven more. So just need to keep it going.
