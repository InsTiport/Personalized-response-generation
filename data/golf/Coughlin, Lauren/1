 Q.  How good does it feel to have set yourself up in this position for week two? Obviously at the halfway point, but got to be a good spot.  
LAUREN COUGHLIN: I mean, couldn't -- if you would've told me this is where I would be at the beginning of the week I would be very, very happy, which I am.   
Kind of fighting a little bit of a cold right here so it's kind of perfect timing as well because we get a couple days' rest. Just looking forward to new golf course, new week, and seeing how good I can do it next week.
