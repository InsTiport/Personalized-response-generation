  Q.  After a rocky start, you had it going there.  What was working particularly well?   
 STEVE ALLAN:  I hit a lot of good iron shots.  It was a little bit annoying to start, but then hit some good iron shots.  Had a good break on the second where I holed my bunker shot.  It went in the hole, which was pretty lucky.   
  
  Q.  A little bit disappointing after 6 and 7?   
 STEVE ALLAN:  A little bit.  6, it was a tough up and down for birdie.  And 7, we got the wind wrong.  The wind kind of switched and it went to the back and it was a tough putt, so I three-putted again.   
  
  Q.  It usually gets breezier here in the afternoons.  Do you think 4 or 5 under will be a good score?   
 STEVE ALLAN:  It depends on the birdies.  The firmness of the greens and the wind, especially there on 15, 16, 17, it's tough to read and tough to get a feel for what the wind is doing.   
  
  Q.  Pretty nice conditions this morning.   
 STEVE ALLAN:  It was beautiful.   
  
  Q.  It seemed like you were happy with the way things went.   
 STEVE ALLAN:  I had a rough start.  To get a good score on the board after a rough start is good.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible).   
 STEVE ALLAN: I had a lot of mid- to long-range putts that I didn't have a good feel for, and little tricky ones that I missed.   
  
  Q.  Are you going to be watching the scores this afternoon?   
 STEVE ALLAN: I'm going to take it easy and get ready for tomorrow.
