 Q. 2-under 68. The eagle on No. 1, talk me through it. 
 STEVE ALLAN: I had 160 yards and just felt like it was a good hard 9-iron. Yesterday I hit the same club in with maybe a little bit less and the wind got it and it came up short, but today I gave it a bit and made sure it got back there.

 Q. Did you actually see it go in the hole?
 STEVE ALLAN: I did, yeah. For once I saw it go in before I could even hear the crowd, so it was nice.

 Q. When you saw it go in, what did you think?
 STEVE ALLAN: It was a great way to start. It made me a little bit even more nervous, though. That was the only problem. I got away with a bad tee shot on the second.

 Q. When you start out with an eagle on the first hole, at the second you've got to be thinking, now what?
 STEVE ALLAN: That's right, you've got to try to calm yourself down and refocus. It was a bit of a struggle through the middle of the round, and I think I found something at the end and hit some really good shots, so hopefully I'll have a good day tomorrow.

 Q. What are you happiest with about your game right now going into Sunday?
 STEVE ALLAN: My game is in pretty solid all-around shape. I've been rolling the ball well. I didn't make much today, but I really have been making a lot of those short putts, the ones you need to keep the round going. I've been driving it well, and my irons are pretty good.

 Q. Tell me about this golf course. Has it been staying pretty consistent through the first three rounds?
 STEVE ALLAN: I think so. We had a little bit of wind the first day. It wasn't strong, but it was kind of swirling around a little bit, which made it a bit tricky, and it seems like the greens get fast in the middle of the day, and then maybe as the overseed rye starts to grow, they don't stay as fast as the day goes on. But they're really rolling great, and it's one of those courses with a lot of birdies.
