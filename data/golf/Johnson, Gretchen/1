Q. Great run this week; what positives can you take out of it?
GRETCHEN JOHNSON: Yeah, there's a ton.  You know, I think I kind of proved, more to myself than kind of the golf community, that I'm a player and I can compete at the highest level.  I think certainly one day I can become a USGA champion.  I can't thank my best friend and caddie for the last few rounds, Amanda Jacobs.  Definitely couldn't have taken it this far without her.  It was definitely a full team effort, and look forward to continuing to practice and get better and compete again next year.
Q. Today you had two close matches.  Just talk about -- it looks like you truly never give up and there's always fight left in you.  Talk about where that comes from.
GRETCHEN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think I'm a gritty person.  I think that's an adjective people would use to describe me.  I'm very passionate about golf and sport and life, and I'm someone that is persistent and has perseverance innately in me.  I think the beauty is you never know when the momentum can start to shift, whether it's to or from your side.  There were definitely a lot of shifts out there, both in the morning match and even this afternoon.  Yeah, just wish maybe a couple things maybe would have gone my way earlier, but it's all good.
