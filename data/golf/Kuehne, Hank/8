Q.
What a great round out there.  You're going to play in front of your hometown tomorrow in one of the late groups.  It's got to be exciting.
HANK KUEHNE:  Yeah, definitely.  I played really solid golf today.  I hit it close a lot.

I left a lot of shots out there, didn't birdie one of the par 5s and couldn't get a lot of putts to go in, but I played really well today.
Q.  Obviously this course is there for the taking right now with the conditions.
HANK KUEHNE:  Well, we were talking about it coming up 17 that to shoot 3, 4, 5-under par today you're probably going to lose ground, I think.
Q.  Playing with Ernie Els, does it calm you, or how does that factor in playing with a guy like Ernie?
HANK KUEHNE:  We play very similar games.  We practice a lot with him and we're good friends, so it's a lot easier.  He's got a great disposition and he's an easy guy to play golf with and he's a lot of fun.
Q.  Now that you've positioned yourself to at least go into tomorrow with a shot, do you have a strategy or do you have a thought about this?  Are you very familiar with this course?  What are your thoughts on that?
HANK KUEHNE:  Well, we'll see where we are at the end of the day.  It really won't change much.  You've got to come out and see what the golf course will be like tomorrow.
Q.  Is there a target number?
HANK KUEHNE:  There's no target number.  You can't put that up.

The wind could change and blow 30 miles an hour, so there is no target number.  I'll just try to go out and put the best score up that I can.
