 Q.  How did your round go? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  It was good.  Yeah, it's a long day. 

 Q.  Was there like a turning point where you felt like you were picking it up? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  No.  I just stayed steady.  I was hitting the ball well and putting the ball well even when she was 3-up and just tried to stay consistent. 

 Q.  What do you think of the conditions; did the rain yesterday affect anything? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  The greens were a little softer for sure.  You could aim at pins a little bit more.  But actually the fairways aren't too wet, so still in great shape. 

 Q.  So what's your take on match play?  Do you go into the weekend any differently? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  You definitely have to take it one hole at a time, one shot at a time even more.  I think you can't control what the other person is doing.  You've just got to stay focused and even though you're down, you've got to keep going with it.
