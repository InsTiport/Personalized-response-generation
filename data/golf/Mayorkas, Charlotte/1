 Q.  You had a really strong round and then some trouble with the 18th hole.  Walk me through what happened on that. 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Just hit too much club and kind of pulled it left and then didn't hit a good chip and didn't make my putt. 

 Q.  You're from Southern California, right? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  San Diego. 

 Q.  How did it feel to be in a tournament like this and have your name up on the leaderboard with Karrie's and Lorena's and have your friends and family here watching you? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  It's great.  Definitely being a California native I feel at home, and with those great players up there it's very special.  You know, it's the last tournament of the year, so definitely excited. 

 Q.  How did you feel when you first looked up at the leaderboard and saw your name with the others? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  I didn't feel anything. 

 Q.  Does having your friends and family here help this week? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Actually, my friends are coming this weekend, so no one is really here.  My caddie is a friend of mine who we played college golf with together.  She played for Stanford, so it's fun having her on the bag. 

 Q.  Playing in California you're obviously a little bit more comfortable here, so would having a win here mean a little bit more? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Definitely.  I mean, home state. 

 Q.  Is it a little bit easier, you know the grass? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Definitely just more comfortable with being in California.  The weather, I love this fresh, cold air when I can wear a sweater, and it's a great golf course. 

 Q.  How were the conditions today?  Did they affect your round at all? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  No, not really.  I definitely think this is a testing, challenging golf course, visually intimidating, but there's some birdie opportunities out there you need to take advantage of. 

 Q.  Are you aware this tournament has history of first time winners? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  I wasn't. 

 Q.  Is that going to weigh on your mind at all? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Not at all.  One day at a time. 

 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow and the rest of the weekend? 
 CHARLOTTE MAYORKAS:  Just go out and stay patient and hopefully the putts will drop.
