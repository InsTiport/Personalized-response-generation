 Q. Just today in particular do you feel you have to chase and how did you feel about the round?  
RORY McILROY: I just tried to play a good round of golf. It wasn't about chasing, it wasn't about doing anything, it was just going out there and executing the shots that I needed to. And I felt for the most part that I did maybe a little bit better than the previous two days. But I just haven't been getting much out of my round. I've just been making too many mistakes. I've been making the birdies, and doing the things that you need to do around here. I've just been‑‑ if I've missed a green, I haven't got it up and down or put myself out of position. The rough this year is about a quarter or half an inch longer than it usually is, and it's just hard to get control of your ball out of it. And I just haven't driven it in the fairway enough to have control going into these greens.  
   
 Q. And the story over the three days, as you've been saying, kind of similar. Do you have any idea why that might be? Anything in your head that you can figure it out?  
RORY McILROY: No, it's not as if I'm playing bad golf. I mean I'm under par for the golf tournament, but I'm just not enough under par. I just made too many mistakes, I guess I'll say. On the par‑3, there, you know. Put myself out of position on a couple of the par‑5s, where I can't go for the green in two. And a different day could be a different result. It's not as if anything is glaringly obvious in terms of what's lacking in my game, it's just been one of those weeks where I haven't quite got the momentum that I needed to get.  
   
 Q. You've got two eagles in two days, so that's really good golf in there?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean‑‑ yeah, I'm hitting some good shots. I'm it's just about hitting the shots a little bit better.  
   
 Q. Do you like this golf course?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah. Yeah, I do. It's a great golf course. You have to‑‑ all aspects of your game have to be really sharp to have a chance to win and to score well around here. So, yeah, I do.   
   
 Q. Why does just a little bit extra on the rough make such a difference?  
RORY McILROY: Because usually the ball comes spinning out of the rough, and just being that little bit longer, you get flyers, basically. I've had a few flyers this week. But you just don't have control of your golf ball and sort of be guessing, I think that's the thing, to guess what distance your ball is going to go around here is never a good scenario.  
   
 Q. Is anything too far off now?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen. I mean I saw Tony shot 6‑under the front nine there. I'm going to need some luck tomorrow to maybe have a chance. Yeah, I can play a good round of golf and finish the week on a positive note.
