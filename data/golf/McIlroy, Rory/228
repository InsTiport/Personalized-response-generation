 Q.  Talk about the last three days, you played with your dad, what was so special about that?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it was really cool.  To be here at Pebble with this weather and to enjoy, not just the last three days, we got here on Sunday night -- and he actually abandoned me on Monday to go play Cypress Point, which is understandable -- but we had a good day at Pebble on Tuesday, we went and played Monterey on Wednesday and then the last three days have been awesome.  I wish I could have played a little bit better for him and wish we would have both been around to play tomorrow, but it was a really cool few days and even though the golf didn't quite go where we wanted it to, we still had a good time.   
 Q.  Talk about those three days of your golf.  You're going to play the next two weeks, what do you take from the experience you had here, how you played and build on those going into those two important weeks?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, for sure.  I hit the ball well, I hit the ball well at Spyglass and I scored well.  I missed two greens yesterday, only missed one fairway, and I shot 3-over.  So that wasn't too good on the greens.  Today I hit some good shots -- I mean, you followed us for most of the back nine -- I hit some really good shots and, yeah, I just need a few putts to fall and I think sometimes with these poa annua greens you start to get a little bit tentative with them and it just gets away from you.  So I let the greens yesterday get into my head a little bit and it was hard to get out of that mindset.  So a little bit of work over the next few days and get myself ready for Riviera.
