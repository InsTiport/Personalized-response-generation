  Q. Even par on Saturday.  Some work to do heading into the final round.  How do you break down how it all played out for you today?
 RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, it was tricky, I thought.  Greens got firm, the wind got up for the last few holes.  I didn't feel, sort of felt similar to like I did yesterday, just didn't feel quite as comfortable with the golf swing as I did on Thursday.
 But I hung in there again, it was a shame to bogey the last, but conditions are supposed to be tough tomorrow, so you get off to a decent start, hang in there.  I'm not too far away, so if I can get off to a decent start, be maybe a couple under through 5 I feel like I'll have a decent chance.
 Q. What are the challenges for you -- you said it sort of felt like yesterday -- to try to get through and keep yourself within reach?
 RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, just a little more trust in what I'm trying to do.  Any of the shots that I hit today that weren't what I was looking for was just indecisiveness or not fully committing to what I'm trying to do.  So I think that's sort of the goal tomorrow, just to trust it a little more and if good shots come, they come and if not then at least I gave my best chance -- I give myself the best chance to hit good shots.
 Q. How difficult would you like to see this place here tomorrow?
 RORY MCILROY:   I would like to see it as tough as it could play.  I'm actually happy that we didn't get that much rain today, because it means the greens stayed firm.  With the wind up tomorrow, I think it will be a really good test and I feel like I need something like that to make up the shots that I need to make up.
