Q.   That was a brilliant match to watch.   What was it like to be part of?
RORY MCILROY:   It was great.   It wasn't a start that I wanted.   3‑down after four holes.   It's very tough against anyone, but against someone like Lee, who is one of the best in the world, I was just trying to get him back to level at some point in the round.   And turning 1‑up is a bit of a bonus.   I started to play well and make a few birdies, and I definitely played well for that win today.

Q.   You haven't been at your brilliant best this week.   You've been getting a little better day‑by‑day.   But you really needed to produce something when you're 3‑down after four and you did.   Do you have another gear?   How does that happen?
RORY MCILROY:   I don't think so.   Maybe there was a little bit of extra intensity whenever I was 3‑down after four.   But I think you just have to stay patient and know that you're going to have chances and chip away and chip away.   And if you can do that then something might turn for you, and that's what happened for me today.

Q.   You talked about the emotional draining effect that match play has on you.   Today must have been another one.   But you've got enough in the tank for the final this afternoon?   I'm sure the adrenalin helping you get through?
RORY MCILROY:   I'm sure it will, yeah.   Adrenalin will definitely help me through.   It's a long golf course, as well.   We walk golf courses every day, but as golf courses go it's a tough walk.   Yeah, I'll get a bit of lunch here and get a lot of carbs and get a lot of energy and I look forward to this afternoon. 

Q.   Hunter Mahan, your opponent, he's made 25 birdies in his last 60 holes.   You're going to have to go after it?
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   I played Hunter three years ago and beat him on the last green and it was a really good match.   So I'm expecting something similar to that. 

Q.   An opportunity to go world No.1, how exciting is this afternoon to you?
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, it's very exciting.   After Luke departed early, that was the goal this week, that was the goal this week to try and get through as many rounds as possible, and give myself a chance to get to No.1 in the world.   And I've given myself that chance this afternoon and hopefully I can take it.
