 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I played really well for the first 11 holes.   I played pretty much, I played well pretty much the whole way around.   I just let a couple of shots, a couple of shots get away from me at the end.   But, yeah, I made bogey on the par‑3 third hole and then the few holes coming in were playing pretty tough, so it's not like you're going to make any easy birdies out there.   I bogeyed the two short par‑4s on the golf course, I bogeyed the 12th and bogeyed the 2nd.   So those are holes that you're thinking of maybe picking up a shot out of the two and I ended up bogeying both of them.   
So a couple little stupid mistakes, but the game was in good shape and if it wasn't just for that bad stretch of seven holes at the end, it would have been obviously a much different story.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your tactic of coming in late.   
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I just wanted to spend an extra night in my own bed, to be honest.   Nothing more than that.   I felt like I was practicing well and playing well and no point getting here too early and making it a long week yourself.   
So I came up on Wednesday morning, played nine holes Wednesday afternoon and then it was a nice way to just come into the tournament.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   I feel like I figured this golf course out and I can play it much better than I have been able to in the past.   It doesn't frustrate me quite as much as it used to.   You know you're coming here and you're expecting to hit fairway woods off tees and irons and trying to position your ball.   
But, yeah, the scoring's really good out there.   There's a lot of low scores; and 70 I feel is going to be pretty average by the end of the day.   So I want to go out tomorrow afternoon and shoot something a bit lower to get myself into contention going into the weekend.  
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, if I could have kept it at five or even four, something in the 60s would have been good.   Walking off if you're not posting something in the 60s, after such a good start, especially that run around the turn, birdieing 16, 18, 1, and 2.   It's a little disappointing.   
So I'll come out tomorrow and try and attack again, because I feel like you can go low on this golf course this week.   It's soft, the greens are receptive, you can see that there is guys going low out there.   
   
 Q.   What happened on the tee shot on 3 and 8?  
RORY MCILROY:   On 3, I just wanted to use the wind with the ‑‑ it just didn't ‑‑ the wind didn't help me as much as I thought it was going to.   So that was that.   
8, it was a perfect 3‑iron, but I don't have a 3‑iron in my bag, so I was trying to hit a little ropey 4‑iron.   It was one of those where I knew I was probably going to have to get up‑and‑down from somewhere to make par.   
So it was just it was an awkward yardage for me and I could have got 4‑iron to probably the front edge of the green and I tried to step on it and just turned it a little bit.  
   
 Q.   What felt sharp in that first 11 holes?  
RORY MCILROY:   Everything.   I think off the tee I was really good.   Iron play was solid.   Holed some nice putts.   I played the par‑5s well.   There's three par‑5s in those first 11 holes, I birdied all of those.   
So that part of my game, my ball striking and stuff has been solid for a while and that's what set me up well for those first few holes.   
   
 Q.   You said you've done away with the frustration, do you feel comfortable on this golf course?  
RORY MCILROY:   I do, yeah.   I do.   There's some tee shots that I still don't feel that comfortable on, so I sort of dial it back a little bit.   You saw Harris and Justin hit drivers on some holes where I didn't.   And that's just because I feel if I hit a really good drive, it could go through the fairway; or if it gets away from me just a little bit, this golf course can sort of exaggerate how bad your misses are.   So I hit it to the corners of the doglegs and sort of played it from there.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Visually it's awkward.   You got tee boxes lining you up in wrong directions and you're having to hit across a lot of fairways.   The depth perception is hard with the way the trees are.   It's just, visually, it's a typical Pete Dye golf course, it's just visually very awkward.
