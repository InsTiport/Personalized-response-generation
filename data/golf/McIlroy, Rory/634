Q.   Thoughts on a good week? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was a good week.   It was a step in the right direction for sure.   I don't think anyone could have competed with Dustin this week.   He played very, very well and obviously is a deserved champion. 
You know, I just didn't make enough birdies.   I didn't take advantage of the par 5s today and some of the short par 4s. 
So yeah, I mean, it's probably one of my only bogey‑free rounds of the year but it just didn't contain enough birdies.

Q.   And it is a prominent finish in a WGC event, so that's nice. 
RORY McILROY:   A couple of Top‑10s, a couple of WGCs.   I had a good last round at Doral this year, and to finish T‑6 I think I'm going to be here, it's not too bad.   It's something to build on and nice to go into an off‑week now and I know that I'm into Dubai.

Q.   One of the aims was to do that and so you've done it in some style?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it would have been nice to try to get a win.   I have three more tournaments left this year and I want to try to finish the season strongly.   Obviously have good memories going to Dubai from winning there last year, so hopefully I can put up a strong defence of my title there.

Q.   And presumably there are plenty of positives about the way you're striking the ball and holing out. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   I still think there's a good bit of work that needs to be done to my game, but it's all heading in the right direction.
