 Q.   How was it?  
RORY McILROY:   It was very frustrating.   I just really couldn't get anything to go my way.   I had a couple of really bad breaks on 4 and 13.   Got a really massive wind switch on 4.   And then hitting the sprinkler on 13 to go up into the azaleas.  
I felt like I played well coming in.   I gave myself looks at birdie almost every hole.   I couldn't get one to drop.   Felt like I had good putts and they were either hitting the high side of the hole or low side of the hole.   Just nothing but going in.  
   
 Q.   That's a big wind on the 4th tee?  
RORY McILROY:   Not at all.   It was into the wind, and it was a perfect little sort of cut 5‑wood.   The wind laid down a little bit before I was about to hit it, so I backed off and then I felt it again.   So I went into it and hit the shot that I wanted to.   It was all over the pin, it was just 30 yards too long.   Had a big wind switch there.  
And then from there it was tough.   But bounced back with a birdie on 5.   Had a chance on 7 for birdie and didn't quite convert that.   And then obviously the start on the back nine was very tough.  
   
 Q.   If anything it was eventful, the bushes on 4, trees on 10, azaleas on 13.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah.   I've seen a lot of this golf course in the last few years.   Yeah, I just‑‑ it was a bad shot on 13.   I didn't quite deserve that, hitting the sprinkler.   But just a frustrating day.  
   
 Q.   But you kept your resolve and importantly you're here for the weekend.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, you know, I didn't know if it was going to be the ten‑shot rule that was going to come into play.   So I didn't know what that putt on the last was, to make the cut.   But when I got into the scoring area and saw that I was in 46th place, it was a bit of a sigh of relief that I'm here for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   What is possible now?  
RORY McILROY:   I don't know.   I mean I just want to go out there and try to get off to a fast start.   11 shots back with two rounds to play is going to be nearly impossible to make up.   So I'm trying to shoot two really low rounds and see where that puts me at the end of the week.  
   
 Q.   Can a 77 be turned into a 67?   Because you played that well.   And yet you shot 77.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'm just not getting anything out of my game at the moment, or at least today, anyway.   I drove the ball‑‑ I'm driving the ball as well as I ever have.   And that should be giving me opportunities to score a bit better.   But I just haven't quite been able to get on a run.  
   
 Q.   Can you attack this golf course?   Can you do it the way the course is playing so fast and fiery?  
RORY McILROY:   No, not really.   It's hard to attack these pins.   Especially I was hitting lob wedge into 17 and just barely held on to the back edge.   And stuff like that where it's going to be hard.   Anything in the 60s is a really, really good score out here.   And it will take something phenomenal to shoot something in the mid‑60s and get myself back under par going into the last day.   But I'm going to need to be 2‑, 3‑, 4‑under par going into the last day to have any sort of chance.
