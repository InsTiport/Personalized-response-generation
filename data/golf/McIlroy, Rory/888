  Q. Give us some thoughts on an opening round of 2-under.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was good. I didn't get off to the best of starts. I was 2-over pretty early on and got it back pretty nicely.   
 I birdied 17, which was my eighth hole today, and then eagled 2 and birdied 3 to get myself into red numbers. It was nice and played pretty solid on the way in, a couple of nice up-and-downs. Decent hoping round, still got a little bit to work on, but 68 is not a bad start.  
  
  Q. You got everybody out here very excited by suggesting you might come back and play the PGA TOUR next year. Is it a done deal? I assume it must be if you're talking about it.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, something I've thought about, especially after winning at Congressional. I really enjoy it over here, and I'd like to give it another go. I'm seriously considering it, 95 percent of me wants to come over here, and it was just making sure everything is in place by next year to make sure that coming over here and playing is as easy as possible logistically, get a place over here and maybe spend three or four months at the start of the year here.  
  
  Q. You had a change of heart. A few weeks ago you seemed to be pretty settled in Europe. What's behind that change of heart?  
 RORY McILROY: I don't know, I think it's a good move for my career. I feel like I play my best golf over here, and I'm comfortable here. Obviously I'm never going to leave Europe; I'm always going to play in Europe as much as I can. But I feel like I have a good chance to start winning some big tournaments all over the world, and most of the -- a lot of the big tournaments are over here.  
  
  Q. Lots of theories around, people saying it's to do with your personal life, the changes there, commercial reasons, any of that a factor, as well?  
 RORY McILROY: I think it all comes into it, definitely. But the main reason is because I think it'll be best for my career and for my golf. You know, there might be other things that have led to this decision, but ultimately it's about the golf.  
  
  Q. Just reassure the European fans you will play some exclusively European Tour events.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, of course. I'll start off in the Middle East like I always do. I'll come back, I'll play French Open. I wasn't able to play it this week. I'm planning Sweden next year definitely. I'll still play the events that I want to play over there and also fill my schedule and make sure that I still play plenty of times on both sides of the pond.
