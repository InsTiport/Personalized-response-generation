Q.   Thoughts on today? 
RORY McILROY:   The work that I did yesterday on the range really helped, just sort of got back into the rhythm and into the flow of things, and played the hole‑‑ I don't think I missed a green on the front nine.   I knew that my game was there and I just needed to take advantage of the chances I was giving myself.

Q.   How motivating was yesterday's round and/or the practice in terms of coming out in playing well today? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I was asked yesterday after I played, if you're going to battle to make the cut or whatever.   I said missing the cut isn't an option. 
I know how well I am playing and how comfortable I am with my game, so even to miss a cut feeling like that would have felt really bad. 
So that's why I put a little bit extra effort in yesterday and this morning and made sure I was ready to go out there this afternoon.

Q.   The way you're playing at the moment, do you expect to be at the top of the board each day you play?
RORY McILROY:   I do.   I expect if I execute my shots and stick to my game plan and do what I can, there's low numbers in me, and hopefully that means that I will be at the right end of the leaderboard. 
It's a very bunched leaderboard.   I'm still five shots behind but there's a lot of players between me and the leaders.   Obviously a few quality guys at the top, Adam being one of them at 8‑under par; and Jim Furyk has been playing great; Henrik Stenson; Ernie Els, there's a lot of quality players there on the leaderboard.
So I'm going to have to shoot a couple of rounds similar to today to maybe win this thing. 

Q.   How long did you hit balls yesterday? 
RORY McILROY:   It didn't take long, maybe like 45 minutes or an hour.   It wasn't like a big grinding session.   Just to sort of try to get back into the rhythm.   It felt good.

Q.   Friday must seem a long time ago, and you've had a lot of great Fridays recently?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, started with the 66 at The Open and I think 64 at Bridgestone, and then yeah, another good score at the PGA. 
Yeah, it was just a coincidence more than anything else.   I just played bad on that given day.   It wasn't anything to do with Friday or trying to, whatever it was. 

Q.   Is there any moment after the bad one at The Scottish Open, just a few days later, you're on your way to winning a major, but that night, that it happened again, and you were a little bit upset with yourself. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, of course, especially after starting with a 64 and starting well.   You know, maybe it was putting a little bit too much pressure on myself to capitalize on those first rounds, but whenever you shoot a bad first one like I did this week, it's a lot easier to go out and play with the mind‑set of, go for it. 

Q.   You called it "Freaky Friday."   Do you have a name for it now?
RORY McILROY:   I don't know, whatever‑‑ hey, I don't want to turn it into terrible Thursdays or something. 

Q.   Would you have liked the last 8‑footer? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, would have been nice to hole that.   An extra shot closer to the lead going into the weekend would always be important.   I was obviously waiting to hit that putt for about 15 or 20 minutes, so that didn't help. 
Yeah, felt like I hit a good putt.   Just didn't read it properly. 

Q.   What was your best shot today? 
RORY McILROY:   Best shot?   The two 3‑woods I hit on the par 5s on the back nine were good.   I put a new 3‑wood in the bag this week because that other one from the PGA.   Even though I played one of the shots of the tournament with it, wasn't what I wanted.   Put a new 3‑wood in the bag this week and that seemed to work out pretty well.   Set me up for two birdies.
