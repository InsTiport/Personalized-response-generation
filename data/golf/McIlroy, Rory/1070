 Q. Before we go any further, how did it feel to be playing in the Masters?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's obviously very nice. It's been an absolutely great year and to get to play in Augusta in my second season, making the Top-50 in the world and staying there, I had to go out this week and I played pretty well and I did that. Yeah, I'm over the moon.

 Q. You missed the cut last week so you knew this was going to be a make or break week for you in that respect.
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, but last week I didn't play that badly. I was just a bit rusty. I had a couple of weeks at home. The weather is so bad at home, I didn't really get much practise in. I was just a bit rusty last week and this week, I practiced well Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and was well prepared for the tournament.
 I went out and I played really nice golf and yeah, I mean, it's obviously a great way to end the year and looking forward to all of the things that are coming my way next year.

 Q. And you've got to be delighted with your finish after the start you had today.
 RORY McILROY: I had an absolutely horrendous start. Two sixes is just -- I've made two fours and won a tournament by three, or two. But to come back and I played the last 12 holes in 6-under, so to come back from that, it was a great effort. I held my second shot on nine and I birdied 10 straight after.
 It was a roller coaster round, but I came back well again, and I'm very happy about that. ...
