 Q. Is that what you needed today?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's definitely what I needed. I knew I needed to shoot something in the mid 60s to give myself some sort of chance going into tomorrow. You know, would have been nice to shoot a couple lower. I feel as if I could have, again. But a 65 out there is a really good score. If I can follow that up with something similar tomorrow, I might have a good chance. 

 Q. So what do you fancy of your chances now? 
 RORY McILROY: You know, it depends how far Freddie gets ahead, and Louie, as well. They have still got 16 and 18 to play. We'll just see how far ahead they are. But you know, obviously if I can make a run at it -- I knew I was five behind going into the last day at the Dunhill and made a good charge, and hopefully I can do the same again.

 Q. What made the difference?
 RORY McILROY: I just didn't make silly mistakes. I played very solid. No bogeys, which was key. I had a big up-and-down on 15 to keep bogey off my card. So that definitely helps. 

 Q. Presumably you knew that was in the bag, given the way that you've been playing in recent weeks, recent months? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, of course. I've been very consistent and I feel as if there's a lot of good scores in me and I was able to produce one of those today. 

 Q. Is it an advantage playing two tournaments here? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely, it's been so nice after Dunhill to Korea to China and then flying all over China and then to fly to Bermuda and Bermuda to Istanbul, and Istanbul to Shanghai, and actually being in one place for two weeks has been quite nice.

 Q. Has that helped your game?
 RORY McILROY: I'm not sure if it's helped my game that much but it's been nice not having to pack again and go on a plane and go somewhere else. It's been nice just to take a car over here from the tournament we were at last week. 

 Q. The fact maybe you didn't start the tournament the way you wanted to but you didn't shoot yourself out of it, how do you do that now at 22? How are you learning how to do that? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm learning. I think I've done that a lot better this year than I have in previous years. I mean, obviously the 80 at St. Andrews is a big one, but learning -- there's just a knack or a know-how of turning that 72 or 73 into 70. Those shots can make a hell of a difference at the end of the week.

 Q. You don't learn that in amateur golf, do you?
 RORY McILROY: No, not really. I mean, every shot counts out here. One shot can make the difference each week, and you have to really try over every shot. 

 Q. I know that you probably don't want to talk about this, but obviously last night is an issue and it's become a bigger issue and it's all over the place. Your thoughts when you heard the comments? 
 RORY McILROY: I mean, it's just unfortunate that there's been such an argument between a player and a caddie. I've heard that since then, Stevie has apologised for his comments, and I think now that he's done that, everyone can just move on and sort of put it behind them. 

 Q. As a Major winner, do you think -- --
 RORY McILROY: To be honest, it's something I would like to stay clear of. I can't really comment anymore than what happened was an unfortunate incident and as long as Stevie's apologised for it, then hopefully they can move on. .
