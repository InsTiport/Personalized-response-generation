Q.   Things didn't happen for you‑‑
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I guess after coming off a three‑week break, and then felt a little‑‑ just a little, I wouldn't say rusty, but just not quite on top of my game yesterday. 
And then today, I mean, I felt like I was trying to get something going and couldn't.   Coming off three weeks off and playing in conditions like these, it sort of shows you where your game's at.   Just got to regroup and put some work in and get ready for Miami next week.

Q.   Were you just miss‑reading putts today?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I feel like it was more the reads rather than‑‑ I felt like I was hitting some good putts.   Just didn't quite go in. 
Yeah, I mean, I felt after the birdie on 5, it gave me a chance to at least be here for the weekend and then two bogeys on 6 and 7 just sort of put any thought of that to bed so obviously not what I‑‑ not what I wanted this week but don't feel like it's too far away. 

Q.   Since golfers don't really have an off‑season, is this sort of like your version between now and Augusta of Manchester United going and playing all those exhibition games before their regular season? 
RORY McILROY:   No, definitely not, because this is‑‑ it's different if you're‑‑ no.   I mean, they are big tournaments.   You've got a World Golf Championships next week and I've got Bay Hill which I've never played before.   They are really big events in their own right, so that's how you have to treat them.

Q.   So you care deeply about the leading up to Augusta? 
RORY McILROY:   I care about my results week‑in, week‑out, regardless whether that's leading up to a major or not. 

Q.   You said early on about momentum, how you wanted to carry momentum and confidence out of something like this.   How do you make up for that now with only two events to go before Augusta? 
RORY McILROY:   Again, I'm not really thinking of Augusta.   I'm thinking of next week and just trying to play four solid rounds.   The good thing about next week is we do have four rounds that we can get into some sort of rhythm. 
So you know, hopefully we don't have to contend with conditions like they were this week, and you know, go there and‑‑ because it has been really good on the range the last couple weeks and it's been good in practice.   Just wasn't so good over the last couple days. 

Q.   How much does a missed the cut bother you? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'm pissed off.   I think it's been since The Open in '13 the last time I missed a cut.   I don't like missing cuts.   You want to be playing on the weekend, and I'm not there.   Well, I'm here; I'm home.   I'm not going to be playing this weekend, which is‑‑ which is not nice. 

Q.   Because how well you were hitting it on the range, are you surprised that this is the outcome?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, yeah. 

Q.   What did you do wrong this week?   And what did you do write? 
RORY McILROY:   I just didn't‑‑ I guess I don't feel like I controlled my ball flight well at all, which you need to in the wind.   That wasn't something that I did particularly well.   I guess the last three weeks, I haven't legally practiced in many crosswinds.   I felt like struggled in crosswinds out there the last couple days.

Q.   Will you practice over the weekend? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'll practice tomorrow and Sunday and‑‑ maybe not tomorrow, forecast looks pretty bad tomorrow.   But Sunday, yeah, get ready for next week. 

Q.   Are you playing Monday at Seminole?
RORY McILROY:   Yes. 

Q.   Anything you can salvage from this week going into next week? 
RORY McILROY:   Not really.   You just forget about it and move on to next week. 

Q.   What did Brooks do right today to get himself back under the cut line? 
RORY McILROY:   He hit greens and held putts.   That's what you need to do.   He was giving himself chances on that front nine and he held putts to get himself back in there.   It was an impressive performance.

Q.   When you see him make a birdie at 18, do you think‑‑
RORY McILROY:   And I made bogey, yeah.   I think that's maybe where it all‑‑ I made a bit of a bad decision on 18, hitting wood out of the rough.   The lie looked pretty good.   Felt like I could get it up around the green, but just didn't come out the way I expected it to. 
But yeah, when Brooks makes a birdie like that, it sort of‑‑ definitely that gave him a lot of momentum going into the next round.

Q.   In your first round, you said your mind is good, swing is good, body is good.   That being said, you're not playing in the final two rounds.   Where do you rate that in the surprise meter for you? 
RORY McILROY:   It's up there.   Usually I'm good at taking it from the range to the course.   That's never really been a problem with me.   But this week, it was funny, it felt like the first tournament of the season when I've actually played two events. 
It felt a little‑‑ I felt yesterday maybe a little tentative, just maybe trying to ease my way into the round a little bit and not really being that aggressive.   That's why it's nice to have four rounds next week to try and put that right.
