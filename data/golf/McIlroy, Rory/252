 Q.  What are your takeaways from this?  
RORY McILROY: My game isn't where it needs to be.  But it's okay.  Conditions were tricky out there.  This afternoon the course played quite firm and fairways were bouncing out a lot and sort of, yeah, it was hard to hit fairways, hard to hit greens.   
But yeah, the game's just a little -- again, my battling qualities, that's all I really have right now.  Sort of a little inconsistent with my swing and sort of with everything else.   
Just a matter of trying to go out there and put the best possible rounds together and see where that leaves me.   
 Q.  Do you work on your swing now or wait till you get to Boston?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'll wait till I get to Boston.  I might just think about it a little bit and maybe make some rehearsal swings in the mirror over the next couple days.   
But apart from that, no, I'll get to Boston on Wednesday and do a bit of a practice session probably Wednesday afternoon and we'll go from there.
