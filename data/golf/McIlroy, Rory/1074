 Q. I sense that you're not 100 per cent happy with it. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I feel as though I didn't birdie any of the last five holes, and I had wedges into four of them, anyway. A little disappointed but 64 is a great score.

 Q. What a start, four straight birdies, you must have felt there was something very special happening. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it seemed pretty easy at the start, and then missed a green right at 5 and then just picked up a couple more after that. It's always nice to have a bogey-free round as well.

 Q. Wonderful recovery at the last to save par?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, probably could have sort of rested and tried to go for the green, but knew if I got it on the fairway, would have a good chance of making par and I did. 

 Q. Do you feel ready to win here in Hong Kong?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think I'll have to get off to another good start tomorrow, but as I've said to JP, if I can just get myself into contention on the back nine on Sunday, I feel as if the more I'm there, the more I'll learn and hopefully I'll be able to close one out sooner or later. 
 Played really nicely. I felt that I could have done a little better, and didn't birdie any of the last five holes, probably with four wedges in my hand, I could have birdied a couple of still, a very, very good round, the 64, and puts me right there for the weekend.

 Q. Do you feel the course is there for the taking? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think so, I came off the course yesterday and was very disappointed, shot 70, because I knew there was a low score out there. Obviously I shot a very good score today, and hopefully if I can shoot something somewhere in the mid 60s tomorrow, I'll be in there with a shot come Sunday. 

 Q. I take it you're pretty confident coming into this event anyway after Singapore last week?
 RORY McILROY: Definitely. I played really nicely in Singapore last week, and it gives me a lot of confidence; especially the field that was there last week, beating Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott and getting myself in the mix. It was sort of self-satisfaction last week but will try and do a little better this week and get off to a good start in The Race to Dubai. 

 Q. Remember our conversations back in Europe about the first time visiting Asia and how it was so different that you didn't really feel that you did yourself justice. Have you learned from that?
 RORY McILROY: I think so. You just have to get used to the greens, because they are so grainy. You could hit a putt that's right-to-left slope and it actually goes left-to-right with the grain. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but I'm starting to learn, slowly but surely.

 Q. And with that Race to Dubai in mind, were you keen to get off to a good start in this part of the world?
 RORY McILROY: Definitely. Last year, this was my first event for the 2008 season, and I missed the cut, which wasn't really nice. So it's nice to be in there this time around and hopefully give it a good go on the weekend.

 Q. Nice to have this little rivalry with Ollie Fisher, isn't it?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I had dinner with him last night, which is fun, and obviously he's doing well. I think he's 7-under out there on the last. If he pars or birdies the last, it will be good for him. He's sort of struggled the last couple of months but starting to play really well again and showing how good of a player he is. Hopefully he does well and hopefully we are both in there with a shot come Sunday.

 Q. Do the two of you wind each other up, that sort of thing?
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I mean, I feel that when we were growing up, Ollie was probably always slightly better than me, even though he was probably a year older. He sort of did things a little faster than what I did, and I've come on here and come on turn probably and going faster than him. He's a great player, and I think we have a very friendly rivalry, which is good.
