 Q.   What is the difference (inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   It's going to be the same.   I came from three shots behind last week.   The guys got pretty close to me at The Open Championship.   They got close to me again today, and I was able to respond like I did on the back nine.   
It's not the biggest lead I've ever had, but I'm still in control of this golf tournament and it's a great position to be in going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You pulled away at the British Open as well.   How do you do that?   
RORY McILROY:   I don't know.   I saw that Phil was making a round.   I saw Rickie was making a few birdies.   Obviously, Bernd Wiesberger.   I just knew that I needed to make a couple coming down the back nine to keep the lead I had or at least be tied for the lead going into tomorrow.   
The two birdies on 15 and 16 were huge.   To get up‑and‑down out of the bunker on 18 was big.   It's not like it's that huge of a difference between tied for the lead and being one ahead going into tomorrow, just sort of makes you feel better about yourself going to bed tonight.  
   
 Q.   What was behind the decision to lay‑up on 10?  
RORY McILROY:   The pin position just didn't warrant going for it in two.   That was real think key.   If the pin had been on the left side of the green or maybe towards the back of the green, I probably would have went for it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   No, no, not at all.   Try to put that out of my mind as much as possible.   The pin position today, it was easier to lay back to a good number and try and get it up‑and‑down from there.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Loving it.   I'm loving it.   It's where I want to be.   It's the best place to be in the golf tournament.   I couldn't want to be anywhere else.  
   
 Q.   How stressful is it being in the final group in a major?   
RORY McILROY:   Obviously it has its stresses at some point, but at the same time it's where you want to be.   It's the position you want to be in.   We don't practice all these hours and grind on the range and put so much work into it to be teeing off in the middle of the pack on Sunday of a major.   That's where you want to be.   
Obviously it brings its nerves and stress and anxiety.   That's what we work so hard for.   That's the‑‑ if I went the whole season without feeling that, then I would be obviously very disappointed.   
So stressful at times, but you have got to enjoy it because it's the best position to be in a golf tournament.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   That was big to make the recovery on 4, to make par there and then to birdie the hole straight after.   That was a big momentum keeper in the round early on.
