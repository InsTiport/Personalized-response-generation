Q. Just talk a little bit about 18.
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, the lie was sort of iffy.  My biggest concern was trying to carry the first bunker on the right there, and I knew I needed to hit it really hard and I swung hard at it, and I got it just -- I got it maybe like right in the middle of the ball and I didn't get -- I felt like if I tried to sweep it, it would be better, and I just sort of came up on it a little bit.
Probably in hindsight trying to take on a little bit too much.  So yeah, and then it would have been nice to get away with a par.  It wasn't to be.
But yeah, it doesn't look like I'm going to lose any ground today anyway, which is some sort of consolation.  But it was a little trickier today.  The wind was a bit sort of everywhere.  Hole locations were a little more difficult.  But I'm still right there, but would have liked to have had a bit of a better finish.
