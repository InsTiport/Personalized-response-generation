Q.   Isn't this kind of like where you're from?
RORY McILROY:   It is, but it doesn't mean I like it. 

Q.   You were coming in off of 18 and you're like, this wind is insane.   Can you describe how different you had to play 18 because of this weather?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah.   When we hit our tee shots it was fine, but then our second shots went from‑‑ there was a little bit of wind out there, but I went from hitting a 7‑iron to like a good 5‑iron, and it finished 30 feet short of the pin.   There was a few gusts out there, which obviously makes it pretty tricky for the guys coming in.

Q.   If conditions soften up are you expecting some low scores out there tomorrow?
RORY McILROY:   I hope so, as long as the wind isn't too strong.   I think with soft conditions on this golf course, guys can take advantage of that, yeah.
