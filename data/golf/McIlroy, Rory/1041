   RORY McILROY: I'm pretty disappointed. I felt as if I've played better than 71. I plugged it under a couple of lips of bunkers, plugged it under the bunker on 13, and then I couldn't even see my ball in the 15th bunker, had a great second shot into the par 5. I was all over the pin and just buried underneath the lip and I felt as if instead of making a 3 or 4 there I turned it into a 6. It felt like a double bogey, and I had a chance on 16 as well.   
 But I played really, really well today again. Very solid. And on another day I could have been a 68 or consecutive. But today it was a 71.  
  
  Q. Felt like you could make a move on?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I felt I was playing well enough to go out there and shoot a good one. And I went out there and after bogeying the first hole today I bounced back with a nice birdie at the second and followed it up with a couple more on 6 and 9.   
 So I thought I could make a charge on the back nine. It just didn't really materialize.  
  
  Q. It sounded at the start of the week you were talking about a possible lull in your form and you weren't sure exactly what was happening. You sorted something out on Tuesday on the practice round. What's it like to feel the good juices flowing back because you're making birdies at a fair rate out there?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's really -- it's nice, it's a nice feeling. I definitely didn't have that feeling last week or even the first couple of days of this week.   
 So it's been the last three days of golf have been really good for me. I felt as if it's been really solid. Just a couple of bad breaks here and there and that's the difference.  
 But I feel as if my game is really turning around.  
  
  Q. The midsection of the course seems to suit you, four birdies in nine holes today and similar yesterday.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah. I think that part of the course presents a few chances. You've got 6, which is a par 4. 7, which is easily reachable par 5, and then I was only hitting lob wedge into nine. Even though I didn't hit a very good shot I held a nice putt. I feel comfortable on that stretch of holes.  
  
  Q. This is the best three days of a major. You're a fledgling major. And you've been in the Top 10. What's that feeling by comparison to a regular event?  
 RORY McILROY: It's been great. I got myself to 3-under at one point today. I was on the leaderboard. And it would have been nice to get a couple more. But just try and stay in touch with the leaders.   
 But it's been great. I was coming into this week looking for I thought a Top 20 or Top 10 finish would be as best I could have done. I turned things around earlier in the week. I feel if I go out tomorrow and play the way I have been, get a couple good breaks here and there, hole a couple of putts, I can finish this week on a really good note.  
  
  Q. You were up to third place at one stage. Your ambitions?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, if I can go out there tomorrow and I think a Top 5 would be a very realistic goal. So I'm going to go out there tomorrow and give it my all and see what happens.
