Q. Can you talk about maybe the difference between today and Sunday?
RORY McILROY: Not a whole lot of difference, to be honest, in my game anyway. Yeah, just missing tee shots. I'm sort of missing my 3 wood left and missing my driver right. So I don't really have to -- you know. I missed a few. I got a little better towards the end, hit some decent tee shots.
If you're in any way like in two minds what to do off the tees around here and get a little bit sort of guidey, it can bite you. So I didn't get it in play enough to give myself shots or looks at hitting it close into greens and making birdies.
So, yeah, just a little bit of a struggle. Yeah, going to work on it a little bit this afternoon and see if I can straighten it out.
Q. You might have mentioned this, but what specifically do you feel like you need to improve going into tomorrow?
RORY McILROY: I think just my overall comfort level. I wasn't particularly comfortable out there. It's still not -- I played here once before in '09, and I just can remember not being that comfortable around here then, and it's still sort of the same. I'm just not comfortable and sort of trying to pick lines and really commit to shots. I just wasn't as committed today as I need to be around here.
Q. As you mentioned, it's been a while since you've been here. Is this the kind of course you remember well, or do you feel like it has to come back to you?
RORY McILROY: It has to come back to me. There's a few holes, obviously, that are familiar, a few on the front side, obviously a few coming in as well. But sort of there's a lot of holes around the turn that I didn't really remember too well. So, yeah, again, I played a couple practice rounds just trying to get lines off tees and get adjusted and feel comfortable with the clubs that you're hitting.
Then again, like it's a course that, once you do get it in play, you can give yourself plenty of chances.
