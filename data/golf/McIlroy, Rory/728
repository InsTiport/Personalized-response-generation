Q.   We talked about the well documented coming in late, you got here at 11:14, 11 minutes to spare.   How unnerving was the whole process for you this morning?
RORY McILROY:   I was just casually walking out of my hotel room and got a phone call saying you've got 25 minutes until you tee off.   I've never been so worried driving to the golf course before.   Luckily there was a state trooper outside who kind of gave me the escort to here, and if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have got here in time.   So just ran into the clubhouse, got my shoes on and picked it up on the first tee.

Q.   At what point were you able to calm down a bit?
RORY McILROY:   I calmed as soon as I got here.   My warm‑up sessions aren't ‑‑ if I warm up for 40 minutes, it's a long time anyway.   I warmed up for like 25 minutes before I won the PGA this year, and it doesn't really‑‑ just to get loose, but I'm pretty loose anyway.   It was probably a really good thing I didn't have to think about it too much. 

Q.   You guys have gotten off to a good start on the European side.   How much belief was in the room last night that Europe could come back from this deficit?
RORY McILROY:   There was a lot of positivity in there, especially the way we finished.   Winning those two points was crucial.   We've tried to carry that momentum into today, and we've sort of done that.   But we need to go out and support the boys now in the middle of the order and see if we can get them home, as well.
