 Q.   You battled away, it wasn't to be.   Can you reflect on that round for us?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I felt like I played okay.   I didn't really‑‑ when the wind is like this and the conditions, it's hard even if you're giving yourself birdie chances, it's hard to take advantage of them.   Yeah, I was trying out there as hard as I could and just couldn't quite get a good run of holes going and get any momentum.   I was a couple under through 14 but I still needed a good finish.   Unfortunately wasn't able to do that.   So just really left myself too much to do from yesterday and I felt like I played a solid round of golf today but just wasn't enough.   
   
 Q.   A word for the fans that did everything they could to encourage you?   
RORY McILROY:   The support out here is phenomenal.   This is going to be the third year in a row they don't get to see me play over the weekend.   It's obviously disappointing to say the least.   More disappointed for them.   I'm honestly looking forward to a couple weeks off and getting ready for the U.S. Open.   Right now, it would have been nice to play the weekend at least.  
   
 Q.   What will you to this weekend as tournament host?   Do you come here and have responsibilities?   
RORY McILROY:   I'll be around.   I don't really‑‑ it's going to be hard for me to be here whenever guys are out there playing golf but I'll be here in some shape or form.   
   
 Q.   I think we all have a different sense of perspective after?  
   
 Q.   This has to be disappointing to you.   How disappointing is it?   
RORY McILROY:   It's disappointing.   I wanted to come here and play well this week.   Obviously I'm playing at home in front of a lot of friends and family, and obviously got a lot of support out here.   To not play the way I wanted to was, or is, very disappointing.   But I'm sort of getting used to it.   This is my third year in a row missing the cut on The Irish Open.   I don't know, I think it didn't fall in a great place in the schedule being my fifth tournament in a row but saying that, that doesn't really make up for how I did yesterday.   I felt like I played okay today.   I just left myself too much to do after that 80 yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Give us a sense of how hard you were trying and at what point did you realize it wasn't going to happen to make the cut?   
RORY McILROY:   I was trying hard, grinding away.   I held a good par save on 11, birdied 12.   Another good par save on 14, and then 15 was where‑‑ whenever I made 6 on 15, I felt I needed to finish with three 3s coming in and it's hard to do that with the conditions in the wind.   Even just shooting something under par out here is a really good effort.   I thought shooting even par today was a pretty good score.   Just I need a little better than that to get into the weekend after what I did yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Is it perplexing that after two weeks ago you can shoot 61 and here we are at this point, or is that just golf?   
   
 Q.   Is it perplexing to you that less than two weeks ago, you could shoot 61 and then 21‑under for 72 holes and then here we are at this point, or is that just golf?   
RORY McILROY:   It's golf but Quail Hollow, the conditions, that's my game.   That's what I do best.   And you give me this golf course in those conditions I had at Quail Hollow, it would be a much different story.   
   
 Q.   Can you give us a sense of what you'll be doing this weekend?   
RORY McILROY:   Not too sure.   Won't be playing golf, that's for sure.   Don't know.   I'll probably be hanging around here.   Might have to show my face to a couple things.   Might see me on the 18th green on Sunday.   But apart from that, just try to sort of get away from it a little bit and sort of refresh and get ready to go for the U.S. Open.   
I'm very disappointed.   It's one of the tournaments of the year that I really earmarked that I wanted to try and do well in.   It's my third year in a row where all of the people out there supporting me won't be able to watch me over the last couple of days.   But yeah, it's tough.   It's a tough golf course as it is, and then I wasn't quite in control of what I was trying to do yesterday.   Even though I felt like I played a bit better today, I left myself with too much to do after what happened yesterday.  
   
 Q.   How difficult has it been juggling the tournaments hosting and trying to play?   
RORY McILROY:   It's not as difficult as you might think.   It hasn't been that bad.   I'm definitely not using that as an excuse.   I mean, if anything, I just think it's fallen at a pretty bad time in the schedule with it being the fifth tournament in a row for me.   In an ideal world, I would have came in here with a little bit of a different preparation I guess.   But that's the way it is, and I still played very well up until this point this year.   I'm just going to enjoy these couple weeks off I have now, and get ready to go for the next major of the year at the U.S. Open.   
   
 Q.   When you got back to 6‑over‑‑  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, definitely, when I made birdie at 12, held a decent par putt on 14.   Felt like I needed to play the last four holes at 2‑under and it would have definitely given me a chance to make it or even just 1‑under, and then that double‑bogey at 15, I just shot myself in the foot.   Really left myself too much to do from then on in.   
   
 Q.   What was the mind‑set?   Did you feel that you had to chase it quite early?   
RORY McILROY:   No, no, it's definitely not a golf course or conditions where you can chase.   You just have to plod along.   I made 12 pars and two birdies in the first 14 holes and that's sort of the golf that you need to play around here.   Just unfortunate with the double‑bogey on 15, and then after that, I was trying to chase on 16 and 17.   16 and 17, I had two great chances there and didn't make it, but that's the way it goes.   
   
 Q.   What positives can you take away from this week?   
RORY McILROY:   About my golf game?   Probably none.   About everything else that we've done?   There's obviously loads of positives.   The Irish Open is now‑‑ look at all this.   The Irish Open is back to what it should be, and all the work that we've done with the foundation and all the people that we're helping because of that, so there's loads of positives in that sense.   But my golf game, not so much.
