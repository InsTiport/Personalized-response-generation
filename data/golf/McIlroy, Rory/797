Q.   Not perhaps the day you were after, but still plenty of time to get back into the tournament?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, a bit of dÃ©jÃ  vu from last year.   I kept getting off to good start and sort of making a few birdies around the turn and not really   getting any momentum back, and it was the exact same what happened today. 
2‑under through seven, feel like I'm playing well, and then I make four bogeys in five holes.   So it's just pretty disappointing.   I feel like, you know, I'm playing pretty well.   I just need to go out there and shoot the score. 

Q.   How is the course playing?   A few tweaks out there?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, the course is nice.   I struggled with the pace of the greens.   It was hard to get the ball up to the hole this morning, but the course is playing well. 

Q.   Second shot to 12? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, just was trying to cut it in, trying to hold it up against the wind and just double‑crossed it.   Ended up out‑of‑bounds by about an inch. 

Q.   Frustrating course that if you're not on your game, it can really hurt you, can't it. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it can, because you think about it and you think about the four par 5s, and you know you should be take advantage of them. 
So standing on the first tee, you're thinking, you know, you're at least 3‑ or 4‑under, and that's the worst you should be shooting.
