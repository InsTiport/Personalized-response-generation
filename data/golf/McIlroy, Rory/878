   RORY McILROY: t was a good comeback today on our back nine, and to shoot five under par for those nine holes when the wind was getting up quite a bit is very pleasing. Controlling the ball flight was getting quite difficult so I am very happy, having gone out in 39, starting from the 10th that I managed to come back so well. I three putted the 12th for par, which was not great, but then at 13 I ended up with a six on that par three because I couldn't get the ball up the slope to the green. That happened three times and in the end I bumped it up and only took one putt. So it was a quality one putt six, if you like! It was great to play with Dustin and his brother. Dustin's a great guy.
