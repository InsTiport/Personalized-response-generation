 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'm obviously standing up pretty happy about the day.   Had a nice finish to the round, was letting the round get away from me somewhat, but making four birdies on the last eight holes was nice to sort of redeem the round a little bit and keep myself in the tournament.   Pretty happy and just looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   I'm not sure.   It's sort of, you know, I guess with the rain coming down and stuff, it's tricky.   The golf course plays longer.   It's just a little tough.   
But right now the way the conditions are, it's obviously not playing any tougher than the practice days.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, birdied the 14th, drove it just short of the green, got it up and down, holed a putt from about four feet.   
Birdied the third hole, hit 3‑iron to six feet.   
The fourth hole, I hit a driver and a 3‑wood up there close to the green about 50yards, chipped it up to maybe eight or tenfeet, made that.   
7, I hit it just short right of the green, made like a 35, 40‑foot putt from just off the green.   
And then 8th hole, hit a driver and wedge to three feet.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I mean, I needed to.   I needed to make some birdies to, I guess, just guarantee myself for the weekend, but try and get myself back in the tournament.   
Yeah, it was pleasing.   It was pleasing to see that.   I had some nice shots coming in and more importantly for me hit some good putts coming in, which was good to see.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I just being more positive.   It's all about attitude more than anything else and not getting too down on myself.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Probably had a little window just a little gap in the trees.   It was maybe three foot wide by three foot high, maybe.   It was perfect.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was good.   It was‑‑ but it's funny, whenever you get in the trees, it's sort of ‑‑ you sort of‑‑ your surroundings make the shot for you.   You don't have to think of anything because all you have is one option, and you just sort of try and ‑‑  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   7‑iron.  
   
 Q.   It's easy for us to say great scores conditions, Webb Simpson 64 today.   Somebody has still got to hit the shots, rights?   Just because it's easier, it's still going to take something?   
RORY McILROY:   Of course, yeah.   You can hit all the good shots you want.   You have still got to make the putts.   
All I saw in front of us today was Webb picking his ball up out of the hole.   He seemed to make everything.   
The scoring conditions are good, but you still need to go out there and do it, as you say.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, a lot.   I mean, walking up the second hole, which was my 11th hole today, all I wanted to do is be here for the weekend.   All of sudden, I'm somewhat back in the tournament.   
I get off to a fast start tomorrow and I'm right there.   So it's giving me a lot of a nice bit of momentum going into tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's nice.   It makes me feel good because maybe in the middle of the season or a couple of months ago I wouldn't have been standing up here.   I would have been going home.   
It's good to be able to do that and fight back and makes you feel good about yourself going into the weekend.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   No.   I mean, I was still 4‑over at that point for the tournament.   So to go back to 3 there around then back to 2 at the next, my goal when I was plus four for the tournament was to get back to even par.   That was what I wanted to do.   I achieved that goal.   I had a chance to get back to red numbers at the last.   I didn't quite make that putt, but that was the goal to get back to even par for the tournament and I was able to do that.   So that was great.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   I was‑‑ it was just on the down slope and firm sand.   I had no shot.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Could be, yeah, it could be.   I played nicely coming in, made some good putts, hit some good shots.   As I said, it's nice to see those positive signs going into the weekend.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   I used eight drivers again, yeah.   But different holes, I guess.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was nice.   I hit a great drive up the 8th hole.   I had a good 3‑wood down 7.   I hit a good drive up the left, just went a little bit too far.   I mean, it was nice to see, though.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's just doesn't go as far.   You get a little bit of water on the club face and it can sort of shoot off on you.   But I was happy with how I played the last few holes, for sure.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   17.   I mean 9 is a driver and 9‑iron.   17 is a ‑‑  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RORY McILROY:   Driver, 7‑iron, 5‑wood, chip and a putt for 5, very good 5.
