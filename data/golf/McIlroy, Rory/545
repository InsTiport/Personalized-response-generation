  RORY McILROY:   I scored well today.   It wasn't‑‑ golf wasn't quite as pretty as it was yesterday at times neither was the weather, obviously. 
Played well for the most part.   Took advantage of some holes whenever we got the break in the weather like this.   Scored really well.   Some key up and downs to keep the momentum going in the round.   Really happy with that, yeah. 

Q.   How do you explain the run that you have been on? 
RORY McILROY:   Mentally I'm in a really solid place in terms of not getting ahead of myself on the golf course.   Staying in the present.   I've got a little trigger words that I'm still using, and that seems to be getting me through.   I can't really explain it anymore, any better than that. 
Obviously my swing is technically in a good place at the minute.   I'm able to shape the ball in both ways.   I'm confident, and I'm just on a good run.   You've seen before when I got on good runs like this, I can sort of keep it going for a little while.   Hopefully, I can keep it longer than I have done in the past.

Q.   What is the key difference between this run and '12, the end of '12, in the game or in your life?
RORY McILROY:   There's obviously big differences in both in terms of my game and in life.   I don't know, it's‑‑ I just feel‑‑ I feel ‑‑ confidence‑wise, I feel similar to what I did at the end of '12.   I just know that I'm a better player than I was in '12.   I'm better equipped mentally and physically to handle a stretch like this where you are in the lead for a lot of tournaments in the summer, every round and sort of playing with that lead.   I'm more experienced and just better prepared to handle that.

Q.   Was it advantage to go out in the morning as opposed to the afternoon when the conditions like they are? 
RORY McILROY:   We had to play in the rain for a little bit.   I don't know what the forecast is going to be like for the guys this afternoon, but I don't think there's any advantage on either of side of the draw.   The winds is getting up a little bit.   I don't think that's going to make much of a difference.   I think both sides are evenly matched.

Q.   How pleased are you? 
RORY McILROY:   I'm very pleased.   I'm in a great position going into the weekend in another major championship.   Can't ask for much more.

Q.   How much was your patience tested throughout the round, with the course conditions and the rain falling? 
RORY McILROY:   My patience, of course it was tested because I didn't play quite as well as I did yesterday.   I had to get up‑and‑down a few times.   Missed a few greens.   It just wasn't as stress‑free as it was yesterday.   But the conditions, you can't do anything about. 
And Bubba, he was fine.   It was okay.   He complained a couple of times on a couple of bad shots, but everyone complained.   I complained out there as well.   That definitely didn't affect me. 
Yeah, patience was a big thing today.   I felt like I kept it pretty well.
