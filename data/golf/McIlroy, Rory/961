   RORY McILROY: I think there is enough good in there to be positive about it. To make six birdies on this course is a good effort and I felt I did well to come back from the two double bogeys I made out there. 
 But it shows you hit it in the rough here it is so penal and you have to just take your punishment at times. If I could have just made those double bogeys into bogeys I would have been happy and it would have been a better round but it is still a solid start and there is plenty of golf left to play in this tournament. 

 Q. You were flying last night when you came off - did that stop the momentum?
 RORY McILROY: I birdied the first hole today so not too bad. We had a bit of a wait on the 15th tee box and I hit a bad drive. It was fine, it is going to be a long day for all of us and I just want to get out there and make some birdies.

 Q. Is there a low one out there for you?
 RORY McILROY: I think we how many birdies I made out there the first round, if I can limit the mistakes I made and maybe turn those doubles into bogeys if I come across bad spots then feel there is a good one out there.
