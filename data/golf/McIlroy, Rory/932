   RORY McILROY: Obviously not a nice way to finish, but other than that I actually played pretty nicely.

 Q. The last hole there was tricky. 
 RORY McILROY: It was a tough yardage for me. I was trying to take a lot off the 7-iron and I didn't think it was carrying the bunker. It's one of those things, in between yardages, and left myself a pretty awkward position. 

 Q. And the one on 16?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, actually wasn't a bad lie, a little sort of underneath it, just trying to sweep it off the top of the grass and I just caught it a little thin and then obviously the second putt lipped out. 

 Q. Feeling pretty good about your play?
 RORY McILROY: Overall, yeah. Iron play was really good. I thought I drove the ball nicely, just the finish was pretty disappointing. 

 Q. How was it playing with Tiger?
 RORY McILROY: It was good, yeah, it was good. He played better than I played today and didn't make any mistakes. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I suppose that is. I played with him at the Memorial this year and he was struggling a little bit. Still hit some good shots. He's playing nicely, and he's still working pretty hard on what he's trying to do. It looks like it's really coming on. Today somehow he recovered from his mistakes. 
 He holed a couple of pretty nice putts for par, but yeah, apart from that, he just played really solid golf. I haven't watched a lot of him this year, but what I have seen, it just looked like mentally he wasn't quite there. I think he's in a better place and that's why he can work on his game a bit. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 RORY McILROY: I don't mind. I've just got to worry about my own game. I've got enough to worry about myself. 

 Q. This is a big stretch. 
 RORY McILROY: It hasn't been that big for me. This is my third week. Time change is pretty big from Dubai, but I feel okay, just a little disappointed about the last hole. 

 Q. The whole thing at the Ryder Cup, too much made about that?
 RORY McILROY: Definitely, yeah. Yeah, it wasn't anything. I mean, I've always got along good with Tiger. It was just one of those things where I was asked, would you like to play on the Ryder Cup. Of course I would; I feel as if I'm playing well. I'd still say the same thing.
