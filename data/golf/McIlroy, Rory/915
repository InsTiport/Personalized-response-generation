  Q. Nice way to finish there, chip-in at the last to seal the win?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was nice. I needed it. It was a great match. We both played pretty well, and I needed to make a good few birdies to win.   
 Yeah, I'm very happy with where my game is, and I'm excited about the next couple of days.  
  
  Q. And I seem to remember, if we go back to Celtic Manor, you did take a few down 18 there, in terms of you put yourself through it a bit, don't you in, match play?  
 RORY McILROY: I don't do it the easy way, that's for sure. I seem to go down 18 quite a lot. But when you come up against a great player like Retief, you know it's going to go almost the full distance.   
 You know, I was happy that I hung on and I made two great birdies on 15 and 16 which were crucial, and managed to hit a decent iron shot into 17 and make par and then to birdie the last was nice.  
  
  Q. I was just saying to somebody, The Ryder Cup boys have all won today, but it's a strong field and everyone is in form.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, for sure, it's a big event for us, and you know, we don't get a chance to play each other that often in match play, so we all want to beat each other as well.   
 Obviously Luke is in great form. Lee is in great form. G-Mac played well last week. I feel as if I'm playing pretty good. You know, everyone seems to be playing well going into the summer, which is a great thing for European golf.  
  
  Q. And everyone talks about how physically demanding this course is, I know you're all fit guys, but obviously going to 18, you don't necessarily want to be doing that each match, do you?   
 RORY McILROY: Not really. If I go to 18 and win every time, I wouldn't mind. I mean, it's not that bad. If you had to walk it all, it would be tough. But you're getting bug ease between greens and tees, it's all right.
