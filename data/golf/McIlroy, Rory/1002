  Q. But I think I heard you say you didn't really play that well with?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I only made one birdie all day, which isn't going to do anything out here.  
 You know, Ollie played well when he needed to and I had a couple of chances to take control of the match and I didn't. And that was really the key.   
 And, you know, I had a great putt on the first extra hole. It just caught the left edge. He made a good 4 on the par-5 second. I didn't play that well, but I still hung in there, so I'm proud of myself for that.  
  
  Q. That's kind of how match play works.   
 RORY McILROY: I didn't play great, but you don't have to play well in match play to get through. You just have to beat your opponent. And I wasn't quite able to do that today.   
 But, you know, it's match play, it's very fickle. I could have played a lot better and lost. I could have played a little worse and won. It's just the way it is. But, you know, it's not a bad start. He won the match anyway. And looking forward to going to Florida and playing in the Honda, playing at Doral.  
  
  Q. Is your back feeling okay?   
 RORY McILROY: It doesn't bother me too much, it's fine. And that's all okay. I'll probably just go get a little physio before the flight home.
