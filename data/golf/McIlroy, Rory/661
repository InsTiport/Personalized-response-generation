 Q.   Just talk about how you feel about your weekend.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah.   It's been okay.   It's been‑‑ I thought I struck the ball much better today than I did the previous three days, which was great, which was a good sign.   Obviously I didn't score very well the first day, then I didn't hit it particularly well the middle two rounds, but actually my short game was good and was able to keep myself around par.  
And then today I played nicely, a couple of bad holes on the back nine.   Yeah, it was okay.   Definitely going in the right direction.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your game now as it was compared to last year going into the PGA?   
RORY McILROY:   I mean, I definitely had a better week last year, coming out of here with a lot of confidence going into the PGA feeling good about my game.   I keep saying my game doesn't feel too far away.   It's obviously not where I want it to be, but it's not a million miles away.  
   
 Q.   You know how difficult this course is.   What do you make of what Tiger has done this weekend?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, obviously the second round 61 was phenomenal.   I got to watch the last few holes of it.   Yeah, I mean, he seems to do well on‑‑ he does well on every course he plays, but he comes back to a few courses on Tour that he seems to really excel at, and obviously this is one of them.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel this course prepares you in general for the PGA?  
RORY McILROY:   It's great.   I feel like the PGA Championships are usually set up very similar to this unless you go to a Whistling Straits or a Kiawah Island like last year, but Oak Hill will feel very similar to here, which I think is a good thing.
