 Q. (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY: Definitely not. No.   
   
 Q. I looked at the picture of the Champion's Dinner last night and the only player in his 20s was Jordan Spieth. Does that surprise you at all when you think about it?  
RORY MCILROY: Maybe a little bit. I guess the guys that, I mean even, geez, I mean, I still consider myself young and I'm 28, I'm 29 next month, I'm nearly 30, but, yeah, that's sort of‑‑ that's surprising. I guess it's sort of this golf course plays into the hands of guys with experience and I guess that it's taken guys awhile to figure this place out, some of them. Some guys have had success really early on, like Jordan has and he's only 24 years old and he's up there enjoying the Champion's Dinner every year.   
   
 Q. And you talked about the scoring average, your scoring average being so good in the presser yesterday. Based on how well you play here, how much would it mean to slip on that jacket?  
RORY MCILROY: I mean, it would mean everything, obviously. I mean, it would fulfill a life‑long dream of‑‑ I mean you go back to videos of me when I'm eight, nine years old saying I want to be the best player in the world and win all the Majors. That's what I wanted to do from a young age, a young boy, and, yeah, it would fulfill a life‑long dream.   
   
 Q. Do you believe in the jinx, the par‑3 jinx?  
RORY MCILROY: No, I mean I'm a little superstitious, but I would like to be the one to break those sort of things, so I have no problem if I were to go low here on Wednesday afternoon, I still think I have a great chance of winning this tournament.
