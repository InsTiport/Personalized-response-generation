 Q. Slow start, good finish - is that the assessment?
 RORY MCILROY: Pretty much - slow start, strong finish with four birdies in the last five holes. I have to be pleased with the finish when you consider that those closing holes are very tough. I am really pleased and it gives me a good shot going into tomorrow. 


 Q. And the thoughts now turn to winning?
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah, the thoughts are on winning here and also trying to keep that place in the top 50 in the world. I haven't been able to stop thinking about that one to be honest. If I can go out there tomorrow and play the way I did at the end today then I will be right up there and I could have a chance to win: that's the aim, anyway -- go out there and try to get into contention on the back nine.

 Q. You must be pretty proud of how you have performed given the added pressures? 
 RORY MCILROY: Definitely. I mean if I look at last week I was a little bit rusty after a couple of weeks at home and this week I didn't play great in the first round but hit it nicely yesterday and again today. Given the circumstances I am pleased with the performance. 

 Q. And I take it that we have to wait until Monday to really assess your year?
 RORY MCILROY: Definitely! I just need to try and go out there and concentrate on this tournament, play the best I can and hope that the best is good enough.
