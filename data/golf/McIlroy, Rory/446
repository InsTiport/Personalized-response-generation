Q.   You got it to 4-under, the unfortunate mistake double bogey on 17.   Did you walk off the golf course satisfied with how you played today?
RORY MCILROY:   For the most part satisfied.   I felt like I did what I wanted to.   You can make your pars on the tougher holes and take advantage of some of the easier ones like the par-5s and couple of the short par-4s.   I did that pretty well today. 
Just a couple mistakes, one big mistake on 17 and a couple bogies thrown in there.   If I can play the same sort of golf and get rid of the mistakes it will be close this week.

Q.   We talked yesterday about the fact you were troubled with your putting at The Players.   You worked with Dave Stockton to figure out the issues.   Did you feel more comfortable on the greens today?
RORY MCILROY:   I felt a little more comfortable.   I felt like even just having that little thought in my head of what Dave and I talked about, it freed me up a little bit.   I was thinking of that and I guess took the result out of it a little. 
I wasn't thinking so much about trying to hold the putter, trying to make a good stroke.   I felt like I putted pretty well on the greens today.   I made a couple of nice ones.   I gave myself plenty of opportunities.   I hope to get birdies.

Q.   We've got a lot of golf to play.   You're at least 5 back right now.   What's your mindset heading into tomorrow?
RORY MCILROY:   I feel like the golf course is there to be had.   I don't feel like there's no score out there.   Today, even after playing with Patrick he got it going.   He got a bogey on 17. 
There's definitely something in the middle to low 60s out there tomorrow morning.   Hopefully I can go out there and get it going.

Q.   You just talked about your round.   Obviously 17 and your club selection.
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah.   17 was a tough one.   It was -- I played 16 and hit 9-iron from 166 and I pretty much was pin high.   Then I had like 170 into the hole on 17 and thought it was -- with the wind stayed the same a perfect 8-iron and the wind switched on us, back into it. 
Even though I saw Patrick's ball climb a little bit in the wind I felt like I could get it there.   It strengthened a little bit and, yeah, just one of those things. 
But, overall, I played pretty well.   I did what I wanted to do.   I took advantage of the par-5s and made birdie on a couple of the shorter par-4s. 
If you can limit your mistakes and do that here and there's a few holes out here which are tough, you take your card and go.   If you can take advantage of the par-5s and some of the shorter par-4s and limit the mistakes, there's definitely a score out there.

Q.   Can you talk about the motivation, the crowd sees you and Patrick head to head.   How exciting and motivating has it been?
RORY MCILROY:   It is.   I said it at the Match Play.   It was very inspiring to see Jordan what he did at Augusta, seeing how Rickie won last week, Patrick has already won this year. 
There's a lot of good young guys coming through and playing well and it's nice.   It's nice to be a part of that group.   I mean when you see those guys winning you feel like you need to step it up a little, too.   Nice healthy rivalry, I guess.
