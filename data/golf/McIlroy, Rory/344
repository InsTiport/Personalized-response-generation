RORY McILROY: Yeah, obviously a disappointing that we didn't get to play the whole 18.  But you know, weather-permitting, we can get it finished tomorrow morning, the third round, and then hopefully get a good run at it tomorrow afternoon.
I think they made the right call.  It was getting dark out there.  I struggled to read my putt on 15 and wasn't really comfortable to hit the tee shot on 16.  We can get back out there in the morning, I've got two par 5s on the last three holes to try and get another couple birdies.
Q. As far as starting the day one shot behind and then turning that into a three-shot lead so far, how pleased are you with your effort?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's been good.  Today was a day to just hang in there and try not to make too many mistakes and that's what I said I wanted to do today.  No bogeys in 15 holes, that was good.  I feel like I left a few out there, but at the same time, I can't complain with a three-shot lead going into tomorrow.
Q. What's the mentality going to be like going into tomorrow, you know it's a long day, finishing your third round and the fourth and also some weather forecast?
RORY McILROY: I just have to approach it like I did today, just take whatever comes and just make sure I'm ready to go whenever they tell us to go play.  I feel like my game is good enough that I'll keep giving myself chances, hit fairways, hit greens, and if I can knock a few in, hopefully that will be good enough to get the job done tomorrow.
Q. I appreciate it's been a frustrating day, but what's the verdict on some good play out there?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it has been frustrating.  It would have been nice to get all 18 in today, but we can come back out in the morning, weather permitting, and finish the final three, and I've got two par 5s to play in the last three holes, so hopefully I can pick up another couple of shots tomorrow morning and go into the final round with a nice lead.
Q. Solid golf out there, with the birdies that you've made, and very few errors, everything nicely controlled?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think that's really the way the conditions were today, I think that's the way you had to play, just limit the mistakes as much as you could.
I've birdied the two par 5s that I played and parred everything else, and if I can birdie the other two par 5s in the morning, I'll be happy with my day's work.
Q. You seemed determined not to play the 16th.  Was it getting dark?
RORY McILROY: Actually the tee shot would have been okay to hit I think but I didn't feel the point to hit one tee shot and come back tomorrow morning anyway to play the second shot.  I don't feel like we delayed it too much by not hitting that tee shot.  I think they made the right decision and happy that I can go out there in the morning and hopefully hit that tee shot in the sunshine.
