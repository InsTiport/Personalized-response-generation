  RORY McILROY:   Yeah, decent week.   I had a lot of chances out there today, but played solid, 68 in those conditions was good.   Nice bit of confidence going into next week.   
   
 Q.   You said you had found a sparkle yesterday.   A bit more sparkle today?  
RORY McILROY:   It was good, yeah.   I played very solid from tee to green, gave myself a lot of chances which was good to see because my greens in reg had been down the last few weeks, and to get that up again is very encouraging.  
   
 Q.   Burned a lot of edges today.   
RORY McILROY:   Yes.   Yeah, I did.   But they were good putts, they just didn't go in, so I'm giving myself chances, which is all you can ask for.
