Q.   You are 2‑down with two to play.   What was going through your mind on that 17th green when you had that birdie putt?
RORY McILROY:   Obviously you make the putt or you are going home.   I remember I held the putt on the 17th green at the Ryder Cup last year.   I was playing with Sergio.   I can't remember if it was Friday or Saturday.   It was the same sort of thing.   I hole it or we're going to get beaten.   I drew a little bit of inspiration from that. 
Hit the best putt that I hit all day, thankfully.   When I got him up to 18, I knew just try and keep the pressure on him and somehow I was able to turn it around. 

Q.   This is a tough format for the best players to advance?   You have gotten to the weekend.   What do you think got you to Saturday's play.
RORY McILROY:   I think probably not making too many mistakes.   If you look at the birdies I've made against a lot of other people, I probably haven't made quite as many.   I think over the last three days, I've only made one bogey.   If guys are wanting to beat me, they're going to have to make birdies on holes and just not giving holes away.   That was very important.

Q.   Obviously 2‑down, headed to 1.   Billy is on the green. 
RORY McILROY:   Didn't have any other option.   I needed to make birdie.   Even then it might not have been enough.   Billy was in there with a 15 or 20 footer himself.   It was just really nice to hole that putt and bring him up 18.   Great 4‑iron into 18 and set up the birdie.   Got a little unlucky with the second shot, just running over and drawn a lot of great lies.   To make 4 there and we both had make chances to make birdie on 1 and didn't quite convert.   Luckily was able to sneak it right here on the second extra hole.

Q.   What was the key to you making into the weekend?
RORY McILROY:   I think my solid play.   If you look at the my scores in relation to the rest of the field, I probably haven't made as any birdies as some of the other guys.   I haven't made bogeys.   I think I made one bogey in the last three days.   If guys are wanting to win holes off of me, they are going to have to make birdies.   That's been one of the most important things.
