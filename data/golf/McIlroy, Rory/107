RORY McILROY: It was a slow start, and then got it going a bit in the middle, and then didn't have it going in the middle and finished off pretty well.  Look, it's again, very benign conditions, same as the first two days.  Didn't quite take advantage of it the way I needed to, but again.  Still feel like my game is in good shape.  It's another round in the books and just try and finish off the tournament positively tomorrow and move on to Portrush.   
 Q.  It's such a difficult game to get everything going at the right time.  Is there a frustrating that the scoring opportunities have been there and that you've not been able to quite take advantage of them perhaps in the way you'd have liked to?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit.  I definitely got frustrated, I bogeyed 11 and then sort of let that bother me and bogeyed 12 after that.  There have been a lot of chances.  I feel like I could be, you know, a few shots better, but at the same time, this is where I'm at.  I could have, would have, should have, but as long as I go^  out tomorrow and try and put it all together and play a good, solid round, I'll be happy with my week's work.   
 Q.  What is the mindset going into tomorrow?  Do you put pressure on yourself from this position or is it a case of going out tomorrow and trying to enjoy it and building towards what will be a big week next week?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, just enjoy it.  If we get another day like this tomorrow, what's not to enjoy, coming out and playing on a nice golf course with nice conditions.   
Yeah, I got off to a slow start and then I played well.  To shoot 3-under for the front nine, considering I was 1-over through four, I felt was pretty good.  If I could keep that sort of golf going through the round, and try to finish the week off on a positive note, I'll be happy enough.
