 Q.   How was the golf course playing?   
RORY McILROY:   It was playing slightly easier than yesterday.   There's a little bit of moisture on the greens early this morning which was nice, so you could see a few balls stopping on the greens.   It's going to get more tricky as the day goes on and the greens are going to dry out.   I could see this leaderboard being very, very bunched going into tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   It's been a couple of weeks since you won the PGA Championship.   What's been the most surprising thing since then?  
RORY McILROY:   Not much.   It felt a lot different than the first one.   It felt like this was great or whatever, but you have to get focused again, there's a few big weeks coming up.   I haven't thought that much about it.   Just trying to get ready for this week and the weeks ahead.   
Maybe after the Ryder Cup, I've got a few weeks to sit back and reflect, but right now I'm just concentrating on here at Barclays and the Playoffs.  
   
 Q.   What has allowed you to be able to go do these things with that much comfort?   
RORY McILROY:   I'm not sure.   I'm just being myself.   The more you're in this position, the more you get used to it.   If somebody asks me a question, I'm going to try to answer it as honestly as possible.
