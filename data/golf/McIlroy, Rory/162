Q. Rory, these rounds don't come around very often.  What was the difference today, 69?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah.  I didn't hit as many fairways.  I got some really bad lies in the rough, as undulating as the greens are and where they tucked the pins away today you couldn't really get to them.  That was one thing.  And I just didn't hole any putts.
I missed a couple of short ones.  I thought they were a little slower today for some reason.  Felt like I couldn't get the ball in the hole and when I did I was reading too much break.
Yeah, I mean I sort of battled the first sort of 12 holes and then it was nice to make a couple birdies on the way in.
Q. When you just smoked the golf ball the day previously, how much harder was it to stay patient?
RORY MCILROY: It is hard to stay patient.  I had two good chances the first two holes and didn't make them and like sort of okay, you know, I had it 3 feet on the 5th hole and missed.  Finally got one to go on 6 and felt like at least I got something going.
Yeah, it's hard to stay patient whenever you know what you've done yesterday, also what was under today.  I didn't want to lose too much ground.  I should have been a few better but, hopefully, that's it.
Q. You did manage to get that a little bit closer to the end.  Look at one of the shots from your day here.  How nice is it to finish on the high note you did?
RORY MCILROY: Much better.  This is a little flighted wedge.  Yeah, I hit a lot of wedge shots close this week over the past couple of days and that part of my game is definitely coming around.  It's nice to see shots like that.
