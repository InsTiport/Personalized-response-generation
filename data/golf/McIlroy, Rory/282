 Q.  Couple quick comments on your round, please?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it was okay.  I guess everyone's probably up here saying the same, it didn't seem as hard as what the scores reflect out there.  I'm even par for the tournament and I'm only five or six back.  I thought that the course was a little more gettable than that.  But it just shows, it's Sawgrass, it's tricky, you got to hit some really quality shots to get the ball close and give yourself opportunities for birdies.  I didn't make many mistakes out there, so didn't play the par-5s quite how I wanted to, but I shot under par at the end of the day and I'm in for the weekend, which was the main objective going out this morning.   
 Q.  After your drive on No. 1, did you tweak your back in any way?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I've been struggling with it a bit this week, sort of felt it for the first time on Sunday.  Then I've just sort of been managing it since.  So it's okay, it's manageable, it's not, obviously not a hundred percent, but it's good enough to get myself around here for the next couple of days.  I'm going for a MRI scan on Monday just to make sure it's not serious and then I'll see what we do from there.   
 Q.  Did you ask for relief on 16?  
RORY MCILROY: I did.  I was trying to, I was sort of chancing my luck a little bit to see if I could get it, but I sort of was pretty, I was pretty certain that he wasn't going to give me relief, so I was asking the question and see what happens.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY: Look, it's in the same area as what the injury was at the start of the year, I said over there, if that injury was an eight or a nine in terms of pain and soreness and stiffness, this is around a four or five.  So it's, it might just be a flare-up of what happened previously and I just need to rest for a few days and it might be okay.  Hopefully that's what it shows in the scan next week.  But, yeah, there's so many unknowns because we don't even know, unless you get an image taken of it and you know exactly what's going on you don't know, so just making sure that the tissue around it is as loose as it possibly can be and at least the warm weather helps keep it not stiffened up.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY: No, that's not it, I think what it was, I had the injury, and then I played a few, I played three out of four weeks or four out of five or whatever it was leading up to Augusta and then I took a little bit of time off, so my body adapted and got used to playing and practicing again.  And I took three weeks off and then I went back at it begin on Friday and instead of maybe gradually building it up again, I hit balls for four or five hours on Friday and did the same on Saturday.  I felt a bit of stiffness on Sunday, hit a couple of drives that didn't feel quite right.  So I maybe should have just taken it a bit easier over the weekend, but I was excited to get back, excited to get ready to play again and so maybe just being a little over keen was a detriment.   
 Q.  Is there anything beyond rest?  Treatment or it sounds like maybe?  
RORY MCILROY: It's treatment.  So I'm getting a MRI on Monday when I land back in Belfast, just treatment now.  Again, thankfully it feels more muscular than joint or bone at this point.  I feel like I can distinguish what the difference is between the two, so this, it's just about making sure that there's no, that this left rhomboid doesn't go into spasm and doesn't really tighten up around the joint.  So just working on that, as I said, but the warm weather helps, it doesn't get, it helps it stay a little looser.
