Q. Disappointment?
RORY McILROY: It is, I guess.  It's good and bad in a way the way I'm feeling.  I play Gary Woodland tomorrow.  I'll just see if I beat Gary.  Gary won today.  Emiliano could do me a favor and beat Soren.
I played well.  If I had of played anyone else I might have won.  Soren played great.  I think I have to give him credit.  He played really, really well, from the first hole.  He made birdie at the first, and his wedge play was very sharp all day.  He didn't miss any real makeable putts.  He sort of holed everything he should have.  And just played a really solid round of golf.  It's hard to beat that, especially when the wind is getting up.  I mean 6-under for 17 holes around here is really good.
Q. Obviously you played well, as well.
RORY McILROY: I feel like 16 was the turning point.  I hit a great drive and had a wrong club for my second shot.  I should have hit 3-wood up there to the green.  I hit 5-wood and came up short where I had a really difficult chip shot.  And I didn't get that up and down.  I think that was the real turning point in the match.
17 I had an opportunity to match him.  But I felt like I had a good shot in there.  Went 20 feet behind the hole, and it's a tricky putt.
Overall I can't be too disappointed, but at the same time when standing on the 14th tee, just having won three holes in a row, I thought I had him going into a tough stretch of the golf course.  But he put up three birdies in a row and you can't do anything about that.
