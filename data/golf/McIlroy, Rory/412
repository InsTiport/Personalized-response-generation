 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
RORY McILROY: Probably a little better than I was expecting out there to be honest.  The one thing, when I was hitting balls this morning on the range, I mean, I had not been out of bed for basically 48 hours, so I was really stiff.  Like I was really, really stiff.  I needed to loosen up quite a lot.  But whenever I got out there, I felt pretty good.   
Thankfully it was a decent start, and now going to try to just get into the tournament.   
 Q.  Diagnosis, definitely food poisoning?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, just one of those things.  It happens.  Looking forward to a good dinner tonight but hopefully it will stay inside my body.   
 Q.  We've heard all sorts of things about losing so much weight.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I've lost ten pounds since being here.  I can't remember the last time I was this light.  But hopefully a couple of good meals over the next couple days and rehydrate and I'll be feeling a lot better.   
 Q.  When you say aches and pains, does that translate to the golf?  Scoring is pretty good in the circumstances?  
RORY McILROY: Felt like I played okay.  Tee-to-green was pretty good.  Disappointed I missed three good chances coming in there on the front nine and didn't quite capitalize on those.  So it was a score that I thought could have been a lot better but considering the position I was in this time yesterday, it's not a bad start.   
 Q.  Given the heat and humidity here, that probably didn't help too much, did it.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, try to keep as much liquid in as possible and take on as much fluid as I can and keep doing those things and hopefully I'll keep feeling better and better as the week goes on.   
 Q.  Good get a score like that under your belt with three more days to go; that's a decent foundation.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it isn't too bad.  Get out a little earlier tomorrow.  Hopefully shoot a decent score, and get myself in there for the weekend.
