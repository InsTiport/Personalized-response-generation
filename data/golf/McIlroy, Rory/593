 Q.   Your best round of the week here.   What was it that you felt was favoring you here today?  
RORY MCILROY:   I played the front nine better today.   I think that was what the key was.   I obviously finished the round off well, I birdied the last three holes for the second day in a row, so I feel very comfortable on the back nine here; and just played the front nine a little better and it ended up in shooting a lower score.   
Overall, it's been another solid week, another top‑10 it looks like, another back door top‑10 as I like to call them, but it's getting close.   I'm playing really well, I'm playing solid.   I equalled my lowest round ever here at Sawgrass today with a 66, so things are heading in the right direction.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, going to ‑‑ yeah, I was supposed to go to Rome, but Caroline pulled out, so we're going to spend a few days in London and do a bit of shopping and see a few shows and take it easy.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   No, probably not.   Probably head back down to Monaco for the weekend and then come back up to Wentworth.  
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Definitely.   Last Sunday in Charlotte I gave myself a lot of chances and didn't really convert that many and I still shot a solid round, but not what I felt like I could have done.   
Any time you shoot 66 and you move up a lot of spots on the leaderboard, I think I was 120th at one point in this golf tournament on Friday afternoon.   So to go from there to finishing in the top‑10 is a good effort.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   It is, yeah.   It goes Wentworth, Memorial, U.S. Open, Irish Open, Scottish Open, Open Championship, Akron, PGA, FedExCup, it's a lot, it's a really busy summer of golf.   So the weeks off in between are going to be vital, just to sort of rest and recharge the batteries.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY:   Limit the mistakes.   Just keep the real big numbers off the card and these bogey runs that I seem to be getting on, just kind of keep it a little tighter, whenever I don't quite have my A game and that's really it.   But as I've been saying the last few weeks, I'm seeing enough really good golf in there to be really positive going into the sort of main stretch of the season.
