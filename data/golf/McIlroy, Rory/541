  RORY McILROY: I think today was just a combination of trying too hard and then I feel like whenever I have played a lot of golf, my attitude can get sort of -- I was very sort of reactive about bad shots and bad breaks today, which I haven't been the last two weeks.  So I think that's a little bit of mental fatigue kicking in there. It's been -- obviously wasn't a day that I wanted today.  But it's been a decent week, a top five.  Improved my position in the FedExCup.  I'm going next week to Denver with a chance to get back to No. 1 again.  It hasn't been all bad.  But obviously a little disappointed with the way I putted.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean I think the bigger goal for me was top two going into Atlanta is very big.  It seems like those top two positions have a much greater chance of winning the overall thing.  Hopefully I can consolidate where I am next week in Denver and play another solid tournament and give myself another chance to win, that's all I can ask. At this point I'm just looking for wins.  And today was a great opportunity.  But it didn't quite materialize.  But there's always next week, which is great.   Q.  You said you had some mental fatigue.  How do you relax?  RORY McILROY: Yeah, I might take tomorrow off, even though I haven't played the course, Cherry Hills.  I think it's important for me to conserve as much energy as possible going into the final two events.  So I'll probably take tomorrow off.  And then just play the Pro Am as my practice round.
