Q.   Rory, quite nice round today, 6 under.   Talk about the second round. 
RORY McILROY:   It was good.   It was another solid day.   Yeah, I played well.   I drove the ball really well again today.   That's the big key for me around here.   I'm taking driver off every hole that I can and set myself up with short irons into greens and taking advantage of those. 
I putted a little better today as well.   Obviously, seeing what Sergio was doing on the back nine, I knew I needed to make a few coming in just to try to stay within touching distance of him going into the weekend, and I feel like I did that. 
Really happy with how I played today, and hopefully I can do the same over the weekend.

Q.   What does birdieing the last holes do for you going into an early day tomorrow? 
RORY McILROY:   It does a lot.   Obviously, it's a great way to finish the day.   Instead of me being six behind Sergio going into the weekend, I'm only four behind.   So that makes a big difference as well.   Just really happy with how I played the last few holes. 
Putting the ball way down there and giving myself wedges into greens and taking advantage of that, that's the big key for me around here.   If the driver's on for me like it is then, I feel like there's some low numbers.

Q.   You're able to get to some of those more difficult hole locations with the shorter irons, take advantage of that? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, even the guys that don't hit it quite as far, because it's soft this week, they're still being able to hit it pretty close.   Definitely, it is an advantage to hit it longer on this course and give yourself short irons or wedges into some of these greens or hole positions. 
As I said, hopefully, I can drive it just the same as I did the first couple of days over the weekend and give myself lots more opportunities for birdies.
