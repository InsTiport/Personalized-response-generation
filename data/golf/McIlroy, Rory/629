Q.   That round got off to a horrible start, two bogeys.   How good to finish with 67? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was nice.   As you said, it wasn't the best way to start.   Especially I hit it green‑side in two at the second and made bogey from there. 
But, you know, I stayed patient and knew that there was chances out there.   67 is a nice way to finish this week.   Obviously not quite good enough.   I don't think anyone could have caught Henrik this week.   He seems to be on a different level than everyone else.

Q.   You seem to have been improving rapidly the last few weeks.   What are your expectations the next few months? 
RORY McILROY:   It's been good.   There's been a lot of progression, a lot of positive signs.   If I can just score a little bit better in areas, not waste too many shots, like getting off to a bad start like today. 
I feel like I'm hitting enough good shots and making enough birdies.   I'm just trying to eradicate some of those sloppy shots and those mistakes, and when I do that, then obviously expectations will be very high.

Q.   Lots going on for you this year.   What's the biggest thing that you've learnt? 
RORY McILROY:   Honestly, I think I've learned a lot of things this year.   It's probably I need to sit down at the end of the year and come back to you.   It's been a learning year.   It's been a very transitional year, a lot of stuff going on, new equipment, a few things off course that haven't really helped either. 
But for the most part, I'm just really happy that my game is back where I want it to be and that's all I really care about. 

Q.   What's your verdict on this week?
RORY McILROY:   It's been good.   I felt coming here I had a good chance to win.   I felt like my game was in good shape.   But it didn't quite happen.   Henrik is playing too good for everyone it looks like right now. 
I'm happy.   It's another good week.   It's another Top‑10.   It's a step in the right direction.   You know, still got a couple tournaments left this year to try and get that win, but I feel like I'm edging closer and closer.

Q.   Did you still fancy your chances just that little bit into the final round here today?
RORY McILROY:   I did, and then I bogeyed the first two.   That sort of put an end to that.   But I thought if I can go out and shoot something very, very low, it might have a chance.   But Henrik was just‑‑ it probably would have been good enough for second place but Henrik is just too good this week.

Q.   How do you reflect on the season as a whole? 
RORY McILROY:   As a whole, obviously it's been disappointing.   It has not been the season that I've wanted.   But at least I've ended it on a positive note and started to play better towards the end of the season.   I'm very happy with that and at least that gives me some momentum going into next year.   But yeah, I'm happy that The European Tour season of 2013 is officially over. 

Q.   As a man who enjoyed the success in the States and in Europe last year, Henrik Stenson is doing the same, so give your appreciation. 
RORY McILROY:   It's tough, you have to, it feels like you win‑‑ I didn't finish the FedExCup.   Henrik won the FedExCup.   But you have to keep giving yourself goals all the time each month, just to try and finish it off.   He's done really well. 
He's played all these four events in this Final Series and he's really wanted to get the job done, and he's been pushed all the way; Rose and Poulter and G‑Mac and even Victor out there, they have pushed him all the way.   He's responded in unbelievable fashion so he definitely deserves this.
