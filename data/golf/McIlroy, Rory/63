 Q.  Talk about the day today.  
RORY McILROY: Frustrating. I don't feel like I got the best out of myself. Yeah, obviously started the week well, and then, yeah, I feel like I just -- I hit some loose shots, and I didn't putt as well as I needed to over the last three days. And yeah, I just let a few shots get away.   
 Q.  Easy fix do you think?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm just looking forward to a week off. Looking forward to getting away for a little bit.
