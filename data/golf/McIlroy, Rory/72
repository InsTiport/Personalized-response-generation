Q. 5-under after five. Talk through the amazing start?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was a nice start. Yeah, I thought at that point, you know, it was sort of looking like, geez, I could shoot something really low with three par 5s coming up. But it wasn't to be. Just one more birdie after that. Obviously no dropped shots. But decidedly average after the 5th hole.
Yeah, it was okay. I mean, it's very easy out there. The scoring is very low. We did well as a team. My dad did well again. We're up there in the team event. I just need to make a few more putts fall over the weekend at St. Andrews.
Q. Did he finish 3-under par out there himself today?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think he did, 3-under par -- I don't want to say that too loudly, he might get cut tonight by Johann. He made some great birdies. He's got us in a really good position in the team event after two days.
Q. You obviously want to win the individual event here, but what would it mean to win the team event, as well?
RORY McILROY: Honestly it would probably mean more to me to win the team event than it would to win the individual, just to do it with him and how much this event means to him and how much he enjoys it.
I'm trying just as hard for him out there as I am for myself, even though I know if I play well, that helps both of us.
