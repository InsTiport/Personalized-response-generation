Q. What are your reflections out there?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I thought I played quite nicely.  I was 4-under through seven.  Made a couple bogeys around the turn on 8 and 11.  But just as the wind was picking up on the back nine, I felt like I did what I needed to do.  I birdied the two par 5s.  It was sort of tough to get it close to the holes coming in just because the wind had picked up.  But yeah, overall, pretty pleased with how the day went.
Q. It did seem like you might be slightly disappointed with that number.  Did it feel like that?
RORY McILROY: I dropped back to 2-under after 11, so to pick up a couple up on the way in, with the way the wind was and to not drop any, I thought I did pretty well.  Obviously the scores are low, but it's only the first round, and 4-under is a decent start.
Q. Looked like the greens were slowing down into the late afternoon.  Did you notice that and did that affect you?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, they have been sort of slow all week.  Definitely a lot slower than what we're used to seeing week-in, week-out.  I think, as well, because it's a new golf course, they have never been here before.  They are just being a little careful in terms of the green speeds.
