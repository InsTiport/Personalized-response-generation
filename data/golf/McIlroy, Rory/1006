  Q. A bit of frustration with the putter?   
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I think it was a day of frustration with everything. It was just a really slow start of day. I couldn't really get anything going. I couldn't get any momentum out there. I didn't really hit it -- JP just said to me, the par 5s weren't the best today, so obviously you know, you need to take advantage of them out here, which I didn't.   
 But I'm still within a couple of shots of the lead. Depends what the guys do on the last two holes there. But I'm still in with a great chance.  
 I was flat the whole day be to honest, ever since the first tee shot, just a little flat. I just struggled to really get anything going.  
  
  Q. You get those days?   
 RORY McILROY: You do. But you get those days and you still shoot 69, not too bad.  
  
  Q. How was it playing with Alvaro?  
 RORY McILROY: It was fun.   
  
  Q. I noticed on the second he went for the green, but you stuck to your own game plan, you didn't have any match with him?  
 RORY McILROY: No, not at all. I mean, I don't pay attention to what anybody does on the golf course, apart from myself.   
  
  Q. How do you rate your chances then?  
 RORY McILROY: You know, I need to get off to a better start than what I did today.  
 So yeah, I feel as if I can get a couple early birdies, maybe a couple under through five, I'll be in with a shout, so hopefully I can get off to a start like that tomorrow, and you know, my last -- my figures in the last round have been pretty good.   
 So just looking for a fast start and try and keep it going from there.   
  
  Q. If you get off to a fast start, you put pressure on the others, don't you?  
 RORY McILROY: You do. I just need to get off to a more energetic start tomorrow.
