Q. Rory, your lowest round too at TPC Sawgrass, 64.  You've had a couple of 66s.  Loads of highlights, but we'll start with the one blemish on your card there.  Just the thinking behind laying up and not going for it in two at the par-5.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I guess I've got it in my head with the 9th hole that any time that I have went for the green it hasn't really worked out well for me.
I had a good number today and I mean I laid it up with a 9-iron.  I probably had 2-iron to the front of the green and in hindsight with that pin being on the left side anywhere up the right I probably would have had a chance to get up-and-down.
So, I thought that, get it within a hundred yards and take my chances from there.  And I just didn't hit a great third shot.
So, I mean, maybe if I had to have it back, I might go for the green again, but it was in my head that just try and talk your chances from inside a hundred yards, try and get it up-and-down and yeah, just under hit the first one and left myself in a difficult position.
Q. Overall your lowest round here on a course that you kind of said has baffled you in the past.  To post that number with wonderful conditions this morning gives you what sort of lift now heading into the weekend?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I mean, I said it yesterday, I felt like we played a completely different golf course to the guys in the morning yesterday.
So, it will probably be the same again.  It was benign, soft greens.  I mean, the back nine, you couldn't get it any easier today.  So to take advantage of that was really nice.
Then as the day went on the conditions were starting to get a little tougher, felt like the front nine played a little tougher with some of the pin position.
And it was going well, it would have been great to get that four at the last, but to be able to take advantage of the course when I needed to, that was nice.  And 64 is still a great score and I'm hopefully not going to be too far behind going into the weekend.
Q. Undoubted highlight today, you look at this, you talked about momentum in the post round yesterday, at this point you were really riding that and that was crucial to your round, then this to halve your score from yesterday here?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, this was nice.  I was making sure I wasn't going anywhere near the water today.  But, no, that was good, that's always, I was just trying to get it down there and make a four.  So to see that drop was nice.
But I hit a lot of quality shots today, I felt like my game's been under control for the last couple of weeks now or at least the last sort of four rounds, so hopefully I can continue to feel like that over the weekend.
