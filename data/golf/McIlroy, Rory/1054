 Q. Three under par through 13, what were you thinking at that stage getting closer to the leaders?
 RORY McILROY: It was a pretty difficult day out there and I thought I was doing very well, three under through 13 was a good score but I just let a few slip at the end. I hit a bad drive at the 14th and got away with it and just missed the green to the right and had a terrible lie. It could have been better but I am still there or thereabouts.

 Q. Is fatigue a factor, you have had a lot of attention in America over these last three weeks?
 RORY McILROY: Not really, it shouldn't be. I have been trying to conserve my energy and doing as little as possible to be honest. All my practice sessions have been quality rather than quantity, I haven't hit many balls. It has been a great three weeks but it would be nice to shoot a good one tomorrow and head home for a couple of weeks.

 Q. Do you feel there is a low one out there because it looks like you are going to need it?
 RORY McILROY: Yes, I do, but it looks like it is going to be a bit of a two-horse race. But if I can go out and shoot in the mid 60s and get myself as high up the finishing leaderboard as possible, then it will have been another good week.
