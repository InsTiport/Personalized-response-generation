  Q. Congratulations on a strong defence.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm obviously very disappointed at the minute. I didn't play very well today, and didn't take my chances and just was a bit of a struggle really.   
 It doesn't matter anymore; I want to win and didn't even put myself in a position today to do that. I didn't really get anything going. I suppose it was very difficult out there today with the wind but I sort of played okay the first few holes and I just didn't take my chances. Like 20-foot putts, you know, you need to hole maybe two or three out of ten and I just didn't hole any.   
  
  Q. When you look back, still proud of the way you defended this week, because you were right in the thick of it.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, but I expect to be every week. So yeah, I'm still disappointed with not putting any pressure on the guys on ton.   
  
  Q. A question of trying to get momentum, but hard with the blustery wind?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's hard to get momentum, and I should have made birdie on 3. If I made birdie on 3, you know, I hit a good putt on 4 that didn't go in for birdie. You know, those two sort of -- I just wasn't able to get birdies early, and that's what you needed to do.
