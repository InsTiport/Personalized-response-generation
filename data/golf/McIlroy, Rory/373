Q. What happened today?
RORY McILROY: I didn't make enough birdies.  I felt like my game was okay for the most part.  I didn't take advantage of the holes I should have.  I couldn't birdie any of the par 5s and that's really what killed me today.
Q. You talked earlier in the week about fine margins and it seemed like it was one of those days where they were as fine as they could be?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, they were, they really were.  I'll take a lot of positives from this, this week.  A lot of things did go right for me.  But I need to just pick myself back up and get into contention again in Orlando in a couple weeks' time and let's see if I can get the win there.
Q. Just in the context of that, being in contention and not getting the job done, inside, how frustrating is that?
RORY McILROY: It's frustrating because it's two out of the last three weeks.  I was leading the golf tournament with 16 holes to play in Riviera.  I was leading the golf tournament here for -- going into the back nine, and to not get the job done in either two of those instances is very frustrating.
So I've got two events left to try to get that win before going to Augusta and I'm hopefully going to get it.
Q. Do you think that's the opportunity to reap the benefits of putting these extra events in; it does give you the best opportunity to be in the right place for Augusta?
RORY McILROY: It does, yeah, it really does.  I feel like my schedule is good leading up to Augusta, and I feel like my game is in good shape.  I just need to figure out what I'm doing in these final rounds and try to rectify it.
But as you said, it's fine margins and today was fine margins.  I felt like for the most part I played okay.  I didn't play as well as I could have done but I definitely played well enough to at least give myself a chance.
I wish I could have just done more on the front nine, but as I said, there's plenty of positives to take from this week, and I'll get back at it next week in practice and hopefully get myself back into contention and do a better job of trying to finish the tournament off in Orlando.
