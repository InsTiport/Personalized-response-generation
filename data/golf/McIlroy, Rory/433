Q. I think the look on your face says it all.  How frustrating a day was it out there?RORY McILROY: It was frustrating, especially how I felt I hit the ball from tee to green.  I drove the ball great.  I hit my iron shots very, very well.  Even when you hit good iron shot, getting it to 25, 30 feet is a good shot at times. I felt like I gave myself enough chances out there to convert a few and wasn't able to do that.  Missed a couple of short-ish putts on the last few holes there and definitely thought it was a day where you could shoot under par and I didn't take advantage of that.Q. What do you think of the putting surfaces out there?RORY McILROY: They are not the best that I've ever putted on.  I still feel like if you make a good enough stroke and you have the right speed, there's a good enough chance the ball will go in.  I need to find a rhythm in my stroke over the next three days, work a bit on the putting green and hopefully it will be better tomorrow.Q. Scores are definitely there to be made at the moment.  Do you think there is a low one there to get you back into the tournament?RORY McILROY: I definitely think so if I can keep hitting the ball as well as I did off the tee.  And if I can hit my irons, I hit a lot of fairways and greens, I just didn't quite have it with the putter today and that's something that I need to get right over the next three days if I want to have a chance.
