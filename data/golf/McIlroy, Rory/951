 Q. Can you give us your thoughts on another very tough battle out there? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was tough. We played pretty good. Got ourselves in a nice position going down 16, and just couldn't finish it off. But it was tough out there and I actually thought we played pretty well. Just the better guys won. 

 Q. You experienced the highs and lows of match-play golf again, you have to lift yourselves, you're together again this afternoon. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, someone out there thinks we are a pretty good pairing, so we are excited to get back out there again. 
 Stewart Cink, Matt Kuchar, two very in-form players and two very good foursomes players. They scrambled really well out there today. 16 was massive; we are looking in command there and we lose the hole. 17 we are in command and we lose the hole. That kind of summed it up really. 

 Q. 4-6 in the overall context, massive session coming up. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, another session with six games, so, yeah, it's going to be big. We have got to win at least four of them, anyway. 
 So yeah, I think the team is still in good spirits and we can go out there and give it a good shot this afternoon and tomorrow morning.

 Q. A bit of momentum this afternoon, get a couple of numbers up on the board early and get a revival underway? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Yeah, the team is certainly good enough to survive this. Not down and out by any stretch of the imagination. We still have 18 points to play for, so game on.
