  Q. You talked about getting it into position for the weekend. Is this how you planned it?  
 RORY McILROY: It is, yeah, I feel as if I'm in a really good position going into the weekend and yeah I like the position I'm in. It's a nice place to be. And only three behind at the minute. We'll see how the guys in the afternoon make out, but I feel as if I'm in a strong position and a position where I can make a charge for the weekend.   
  
  Q. Talk us through the ninth hole there, your last.   
 RORY McILROY: I hit a good 3-wood off the tee and had 160 yards to the pin, straight downwind, I thought. And I hit a pitching wedge and I think a gust just hit it from left-to-right and it sort of kicked off the slope of the bunker and hopped the bunker and then went into the hazard. And I didn't even know if it was my ball or not.   
 I couldn't really see so I just identified it and then hit a pretty nice shot out to 10 or 12 feet and really tried hard over the putt just to sort of end the round on a good positive note and I was able to do it.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 RORY McILROY: The wind was a lot, it definitely freshened for our last nine holes. Especially the holes first, second, third, fourth, going into the wind. I don't know what the -- when the fourth hole, it wasn't too bad when we played it. I hit a driver and a great drive and a good 3-iron so I'm sure the guys out there now are going to struggle to get up in two.   
  
  Q. Talking about making a charge for the weekend. Do you feel like you're in a position that you have to charge?  
 RORY McILROY: No, no, no, it's just a figure of speech. It just means I can go and, I'm in a great position and I can just go out and I'm not that close to the lead and I'm three behind and I can just go out and play some good positive golf.
