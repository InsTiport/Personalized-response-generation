 Q.  You win last week, the only guy in the field that's won on this golf course, you got to come in with some good feelings and expectations.  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, when I saw the golf course again on Wednesday, it was playing a lot different than how it played in 2012.  But then with all the rain yesterday, it's playing very similar.  It's soft, basically we're throwing darts out there and it's just a matter of converting the chances that you're giving yourself.   
 Q.  It LOOKED like those greens still had all kinds of fire in them this morning.  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, they're a good speed, there's a few that can sort of run away from you, but if you hit well struck iron shots, they're going to stay pretty much where they land.  So I would expect some lower scores again as the day goes on.   
 Q.  Do you like the fact that you're getting ready to go right back out there, especially after birdieing 18?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I'm getting used to these five o'clock wake-up calls, that's for sure.  With the early starts last week and this week again, hopefully we can get it all done today and we can get back on a normal schedule tomorrow.  But, yeah, I'm looking forward to getting back out there and obviously trying to shoot another good one.   
 Q.  You keep driving the ball so beautifully so that you got to watch your through lines on the fairways.  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, there's a few holes here where you have to cut some corners if you're hitting it quite long.  Prime example, 18 there, I pulled it a little bit, but, yeah, if I can continue to drive it well -- especially with how soft the fairways are -- and putt well, that's a good recipe for success around this place.   
 Q.  Was Deutsche Bank training for you with early morning wake-up calls and long days?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, there was a few early starts at Deutsche Bank and then obviously here this week I had the early pro-am on Wednesday and then I got to slept until 7 on Thursday, which is nice and then up again early this morning.  So, hopefully we can get back on schedule this afternoon and then hopefully a nice lie-in tomorrow morning.
