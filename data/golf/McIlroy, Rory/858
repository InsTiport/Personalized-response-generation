 Q. So going off on holiday now? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I actually got off to a really good start. Birdied the first two holes and then I had a few pars, had a few chances on the front nine and didn't take them. I was able to play well coming in, birdied three of the last four. So wasn't what I was looking for but it's still solid.

 Q. Now your plans are to have a bit of time off?
 RORY McILROY: Two weeks off which I'm really going to enjoy because I've been on the road for the last six weeks. So two weeks off will be nice, and then back and play World Cup, Hong Kong and Dubai. 
 Not really what I was looking for today but finished the quite off well. I would have had to do something very special to keep up with Martin today. A little disappointed but looking forward to my two weeks off. 

 Q. Last night you thought there was something special on the way?
 RORY McILROY: I had two good shots into the first and holed a nice putt and thought it was a perfect way to start the round. I had a good chance on 5, good chance on 7, good chance on 8 and I missed them all. So I probably could have held a few more putts. 

 Q. Were you then trying to push it? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit, got too aggressive, made bogey on 11 trying to get it to the pin and was really trying to push on 14 and just didn't hit a very good shot.
 But it was nice to birdie 15 after that and birdie 16 and 18.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 RORY McILROY: No, I don't think so. I feel like I played very well, kept my standard up all the way through. I obviously feel as if I could have shot lower out there today. I'm driving the ball as well as I have but didn't hole the putts when I needed to and that was pretty disappointing.
 Mentally I feel fine. Obviously I'm looking forward to these two weeks off, but I feel like this little stretch has been very good. 

 Q. Taking your clubs? 
 RORY McILROY: No, JP is taking them for me and I'll see them at the World Cup.
