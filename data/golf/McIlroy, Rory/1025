  Q. Well done, perhaps enough, but what a final round.   
 RORY McILROY: It was great. I got off to a great start, made seven birdies on the front nine, so it was a great way to start. And then made three on the way in, so I missed about an 8-footer on 15, and I missed one on the last there.   
 So those two got away but apart from that I played really well and got myself into contention and got myself on the leaderboard and I was happy with the way I handled myself and probably just come up a couple short.  
  
  Q. What was the key today, what clicked?   
 RORY McILROY: I've been working hard this week, and my ball-striking wasn't the best the first few days. I hit it very poorly on Thursday and as the week progressed, I've hit it gradually better and better and today everything just sort of clicked into place, and I hit my irons well and got it up-and-down when I needed to. It was just a very, very solid round.  
  
  Q. Did this have the potential to be a launchpad round in many respects? It's done your Race to Dubai chances no end of good?  
 RORY McILROY: It certainly gives me a lot of momentum going into the next two weeks. I'm feeling a lot better about my game than I was at the start of the week, but yeah, I'm sure it is. Hopefully it's a bit of a springboard into the next two weeks, and yeah, looking forward to it now.  
  
  Q. Were you a little bit down at the start of the week?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I wasn't happy with my game. I was a little bit tired, a bit grumpy. But I worked at it and I worked at it, and you know, it's coming around, and today, it was really nice to see a few go in. It was great to shoot a low number.   
  
  Q. That must give you more satisfaction than anything else, to turn the week around like that?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, after starting with a 73, and then being 2-over after 19 holes in the tournament, and then coming back; so I've my last 53 holes in 16-under par, which is pretty good around here. So I'm happy with that.   
  
  Q. Was there a moment there where you thought, I've got a chance here?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I got within two after nine. Mickelson dropped to go back to 13 and I was at 11, and I thought if I could post 15 or 16 it will be a good target but obviously I didn't know Ernie was going to do what he's doing and obviously Phil is hanging in there.  
 Yeah, I give myself a great chance and yeah, I probably just need a couple more putts to go. Yeah, I'm very still happy with the way I finished.  
  
  Q. You obviously knew how well you were playing. Was it a surprise to look at those boards after nine?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, and Tiger fell off the board, as well, and I was like, I wonder what happened there. I was looking at the board on 81, and he obviously doubled the fourth and bogeyed 6 and 7. But he's come back well. Still Ernie and Phil are both on 16, and we'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. You touched on The Race to Dubai there, given the amount of money you'll earn and the boost that you'll get from this and the way the others are going, it's all in a good direction, isn't it?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm making ground all the time. I made up ground a little bit last week at the Match Play, if Lee plays in and doesn't do anything spectacular, I'll make a little bit of ground up again. I don't know how Martin has finished. I don't know if I'll be second or third or whatever I'll be, but I'll be closer than I was at the start of the week, which is a good thing.
