Q.   Did darkness have anything to do with you missing?
RORY McILROY:   Probably, yeah.   Even the green before it was hard to see your line.   I think with just a little bit more speed that putt might have went in on the last hole there.   But I think it was a good idea to call it when we did and come back in the morning and try again.

Q.   A lot of ebb and flow in that match, how would you best describe it?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was back and forth.   The quality wasn't quite there as much as it was in the first one.   But still I think it was 3â€‘under par for the 18 holes, so it wasn't too bad.   The conditions were cold, it was a little breezy.   The greens were getting a little slower as the day went on, as well.   You had to take all those things into consideration.   And I'm just happy I'm still here in some sort and again try and win this thing tomorrow.

Q.   I know you had ambitions earlier in the week to make it to Las Vegas and see the big fight on Saturday night.   That's obviously not going to happen.   Getting up for what could be just one hole tomorrow, how do you mentally prepare yourself for that?
RORY McILROY:   That's fine.   I have to do it.   It's the position I'm in.   And I'll be here at 6:45 in the morning.   And I'll try and come out fast and win that hole and try to advance to the last four. 

Q.   Have you ever been in a suspended match play match before?
RORY McILROY:   No, not really.   I'm not sure it's ever really happened before, with the guys pushing tee times back so late, this obviously could have been avoided if we went off a little earlier.

Q.   Was there any talk of continuing?
RORY McILROY:   No.

Q.   You go home tonight happy or frustrated?
RORY McILROY:   I'm frustrated.   I had two opportunities to close the match out and I didn't.
