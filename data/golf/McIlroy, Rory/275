Q. Just general thoughts on the day.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, what can I say.  I was a little rusty out there.  I feel like I turned a 75 or a 76 into a 73, so it wasn't all bad.  But yeah, I didn't hit enough fairways, didn't hit enough greens.  Felt like I was scrambling all day.  But I scrambled pretty well, and I birdied two of the last three holes to make it somewhat respectable.
Q. What happened on 10?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was just a bit of a loss of concentration.  I went to tap one in, and it came straight left off the putter, and thought to myself, I'd better mark the next one.  Yeah, just one of those things.  It was definitely a cheap shot given away, but as I said, just to make a couple coming in was nice.  At least gives me a chance to go out and shoot a good one tomorrow and get myself in the mix.
Q. You talked the other day about the golf ball, testing in conditions.  With the wind today was this a good test for you to know what it was going to do?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it definitely goes through the wind a lot better, which I'm happy about.  It wasn't -- I mean, we only had a little bit of breeze the last few holes.  I felt like it was pretty calm throughout the day.  But my -- it was hard to know.  I wasn't hitting from the fairway too much, so it's hard to control your distance from the rough here with any golf ball, let alone one that you like.  Hopefully I can hit it on the fairway a bit more tomorrow and give myself a few chances from there.
Q. You said yesterday you felt like everything had come together in your life.  Do you feel a little bit more relaxed maybe?
RORY McILROY: Yeah.  I mean, not -- like if there was any weight on anyone's shoulders, it was Erica; she was the one stressing over the wedding.  I was like, it'll be fine.  But yeah, it feels normal.  I feel like we've sort of been married for the last year and a half anyway.  We lived together, we traveled together.  There's pretty much nothing she doesn't know about me and vice versa.  It feels pretty much the same.
Q. Is the transition from the range to the course when it's this sort of course as exacting --
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it is difficult.  In fairness, I haven't been able to practice as much as I wanted to the last few days.  I only played nine holes here.  I've been very limited hitting golf balls.  My back has got a little bit stiff again, I guess just from obviously building it up and playing through and then not doing anything for three weeks and then coming back last weekend and hitting balls for four or five hours a day.  Just aggravated that joint in my back again, the thing that sort of happened at the start of the season.  I've sort of been trying to rest that and manage that, so I think that's why I'm a little bit rusty, as well.  But I think this week it's just about trying to manage that and get through the week and try to play with what I have, and then next week try to get that better and try to recover and try to play a good stretch of golf from here through the summer and obviously focus on the majors.
