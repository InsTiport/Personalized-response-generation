Q. Just thoughts on the match today.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, played well.  Probably played a little better than I did yesterday.  We had a good match.  We both had some birdies on the front nine.  I eagled 12, birdied 15 and 16 on the back to close it out.  I needed to play well today to beat Justin.  He's a very good player.  I can see why he's done well so far at the start of the year and just happy to get the win.
Q. Your thoughts on going into tomorrow?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, look, it's a nice position to be in compared to the last couple of years, control my own fate a little bit.  Just got to go out and play well.  I've been looking forward to the match against Fitz for the week, because I've become pretty close to him living down in Jupiter and whatever.  Go out and play similarly tomorrow, take my chances when I can and hopefully get three wins out of three and move on.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's good.  Hitting good shots.  Driving it well.  Iron play is pretty good, converting, yeah, comfortable with pretty much everything.
