 Q. Not the weekend you were hoping for but overall a positive week for you?
 RORY McILROY: Yes. It is probably looking like it is going to be a top-20 finish and a top-20 finish in this field is a pretty good accomplishment. I was in a very good position going into the weekend but just couldn't capitalise on it and I got a bit tired the last couple of days and the adrenalin levels weren't quite there. But it has been a good three weeks and I still feel as if I'm playing pretty good.

 Q. How valuable have those three weeks been?
 RORY McILROY: It has been great, a lot of people have gotten to know me which has been great and I have had a lot of support out here now. It has been a great three weeks but I am looking forward to getting home for a couple of weeks and I'll be raring to go and get back out here and play some more. It has been great and I feel that if I can do a little bit of work at home I'll get myself ready for the next stretch.

 Q. That includes the Masters of course, how excited are you about that?
 RORY McILROY: Can't wait. It is going to be my second event back when I do get back out here. It is right around the corner and the closer it gets, the more excited I'll be. It'll be a great week for me and hopefully one that I will do well at.
