 Q.  How would you assess the week?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I mean obviously really happy with my weekend, playing 11-under on the weekend from just making the cut on the mark and I'm pretty happy with that.  So I feel like I made the most of squeezing in and could have been a few better today, but I would have taken a top-10 on Friday evening.  So I'm happy enough with that and feel like I've seen a lot of good stuff over the last couple of days to give me encouragement heading into the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  What do you think you need to most work on over the next week to get ready for the U.S. Open?  
RORY MCILROY: I feel like I still need to drive the ball a little bit better.  And then everything else feels good.  I feel like I've made some really big strides with wedge play, irons, all that sort of stuff.  I feel like I hit a lot of good putts this week that didn't go in, but made some good putts too.  So my game feels pretty good.  I just, as long as I can keep the ball in play at Shinnecock, I feel like I'll have a good chance.   
 Q.  What's your plan going up there?  
RORY MCILROY: We rented a house for two weeks, so we're up there.  It's better to practice there than it is to practice down in Florida this time of year, just it's soft and rain and humid.  And so we head up there tonight, I'm going to play Shinnecock tomorrow.  And then I'm actually just going to play a few other golf courses around the area the next few days and sort of relax and take it easy up there.
