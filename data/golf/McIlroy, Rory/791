Q.   Rory, it's been a little bit of a struggle over the last few weeks.   You've had some time to re-group.   Looked like you hit it pretty solid.   Are you happy with the way you hit it?
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, for the most part, definitely.   I felt like that was about the best round of golf I played in awhile.   It could have been a lot better.   Middle in the fairway, 3-under par, have a 9-iron into the green, par five.   The scoring doesn't look too good.   Off to a decent start, definitely.   2-under is a decent start.   Definitely so.   Lot of good signs out there.

Q.   I heard the club feels like it's a little underneath the plane a little bit.   The shot you hit at 6, that would have been a shot really hard to hit to the right hole location.   Little bit of a downhill lie.   More on plane.
RORY MCILROY:   Definitely.   I'm getting the club in a better position.   From there you have a little bit of freedom.   You're not trying to protect against a bad shot.   You're trying to hit the shot you can see.   Yeah.   I still feel like it's improving but it's getting.

Q. The freedom off the tee looked really good.   You drove the ball really nicely.   Good luck.
