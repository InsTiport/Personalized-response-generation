  going to -- most times you're going to come out on top. 
 You know, Martin and Ian played very, very well today obviously, and you know, I didn't get off to the best of starts, but you know, I kept patient and you know, hung in there and made a couple nice birdies towards the end. You know, it just wasn't enough. 
 But I mean, you know, it's still a great way to start the season, last group and going down the last one behind and getting juices flowing again, it was a nice feeling, and hopefully that will set the tone for the rest of the year.

 Q. The way you put the foot on the gas and got it going with the opportunity, you've got the birdie at 17 to get a chance down the last is something, isn't it?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, exactly and the up-and-down on 16, as well, and the shot into 15. Those three holes are perfect, and just disappointed that it didn't hit the fairway at the last. But that's the way it goes. I give it my best shot and it's not as if I went out in the last group and shot level par, so I went out and shot a really good score in the conditions and just wasn't good enough. 
 You know, I've got nothing but positives to take from this, because I thought I did very well today. 

 Q. Can you talk me through the deliberations on 18, why you laid up, when Martin had the opportunity and went first?
 RORY McILROY: I didn't have a good enough life. I was thinking about hitting 5-wood, trying to get it up short of the green but the chances of me actually hitting into that gap were very slim so I just hit 8-iron out and take my chances from 120 yards. I just under-hit the wedge shot a little bit, it's one of those things. I'll have plenty more opportunities before the end of the year to get a couple of wins, so I'm pretty pleased 

 Q. On the green itself, it's fine margins where the pin was cut. 
 RORY McILROY: If that pitches another yard or two, it would have been -- it would have been maybe eight feet away, be but it pitched on the slope and came back. That's the way it goes sometimes.

 Q. I imagine all told, you enjoy a tussle with those two for the final day?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was brilliant. I think we all played great golf, which is one of the most important thing. We all made birdies and we all hung in there and you know, Martin made a great birdie at the last, set up by a great tee shot. With he gave the crowd some pleasure out there today and that was nice.

 Q. Martin Kaymer, some talent, isn't he, five tournaments and to come back from injury the way he has?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I with as talking to him about that, the plate that he has in his foot, and it's incredible what he's come back from. You know, this is his fifth win and he's a great player. And yeah, I mean, I'm sure I'll have a lot of battles with him over not just this year but in future years and he'll be a great addition to The Ryder Cup team.
