 Q.  Rory, you found a lot of rough today.  Given how much you were in the rough, you really -- your play around the greens sort of salvaged it, right?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it did.  I think when this rough is a little wetter, it is a little easier as well because the club slides through, it doesn't really get tangled as much.  So, if there was a day to miss fairways, this is probably it.   
But, yeah, the course just played really long today, and I think everyone -- it's not really a day where you were going to give yourself a lot of chances, so I was happy that today was the best I putted in a long time.   
I think even after yesterday I was top-10 in strokes gained putting, which is the first time that's happened in a while as well.  So, definitely positives on that front.  Just obviously disappointed with how I finished.  But, a lot of positives to take from it.   
 Q.  Talk about the stance that you had at 16 and 18.  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I guess as well with the wet rough the ball isn't going anywhere when it hits, so maybe on a dry day both those balls would have came back into the bunker.  Obviously, it would have been an easier up-and-down from there, rather than where I was.   
 Q.  The one on 18, I'm just curious, it's difficult as it is, but the wet, are you nervous about slipping in?  
RORY MCILROY: It's not -- I just couldn't get a stance to where I could aim directly at the pin.  I was aiming about 10 feet right of the pin and trying to hood the club face and sort of manufacture some sort of shot to sort of hit it left of where I was aiming.  So, but, yeah, I tried to have one foot in the bunker and one foot out, but really -- that wasn't going to work.   
 Q.  How good do you feel heading into tomorrow?  
RORY MCILROY: I'd feel much better if I didn't just do that on 18.  I feel good.  It looks like the guys -- it's not like Henrik or Jordan or anyone got away from the field, so right now I'm four behind.   
Last three holes are playing pretty tough, so we'll see where I'm at.  It would have been or sorry, five behind.  It would have been nice to be a little bit closer to the lead going into tomorrow, but I still feel like I have a good chance.   
And I said yesterday I needed to get off to a fast start today and I didn't.  I was 2-over through six holes.  I really need to -- I played the first six holes this week in 4-over par.  I need to play those holes a lot better tomorrow if I'm going to have any sort of chance to win.   
 Q.  How much of your trouble off the tee today is just it's hard to keep dry, it's just you can ascribe it to the weather?  
RORY MCILROY: The one thing that I struggle with, especially for me when the driver face gets wet, it takes a lot of spin off the ball so it's hard.  The more spin you can put on it the tighter you can sort of keep your lines.   
So, and I like to shape the ball off the tee a little bit and with this wet weather, it doesn't really allow me to do that.  So, it's tough.  It's tough for me to just aim out the middle of a fairway and try to, just try to hit a straight one, because that's not the way I play, it's not my game.  But with the wet weather the way it is, it's what I have to do.   
 Q.  It's tough to walk straight much less hit straight.  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah.
