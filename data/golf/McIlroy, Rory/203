Q. Not the way you wanted it to end.
RORY McILROY: Especially after what happened last week, that takes it out of you being in contention, and all that mental energy.  So, I wish I was hanging around for the weekend.  But I'll rest up and get a little bit of work in before going to Augusta.
Q. Last week was obviously two tales, wasn't it?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was.  It was tiring.  And obviously going from winning on Sunday to traveling on Monday, and getting an early practice on Tuesday to play on Wednesday, didn't have a lot of time to sort of recharge the batteries.  I feel like my game is in good shape.  I got off to a bit of a scrappy shot today.  I was 2-under on the back nine and trying to press, and Brian just played really, really well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY: Yeah, we golf.  Obviously a couple of days extra at home, that I wasn't planning on.  But, yeah, just chill out, rest up a little bit, recharge the batteries, get into the gym.  Sort of have a good week training and a good practice week.  And just get myself ready for Augusta.
Q. You're excited about it?
RORY McILROY: I'm excited about it, it should be good.
Q. Is this just the nature of the beast that in match play anything can happen?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it is what it is.  Yeah, as soon as I went dormie I knew that that was it for me, no matter what happened this the match.  Obviously I tried to lay as good as I could.  And to end with a bit of pride.  I left myself behind the 8-ball after losing that first match, and scraped it back little bit.
Brian played great today.  He made a few birdies and didn't really make a mistake.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY: I'm going up on Wednesday and Thursday.  Me and Harry are going up, two members are hosting us, we're going to have a couple of social runs Wednesday and Thursday.
Q. It would have been nice to get some weekend work here?
RORY McILROY: I'm on a flight straight.
Q. It would have been nice to get some weekend work in here.
RORY McILROY: On the range.  Yeah, it would have been, but it is what it is.
