  RORY McILROY:   It's a frustrating golf course because you feel like you should be doing so much better, and it just doesn't allow you to.   You have to be so precise and just to get the ball close on some of these greens and these pin positions; it was more frustration than anything else today, because I felt like I started the round really well. 
I had chances basically on every hole and all of a sudden, I bogey 9 and I turn in even par and I'm just like, you know, I should be 3‑ or 4‑under par here.   I had a lot of looks on the back.   It is frustrating, because I feel like I have played much better than what the finish and the score suggests. 

Q.   This monster has a newfound respect, has it? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, only four or five guys are under‑‑ it's incredible.   It's frustrating because you feel like you can‑‑ I don't know if it's because you've got memories of the course before, like going low, and it just doesn't‑‑ this new‑‑ the way it is now, it just doesn't allow you to do that.

Q.   What's the plan next week?
RORY McILROY:   I'm going to California tonight to see Caroline.   I'll be in Indian Wells and then I'll be with her until she's not in the tournament anymore, whatever that is, and come back to Florida, and spend two weeks at home practicing and getting ready, got Michael Bannon, Steve MacGregor coming over the week of Bay Hill.   So do some good work then and have another week to prepare for Houston, go up to Augusta, see the place there, and play Houston and the Masters.
