  RORY McILROY:   Disappointing, frustrating.   Obviously played nicely the front nine and then started to hit a lot of sloppy shots on the back.   Missed the last six greens in a row.   Missed seven greens on the back nine, so a bit of work needed on the range this afternoon.

Q.   Just one of those things or something that you‑‑
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, just one of those things.   Just hit a couple of bad shots and then I guess I let it affect me a little bit and then I started to doubt myself sometimes.   Didn't hit a lot of quality shots on the back nine.

Q.   I presume there weren't many doubts at all when you had three birdies in a row and you have suddenly cleared the field, even if you noticed. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, as I said, I think I hit the first ten greens, so that wasn't ‑‑ and then I made bogey on 11 and I had a chance at 12 and then from there on 13, I hit a bad drive up the left and then just sort of knocked my confidence a little bit and started to struggle from there.   A bit of work on the range this afternoon and hopefully come out tomorrow and play a bit better.

Q.   Is that consolation that essentially there's no great damage done in terms of position? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I mean, it would have been nice to play a bit better and start tomorrow with a few more shots in hand but I guess I'm in a decent position going into the weekend, and still have a great chance at winning this tournament.
