 Q.  Obviously disappointed to bogey the last hole but IMAGINE going from five behind to tied for the lead, very pleased with the day's work?  
RORY McILROY: It is a good day's work.  I can't let a bit of a disappointing finish change what was a really good day.  Conditions were tough out there.  Felt for the most part, I controlled my ball well.  I held some nice putts.  Felt like I've putted it well this week.   
Yeah, a great day overall, and obviously a great position heading into the weekend.   
 Q.  You told us yesterday that you were working on four or five things in your swing and you were focusing on your swing and not the score.  What was the mind-set when you started to see yourself climb the board?  
RORY McILROY: Exact same.  If I focus on what I need to do in my golf swing, then hopefully the rest will take care of itself.  I will hit some good shots and hopefully take advantage of some of the opportunities that I give myself.   
But it was the same.  It was more just if I make good swings, I'll play well and hopefully have chances for birdies and that's what I'm really concentrating on.   
 Q.  You hit the ball beautifully until the last tee shot.  How does it feel today?  
RORY McILROY: It's good.  It doesn't feel very natural at the minute.  It's quite mechanical and there's a lot going on in terms of what I'm trying to do.  But it feels good.  It's in a good groove.  I'm concentrating a lot on it.  I feel like if I set myself up well with alignment and everything, if I make a good swing, it goes where it should.   
So that's a positive and hopefully I can continue to do that over the next couple of days.   
 Q.  One of the reasons you chose to come here instead of the Bridgestone was it was good preparation for The Open.  Presumably being in the position you're in going into the weekend, it's ideal preparation?  
RORY McILROY: It is.  It's ideal, especially the little bit of breeze we have, as well; the course isn't as firm as I thought it might be but obviously there's been quite a bit of rain over the last few weeks.  Great preparation, last two rounds in contention in tricky conditions, I can't really ask for much more than that.   
 Q.  From our perspective, that was exceptionally good.  So how was your assessment?  
RORY McILROY: It was very good.  I played well.  A little disappointed with my finish at the last but I can't let that change what was a really good day.  I played very well.  I didn't really put a foot wrong until 18.  Hopefully I'm going to continue to do that.   
 Q.  Many situations that last hole could beat you up, but is that the nature of Le Golf National?  
RORY McILROY: It's my only bogey of the day.  So to get around here nearly bogey-free is a pretty good effort.  As I said, it was disappointing to make five at the last, but it's not going to be the last bogey I make this week.  It's just one of those things.  But hopefully I can get that shot back quickly tomorrow when I start off again, and get back into sole possession of the lead.   
 Q.  Looked like it could have been so much lower, as well, so many just shaved the hole.  
RORY McILROY: That's one of the things I was happiest with today was how I putted.  I putted very well, even the ones that didn't go in, looked like they were going to go in.   
Yeah, maybe it could have been a couple better but 66 in those conditions on that golf course, I'll take that anyway.   
 Q.  With the work-in-progress, does it feel that much more fluid at the moment?  
RORY McILROY: Not really, no.  It's not really feeling fluid.  There's a lot of thought in there and it feels quite mechanical.  It seems to be working so far and I know it's going to take a while.  After a week or ten days of practice, it's not going to quite feel natural yet but it's getting there.   
 Q.  Today was your day, 6-under par, you take the lead.  What did you do best today?  
RORY McILROY: Today was a good day.  I played well.  I kept the ball in play.  I drove it well.  Hit fairways, hit a lot of greens.  Sort of what you need to do around this golf course.  I putted well.  Felt like I putted nicely.  Still a couple of putts that didn't quite drop but it felt good out there.  I need two more days like that over the weekend to have a chance and try to win.  But I've put myself in a good position.   
 Q.  When you're sort of talking about bedding in swing changes, how important is it going out there and shoot a 66, knowing it's not your best golf?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, there were good shots, but I'm not really just focusing on the target.  I'm focusing on what I'm doing here.  It's good.  In a way it's nice to go into contention and not really be thinking about the result.  It's a nice thing to have to just be thinking about your swing and thinking about what you need to do here to obviously get the ball close to the hole out there.   
As I said, it's a work-in-progress and it doesn't feel natural.  It doesn't feel very fluid at the minute.  But the more I do it, the more, to use a Tiger term, the more reps I get, the more hopefully it will start to feel a bit more natural.   
 Q.  Can you put a percentage on it?  
RORY McILROY: I don't really know.  I could feel like I'm swinging it at my best and not shoot 66 out there today.  There's a lot of things that need to go right in golf, and it's not just your swing; but I feel like what I'm doing right now is the best way long-term to be a bit more consistent.   
 Q.  How different was yesterday from today?  
RORY McILROY: A little, yeah.  I felt a little more comfortable today than I did yesterday, and I think even the 71 yesterday gave me a little bit of confidence because I hit quite a few good shots in there.  Hit a few loose ones, as well.  I didn't hit as many loose ones today, but yesterday I think gave me the confidence to go out there and commit to it a little bit more.  I needed that one round under my belt competitively to sort of get that out of myself today.   
 Q.  Was there a stand-out shot today that really delighted you?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, there was a few.  I'm working quite hard with my wedges.  The wedge shot I played into the 13th was a really good one.  I was really happy with that.  And it's not really one that would stick out in anyone's mind.  It's one that I was quite pleased with, and I felt like my putting was good.  Even the putts that didn't go in looked like they were going to go in.  That was a positive going into the weekend, as well.   
 Q.  Obviously Royal Troon voting tonight on allowing women members and pretty confident that it will go through; can I get your reaction as if it has, look at your crystal ball.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's about time.  I think I said all I needed to say whenever the Muirfield thing happened, as well.  We're in 2016 here and it's just time -- you've got to move with the times.  I respect that men want their own space, women want their own space.  It happens in every household.  I mean, my mum and dad are in two separate rooms watching their own programmes.  People want their own space; but at the same time you need to make it accessible to everyone.   
It's a good thing that they have and at least that potential cloud over The Open Championship in a couple weeks has been moved away and it's a good thing.   
 Q.  With Muirfield having a second vote later in the year, we could finally put the whole issue behind us hopefully.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think the majority of members -- it wasn't the majority that voted at Muirfield anyway.  They just needed two-thirds, which is tough.  I think the majority of people realise this day and age, it's just not the done thing and make it accessible for everyone if they want it.  Women mightn't even want to be a member at Muirfield but at least give them the option.   
 Q.  You talked about you're just out here going swinging and that's what you want to do for the time you're here.  But at some point, if it continues to go this way, are you going to have to start looking at the leaderboard?  Are you going to have to start thinking about something else?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, of course.  But that's not till before -- that's over sort of 24, 36 hours away until I tee it up in contention in the final round.  Because of course you want to know where you are, but at the same time, I think it's just a nice distraction to have sometimes if you're in the heat of battle just to really focus on what you're doing, because as I said, it sort of takes the result out of it a little bit.   
 Q.  PÃ¡draig has always done that.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I feel like I've always played well with a swing thought or two, but four or five is a little bit more.   
 Q.  Were you still on four or five today?  Did you manage to get it down?  
RORY McILROY: You've got a weak grip, you've got to take it away, you have to fold the right elbow, get the left knee out of the way, so is that four (laughing).
