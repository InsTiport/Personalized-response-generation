 Q.  Missed putts early on.  Your reaction to 16, the bad shot?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was tough.  I think I've been saying all week that you need to get off to a good start on this golf course, and you need to be under par early, and I wasn't able to do that.  I missed a couple of the short ones, as you said, on 1 and 3.  But I knew I had some chances coming up; I birdied 4 and birdied 6.  Had a couple of other chances on the front nine.  Just to be over par on the front was tough because you can't really expect to pick up too many shots on the back nine because of how tough it is playing.  Actually felt like I played okay on the back nine.  Held it together quite well.  I obviously had the bogey on 15, and actually had a decent chance on 16 to make birdie.   
But, yeah, it was one of those days that was a tough day.  I just wish I had gotten off to a better start.  Maybe it would have given me a little bit more of a cushion going into the back nine.   
 Q.  Just frustration (inaudible).  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I actually had to get it -- the club head came loose on it earlier on the week.  I had to get the head re-glued.  So it was probably partly to do with that and partly the throw as well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
RORY McILROY: I'll get it reshafted tonight.  The truck's here, so I'll have it reshafted, and all will be well in the morning.   
 Q.  Did you think that was frustration of that shot or that round or was it just a combination of the whole week?  
RORY McILROY: No, I think it was just I let one go right on the previous hole, the 3-iron, and I did the exact same thing there.  So it was basically just a bad swing.  No one likes to make the same mistake twice, and that's basically what happened.   
 Q.  You made a couple changes in your putting this year.  Will you be making anymore?  
RORY McILROY: No, I mean, like when you're putting in 25-mile-an-hour winds and the greens are a lot slower than you're used to, these things can happen.  I was watching a bit of the golf this morning and I saw a few guys miss a couple of the short putts and it can happen.  When they don't cut the greens or roll the greens, they can get a little bit, not bumpy, they're decent surfaces, but the two putts that I missed early on, I just wasn't comfortable over them.  I sort of read them, and then I'm thinking, do you factor the wind in, do you not?  So I was just a little bit indecisive over them, so I missed them.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
RORY McILROY: You tell me.   
 Q.  Are the changes good, Rory?  Was it smart for them to do that today?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, you don't want balls oscillating on greens and you don't want the same thing that happened at St. Andrews last year.  So I thought it was a good call.  Obviously you want to get the round completed and done.  I think they made the right call.   
 Q.  How do you look at tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY: Try to get off to a good start.  I really don't know what the weather's going to be like, but try to get off to a good start again.  And it looks like, depending on what happens on the back nine, Henrik and Phil are sort of playing their own tournament right now.  So go out and try to shoot a good score and try to finish as high as I possibly can.
