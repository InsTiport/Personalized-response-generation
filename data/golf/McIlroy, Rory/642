  RORY McILROY:   I'm just not scoring well.   I missed it on the wrong side, I'm missing greens with wedges, and just not‑‑ just don't have my scoring hat on.   I don't think it was holding me back.   I feel like I'm hitting the ball pretty well, I'm just not scoring.   I mean, there was glimpses of it at Barclays and Deutsche Bank, then taking a week off, I didn't play any competitive golf, but you come back and you get a card in your hand again, yeah, it's a lot different just practicing than being out there.   Just not scoring as well as I need to. 

Q.   After making some progress at the PGA Championship and getting a little confidence, is it doubly disappointing to not be able to build on that?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I guess.   You know, I felt really good after the PGA.   I feel like when I've actually gotten myself into contention, that's what I've played my best this year.   When I've actually had a little bit of pressure, that's when I've actually played my best, so that's a good sign.   The bad sign is that I'm not in contention too much. 
But yeah, it's frustrating, but I'm trying to stay as patient as I can. 

Q.   You talked at Muirfield about the possibility of seeing a sports psychologist.   Where are you on that? 
RORY McILROY:   No, I mean, I don't think it's anything to do with that.   If I could just‑‑ if I'm going to miss shots, miss it in the right place, at least give myself the easy up‑and‑down.   If I'm going to‑‑ if I have a wedge in my hand a lot, I just need to sharpen up that end of the game.   It's nothing mental like that, it's just taking advantage of your scoring opportunities, and when you don't hit a great shot, at least hit it in a spot where you can have a chance to get it up‑and‑down. 

Q.   Second hole, was that an example of that?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   Exactly.   That's one place you can't miss it.

Q.   No TOUR Championship.   What's the schedule for the next few weeks?
RORY McILROY:   Four weeks off.   I can still make it.

Q.   Sorry. 
RORY McILROY:   No, I'm joking.   No chance. 
Yeah, four weeks off.   I'll take a little bit of time off and just sort of, as we say, get my head sharp a little bit and get refreshed and practice and get ready for the last sort of stint of the season. 

Q.   Are you glad there's no cut this week? 
RORY McILROY:   I mean, it's unfortunate there's no cut this week.   (Laughter.) I'm playing at 7:10 in the morning.   I will be done by 10:00.   Yeah. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY:   It is and it isn't.   If you can set yourself some little goal to try and achieve tomorrow, whether it's‑‑ if you set yourself a target, as in a score to shoot or even little goals throughout the round, something like that, at least you're going out and trying to achieve something.   I mean, it's not the nicest, but I'll go out and I'll play and I'll try and do better than I have the past couple days. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY:   No, I think the goal should be a little better than 76, but yeah, go out and try and shoot something in the 60s.   That I guess would be a decent goal. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY:   I do, I guess.   I don't mind that, though.   It's nice to get a few weeks off and a little bit of a rest and a bit of time to work on my game and get ready for that Asian trip. 

Q.   Someone would look at your year, and the easy speculation would be he's not working as hard as he needs to.   If you had to be honest with yourself‑‑
RORY McILROY:   I'm working harder.   Everything sort of came easy last year, and I'm sort of working harder, hitting more balls, spending more time on the range because I'm searching for it, and that's sort of‑‑ so I'm working harder, and that's what's frustrating.   But the fact that I'm working hard and I'm not really getting much out of it, if I can keep patient and keep working hard, I'm sure it'll turn around.

Q.   How do you stay patient?
RORY McILROY:   I'm 24.   I mean, I've got a lot of time in this game still.   I've got obviously a few tournaments left this year.   I'm sort of looking forward to getting to December and drawing a line under the season and start fresh in '14.

Q.   Are there any reference points for‑‑
RORY McILROY:   Not really.   I guess 2010 was a little‑‑ I got my first win in the States, but I didn't perform too well in the majors.   Yeah, I didn't make the TOUR Championship, so it's sort of the same, same sort of thing, but obviously a season with a win on the PGA TOUR is always going to be good.
