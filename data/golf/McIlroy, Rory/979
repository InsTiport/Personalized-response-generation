   RORY McILROY: This is a very big week for me. I had a week off last week and was going to play here and Loch Lomond but decided to focus on The Open at St Andrews and felt this week would give me better preparation as it can get hard and firey on this course. It has a bit of a links feel to it. This is a great course and great venue and there are a lot of World Ranking points available and money to move up The Race to Dubai rankings. I really want to get back into contention for that so there are some big weeks for me coming up starting here and then moving on to St Andrews and the 3 Irish Open, WGC and US PGA.

 Q. Amazing week in America for a fellow Northern Irishman - Graeme McDowell - winning the US Open?
 RORY McILROY: I caught up with him last week. I went up to Rathmore where they had a big party for him on Wednesday night and then he came down to our house and stayed with us and we played a game of golf at Royal County Down. He is still buzzing from it. He has gone back to Orlando to get some practice in before the Scottish Open and Open at St Andrews. It is a fantastic time for European golf and British and Irish golf in particular.

 Q. What sort of incentive was his win to you?
 RORY McILROY: It was big. I don't want to be the only Irishman on the Ryder Cup team without a major. I have played a lot with G Mac over the years and to see what he has done lifts me. If G-Mac can win the US Open the way he did, I have played with him enough week-In, week-out to know that I can go out on any given week and do the same thing.

 Q. Is it a new golden era for European golf?
 RORY McILROY: A lot of people are saying it and a lot of guys are doing well. Poulter won for the first time in the States, I won; Luke Donald is hitting form; Lee won in Memphis, Justin won and now G-Mac winning the US Open. There are a lot go guys playing well at the minute and that is great for The Ryder Cup. Hopefully we can carry that on to the next two Majors where British and European guys can kick on.

 Q. How would you sum up your first half of the season, playing mainly in the States?
 RORY McILROY: Not as consistent as I would have liked but the win gave me a lot of confidence going into the second half of the season. The first two Majors have been a disappointment missing the cut in both but feel my game is nearly there and have done a lot of good work on my swing and feel it is coming around. Hopefully I can have a good second half of the year and pick up a couple more wins.

 Q. How impressive was Graeme's win?
 It was just the way he handled himself. He has taken some bad press in the States by people saying no one made a charge at him but you cannot make a charge on that course. It was a case of hanging on for dear life and he did that better then anyone else for the whole week. He really deserved it and played better than anyone else.

 Q. And Gregory Havret pushed him hard?
 RORY McILROY: Gregory had a great week and I saw him yesterday to say well done. He did great. After he won in Gleneagles he has had a tough time and his great showing in the US Open will open a lot of doors for him and give him a lot of confidence heading into his national championship. I am sure he will take the form he showed at Pebble Beach into this week.

 Q. Should he take up the opportunity to play more in the States?
 RORY McILROY: If he is comfortable and suits him then go for it. It is not that hard with the WGCs and Majors.

 Q. Big weeks coming up?
 RORY McILROY: It is especially with what GMac has done. We all know St Andrews well from playing the Dunhill. It will be playing a bit different, bouncier and firey but the Europeans will have a good chance and it will be a strong challenge from us. Tiger has done well but this is a big week for us and a chance for me to move up the Race to Dubai and get into contention again.

 Q. Le Golf National is hoping to host the 2018 Ryder Cup - what do you think of that?
 RORY McILROY: It is definitely a good enough course to host the Ryder Cup. The weather will be fine and think it will be a great venue for the Ryder Cup. All the players love it and the Europeans will know it well from playing it so much in the past. Hopefully if everything goes well this venue will get it.

 Q. What is your recipe for winning?
 RORY McILROY: Patience. I think the first three rounds are about getting in position and the last day just need to see where you are. Try and keep hitting good shots and good putts. It can only take one or two holes to decide a tournament so you need to bide your time and take your chances when they come. You need a bit of luck here and there. Make the most of it.

 Q. Has Bob Rotella changed anything?
 RORY McILROY: A little. Bob was into if I hit a bad shot to stay patient, be indifferent. It is not the end of the world and that was one of the big things I took from it.
