THE MODERATOR: Welcome back to the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 2020. Just some thoughts on being back here as the No. 1 player in the world.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, sort of feel like this was the start if sort of like a two-year journey to get back to this point. I came here two years ago off the back of a missed cut in Tampa and sort of a little lost with my game, especially a little lost with my putting and spent an afternoon with Brad Faxon at the Bear's Club and then came up here and, obviously, something stuck with me from that afternoon and was able to win and that was my first win in 500-whatever days. So I feel like this place is a lot of special memories to me. It was definitely the catalyst to sort of do what I've done over the past two years and ascend back to the top of the World Rankings.
So good to be back. Course is in phenomenal shape. It's as good as I've seen it. It's nice to get back on Bermuda greens after the few weeks that I've started off on the poa annua. So, yeah, everything's good and game feels in good shape and looking forward to getting going.
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll take some questions.
Q. How much do you use ShotLink data for your course management, how they change what you do or affect anything about going about it?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I use them a lot. All of the, it's one thing I keep harping on about to the TOUR is actually how ShotLink data on every round that we play, like North Course at Torrey Pines doesn't have it, the other three courses at Pebble when we play there doesn't have it. I think a lot of the guys are starting to use ShotLink data to, it's course management, but it's also how you practice. So I got a stats report last week after the three weeks that I've had at Torrey Pines, at Riviera, and Mexico, and that's what I base my practice off going into the next few weeks. My bunker play wasn't up to the same standards it needed to be. I needed to get better from 6 to 12 feet. It's stuff that you sort of know anyway, but it's nice when you have that objective data in front of you. So I use it for a lot of different things. It is very important.
Q. With specific reference to the Olympics, are you relaxed about it, how do you get enough information, something you're going to keep an eye on --
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it's something that we're trying to stay on top of. I mean, it's something that if the organizers and the Olympic Committee believe it's safe enough that athletes can go and compete in the games, then you have to take their word for it and you have to, they're obviously liaising with the people that are the best at doing this, whether it's the CDC in this country, whether it's the World Health Organization, whatever it is. If they're speaking to those people and those people are the best in their field, then you have to trust that their judgment is the right one.
Q. Based on the conditions out there right now, what kind of tournament do you expect to see this weekend?
RORY MCILROY: I mean, conditions right now, the golf course is playing very nicely. The rough's pretty thick. If you start missing it in the rough, you can make life a bit difficult for yourself. I think they're expecting a lot of wind tomorrow afternoon, so the scoring might be tough, a little tougher tomorrow than we have seen in the past. But it looks like the conditions are going to be good over the weekend.
So it's an exciting golf course. There's four par-5s. I think people can get it going around here and shoot some low scores. So I don't see any, I think Francesco shot 64 to win last year. I shot 64 the year before to win. So I would say you would see something similar. There's going to be a lot of people in with a chance and someone's going to go pretty low over the weekend.
Q. Just watching everybody out there, like, asking for autographs and pictures and things, I'm curious how much of a challenge it is to you how you sort of divide your time and energy to figure out how to deal with it all, when to say no, when to say yes.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, Wednesdays are pretty hard to concentrate at times because you're trying to find that balance between treating it like a practice round as well and trying to get something out of the day instead of just being a host for your amateurs and sort of trying to get them around. So I always try to play a game with Harry, my caddie. He sets me a score to shoot that day and says, right, If you shoot 4-under or better I'll buy you dinner and if you don't get to that, you have to buy me dinner. And that's, we do that every Wednesday and it just, it keeps me concentrating on every shot and over every putt and it's something that I need to do because as you see out there it's very easy to get distracted and talk to people and basically hit the ball everywhere. So it just keeps me sort of on the straight and narrow.
Q. How did you do today?
RORY MCILROY: I lost by one shot. The target was 4-under. I shot 3-under even with birdieing the last.
Q. When you talk about the two-year journey kind of started here, do you think you've grown more from a game perspective or from a mental perspective over those two years?
RORY MCILROY: Mental more than the game. I mean, I think I'm more, I have done things in the game previous to two years ago that were maybe higher than what I've done the past couple of years. But from a mental perspective the consistency and showing up every week even when I don't have my best stuff I'm able to still get in the mix and have a shot at winning tournaments. So mentally over these last few years I've definitely gotten better and, yeah, more stability in my life, there's a lot of different things that go into it, but, yeah, just a lot more comfortable with where everything is.
Q. When you talk about gearing up for the Masters, when does that start and what does it mean?
RORY MCILROY: Honestly, I don't know when it starts. For some people it starts the Monday they arrive at Augusta. For some people it started in January. I think it's different for everyone. For me what I realized is I can't make things too big in my head. So if I started to gear up for Augusta in January, by the time Augusta got around in April my head would be absolutely fried. So I try to push it out as late as possible. I've got four tournaments to play between now and then and my biggest concern and my top priority are those four tournaments.
Q. What I'm talking about gearing up, does that mean working on certain shots you are going to need or does that mean getting your game in peak form?
RORY MCILROY: I don't think anything trumps execution in this game, so it's just getting your game in good form. Playing enough competitive rounds, getting the -- yeah, just shooting good scores, seeing shots. I'm not particularly -- like it's not as if I'm out on the golf course on the, you know, whatever hole here thinking, okay, this is the 5th hole at Augusta, this is the tee shot I need. I mean, some guys might do that, I'm not sure, but for me if I'm playing good golf that's the most important thing.
Q. You've been forthright in talking about the Premier League and also saying --
RORY MCILROY: Football or golf? (Laughing.)
Q. If nothing else maybe it leads to some changes structural and otherwise on the PGA TOUR. What would you have in mind?
RORY MCILROY: I mean, I don't want to come across as all sort of elitist, but I think there is a some smaller fields, maybe a few more events with no cuts, maybe not necessarily -- if you look at the international properties that the PGA TOUR have started to go towards, like Korea, Japan, 70-player fields, no cuts. That's the sort of stuff where you're giving the -- and honestly, there's so many -- I mean I get playing opportunities -- there's so many tournaments and there might be an over saturation in golf in a way. You look at the NFL and they play 18 games a year, 20 games a year max and people want it all the time. I know football's different than golf and all that, but I think being a golf fan these days can get quite exhausting following so many different tournaments, different tours, all that stuff. So maybe making it a little, sort of streamline it a bit might be a good way -- a good place to start a conversation.
