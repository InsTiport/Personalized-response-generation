Q. One of those days out there.  Just get some comments on the round.RORY MCILROY: I started off well.  I was 2-under par through 7.  I was right in the tournament there. Bogeyed 8, which wasn't a disaster.  It was a bit of a silly bogey.  3-putting there. Then, the 12th hole just really derailed me.  I just -- the first two putts I didn't really -- I didn't lose any concentration.  I took my time over them.  And I just, I completely misread the first one.  Then just hit a bad putt the second, and then the third one I was just going for a tap in and just lost concentration. So, obviously, to go from being right there in the tournament, dropping three shots in one hole wasn't what I wanted. But, I just need to go out tomorrow and try and post a low one and finish as high up as possible and give myself the best possible chance going into Atlanta next week.
