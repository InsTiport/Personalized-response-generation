Q. Sometimes a guy cards a 69 and breathes a sigh of relief, other times it could feel like he left a couple out there.  What is your description today?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I feel like I left a few out there.  I didn't hit the ball as good as I did yesterday.  Still hit it okay, but I hit -- I felt like I had a lot of good putts that just didn't go in.  I started them online, did everything I needed to do, and it's just one of those days where they were sliding by the edges.
You know, I think over the weekend, if I just keep giving myself chances, hit a few more fairways over the weekend than I did today, and if I can keep doing that and keep giving myself chances, hopefully I'll be able to move.
Q. With the putter, does it feel like you're knocking at the door, and once the lid comes off, it's going to be one of those stretches that you start going?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, the thing is I am rolling it quite nicely.  I had a couple drop today, but for the most part it was just sort of whether I -- I started online, but it wasn't -- I misread it or I hit it on the right line and it would lose a little bit of speed and just fall across the front edge of the hole.  Frustrating today on the greens, but again, I felt like I had a good putt, so just have to stay patient.
Q. Comfort level with your game from where you're at from last Saturday to where you are now going into today?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm more comfortable for sure.  Still have a bit of work to do.  I'm going to go to the range after lunch and work on a few things that wasn't quite as good today as it was yesterday.  Just try to recalibrate, and I've got some good feelings.
Q. Halfway through, 7-under par, but it appears maybe there are a few shots out there that you could have had on that score also after two rounds?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I didn't feel like I played as good today as I did yesterday from tee to green.  Yeah, I felt like I should have been a couple lower than I was.  I played the two par-5s even par, which you need to play better around here.
I just need to go and do a little bit of work on the range this afternoon and try to get a bit more comfortable for the weekend.
Q. Is there a positive there though going into the weekend knowing that those birdies and eagles, for that matter, are out there at TPC River Highlands?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I think if I can put the ball in the fairway and hit my irons as good as I have been over the first couple of days, it will give myself a lot of chances for birdies.  It's just about converting them and taking the opportunities when they present themselves.  So a little bit of work today after lunch, and hopefully I'll be ready for the next two rounds.
Q. Your swing was very good yesterday.  You were striking the ball very good?
RORY McILROY: I think with just what I'm working on I'm not 100% comfortable and I'm still thinking a lot about what I'm doing.  So it will be probably a few weeks before the consistency level is where I want it to be.  But it's good that there's good signs in there.  I'll keep working on it.  I'll go to the range and practice this afternoon, and hopefully it will be a little better tomorrow.
Q. What went well in your mind today?
RORY McILROY: You know, I was patient.  I could have gotten frustrated pretty easily, feeling like I was missing a few chances and not playing quite as well as I did yesterday.  So I stayed patient with it.  I felt like mentally I was pretty good.  You sort of need to do that when you don't have your best stuff.
