Q.   Silver lining to every round, a little hugging it out? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, that's it, exactly.   It would have been better if it were my girlfriends, but that was the best we could get at the moment.
RORY McILROY:   I just couldn't hit any fairways.   When you can't hit fairways around here you make life a lot more difficult for yourself.   I was hanging in there, made a really good up‑and‑down on 4, good up‑and‑down on 6, and just sort of trying to hang in.   Making double on 7 and then another 6 on 8 was‑‑ you know, that really knocked everything out of me and it was hard to get any momentum going after that. 

Q.   Was the day kind of summed up when you and Sergio had a little hug right there? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   That was both of our first birdies of the day, so we needed to feel a little love from someone out there.   Yeah, it was a nice moment in the round filled with not‑too‑good moments.

Q.   Was that another harsh Augusta lesson today? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, seems like every year I come here I throw a bad nine holes out there.   42 today wasn't a great effort.   But the good thing is it wasn't on the last day.   I can go out there tomorrow, try and shoot a good score, try and finish well, get a top 10 or a top 5 or whatever if I can shoot a really good one and at least leave here in a positive frame of mind. 

Q.   Back nine last year, front nine this year.   Maybe it's out of the system. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   That would have added up to an 85.   Hopefully I don't do anything like that tomorrow. 

Q.   Tomorrow set out your goals for us, just to try and shoot as low as possible and get yourself on the leaderboard? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   I think if I can finish top 10 it would be a really good result, I think.   So if I can go out there tomorrow and shoot something in the mid 60s and walk away from here with a top 10, I'd be very pleased.

Q.   One last word for your rugby team tomorrow?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I was speaking to a couple of the boys this morning actually.   It'll be good.   I think months at home are very tough, but if we can play well I think it's going to be big for us, as well.   Hopefully the boys put it up to them early and I'll be watching tomorrow morning, and hopefully they get the job done.
