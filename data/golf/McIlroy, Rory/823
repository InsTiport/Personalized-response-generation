 Q.   Well played today; at 18, did you feel like you needed to take a chance on that shot?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, you know, 18 today was playing brutal, probably the toughest it's played all week.   I hit a really good second shot through the trees.   It just jumped on me a little bit and ran through the back of the green and drew a pretty bad lie there.   Especially with water on the other side of the pin, I didn't want to be too ambitious.  
   
 Q.   After winning last week, not your best round on Thursday, you have to feel good with the way you fought back into contention this week?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, definitely, I would have taken this after Friday, only being 2‑under par to finish 14.   It's been a really good weekend, and a lot of positives to take from it.   It wasn't quite the way I wanted to finish, but it's still been a good week.   
   
 Q.   Did you enjoy the Heat game last night?  
RORY McILROY:   I did, yeah.   It was awesome.   First one I've ever been at that's went into over time, and yeah, they produced the goods when they needed to.   
   
 Q.   Has it been easy this week to take it easy after all you've been through, you gave it a good run ‑‑ do you ever let yourself think that you can just cruise this week?   
RORY McILROY:   No, not at all.   There's no room for complacency out here at all.   You know, I knew that every week's an opportunity to win, every week's an opportunity to play well, and even though I didn't play my best over the first couple of days, I fought back nicely at the weekend and posted a couple of good numbers.   
Looks like it will just come up short, but no, I mean, there was no thoughts of me relaxing this week or thinking that my job's done.   I know better than that, and I know I still have to keep working hard and giving it 100 percent.   
   
 Q.   When you don't win, what's the feeling‑‑ what do you leave with?  
RORY McILROY:   I don't know, I feel like I leave with it too much‑‑ I'm in contention a lot.   It was nice to win last week.   It would have been nice to get another one this week.   
But, you know, it's very positive, putting yourself in contention to win so many times, you can take a lot from it.   You know, it might be‑‑ you know, you don't look at it as it's a better feeling of finishing 15th and never really having a chance, because you feel like you could have won.   
But, you know, I'll look back on it tomorrow and look back at what a good weekend it was, and at least starting the day, eight shots behind, even to just give myself a chance to win was a pretty good effort.   I just couldn't close it out the way I wanted to.  
   
 Q.   I know you're concentrating on your own game, but in front of you on the 12th tee, Tiger hits a drive, he stripes it 320 and then he leaves.   I'm sure everyone wants to know your impressions and what, if anything, you saw happened?  
RORY McILROY:   I don't know.   The only thing I saw was‑‑ I saw Tiger and Joey go right off the tee box and I saw Webb and Paul go left.   I didn't know if Tiger was going to the bathroom or what he was doing.   
But obviously it sounds like he's hurt his left leg, left knee, I'm sure, but to be honest, it's a shame, because he looked like he was coming out this year, swinging it really well, playing good, getting himself into contention.   It's probably just precautionary, but I really hope he's healthy for the Masters, because obviously it would be a great week with him there.   
   
 Q.   As a fellow competitor, why do you say it's a shame?  
RORY McILROY:   Because golf‑‑ you know, Tiger Woods has been the face of golf for the last 15 years.   And you know, feeling like he's coming back to his best or something near his best, it's great for the game.   He can spark an interest in golf that no one else can.   You know, it's great to see him back and in contention.   And as I said last week, I'd love to have a lot of battles with him coming down the stretch, and it would be great to be able to do that at Augusta, if obviously he's healthy and plays well, and if I can get myself into that position again, as well.  
   
 Q.   You've been in contention a lot for the last six months, do you feel like when you tee it up every single week, that you can win every week?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I do.   You know, even when I don't feel like I've played my best or I am playing my best, that's been the biggest improvement in my game is being able to turn those 71s and 72s into 69s or 68s and keep yourself in a tournament.   That's been the biggest improvement in my game in the last six months and it's been the reason why I've been up there so much.   
   
 Q.   Is there something that's changed in the past year that you're able to be up there every week?  
RORY McILROY:   There's a few things.   You learn a lot from previous experiences.   Masters was a big one for me.   I think U.S. Open gave me the confidence to know that I was doing the right things and that I could win the biggest tournaments.   
And confidence, it can do massive things for your game.   Even if you're not playing that great, if you still have confidence in yourself, you know, it makes a big difference.   
   
 Q.   How many times do you think you'll go down to Augusta before Masters week?  
RORY McILROY:   I'll just go for two days.   So I'll fly up on, I don't know, whatever, Wednesday or Thursday, and stay overnight and play again and then fly back down the next day.
