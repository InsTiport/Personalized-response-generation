   RORY McILROY: Played really nicely out there again. I didn't make many mistakes. That's been the big difference between last week and this week. Just keeping the ball in play and not making many too unforced errors, and you know, to shoot 7-under over the first two days here is a pretty good effort and you just try to keep it going for the weekend. 

 Q. When you look at Martin, it seems every time we tee it up and he's in the tournament, he's near the leaderboard --
 RORY McILROY: That's why he's world No. 1. 

 Q. Is it surprising to some of you guys, that you knew him for awhile and how elite he's become? 
 RORY McILROY: Not really. Every time he tees it up, he's such a solid player, you always expect him to play well and I think he did well around here before last year, so you know, he likes the course, and obviously likes the place. So he's playing well and to give Martin Kaymer a stroke-lead on you, even though Hunter is a couple of shots ahead of me, to give Martin a stroke-lead is going to be pretty tough to sort of keep up with him. 

 Q. Did the course play easier in the afternoon than in the early morning?
 RORY McILROY: I thought it played easier just because the wind died down a bit but the greens got firmer and if you didn't hit the fairway, it was very tough to control your ball out of the rough. So conditions probably got slightly easier but just got a little trickier because the greens got a little firmer.
