  RORY McILROY: It was incredible.  We were obviously standing at the side of the green and watching the ball in the air and we are thinking, this is looking really good and it lands right beside the hole and stops dead.  So really happy for JD to get the job done, because he's been fantastic all week, and he's really taken to this Ryder Cup really well.  You know, he's been great in the team room, he's a lot of fun, so it was great to see him do what he did there.Q. You've been part of three winning Ryder Cup teams.  Talk about this team compared to the other, how the dynamic has been and how Mr. McGinley has been.RORY McILROY: I can't say enough about our captain.  Paul McGinley has been absolutely immense this week.  He has left no stone unturned.  He's just been fantastic.  From everything that he's done, everything sort of tied in from speeches that he's made to the people that he's got in to talk to us, the imagery in our team room; everything's been tied in, and he's given this week a lot of thought over the past two years.  I'm just so glad that it worked out for him.Q. Obviously a lot of pressure on you, as we talked about, you were world No. 1, you come in here expecting to win all these points.  After the first loss, how proud are you what you achieved, two halves and two wins?RORY McILROY: Yeah, very proud.  I feel like I definitely played my best golf yesterday and today.  I mean, I came out today and played the best golf I played all week. But you know, I know what's expected of me and I know that I would need to go out there and deliver points and that's what I was able to do this week.  Personally for me, it putts the icing on the cake of what's been a fantastic summer and obviously looking forward to more Ryder Cups and more great weeks with these guys.
