Q. Rory, 2-under par 68, if we can get some thoughts on your round.
RORY McILROY: Uneventful. I didn't really -- I made three birdies and one bogey. The one bogey on the 6th hole I three-putted from like 30 feet. It was one of those days. I put myself in position to shoot a low score, I just didn't capitalize on how I hit it off the tee. My distance control on my wedges was a little off, and then the putting right there got a little difficult at the end of the day. Greens were sort of slow, and they got pretty bumpy at the end. Hopefully some better greens in the morning and hopefully shoot a lower score.
Q. A lot of talk about golf returning. What was it like being out there?
RORY McILROY: It was good. It felt good to be back. I thought it was going to feel more different than it was. Like it's a little strange not having anyone around, but at the same time we are so concentrated on what we're doing and trying to shoot good scores and play good golf, so once we -- me personally, once I got into it, I didn't feel like it was much different at all.
