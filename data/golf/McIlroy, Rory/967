 Q. Disappointing end to that.
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I just didn't play good today. I got off to a nice start but a few bogeys around the turn, and just couldn't really come back. 
 I sort of just let it get away from me a little bit, and you know, didn't really come back. It's one of those things. 

 Q. You made such a bright start; did you feel the force was with you at that stage? 
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I had two good birdies on 1 and 2 and I had chances on 3 and 4 and 5, as well and didn't really take them and made double on 6. You know, I just couldn't really get back into it after that to be honest.

 Q. What was your mind-set at that stage after you've dropped a couple of shots, do you feel that you have to go even closer at the pins and attack even more and therefore leave yourself open to your mistakes? 
 RORY McILROY: A little bit, yeah, I was trying to, after I made bogey on 8, I'm back to level for the day, and I was just trying to get it back somewhere, you know, I was trying to shoot somewhere in the 60s and I was trying to push a little too hard and made a few mistakes because of that. 

 Q. You must be hugely disappointed at 2-under for the tournament given the high expectations coming into it and the way you started?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, to be honest, I'm just looking forward to getting to the States now and playing in Akron. I've got a couple of big weeks ahead of me; so that's what I'm sort of concentrating on.

 Q. You said you let it get away, did the shoulders go down and you felt this wasn't going to be your day?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, pretty much. I was trying to fight to get back into it and nothing was really happening and I hit a couple of decent shots on the back nine and didn't really get rewarded and made bogeys from them and wasn't really going to be.
