  RORY McILROY:   Obviously a little bit disappointed with how I finished.   Being 2‑down with five to go, playing the last five holes like I did, I was happy about that. 
I didn't hit the greatest drive off the 19th and got a pretty bad lie in the rough.   It was just unfortunate. 
I played pretty well for the most part.   A couple of loose drives on the back nine to give him a couple of holes.   But, you know, he played really solid today and didn't really do much wrong, didn't really give me anything. 
So the more consistent player won at the end of the day.

Q.   What does it say when you were 2‑down and you go birdie, birdie, birdie to take the lead?   What does it say about what you were able to pull out at that point?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was good.   I hit a couple of really good iron shots in that stretch.   Hit a nice 8‑iron to four or five feet at the 14th, and then a great 4‑iron into 16 to three or four feet. 
It was nice to produce those shots when I sort of needed to.   It was just unfortunate I couldn't keep it going.

Q.   What positives can you take from this week looking at the Honda and forward?
RORY McILROY:   I'm very comfortable with my game.   I don't feel in any way disappointed leaving so early, because I feel like my game is there.   I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks.
