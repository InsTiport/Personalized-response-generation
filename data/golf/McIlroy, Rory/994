  Q. How did you feel out there today?  
 RORY McILROY: I struggled; I wasn't very comfortable with my swing on the front nine but I actually played a lot better on the back nine and started hitting some good shots towards the end. You know, it's a positive to take from the day and just going to go and work on a few thing on the range.   
 You know, not much is wrong. I didn't play the par 3s well today. Missed the greens there. I think I played them 4-over par. So you know, if I had played those okay, I would have been level or 1-under and it would have been okay.  
 But go out in the morning, you know, if I start off okay, get back to somewhere around level, should be all right.   
  
  Q. Is it a particular swing issue?   
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I was just getting a bit ahead of it on the front nine and I was getting a little afraid to release it, because if you're getting ahead of it and your hands come too quick, I didn't really want to be hitting it left, especially around here. So I was just sort of hanging onto it a bit much and just tried to slow it down a little bit on the back nine and seemed to work pretty well. Hit a couple of nice shots coming in, so that was good.   
 Just need to go and try and groove that swing thought now and hopefully be okay for the morning.  
  
  Q. Birdie at 16, birdie at 17.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was a bad start, 5-over through ten wasn't great. But I hung in there and I gave myself a lot of chances coming in, which is great. So I just need to go and try and do that tomorrow and hole a few putts and get myself in there for the weekend.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us how you played those two holes?   
 RORY McILROY: 16, I hit 5-wood off the tee. I had 112 yards from the middle of the fairway. I hit pitching wedge in to about two feet and then on 17, I hit a drive and a 3-wood just left of the green and chipped it up to about four feet and held the putt.   
 On 10, I hit it into the right trap and the pin was tight right, so I left -- well, came back to me but finished in a footprint and just hacked it out and 2-putted from about 50 feet.   
  
  Q. Some people are saying the sand is difficult?  
 RORY McILROY: The sand is very inconsistent. Some bunkers have a lot of sand and some bunkers don't have any. It's sort of hard to judgment. I left a couple of bunker shots in the bunkers today, which isn't like me. I'm usually pretty good out of them. Pretty difficult out of the bunker. Shouldn't be hitting them in there in the first place.  
  
  Q. Did you find they set up the course pretty fair today?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was fair. It was good. The pin positions, I think a few of the pin positions were probably some of the toughest pin positions on the greens, like on the 9th hole, for example.   
 But yeah, I thought they set the course up really well today. It reflects, 6-under is leading, but if you take the six and the five out, 4-under is a really good score out here. It's definitely a tougher challenge than it was the first few years.  
  
  Q. Were you feeling disheartened after the first few holes?  
 RORY McILROY: Not really, I hung in there, which is a good thing. Seemed like every birdie chance I left myself, I left it short.   
  
  Q. Much debate about 18, whether to go for it?   
 RORY McILROY: I had 212 yards to the front of the green, so I was going to go for it. Just it was a bit of a tricky lie. It was sort of uphill. So I was just trying to get it up in the air and turned it over a bit.
