RORY McILROY: The back nine gives you a few opportunities to be a little more aggressive.  But overall I didn't play great the first 13 holes, and then from the 14th onwards I felt like I played a lot better.  I had some quality shots coming in when I needed to.  So hopefully that bodes well for the rest of the week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit.  You feel bad because he's up basically the whole match, and to finish like that, as well.  If I hadn't birdied 18 and he parred it, I would feel like I won the match and he probably would feel the same way, whereas he's definitely going away like he lost it.  It was his to lose.  I feel a little bit bad for him, but I'm just happy that I snuck through with the win and looking forward to the next couple of days.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I do.  I draw upon it a lot.  I know that when I need some of that stuff, I'm able to produce it.  So that's huge.  I'm going to have to do that more and more as the week goes on, because the matches only get tougher.  The quality of my play needs to get better, as well.  But the way I played the last five holes, if I can continue that, I'll be happy.   
 Q.  I notice you put a new 2-iron in the bag today.  Anything in particular you like about it or the reason you put it in this week?  
RORY McILROY: It goes miles.  It goes so far.  It's a great club in the wind, the ball flight is really, really stable.  I tested it with Nike a couple of weeks ago and thought it would be perfect for the likes of Oakmont and Troon.   
But getting here this week and seeing the golf course, it's sort of great for here as well.  The ball speed I'm getting off it is close to some guys' drivers.  Flight probably carries 265, 270 and runs close to 290.  So it's hopefully going to be a great club this week, but I think for the summer coming up, some of the golf courses it's going to be a great club.
