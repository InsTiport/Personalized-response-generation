   RORY McILROY: Didn't have my best game today but hung in there. Birdied all the par 5s which you need to do and birdies on the last two holes really capped it off. 

 Q. Were you missing fairways --
 RORY McILROY: I was missing a lot of shots left, probably just from playing in the wind last week, as well, and this week a little bit, as well, just smothering it. I'll work on the range tomorrow morning. Midway through the round, I hit some nice shots coming in. 

 Q. Just the position you would love to be in at Doral -- well, you'd like be leading by six.
 RORY McILROY: Well, I'm three behind at the minute. Not a bad position to be in. You know, Dustin Johnson looks like he's playing well, Hunter is playing well, Nick Watney is playing well. The scores they are shooting out there today -- it's really, really good scoring.
