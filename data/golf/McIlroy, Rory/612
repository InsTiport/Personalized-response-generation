  RORY McILROY:   Look, for the most part I think it's very fair.   There's a couple of little places where maybe fall‑offs off greens to the water are a little severe.   Some things they could soften up a little bit.   For instance, Phil hit his second shot on 8 like straight at the pin and it bounces a few yards short of the green and gets a kick left and all of a sudden it's in the water.   
So sometimes, you know, a little unlucky, but a few holes where it runs off into the water and there's nothing really to stop it.   You challenge the left side of the fairway on the last hole yesterday like I did, and you get a‑‑ if the fairway was just tilted more this way, at least it gives the guys a little bit more of a chance to stay out of the water and get rewarded.   But for the most part, the golf course is great.   It's fair.   It's a tough test.   It's much tougher than it was.   
And you know, considering what was here last year to this year, it's a huge improvement.   
   
 Q.   What did you hiton ‑‑  
RORY McILROY:   I hit‑‑ the wind was sort of down off the right and I was trying to hold an 8‑iron and I just let it go a little bit in the wind.   It sort of didn't quite make the bunker.   I was sort of‑‑ the ball was just on the edge and my feet were in the bunker.   It was a little bit of a tricky chip shot.   I chipped it up to eight feet and hit a really good putt and just lipped‑out on the low side.   
   
 Q.   (Is being in contention, is it like a habit)?   
RORY McILROY:   I think it's definitely like a habit, I guess it's like riding a bike.   So the first few times you get back into contention, you have to get used to it again, but you know how to do it; it's there.   
Yeah, it's definitely a habit, once you do it, you start getting more comfortable, and you know, it's like winning or putting yourself in a position to win.   Once you do it enough, you get into the habit of it and the knack of it.   I guess you have momentum on your side.     
   
 Q.   (Regarding weather delays).  
RORY McILROY:   It's slow on the golf course, a lot of stop/start, I'll be looking forward to getting to the weekend when everyone is in twos and we can start moving along a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Given the season so far, is it difficult to stay patient, do you get antsy ‑‑  
RORY McILROY:   I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't anxious to get it, but you know, at the same time, I realize I have to stay patient to get it.   So just a matter of sort of managing your emotions and your expectations and your anxiousness and just trying to putt all your energy into the round of golf that you play and know that four rounds of good golf are going to add up to maybe a win.   
   
 Q.   Just on that point, managing the emotion, when you're in conditions like this, you can address the ball, do all the things that you can control technically, execute, but then with this kind of wind, you get bad breaks.  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, of course.   
   
 Q.   How important is it managing your reaction to those kind of things?   
RORY McILROY:   Definitely, you have to stay as sort of neutral as possible out here, especially in conditions like this, because you're going to get bad breaks and you're going to get good breaks, and I got a good break on the 8th hole, for example, this morning, hit it right of the bunkers.   It was a terrible tee shot but got a way with it, could get a 4‑iron up near the green and got up‑and‑down and made birdie.   But then you're going to get bad breaks, like maybe the tee shot at 18 yesterday or whatever it is.   
I think you just have to realize that and realize that some are going to go for you and some are going to go against you and at the end of the week, it should sort of all even out.   That's why you have to stay as patient as possible.   
   
 Q.   How intimidating is that last hole on a day like today?   Looked like you hit a real good tee shot and it was drawing a little bit.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, much easier today because it's downwind, so the majority of the guys will be able to cover that left side, that corner.   So it makes it a much easier tee shot.   
But yesterday, we played it straight back into the teeth of the wind and it's a tough shot.   It was in a little off the right, and you don't want to just fan one out there because then you're going to leave yourself with 220, 230 plus.   You want to try and hit a strong, flighted shot and then that brings the water more into play I guess‑‑  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)‑‑  
RORY McILROY:   A little bit.   Like I said, the 18th, I would like to see the left side of the fairway, make not a bank like this but be at least a little leveller so a good, bold shot has a chance at least of staying up.
