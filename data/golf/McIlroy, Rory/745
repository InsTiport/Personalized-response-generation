 Q.   Could you feel like the momentum was flipping away there for a while?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, of course, getting to 3‑up, having a good chance on 12 to go 4‑up, and then the guys come back at us with three birdies in a row on 14, 15, 16.   So we knew we just needed to hang in there and try and get something back.   
You know, fortunately for us, Brandt didn't hit the best tee shots on the last and we took advantage.
