 Q. That was spectacular, 6 birdies, no bogeys. Talk about your experiences in this round. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was a good round of golf. I didn't really put a foot wrong. The only mistake I made was missing the green on 14, and I held a nice sort of 15-footer for par there. Apart from that it was pretty much stress-free golf.
 It was nice. I feel like I'm driving it well. I'm hitting my iron shots good, holing a few putts. So it's a nice combination.

 Q. Is the course set up perfectly for you?
 RORY McILROY: When I got here last week on Wednesday, I felt like the golf course set up good for me. It sort of worked out that way. 

 Q. I don't know if you ever get comfortable on a U.S. Open golf course, but you looked comfortable, did you feel that way?
 RORY McILROY: I did, yeah, I felt very comfortable. I said this in the press conference Tuesday. It doesn't feel like a typical U.S. Open, for some reason. The golf course is going to get harder and it's going to get firmer and it's going to get trickier, but I still feel that it's very playable and fair. If you don't hit a fairway, you've still got a chance to hit it on the green and give yourself a chance for birdie.
 I like the way they've set up the golf course this year.
