 Q.   A bit of a slow start but now you're a shot back.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it wasn't the greatest ballâ€‘striking round out there that I've ever had, but somehow managed to scrape it around in 69 and still in with a chance.   As badly as I did hit it out there, I'm still happy with my position going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday you eagled 9, today you bogeyed it.   What happened?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, not a great tee shot, I got lucky, it stayed in the fairway, and then an even worse second and left myself in an awkward spot with my third and then an awkward spot with my fourth and missed a little putt for par.   Obviously not a great hole, but it was great the way I bounced back with a birdie on 10.  
   
 Q.   Phil had 10 birdies today.   Seems like there's a lot of birdies out there on the course.   Do you have to play near perfect tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'm only one back.   Phil obviously played well today.   You know, he might go out there and shoot the same number again tomorrow, but I just have to concentrate on myself and try and do the best that I can.  
   
 Q.   What has your impression been of Crooked Stick?  
RORY McILROY:   It's been phenomenal.   I wish for everyone that the weather had cooperated a little bit better and the conditions would have been a little firmer, but it's been great.   You know, the crowds have been fantastic.   I think they've really enjoyed the golf.   Hopefully another day of sunshine tomorrow and it'll be a great way to cap off the tournament.
