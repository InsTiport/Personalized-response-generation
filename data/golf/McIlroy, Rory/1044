 Q. You're safely in for the weekend but that's hard work today. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I sort of struggled from early on. I think I lipped out my first three holes and that set the tone for the day. 
 And yeah, I mean, actually I finished quite well to make the cut. It's my fourth week in a row. I feel a little bit sort of -- I gave my best efforts for the last two days but I think the two-week break coming up will be very welcome.

 Q. You had a good crack at it last week; are you feeling weary after that?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, and obviously I had the four-week stretch in America, and then headed back over for the Irish, which was a tough week and then last week and this week. 
 I've done well to get in for the weekend after the way things were going in the middle of the round, so hopefully give it my best shot for the next two days.

 Q. The thing that makes Tiger really stand out is his head; you seem to have that similar quality, you don't seem to get too fazed when things go a bit wrong.
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I knew I had a few chances coming in that I could make birdies, and obviously missing the putt on 4 to go back to level par, I knew I needed a couple. I didn't make the one on next hole, but then I was able to get one on the 7th hole, my 16th, and I was able to make the putt and get up-and-down on the 8th hole which is my 17th. 
 Yeah, it's obviously nice to be able to do it when you need to. I was able to do it today.

 Q. Is that something that comes naturally to you or do you have to work at it? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think you focus a little better when you need to do something, whatever your intensity level is and you seem to be able to do it more times than not. Maybe I just need to be able to get that intensity level up for the rest of the round.
