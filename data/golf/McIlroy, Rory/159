Q. Fine round of golf.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I felt like it was the worst I could have shot.  After the start, I felt I could have shot something in the -- definitely in the mid 60s.  I felt like I could have shot something in the low 60s the way I hit it.  But keep swinging like that, keep giving myself chances, and I'd say three more 67s, I'll be right in the mix on Sunday.
Q. How big are fairways this week?
RORY MCILROY: Massive.  You've got to hit it in the fairway.  Just the holes that I struggled on today are the holes where I missed the fairway.  Put your ball in play, make life a lot easier for yourself.
