  Q. What was it like being out there with all that movement and did you have a sense of what was going on as guys were jockeying for position?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was just a weird day. Nick got off to a bad start and Kaymer was leading early and then there was a few guys making a run and Dustin came in with a charge there on the last few holes and I was just sort of always hanging around. And just waiting for that one putt to drop here or there, and I got a good putt on 14 and I missed one on 15 which was quite disappointing.  
 It was a good week. I'll take the positives from it. It wasn't the result that I wanted going into today, but it's a learning experience and hopefully one that I can establish myself for the next majors.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was good to be a part of it and for the first time or whatnot being in contention, I mean it was different. I was definitely feeling it the first few holes. I made a few tentative swings and did I well to recover from them but I held together nicely on the back nine and I was disappointed with the one on 15, but apart from that, it was pretty well played.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I knew I needed to make it before I hit my second shot. I heard the roar from 17 when Dustin holed his birdie putt and I knew that I needed to make three to have any sort of a chance to get into the playoff and I hit a really good shot in and I hit a good putt and it just wasn't meant to be.
