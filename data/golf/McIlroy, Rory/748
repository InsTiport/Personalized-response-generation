 Q. Such a fast start from Phil and Keegan, and clearly you were playing catchâ€‘up, but in the middle part of that match it looked like you might be able to pull this off.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, they got off to a very fast start, and at the end of the day we just gave ourselves a little bit too much to do.   We started a little sluggishly.   Obviously it was just a high to end this morning and then to try to get ourselves back for the afternoon, just didn't start as well as we would have liked.   But we were trying to claw our way back, and we played some good stuff on the way in, but Keegan and Phil were just too strong this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   Great tee shot at the 17th from you and it was a hell of a blow from Phil to get inside that.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was, it was a fantastic shot, especially when he had to.   We thought a couple of birdies the last two holes we might pull off a half, but Phil was obviously thinking otherwise.
