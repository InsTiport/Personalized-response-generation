Q.   Par 71 the first round, a little disappointed? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, for sure.   I felt like I played well.   I made a few silly mistakes out there which cost me three double‑bogeys on my card, three 6s, which obviously doesn't help. 
But the rest of it was actually pretty good, so just try and cut out those silly mental errors and I should be okay.

Q.   Was the course in as good of shape as everybody is talking about?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, the course is great.   It's perfect.   Even with the little bit of rain this morning, it's held up really, really well.   It's definitely gettable out there.   Hopefully go out there tomorrow at some point, whenever we tee off and try and put up a number.

Q.   Your countryman, PÃ¡draig Harrington, is very big on this course, wants to make it a permanent site for The Barclays.   How do you feel about that?
RORY McILROY:   I second that, definitely.   I think it's a great course.   I think it's one of the best venues we play on TOUR.   We are so close to Manhattan.   I think on TV it looks great with the skyline.   I would love to see a tournament come, a PGA TOUR event come back to Liberty National every year.
