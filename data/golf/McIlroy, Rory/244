RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was tricky enough out there.  I feel like I could have shot a few better but it was tough because some of the greens out there are quite exposed and you're sort of in two minds whether to -- when you're reading a putt, whether to think that the wind is going to affect it or not.  Some putts were affected by the wind out there and some putts weren't.  Sort of just committed to that.  It was okay.  Was 2-under for the last two to make it more respectable and hopefully I can play better at Carnoustie tomorrow.   
 Q.  What was missing today that was clearly so evident over the weekend at Close House?  
RORY McILROY: I don't know really.  I don't feel like I've played that much -- obviously the conditions are much different and it was more of a grind today.  Yeah, difficult like I played that much differently.  Just didn't get it going.   
 Q.  Carnoustie obviously tomorrow.  Thoughts on what is always regarded as the toughest test of the three venues?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I don't think it will be quite as windy tomorrow, so we're going to get Carnoustie maybe a little easier than the guys got it today, which is nice.  I played there on Tuesday and it's actually not -- it's quite soft.  The greens are very good.  They are running very nicely.  So it actually could be a good opportunity for some of the guys to score well tomorrow.   
Get off to a good start.  With the direction I'm hitting the putt, obviously the wind is straight left-to-right on the putt and thinking, okay, the putt is going to hold it.  If there's no wind, it was probably a right-edge putt and I hit it sort of straight, thinking that the wind was going to hold it there, and it just sort of broke and missed on the left side.   
 Q.  Close --  
RORY McILROY: Not to the pin.  I've hit it over the green before when it's been howling downwind.  It was a good opportunity to get back to level par.   
 Q.  Was it difficult to get some momentum out there?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think that's the big thing, as well.  Obviously you're waiting around a lot and you've got no -- don't really have any rhythm or anything -- I think it's easier when you get off to a good start.  When you get off to a slow start, you're waiting a lot and that can be quite difficult.  It was okay.  Again, I feel like I've shot bad scores here -- well, not bad but I've got off to slow starts here in the past and been able to recover and get myself back into the tournament.  I feel like I can do the same again.
