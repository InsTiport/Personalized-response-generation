 Q. Rory, that was incredible play out there, the shots being played by everybody; it was something else, wasn't it. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, Lin made two threes on the last, and he probably should have won it in regulation, and he maids two threes in the playoffs. You can't be that to be honest. I thought I probably did enough to make 3 at the first playoff hole and I had an incredible shot for my second shot, but it just wasn't meant to be. And obviously it's still been a great week for me. I'll look back on it, and I've played really well. I couldn't have done much more. 

 Q. Just talk us through that second shot on the second playoff hole. You looked to be in all sorts of trouble. 
 RORY McILROY: Right behind the tree. I had to hook a gap wedge about 40 yards, and just one of those shots that you try, and if it comes off, it comes off; and if it doesn't, Lin was in a great position, anyway. It came off perfectly, and I thought it was actually going to roll down in the bunker, but that was a great shot. 
 I was sort of saying when I hit the tee shot, he had a shot from the trees, so hopefully I had one. But that's how it goes. Still a great finish, and it might get me into the Top-50 in the world, so it's all good. 

 Q. He had to beat you, didn't he. 
 RORY McILROY: He had to beat me. I didn't back off and I didn't make any stupid mistakes. It's all right. It was a great week. I'll take all the positives. As long as I can keep putting myself in these positions and feeling the nerves and the adrenaline, I'll know I'm doing things right. It's been a great week and I can't be too disappointed. That's the way it goes. 

 Q. You're going to take a lot from this into the new year and all that sort of thing. 
 RORY McILROY: Exactly. It puts me in a great position going into the new year and I have two events left in South Africa. If I don't win there, I'll hopefully win sometime next year. As long as I keep putting myself in these positions, I'll be able to pull through sooner or later.
