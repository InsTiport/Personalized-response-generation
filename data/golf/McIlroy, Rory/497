Q.   A quiet start to your round with four pars, and four birdies in six holes took you into a tie for the lead.   How were you feeling about your game at that stage? 
RORY McILROY:   I felt good.   I knew I felt a little better out there today than I did yesterday.   I knew if I stayed patient, the birdies would come at some point.   Got on a nice little run on 5, 6, 7, and birdied 10, as you said, to go 4‑under.   Back nine wasn't quite as good as the front unfortunately.

Q.   Two double‑bogeys in a row.   Was the one on 13 affected by the frustration you must have felt by the one at 12?
RORY McILROY:   Not really.   It was just a bad swing on 13 but it was annoying to follow up a double with another one on 13.   So I was a little frustrated but it was nice to get a couple back on the last few holes.   At least keep myself within touch going into tomorrow.

Q.   How do you approach tomorrow tactically with ground to make up over a guy that we know loves this golf course?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, just try to get off to a fast start, get off to the start that I got off to on Thursday, put some pressure on them and see what happens.   But yeah, I can't afford to stay patient tomorrow.   I need to go and get some birdies from the off and see where I can go from there. 

Q.   Six birdies today, and two doubles back‑to‑back, but when you look back on this round, will you look at the fact that you were fighting back after a little bit of trouble? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I definitely felt like I played better than yesterday, even though the score is the same.   12 and 13, obviously ruined that scorecard a little bit.   If I had not had those two holes, I would be right up there in the lead.   It makes life a little more difficult for myself tomorrow but hopefully I can get off to a fast start and try to put pressure on the guys ahead of me.

Q.   You said you felt like you were playing better today than you were yesterday.   What do you think you need to do tomorrow to get off to that fast start?
RORY McILROY:   I feel like I played the first few holes okay.   I had a chance at 1, a chance at 2.   3 and 4 were tough pin positions.   Then I got into the round. 
I need to be aggressive tomorrow.   I need to go at pins.   I need to try to hit it close and hole some putts.
