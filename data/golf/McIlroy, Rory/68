 Q.  A long season, how do you sum it up? There's been so much success in there over the course of it?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, there has been. You know, I'll look back at 2019 very fondly. There's been a lot of good golf played. Probably some of my most consistent golf. You know, four wins, I guess this is the 19th Top-10.   
Yeah, you know, look, it's been a learning year, as well. I learned some things that I want to take forward into next year, as well, but first and foremost, I'm looking forward to a couple of months off and reflect on everything and get myself ready for next year.   
 Q.  What does Rory McIlroy do in his time off? Is it all way from the course or do you do a little bit of both?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, so I'd say I'll try not it touch my clubs for rest of the year. I'll take a nice four or five week break from them and then in the new year, I'll start getting ready again and playing in the last week in January. Spend time with the family. I'm going to go back home for Christmas for the first time in a couple years, that will be nice.   
But yeah, really just try to get away from it and maybe do a bit of gym work. Yeah, sort of enjoy the sun in Florida for a few weeks and enjoy Christmastime at home.
