 Q. How did the first round go in terms of patience and concentration, what was that one like?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was okay. The conditions weren't that difficult. I mean I felt the course was there. It's soft. There's not much wind. I made five birdies, that wasn't the problem. I just made too many mistakes. And that was the problem. And I'm making mistakes from pretty simple positions, just off the side of the green, 17 and 18 are good examples of that.  
   
 Q. How important is it that you haven't really separated yourself from where the lead is by very much?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm sort of surprised. I'm sort of surprised that there hasn't been lower scores out there. It's soft. The greens are sort of slow. It's there for the taking. And I'm surprised someone hasn't run off.  
   
 Q. Do you have work to do and what will it be on?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm going to go to the putting green and try to figure this out, just sort of reads more than anything else. Just figuring out, I over read a few early on, and then I started to under read them coming in. So just try to work on that a little bit.   
   
 Q. It looked like a roller coaster from the outside, how did you feel from the inside?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, that was fine. I think I've sort of been through it all here at this golf course. So it's sort of‑‑ it's fine. You know you're going to have chances. There's birdie opportunities. I can accept mistakes if I'm trying and it's not a mental error or I haven't got into places, so I can accept some mistakes, but six bogeys out there is a little too many. And I'm just going to have to try to get over those in the next few days.  
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
RORY McILROY: Under one branch and over another, same 7‑iron downwind.  
   
 Q. Is it harder for you to have a round like this with six bogeys versus a round with maybe a triple and fewer singular mistakes?  
RORY McILROY: You never like to see six bogeys on the scorecard. That's a little too many. You can accept whether it's an undesirable break or hitting the ball in a hazard or something, that happens out here. But, yeah, I just need to tidy that up a bit.  
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
RORY McILROY: I think just whenever the greens are a little slower, they don't break as much. And that was really the‑‑ the greens are maybe two or three feet slower than they usually are, just because it's been so soft and the rain. So sometimes that happens. They will get softer as the week goes on, so it's just a matter of adjusting.
