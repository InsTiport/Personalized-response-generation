   GORDON SIMPSON: Well, Rory, it was all going nicely, and you are now unfortunately out of the lead, which is the first time that's happened in a long time. But I'm sure you're still happy about where you stand going into the weekend.
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely. Apart from the mistake at the last, you know, it was another really good day's work. You know, played really solidly, and you know, made a few birdies around the turn. You know, could have made a couple more, as well. 
 But it was a solid day, and the conditions are still pretty tricky out there and they are probably only going to get trickier in the afternoon.
 6-under par going into the weekend is not too bad, and you know, only one shot behind at the minute. Might be a couple more. Depends what Charl and Alex and a few of the boys do this afternoon. 
 But I still feel pretty good going into the weekend.
 GORDON SIMPSON: You have a feeling it's going to be very bunched up, isn't it. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, the way the conditions are, it was always going to be like that, being windy and the rough up. 
 So, yeah, it's going to be very bunched and it should make for a very exciting weekend. 

 Q. Couldn't see your ball on the 9th in the rough, it must have been quite deep?
 RORY McILROY: No, it was actually -- the rough was lying with me, so it wasn't too bad. It just didn't quite come out the way we thought it was going to come out with a little bit of jump, a bit of a flyer. It came out a bit soft.

 Q. You had no option but to go for the green from there. 
 RORY McILROY: It was only 150 front. It wasn't as though I was hitting 7-iron. If I kept it a little right, it would have been okay. But you know, it just drifted left on the wind. 

 Q. A sour taste that it comes at the last hole?
 RORY McILROY: A little bit. I had not made a mistake all day and to do it at the last hole is disappointing. But if I go out tomorrow and make two birdies in the first two holes, then it's all forgotten. 
 Q. A nice groove around the turn, the putter was working quite well?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I stayed very patient, because I opened with seven straight pars and I had a couple of chances for birdies. It was nice to see one drop eventually on 17, and after that, I sort of got a bit of confidence and started to play really, really nicely. 
 Now around the turn, hit a couple of loose drives on my back nine, front nine, and you know, he was struggling for a few pars. You know, thought I did pretty well, and you know, just a bit disappointed with what happened at the last. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: Of course you were playing with what is now the new leader, JimÃ©nez, he's 46, but still got plenty of talent.
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, he played really nicely today. He got off to a fast start, held a couple of nice putts early on, and he's a great iron player -- well, he's great from tee-to-green, and he putts his ball in the fairway and gives himself chances to go at the pins, and that's what he did today. It was a really nice round of golf by him, and he's pretty tough, when he gets up there, he's pretty tough to beat. So it should be good. 

 Q. And he complimented you on some of your birdie putts from long range. What was the longest one you holed today?
 RORY McILROY: Probably the one on 17, 25 feet. Something like that. But I got the pace of the greens a little better today, struggled with my pace a bit yesterday and today I was a little better. That was a positive. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: Rory, it's lunchtime. Thank you.
