Q.   What's the verdict?
RORY McILROY:   I got off to a good start today.   I was 3‑under for the first, I don't know, what was it, nine holes, ten holes. 
Then I had a good chance to go to 4‑under for the day.   I had a good chance to go to 5‑under on the par5 there, made par, and then 3‑putted‑‑ I missed the speed on 4 and 3‑putt there. 
Left myself a tricky up‑and‑down on 5 and had a really good putt that lipped‑out. 
Made a good par on 6. 
7, again misjudged the speed with my first putt. 
8, left it above the hole, and these greens are pretty slick.   Slid it five or sit feet by there and hit a really good putt there and that lipped‑out, too. 
Then made a great par on 9.   Hit it in the trees left and chipped it out and hit a great 8‑iron pretty close there and was able to make that.   
On the last, I saw the projected cut was plus two, so depending on the conditions and what the guys do today, I wanted to try to hole it, anyway.   Hit it a few feet by; and then really knew the second putt was to make the cut, and just lack of concentration on the third and missed that. 
Obviously not the week that I wanted, but you know, I've got a few days to work on a few things and try to get ready for Dubai.

Q.   I imagine with the four birdies, you thought you still had a chance at that stage. 
RORY McILROY:   I was only four off the lead at that point and thinking, you know, I can make a couple more here and I'll be right back in contention.   Unfortunately just went the other way. 

Q.   You've never liked this course. 
RORY McILROY:   (Laughing) I still love this course.   It's a great place and it's a great tournament.   I always enjoy coming back.   Just a pity that this year had to end like that.

Q.   Sounds like the greens have been tough; has the wind been tough, as well?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, the wind is tricky and has definitely made it play a little trickier.   I didn't putt well in Singapore last week and sort of got a way with it.   This week was the same, so I think a bit of putting practise is required in Dubai.

Q.   A bit of a sniffle there, but, what?   Mental tiredness, as well? 
RORY McILROY:   I don't know.   I think if I was completely fresh, I wouldn't have been making the mistakes I was making out there.   As I said I've got a couple days to rest up and get ready for Dubai. 
I got off to a great start.   I was minus four for the first ten holes or whatever it was and had a chance to go to minus five, and then I just started going the other way.   And you know, I just got on a slide and I just sort of couldn't stop it.   Just one of those things, hit it in the wrong spot and misjudged the speed on a couple putts and that's just the way it goes.

Q.   Seemed like your round turned on that bunker shot on the third hole on the par5. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, a little bit.   I was in the middle of the fairway with 220 to go and I didn't make birdie there.   I was pretty disappointed. 
After that, the wheels came off and just didn't really‑‑ that would have been a huge momentum keeper and I just lost all the momentum there.   It was very hard to get it back. 

Q.   Any particular lessons you can learn from this? 
RORY McILROY:   I've got to go definitely work on my putting a little bit the next few days and try to get ready for Dubai that way.   I feel like I'm hitting the ball pretty good still.   You know, I think these couple days off might actually do me good and give me a little bit of a chance to rest. 

Q.   Will you be back next year? 
RORY McILROY:   I'll have to see when the tournament is on the schedule.   But yeah, if it fits, then yeah, of course I'd love to come back.
