Q.   Looks like you'll miss out by one or two, how frustrating is that having left so many out there?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is, it's frustrating, I left myself with a lot of work to do after yesterday, and even today, making, I don't know, five birdies and an eagle, six birdies and an eagle, to end up shooting only 2‑under par, there's a lot of mistakes in there and a lot of wasteful play.   Second year in a row that I'm not playing the weekend at The Irish Open, it's not a very nice position to be in. 
Yeah, I don't know what else to say.   Just very disappointed.

Q.   Having shot 37 on the front nine, you needed 30 coming home.   When you eagled 10, did you think, right, I can get going then?
RORY McILROY:   I did.   I felt that was the start of something.   Then hit it in the water hazard left of 12 and that set me back.   But came back well with a birdie on 13 and had two good chances on 14 and 15.   I hit two really good putts on both and they didn't drop, and then got a bit of a flyer on 16 out of the rough and that was really it.   Proud of myself with how I fought out there and didn't give up, and tried for the last shot.   Gave myself a chance to try to make the cut with the big birdie putt on 17, but just wasn't meant to be.

Q.   Are there positives you can take from the week?   You've been like there all year, just making too many mistakes. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I just need to tighten it all up and become a lot more consistent, and just make the bad shots a little bit better and not be as wasteful around the greens.   If I can do that, I know my game is right there.   But I've got a couple weeks off now to work on my game a little bit and play some links golf can get ready for The Scottish Open and The Open. 

Q.   You played your heart out, six birdies and an eagle. 
RORY McILROY:   And it only added up to a 69, 2‑under par.   Yeah, I tried till the very last shot out there.   I was really desperate to make this cut, especially after missing the cut the year before.   You know, I was grinding on the back nine, trying to hole chip shots and hole putts and to do whatever I could to make the cut.   Looks like I'm going to fall one short.   
             Obviously very disappointed. It's a tournament that is very important to me, and I want to do well.   To come here for two years on the bounce and not even be in for the weekend, that's not very nice.

Q.   You birdied the third, made the early birdie you needed, and then the 7 on four, how did that happen?
RORY McILROY:   I don't usually press my luck or try to blame anything, but terribly unlucky.   I just clipped a branch on an overhanging tree.   It could go anywhere, just clip the leaf or still go down the fairway or be in the right rough or whatever.   Must have hit something pretty hard and dropped straight down and couldn't do anything with it apart from go back to the tee box and play three off the tee. 
So that's how the seven was made there.   Just some sloppy sort of approach play and some wastefulness around the greens with the other four bogeys or whatever it was.

Q.   Does it make it even more disappointing when you see such a big crowd out there with such big support today, and so many other Irish golfers at the top of the leaderboard?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is disappointing not to be able to personally play in front of them this weekend, but more so for them a little bit.   Not to be here over the weekend the second year on the bounce, as I said, isn't what I want to do when I come back home to play. 
But I'll be back next year and try and do better.

Q.   Time for a rest and regroup and get ready for what's going to be an important, busy summer for you. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is.   I was thinking, this is my sixth tournament in eight weeks.   I've had a busy stretch here with a lot of stuff going on, so it will be nice to have a couple of weeks to regroup and play some links golf and get ready for The Scottish Open and The Open Championship. 
Yeah, would have been nice to play two more days of golf but looking forward to a bit of a mini‑break.

Q.   Have you had an Irish Open where you thought, I enjoyed that and played to my potential?
RORY McILROY:   I look back at every Irish Open really and say that I enjoyed it, but can I look back and say that I played to my potential in any of the ones I've played?   Definitely not.   Not even close.   Not even close. 
I'd love to be able to produce my best when I come back home, and it hasn't been this year or last year or the previous years, but hopefully I'll start to in the future.

Q.   Is there an underlying reason for that?   There is a lot demanded of you always over the course of the week?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, but I don't think it's anything to do with that.   It's definitely been the first Irish Open where I've felt the least pressure.   I went out and really enjoyed it and played and fought for every shot and smiled, and so that part of it; I would have liked to have gotten a little bit of practice on Tuesday, but obviously clubs didn't arrive till Wednesday morning, so that made it a little difficult.   Can't really put it down to anything.   Just one of those weeks.

Q.   Do you think the crowds out there deserve an Irish winner this weekend? 
RORY McILROY:   Of course.   I think every year they deserve an Irish winner.   They are the best crowds of the year.   They are just so supportive, and obviously being Irish, standing ovations on the greens, it's just so nice to be able to play in front of.   They don't just deserve one this year; they deserve it every year.
