 Q.  (Indiscernible - crowd.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was really nice.  I said to Harry walking up the last there, it's been a while.  It's been a while since I played like this and sort of put my foot down, but it was so nice to do it today.   
Obviously a huge confidence builder not just for next week, but for the rest of the season.  To be tied for the lead and to play the way I did, play with that freedom and play with no inhibitions, take driver and stay aggressive, I think this will -- obviously very proud of what I've done today.   
Hopefully sets up well for the rest of year, too.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible - crowd.)  
RORY McILROY: I think when I birdied 13, the par-3; 8-under.  I mean, birdied 14 with that long putt and I'm thinking, Okay, here we go.  So I was trying.  It was in my mind.   
Obviously eagle on 17 really put it into focus.  I just leaked a little 6-iron on 18 there.  I was trying my best with a bunker shot, but wish I would've had a putt for it instead of a bunker shot.  I'm really proud of how I played today and can't wait for the rest of the season.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible - crowd.)  
RORY McILROY: I can't wait.  The reception from the Canadian crowds have been incredible this week.  I think I somewhat endeared myself to them by cheering for the Raptors on Sunday night when I went to the game.  They couldn't have been any better.  They've been so welcoming all week.  As you said, I can't wait to come back next year.
