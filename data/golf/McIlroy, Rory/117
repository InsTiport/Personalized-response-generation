RORY MCILROY: And I said the higher you're going up to the 18th tee, I can't remember the last time I played a round of golf without a birdie.  I was like, I better birdie this last hole.  Thankfully I did.  It was nice to finish that way.
Q. What sort of self-talk do you use to yourself when you're out there?  Because I agree with you.  I was quite close to the green for a lot of the putts, a lot of them looked good, and there just seemed to be a lid on it sometimes.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it was either wrong speed at some times or sometimes just a little bit of line, either way, you know, high or low.  And just keep it hitting good putts.  That's all you can do.  I guess it's early in the tournament.  Keep hitting good shots.  Don't let it frustrate you.  Keep hitting good putts.  Eventually things will turn.  Hopefully that birdie on the last was the turning point, finish on a positive note and come back tomorrow and hopefully get into red figures for the tournament.
Q. And do you use anything positive, the fact that you've seen there's a 63 out there, because in the practice rounds I don't think anybody would have expected to score that low?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, 63 -- and there's a 64 out there as well from Danny Lee.  So there's a couple of loose scores.  I mean, look, if you can put the ball in play and give yourself chances, I felt like I gave myself enough chances today to shoot something sort of in the mid-60s.  But, yeah, I mean, it gives me hope.  It gives me hope I can go out tomorrow and shoot a low one.
Q. Brooks Koepka said the difference between a subpar round and 75 is marginal, and maybe like today, grinding out the 72, was really important.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I think so.  I think that's a little bit, you know -- there's definitely a lot difference between a 75 and a 63.  But, yeah, around this golf course, the margins are fine.  And if you miss the fairway by a yard or two, it can make the difference between hitting a shot into 10 feet and having a birdie chance or having to get up-and-down from 100 yards for par.  But I did that well tonight.  Hit enough fairways, felt like I hit enough greens, and, you know, hit good putts, and some days they just find a way to not go in.
Q. And the way that the round went and you got the birdie on the last, finally made your only birdie, how much of an important step is that, stepping into the morning round, fresh greens and Round 2?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, that's the other thing, the greens were starting to get a touch bumpy out there, so that was making it difficult in terms of speed not trying to be too aggressive with your putts and not leaving yourself those three- and four-footers all the time.
But, yeah, birdie at the last was great.  I'm happy to get that birdie.  And as I said, hopefully it's the turning point in the -- not the way I've played, but just in my scoring and taking advantage of the shots I've been hitting.
Q. What's your reaction when you get out here and before you hit a shot, you've seen not only there's a 63 out there, but Brooks put it up there?
RORY MCILROY: All I do is concentrate on myself.  I've been out here long enough to know that a first round score is just a first round score.  The golf course is hard enough without looking at other people.  I'm just trying to do my own thing.
Q. They were saying on TV the greens -- there's probably less turn in them than you think.  Do you think that was the case?
RORY MCILROY: Yes and no.  They are deceptive.  That's why I've been using the green book a bit this week because they are very subtle.  Actually reminded me of greens from back home that are quite flat and they just have little subtle breaks here and there.  The green book's been pretty helpful.
So yeah, you know, if I can just hit the ball similar tomorrow and make a few more putts and get myself into red numbers going into the weekend, I'd be pretty happy.
