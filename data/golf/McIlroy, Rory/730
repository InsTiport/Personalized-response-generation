Q.   Everyone wants to talk about how you got to the course here this morning, tell us what happened?
RORY McILROY:   I thought I was off at 12:25 instead of 11:25 and was casually making my way out of the hotel room door, and I got a call saying, you have 25 minutes till tee off.   I was a bit worried then. 
But as soon as I got to the course I was fine and settled into the match and obviously delighted to win. 

Q.   How did it happen? 
RORY McILROY:   I read the tee times on my phone, and they are obviously on Eastern time and it's Central time here.   So an hour back, so one of those things.

Q.   Police escort to the course?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, police car, in the front of the police car.   At least I wasn't in the back. 
No, police car and got here as fast as we could.

Q.   Just tell us how you played after that obviously because great to take down a man who has been a bullwort for the U.S. side. 
RORY McILROY:   I played great.   I was very solid out there today.   Didn't really do much wrong.   He made a few mistakes and I took advantage of that. 

Q.   So much going on behind you, how do you think it looks from a European point of view at the moment?
RORY McILROY:   We got off to a good start but there's a lot of tight matches in the middle and the end, and if we can sort of turn around or get them to go our way, we still have a great chance.
