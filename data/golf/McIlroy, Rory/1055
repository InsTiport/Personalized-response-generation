   RORY McILROY: It happened early on, I got to 2-under through six, and then through nine, and then having, I don't want to say I got unlucky, but I got unlucky on 10. The ball catching the face and then came back. But I made a great 4.   
 Then I didn't birdie 12, and I bogeyed 13, and bogeyed 16, as well, a couple of loose ones, but came back well with two good birdies and finished fifth on my own. Ross played so well, I don't even know if I could have capped it off. He played great.   
 This is a great week for me, because it's put me back on track, another top-five finish, and looking forward to next week. I feel as if I've got the game to go and win there next week, so this is hopefully a good building block for the rest of the season.  
  
  Q. Did you go out there with a sort of score in mind today?  
 RORY McILROY: I thought if I shoot 65, it would have been, but that would have only got me into a playoff.   
 To shoot 65 out there would have been very tough, and it just makes Ross's 64 look so much better, because it was an incredible round of golf, really, no blemishes on the card and he did really, really good.
