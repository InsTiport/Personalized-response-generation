Q. That was a tough match.  What is it like when pros play like Zach Johnson?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, he really doesn't give you anything.  We probably didn't make as many birdies out there as we should have.  He hits it in the water on 12, makes his par.  Gets it up and down on 15 or 16 for birdie to get it back to one.  He just hung in there.
We both really didn't have our best stuff.  But I definitely produced it when I needed it on the last.  Lucky to get through to this afternoon.
Q. They call it surviving and advancing in NCAA basketball tournament.  That's what you did today.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, that's the name of the game.  Match play, I would have liked to play better, but I played a little bit better than Zach and that's what I needed to do.  Made some birdies but made a few mistakes.  Just happy to be through to the quarterfinals and hopefully the standard of my golf can go up another level this afternoon.
Q. You play Chris Kirk.  I followed you at Deutsche Bank a couple of years ago, kind of a match play situation.  What do you have to do better this afternoon?
RORY McILROY: I guess I've got to convert a little bit better.  I missed a couple of putts.  I gave away two or three really soft holes.  You can't do that.  You can't do that in match play, especially at this stage.  I need to play the par-3s a little better, as well.  My par-3 playing hasn't been great this week.  I've been a little conservative with my lines.  At this stage of the game you need to be aggressive.  I'm going to go out and fire at pins and make as many birdies as I can.
