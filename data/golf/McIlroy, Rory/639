 Q.   An up‑and‑down round of 68, how do you feel about that one?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was good.   I finished well, finished strongly, which was important, especially after making bogey on 14 and only going in there with a 6‑iron and hitting into the water was pretty disappointing.  
But another day where I gave myself plenty of chances, and still feel like I left a couple out there.   But you know, not a bad position going into tomorrow.   It looks like the guys aren't getting too far ahead depending on what happens the last few holes.   But I need to shoot something a bit lower tomorrow to have a chance.  
   
 Q.   Got to ask you about this conversation you've had with the president of The PGA of America about potentially the US PGA Championship going to Royal Portrush.   Tell us about that.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I didn't speak to Ted about Portrush in particular.   He's always been a fan of Ireland as a venue.   I mean, I think it's a great thing.   It's very‑‑ it's something totally different, totally out of left field.   
And if it were to happen, it would be great, but I know Ted is a big fan of Ireland.   I know Pete Bevacqua, as well, the CEO of The PGA of America, he's a big fan, and maybe one day it can happen.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the round if you would.   
RORY McILROY:   It was a solid third round.   I feel like I could have been a couple of shots lower, but still, a decent round, and you know, went in with a decent chance going into tomorrow.   I'll need something around 60, in the low 60s, anyway, to have a chance.   
But at least I feel like I'm going out on the golf course tomorrow with a chance to win the golf tournament.  
   
 Q.   And that does suggest you are looking at leaderboards, you're assessing what is necessary?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   I knew the putt on the last was a big putt, just so the guys couldn't get too far ahead.   They have got a couple of birdieable holes coming in there, and you know, depending on what happens, I'm four behind at the minute, could be five or six before the end of the day.   I know I'll need something pretty special tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Quail Hollow?  
RORY McILROY:   Something like that.   Something like that work.   Something like this time last year, five birdies to finish with a good 13 holes to start would be good, too.
