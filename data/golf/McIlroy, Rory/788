Q.   Little disappointed with the 18th hole there, pretty solid golf.   Positive result really for the week, deciding to play here in Memphis.
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, it was.   I saw a lot of positive signs this week.   I got in a good position after 11 holes of the final round and hit a couple of shots coming in, but, you know, overall it's still a pretty good week and just looking forward to getting to San Francisco and going there.

Q.   What happened on 18?   Was the 3-wood off the tee?
RORY MCILROY:   3-wood off the tee.   Trying to hit the same shot I hit yesterday off the tee and turned it too much.   I was missing that 3-wood left all day.   To be honest, I wasn't really that comfortable with it, but I knew it was the shot that I needed to play and I didn't hit the way I wanted to.

Q.   Obviously your standing after the birdie on 11, you had to be feeling good.   What happened there?   Was it the swing, the golf course, type of competitive nature that gave you some of the bogies coming down the stretch?
RORY MCILROY:   No, it wasn't -- a bad swing off tee with the ball going in the water.   14, the par-3.   I hit a great shot in there, hit it a little too long.   Should have made birdie on 16.   Made a great birdie on 17.   Then the last, I just tried to hook it like yesterday and turned it a little too much. 
You know, overall it's been a decent week.   Looking forward to getting to San Francisco and I can take a lot from this week into next week.

Q.   Did you need to win this week to make the decision to come here worth it?
RORY MCILROY:   No, definitely not.   I wanted to come here this week just to get some competitive rounds.   I said in the early part of the week, if I got into contention, that was great.   I did that.   I had a real good chance to win the golf tournament.   I didn't do that.   I'm happy I came here, and I feel like I'm well prepared going into the U.S. Open.

Q.   What a week you had.   Just how are you feeling about your game for next week?
RORY MCILROY:   I felt pretty good.   I had a great chance to win this week, and it didn't quite happen.   So, you know, I can take a lot of positives from this week into the U.S. Open next week.   So, it was a great chance to win another tournament, and I didn't quite capitalize on it.   I'm a little disappointed with that.

Q.   You were having success on 18 all week.   What happened on the tee?
RORY MCILROY:   A bad swing.   Trying to turn it off the bunker and just turned it a little too much.   I mean, it was a bad swing at the wrong time.

Q.   What did you think about this tournament?
RORY MCILROY:   Fantastic.   What it does for the children's hospital is absolutely incredible.   I think the whole community comes and supports the tournament.   It's played on a great golf course.   I really enjoyed myself this week.

Q.   Did you hit a 3-wood the last hole, kind of placed it?
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah.   Just wasn't -- didn't make a good swing at it.
