 Q.  A round of two halves, wasn't it. Tell us about the first part and more about the second part?  
RORY McILROY: I got off to a bit of a slow start. The course is set up tough. The rough is pretty thick in areas. The greens are pretty firm and I think I went out with the mind-set of sort of try to play my way into the round. I did that. I birdied the holes that I should birdie on the back nine, apart from 18, I birdied 14, I birdied 16. Got myself to under par. Then hit a bad drive on 18. But made a good bogey in the end.   
Yeah, once I made the turn, things started to go for me a little bit more. Yeah, after nine, I didn't expect to shoot 5-under par, but it's nice to shoot that score and get right into the tournament.   
 Q.  It's beautiful when it starts flowing, isn't it. You always seem to have a spring in your step and everything becomes fluid.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think it's momentum. Sometimes you feel it a little more than other times and definitely got to momentum on that back nine today, and tried to sort of ride that momentum to the very end. It would have been nice to pick up one more, had a good chance for birdie, but after the start today, to shoot 5-under, I'm not complaining.   
 Q.  It was scorable today, wasn't it.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, looking at the leaderboard and looking at the scores that have been shot, it definitely was scorable. There was no wind, so it was a day to take advantage of the conditions.   
It looks like the conditions are going to say that way for the next few days, but it's nice, the last few tournaments I've played, I've had a bad opening round and then been trying to play catch up. At least now, I'm right in the thick of things from the start, which is a better place to be.
