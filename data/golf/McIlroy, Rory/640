  RORY McILROY:   Testing day.   A couple of holes where I didn't get it up‑and‑down like I should have and didn't take advantage of some of the opportunities I gave myself.   But yeah, I mean, it could have been a few better.   But I still haven't done myself much damage and hopefully the weather clears up a little bit by the weekend and we can start making a few more birdies. 

Q.   You seem to have eliminated the big number, though. 
RORY McILROY:   Definitely more consistent with my ball‑striking, which is a big thing.   Obviously when you do that, you're not going to hit as many shots off line or as many destructive shots; you sort of rack up numbers by doing that.   That's been a good thing. 
As I said, I'm giving myself a lot of opportunities and I'm just not taking advantage of them the way I should have.   Just wasn't quite efficient enough the first two days in terms of taking advantage of those opportunities that you give yourself.   But as I said, I'm not too far away, and a good one tomorrow and see what happens.

Q.   Your game in the last couple of years has really come on in the wind, the way you play in the wind.   Do you think a couple of years ago you would have scored as well? 
RORY McILROY:   I grew up in it I guess but the last couple of years it's got progressively better I think.   I played well at The Honda Classic there, won in the wind there, which is nice.   I always felt like my wind game when I play on courses like this is okay. 
When I get to links and you have to sort of keep the ball a bit more on the ground and it's going to run a bit further, that's something that would be more of what I would try to improve on.   In the wind, the ball hits and stops, anyway.   So it's not like you have to judge when it gets on the ground, as well.
