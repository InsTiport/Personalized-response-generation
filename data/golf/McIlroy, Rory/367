Q. We were using a lot of adjectives to describe your match.  How would you describe it?
RORY McILROY: Scrappy.  I don't know if they used that one.  The quality of golf out there wasn't too good.  I feel like it's hard for the quality to be that good too because the wind is gusty.
Even you see on 17, I felt like I had a great shot right over the pin and left it 10 or 11 yards big.  It was always hard to judge your distance.  I didn't have my best stuff today, but I hung in there and hit good shots when you needed to.  I felt like I played tee to green very well from sort of 14 on.  So I'm just happy to get the win.
Q. You didn't lead until the last hole.  Hoe would you describe this day?
RORY McILROY: It was a day where you just sort of had to hang in there.  With the wind it's tricky.  It swirls around here.  It drops, it gusts.  It's tough to pick a club.  I really struggled with that today.  I hit some good shots, but I just had to grind out pars and that's what I did coming in and ultimately that was good enough.
I know if I want to progress further in this tournament, I'm going to have to play better than I did today.
Q. You go in the water at 13, but then suddenly your focus changes.  I just noticed an intensity about you.  Did you feel that yourself?
RORY McILROY: I sort of needed that.  I felt like the first few holes I was a little bit flat.  I think teeing all off so late as well, I came off at 2:20.  We're not really used to do doing that too much.  I was a little flat the first few holes.  Once I needed to play well, I felt like I went up a gear and hit some good shots on the way.
Q. It reminds me a little of last year?
RORY McILROY: Match play is all about just getting through.  Especially this time you don't have to play your best golf these rounds.  You have to get through and get by and get into the weekend.  I'm one step towards doing that after today.  I know that I'm going to have to play a bit better if I want to win my next matches.
