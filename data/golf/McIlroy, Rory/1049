   RORY MCILROY: It was a really solid round and could have been a little better, but I made a couple of putts for pars that were very crucial as well. Overall I was very pleased with how I finished.   
  
  Q. How valuable is this sort of experience?  
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it's great. I don't know where I'm going to finish, but it's going to be a Top 15 anyway, so it's another good performance in a major this year and gives me a lot of confidence going into the rest of the season.  
  
  Q. Are you looking forward to the Open?  
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah. I feel as if I've got the game to contend in majors now and try and compete to win them. So yeah, the Open is a big target of mine in the summer.   
  
  Q. Congratulations on what's been a great finish to your U.S. Open. Your initial reflections on what you've done here.   
 RORY MCILROY: I think it's been a very solid week. I knew I shot a couple of 70s and 72s in the first rounds and I knew the guys were lighting it up a bit.   
 I knew if I just hung around and stayed patient, I knew around level par would be a very good result in this tournament, and that's what I was trying to do today to get back to level. It didn't quite happen. I got it to plus 1 for the tournament but finished at plus 2.   
 It was a really solid week, and I can take a lot from it.   
  
  Q. Was there any moment where you felt like something bigger than a Top-10 was in the prospects?   
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I made a really good par save on the 5th and I hit it in to about eight feet on 6 for birdie. I thought if I could birdie that to get to level par for the tournament and birdie one more on the way in, I felt I might have a chance, and I missed the putt on 6 and bogeyed 7.   
 But you know, it was weird, as well, because we were playing behind the final group. It was quite surreal.   
 But it was a great week, and it's been a long one, and I feel I've done very well.
