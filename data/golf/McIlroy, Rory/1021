   RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, 4-under through nine, I thought I had a really good chance. My target was 20 at the start of the day, which obviously would have been, well, sort of good enough. But you know, Simon Dyson played great, 7-under through eight holes, he just played incredible. So hats off to him. And I just didn't play well enough on the back nine to really have a good chance, so second is okay. I wanted better, but it moves me up in The Race to Dubai a bit, and there's always Portugal to make up some more ground. 

 Q. You were saying yesterday, you sort of expected someone to come out of the pack. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it will be hard to catch him, but I was doing my best. Birdied 7 and 9 to get to 4-under par, and get to within three. But the back nine did play a little tougher. Definitely the wind got up a little bit and it got a bit trickier. 16 and 17 played particularly tough and two bogeys there; what I was annoyed about was birdieing 15, and then bogeying 16 straight after again and bogeying 17. 
 But then, I made a great three at the last, and you know, I knew -- I had a putt on 17. I knew if I held that for par, and then birdied the last, would I have been second on my own and that would have got me to the top of the Order of Merit. 
 But it didn't, and missed the putt, but I still made three at the last. So it puts me very close to Martin. I don't know if I've moved into second. 

 Q. Points are good, but it's the win you want. 
 RORY McILROY: I've always been contending and today was a good chance, but Simon, you deserve to win if you go out and shoot 66. Hats off to him, he played great. 
 To play the Old Course, it was good. I wish I had played a bit better for my dad, but still, scored 69 on St. Andrews with my final putt at the last.
