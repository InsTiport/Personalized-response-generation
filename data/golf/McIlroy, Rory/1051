   RORY McILROY: There must have been seven or eight putts out there that looked as if they were going to go in and just went the other way.   
  
  Q. What's the best part of your game, you feel, coming into Bethpage Black?  
 RORY McILROY: My driving was really good this week, which you need. I didn't putt very well. I didn't think I putted very well all week. So didn't take my chances, and I'll try and work on that for the next -- work on that the next couple of weeks going towards the middle of the season really.   
  
  Q. How early do you get to Bethpage?   
 RORY McILROY: Friday. I'll be in New York for the weekend. I'll be there on a couple of company days.  
  
  Q. How many practice rounds will you get there?  
 RORY McILROY: Three. Well, 2 1/2.  
  
  Q. Enough to get to know the course?  
 RORY McILROY: Exactly.
