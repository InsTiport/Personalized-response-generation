RORY McILROY: I felt like my game was good coming in here.  I think I was just blown away by the wind yesterday.  That was the thing.  I mean, I haven't played in wind like that for quite a long time.  I just felt like I couldn't hit it far enough left or right to allow for the wind.  It was a lot of crosswinds yesterday and I felt like -- holes like the third hole, I couldn't aim far enough left to keep it in the fairway, so just stuff like that.
You get yourself out of position on this golf course, really you give yourself a bogey and move on.
Today I hit 17 out of 18 greens.  I did a lot of good stuff.  Obviously the conditions were conducive for that.  Yesterday I just wish I could have maybe just had one day to prepare for something like that.  I feel like it would have been a different story.
Q. (Question regarding preparation)?
RORY McILROY: Yes, it's tough.  It's a tough tournament.  I have prepared well here in the last few years.  I come in here with the right attitude.  Even after yesterday I felt like I could come in today and shoot in the 60s and make it to the weekend.  Obviously I played the front nine well, I didn't putt very well.
Q. (Inaudible)?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, just I knew the conditions were good on the back nine.  I knew I had some chances to have some short irons my hand.  I was just trying to look at every flag and hit it there and try to make some putts.
I maybe could have squeezed one more.  I missed the putt on 15.  I could have squeezed one more on the back nine, but it still would have been short of what I would have needed.  The first 27 holes for me were obviously what did it.
