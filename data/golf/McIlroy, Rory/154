Q. What is it about you and The Ryder Cup?
IAN POULTER: I love it and embrace it, and when you have great partners to go out and play golf with, kind of it's inspiring.  So for me, I just want to get on the golf course.  I just want to see the fans.  I just want to hole putts.  And I want to help this team.
Q. You've seen 3-1 U.S. -- what does it say about the mental toughness of the European side?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, I think a big thing for us this week is as Ian said resilience, but also persistence.  You have to persist.  Persist, persist, persist, until it turns around for you, and this morning wasn't ideal, but it was still a better start than the one we got off to at Hazeltine.
We just needed to putt our heads together and go out there and just hit good golf shots.  Foursomes on a day like this is very, very tough format to play.  Just try to get the ball in the fairway and get the ball on the green and for the most part today, we did that.
Q. Must be hugely satisfying?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it is, it's hugely satisfying.  We were 2-down I guess through four or five or whatever it was, and you know, I held a nice putt on 6 for birdie and then we got going after that.
It was a little bit -- we played solid golf and we made our pars in difficult conditions.  The two guys struggled and missed a few fairways and we took advantage of them.
Q. On 13 after your tee shot, did you honestly think you would be putting for birdie on that hole?
IAN POULTER: I had full faith in Rors to get it somewhere on the green.  I said 60 foot would be nice, but what a clutch shot to get it to 25, 30 feet and a little bit of a wind assist to hold its line as it was rolling towards the hole, it was nice to see it drop in.
Q. This is a fantastic afternoon for Europe.
RORY McILROY: Incredible afternoon for Europe.  One we haven't really had since Gleneagles, I guess.  You know, there was a couple of times where we threatened to have a great session in Hazeltine that didn't really materialise, but to see all the blue on the board this afternoon is awesome.
