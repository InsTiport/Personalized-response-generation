  RORY McILROY:   I felt like I was probably a little more on my game last week.   I scrambled really well yesterday to still give myself a chance going into today.   I did some great work last night and drove the ball beautifully today, set myself up to attack these pins.  
   
 Q.   When you came over here and decided to play more regularly here in the United States, did you think you would have six victories, including two major championships and two playoff events before your 24th birthday?  
RORY McILROY:   You know, I never really thought about it.   I just wanted to go out and play as best as I could.   I knew if I played to my ability that I would win events.   I didn't think that everything would happen so quickly, but I'm just on a great run at the minute and trying to keep that going for as long as possible.  
   
 Q.   How big do these Playoffs feel to you?  
RORY McILROY:   They're big.   You've got the best players in the world every week.   Last week it was myself, Louis, Tiger, Vijay.   This week, myself, Phil, Lee, Tiger, Vijay.   I mean, it's‑‑ the fields are really deep, and it's good to be able to win events like this where the quality of the field is so good.  
   
 Q.   You and Tiger are going to play with each other on Thursday in round 1 at East Lake.   That comes a week from Thursday.   As someone who comes over here from another country, how important is it to play well in the United States and win regularly in the United States when you're from outside this country?   
RORY McILROY:   I think it's very important.   I think you're probably accepted by the people a little bit more.   I feel like I've got a tremendous support on the PGA TOUR.   Everywhere I go, the fans couldn't be more supportive and welcoming.   I feel like this is where I belong.   I've always wanted to play on the PGA TOUR, and it's working out pretty good so far.   
   
 Q.   A 67, and you really didn't make any putts today.   
RORY McILROY:   No, I didn't need to.   The ball‑striking was good.   It was a big turn‑around from yesterday, which was very nice.   Obviously very pleased to get my second win in a row and obviously going into Atlanta where I wanted to be in that top spot.  
   
 Q.   This game is hard, and you've won three out of four now.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I'm just on a good run.   I'm playing well, I'm confident, and it's just nice to have these runs.   Hopefully I can keep it going for as long as possible.  
   
 Q.   What do you do with a week off?  
RORY McILROY:   I'm going to go to New York, chill out.   I'm actually going to go train a little bit with the Knicks, so that'll be good fun.
