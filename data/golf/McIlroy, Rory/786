Q.   The score, I guess, pretty much explains what the day went like?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   Just didn't‑‑ I didn't‑‑ I got off to a decent start and then it's just so tough here if you put yourself out of position at all.   It's so tough to make your pars from there. 
I just, too many times just was in the wrong position off the tee or with my second shot and it makes it very difficult.   You know, when you're trying to play catch‑up on this golf course it's very hard.   I was able to make one birdie out there today.   I need to try to make more tomorrow and limit the mistakes.
But you have to be so precise.   Anything just a little off and it really punishes you.   You have to be precise with your tee shots and your iron shots and leave it on the right side of the pins and today I didn't really do any of that. 

Q.   So many things lend themselves to either a great round or a poor round.   Was there one thing you just found troublesome all day or was it a combination of things?
RORY McILROY:   It was a combination of things.   You hit your first shot out of position.   It's hard to get your second shot back into position.   And that sort of‑‑ if you hit one bad shot on any of the holes it's very hard to recover from that.   And that's what I found today.

Q.   Coming in as defending champion there's that added pressure, not only trying to hold up from last year, but try to take this year's too.   Does that plan into your round anything you're trying to do?
RORY McILROY:   No, not at all.   I tried to approach it like any other tournament I play.   I tried to go out there and shoot the best score I could.   And today wasn't my greatest day, but hopefully I can come out tomorrow morning and try and shoot a good one and at least try to be here for the weekend.

Q.   Where do you see the point where you have to say, okay, I can't do this and I can't do that?   What things are in that equation for tomorrow?   What do you have to stop doing or start doing?
RORY McILROY:   I've got to hit it in the fairway for a start.   And from the fairway, I've got to hit it on to the green.   You just keep it simple and try to hit fairways and try to hit greens and not be too greedy.
