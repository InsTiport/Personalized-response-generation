  RORY McILROY:   It's tough to score out there with the way the conditions were.   But tee‑to‑green was really, really good.   A couple of 3‑putts, bogey on 13, bogey on probably the easiest hole on the course, wasn't great.   But apart from that, it was good.

Q.   You seemed to look comfortable?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, everything's sort of falling back into place.   It feels good to feel so positive about my game.   You know, just keep giving myself chances and trying to hole a few more putts.   But it's a nice way to start the week.   From tee‑to‑green, it was really solid, and as I say, it could have been better.   But on a day like today, it's just good to keep yourself there or thereabouts. 
Luke shot 65 but the next is four and three and two, so it's not too bad. 

Q.   Of the nine rounds that you've played, are these the toughest conditions?
RORY McILROY:   Definitely.   I've never witnessed wind like this in China.   It's a little different.
