  Q. Just if we can a couple quick questions.  Just talk about 18, if you can.
 RORY McILROY:   I mean, I just hit a drive that started 10 yards left of where I was aiming and went on the wind and did the same thing with the 4-iron.
 Q. And how hard is it to recover from the start that you had?
 RORY McILROY:   Very hard, especially when you're trying to figure it out as you go along on course, right?  You're not like, you don't really -- you're trying to figure it out but you still know you're not really sure where the shots are coming from an then it's sort of as I said earlier in the week, it's hard to at least to try to eliminate one side of the golf course, basically.
 Q. Last question, is it the harder one of the questions, is it harder to recover from two big numbers or from just not giving yourself enough birdie chances out there?
 RORY McILROY:   Yeah, like both.  I mean obviously the big number one 18 didn't help and then doubling the 1st wasn't helpful either.  So yeah, I just think just it's hard to recover when you just haven't played good.  I mean regardless if you take that 18th hole out it still wasn't a very good day.
