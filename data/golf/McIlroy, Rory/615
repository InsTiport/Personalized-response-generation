 Q.   Thoughts after the restart?  
RORY McILROY:   It was ok. I birdied the first hole, and had an eight foot putt for birdie on the second and lipped it out, then made bogey at the par three fourth. It was ok though. I played pretty good. It was tough out there though with the wind and the firm greens with the moisture on top. It was really skidding. So it was hard when we got back out to control the distance so you had to guess a little how much the ball would skip forward. So it was ok. I ll get back out in the morning and play the last three and a half holes without as much wind and with better conditions.  
   
 Q.   You said you d take under par today?  
 RORY McILROY:   I said I d be happy with anything under par from this round and I m still on course for that. I m happy with the way I played and I d like to get something in the 60s and I d be happy with that.  
   
 Q.   What grade would you give the changes?   
RORY McILROY:   The second hole I had a chance for birdie and to get to three under. I hit a good putt and it just lipped out. The fourth was playing tough into the wind and I bogeyed that after hitting it into the left trap. Overall I played pretty solid though so it was a pretty good day.
