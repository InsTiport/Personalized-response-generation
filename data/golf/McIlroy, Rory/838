Q.   Have you ever had an up‑and‑down day like that in your professional career? 
RORY McILROY:   I don't think so.   Obviously that wasn't the best start, 3‑over through three and I battled back really well to get it back to even par after eight.   Made a mistake on 9 when I brushed the sand off the green, wasn't thinking clearly and a penalty there.   Felt like I played the back nine well, and even par, considering everything that happened out there today is a decent score.

Q.   What happened? 
RORY McILROY:   Nothing.   I mean, my ball was just maybe six feet off the green and there was a lot of sand in between my ball and the hole.   I just brushed the sand and Luke was like, "I don't think you can brush sand off the fringe." 
And I'm like, "Oh, yeah, you're right.   Just one of those things."

Q.   You had the double early and you came back with two birdies and you had a mistake at 9 and came back with birdies.   What does it say about your resiliency that you're able to bounce back? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it happens.   You're going to get a bad deal every now and again, and just have to take it on the chin and try and come back and get the shots back as quick as possible. 

Q.   Let's get the horrible stuff out of the way first.   Two‑shot penalty at 9, was that a loss of concentration; didn't you know the rule; what? 
RORY McILROY:   I think it was a little bit of both of the first week back, as well.   As soon as I bent down to brush the sand and Luke said, "Don't think you can do that."
And I was like, oh, yeah, I can't.   So just wasn't thinking.   Turned a routine 4 into a 6 there and just sort of undone all the great work to get back to even par. 
But felt like I played great golf coming in and made a few birdies and finished at even par which is a decent score considering everything that went on out there. 

Q.   How difficult is it to put it out of your mind when you've just made a mistake like that thinking, I've just cost myself two shots after that battle back. 
RORY McILROY:   It was okay.   I had a great tee shot off 10 and I thought I put myself in position and I had a great second shot on to the green, 20 feet.   So I was almost thinking on the 10th tee, right, let's try to get these two shots back straightaway and didn't quite do it. 
But bogeyed 11, but birdied 12 and 13 to get them back.   It was an interesting round.   I'm not sure I've had so many up‑and‑downs in a round of golf before. 

Q.   You managed to turn around and bounce back; what's the key to doing that? 
RORY McILROY:   Just stayed patient and realise‑‑ JP said something to me out there today.   It's only Friday.   It's not like these things are happening to you on a Sunday afternoon. 
So I've just got to stay patient.   I knew I was going to plan well enough that I was going to hit some good shots coming in and give myself chances. 

Q.   You had a ring side seat watching Tiger Woods play; is this the best golf you've even him play in a long time?   What's your verdict? 
RORY McILROY:   He's definitely got the ball under control.   He seems comfortable.   He's only had a couple bogeys in two days.   He's not making many mistakes and he's very consistent, his ball flight looks good.   Really looking forward to battling over the weekend. 

Q.   Looks like you'll get to play with Tiger again, are you quite pleased about that?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, great.   I enjoy it.   I enjoy his company and we have good chats around the course.   Yeah, it will be good, good atmosphere again, good buzz in the two‑ball, so that will be good. 

Q.   What about the first double‑bogey? 
RORY McILROY:   I need to stop hitting it in these fairway bunkers.   Every time I hit in the fairway bunker I make a bogey or a double.   Again, just try and drive it a bit better, but it's fine. 

Q.   Quite a few birdies today but the few double‑bogeys, give us your thoughts on that. 
RORY McILROY:   It was interesting round to say the least.   I didn't get off to the greatest of starts, and felt like I battled back really well to get myself to even par through eight holes.   Just made a very stupid mental mistake on 9 that cost me two strokes, and then I felt like I played the back nine pretty well at 3‑under. 
So I mean, overall, with everything that happened, it wasn't a bad score.
