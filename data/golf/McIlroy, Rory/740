GRAEME MCDOWELL:  We are still looking at that. We have a team meeting tonight and we will talk through
how the course breaks down for us and we will finalise that tonight. Now we know the opponents
are we are focussed. 
RORY MCILROY:  We have an idea but it s not set in stone. We will talk to the Captain and the Vice-
Captains again tonight and make the decision then. I can t wait for 07:20 in the morning. Leading the
side off in The Ryder Cup   we are going to go out there and get the blue on the board early. 
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  We are going to use the World Number One s power and precision and I will just
knock a few tap-ins in. 


RORY MCILROY:  It is a great honour to lead Europe out there. 
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  It is a great honour   we didn t do that at Celtic Manor so it is a big thing for us both.
For me personally it is huge because I was last man out in the last match and I am first out here. I am
very proud to be playing alongside my great friend and the greatest player on the planet. 


RORY MCILROY:  To be honest they are not the opponents we were expecting. We know that their team is
so strong all the way through but it was a little surprise to see a rookie in their first group. 
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  I was expecting Phil and Keegan to go first but obviously Davis has his strategies and it
will be a great match no matter who we are playing. Jim is a hell of a player, a seasoned campaigner
and Brandt is obviously on a hell of a high after last week and winning the FedEx Cup. 


GRAEME MCDOWELL:  It s huge. Tomorrow morning s session is hugely important and JosÃ© MarÃ­a has
stressed that. We know they are all important but we really feel that it is very important to make a
fast start. 


RORY MCILROY:  I just can t wait. I am so excited right now   I just can t wait to get out there to try and
get the first point. 
GRAEME MCDOWELL:  Couldn t agree more with my partner. We are pretty pumped for this whole thing so
let s get out there and get the blue on the board. 
