 Q.  Your thoughts on that one?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, like it was okay.  I felt like with the way I hit it, I probably could have squeezed a couple more out of the round.  I sort of was trying to stay as patient as I could.  I had a good chance for eagle on 16 and missed, but made birdie.   
Hit it in the middle of the fairway on 18, looking to hit it in two and hit it in the water.  So looking like you're maybe going 2-under through nine and you're back to even.  Then you're just trying to  -- basically I was trying to shoot something in the 60s after that.  I was able to get one birdie on the front nine.   
But yeah, I mean, I feel I hit the ball well.  Greens were a little -- they are soft and obviously there's a lot of footprints and stuff.  I feel I did everything okay.  I just didn't really get it going.  Didn't really get any momentum going.   
But I'll go out there tomorrow and know that I feel like I'm playing well enough to shoot a score in the mid 60s and get myself back into it.   
 Q.  What about the new clubs, as well.  
RORY McILROY: I felt like I drove the ball really well.  Look, I've been driving the ball well anyway, but yeah, it was nice to see the ball flying where it was going.  I would say I would have been level without them and maybe a little bit behind before, and I was hitting it by both of them, so can only be a positive.  Especially when conditions are like this and it's so soft, it goes a long way in the air.  Hopefully that can be to my benefit over the next few days.
