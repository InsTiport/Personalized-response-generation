 Q.  Could you start by giving us your thoughts about joining the professional ranks and the ISM stable, and thoughts for the week? 
 RORY McILROY: think everyone knows that I have known Darren and Chubby for quite a while now and it was the perfect move for me to come out from a pretty good amateur career and turn pro, especially at this event because ISM are running the show here. It has been fantastic and I am really pleased how things have gone over the last few years as an amateur and hope to carry on from there. As for my expectations for this week, I just want to go out and enjoy myself in my first event as a pro. I have a number of events to try and get my card and if that doesn't happen I have Tour School as well. I am not putting too much pressure on myself but I would love to go out this week and play well. 

 Q.  Any advice from Darren in the practice round this morning? 
 RORY McILROY: I met Darren on my ninth birthday at Portrush and have known him since then through the Darren Clarke Foundation. The next time I met him I was 12 and since then we have had a great relationship. He gave me his phone number when I was 13 or 14 and he has been fantastic to me. Anything I wanted to know, I could always ring him up and ask him and it was great to have that. Every time I play in a professional event I try and get a practice round with Darren as he knows so much and there is so much you can learn from Darren. I enjoyed nine holes with him today. 

 Q.  Turning professional you have a lot of backing from some blue chip sponsors? 
 RORY McILROY:  I have. Obviously Jumeirah. I played in the Dubai Desert Classic the last couple of years and have a relationship with them which is great. The Chief Financial Officer is actually from my home town of Hollywood so that is where is started. It is a great relationship for me to have as Jumeirah are expanding all the time and they are going to have hotels all over the world and as I hopefully grow as a professional golfer, they will grow as a brand and I think that is a perfect combination. 

 Q.  Clothing sponsors? 
 RORY McILROY: Nobody, whoever I want. I just have corporate sponsors. 

 Q.  Clubs? 
 RORY McILROY: Titleist. That is another good sponsor. I have played Titleist all my life and it was great they wanted me as a staff player. That works out well as I don't want to be changing clubs and tinkering with things as I start out as a professional. That has worked out really well. 

 Q.  Is it a 14-club deal? 
 RORY McILROY: I am not sure but I play all 14 Titleist clubs anyway so it doesn't matter. 

 Q.  Cap and gloves? 
 RORY McILROY:  Cap is going to be Jumeirah with three sides Titleist. Glove, ball Titleist and shoes Footjoy. 

 Q.  And some Irish backing from your sponsors? 
 RORY McILROY:  Definitely Bennett and FL Partners. I struck a relationship with Neill Hughes and met them in Dubai as well. With the amount of exposure I have got in Ireland over the last couple of years, a couple of sponsors in Ireland will work really well. 

 Q.  Looking back on your amateur career, are they any people that stand out for helping you? 
 RORY McILROY:  The Golfing Union of Ireland first of all. I have travelled all over the world at their expense and they have been fantastic. I have played for them all over the world, in South Africa for the European nations trophy and they have been fantastic. The relationship with Darren. He has been a big influence and always on the other end of the phone. Mum and Dad obviously have been pivotal in my career and have made a lot of sacrifices for me. They have worked very hard to get me where they have and I think this is the point where they step back and let me get on with it. There are too many people to thank but I think they all know who they are who have helped me get to this point. 

 Q.  Are you looking forward to the first time time you invite Mum and Dad to a tournament and pay their way? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah. Hopefully a few years down the line if I keep playing well. I am not really worrying about the money, just want to go out and earn my Tour card. That is what is on my mind. 

 Q.  Oliver Fisher said when he turned pro that his deal with Nike paid for his first year on Tour and that took the pressure off him. Have the deals you have got been that successful? 
 RORY McILROY: I think so. I am pretty comfortable financially. 

 Q.  Graeme McDowell said when he turned pro he didn't have anywhere near the Tour experience you have got. Do you think the fact you have played a dozen tournaments will help you? 
 RORY McILROY: Every time you go out on Tour you feel more comfortable. You get to know more people. It has been great as all the guys have made me feel welcome out here. Because I have that experience hopefully the transition won't be as difficult for me as it has been for some guys in the past. 

 Q.  You played in about 10 or 12 pro tournaments - how different are they to amateur events? 
 RORY McILROY: Playing as an amateur in professional events is quite different but playing as a professional in a professional event is different as every shot counts and one shot could cost you Â£20,000 or whatever. 

 Q.  Have you found it tougher? 
 RORY McILROY: The courses are set up tougher. This week the long rough is eight or ten yards off the greens but other courses it has been two or three yards and around the greens is where is it tougher in championship venues. If you miss the green you have to work harder to save par. 

 Q.  What tournaments have you got invites for? 
 RORY McILROY: This week, Alfred Dunhill, Madrid, Portugal and Madeira I think. Hopefully from those five I can give it a good go and play well enough to try and get my tour card or at least finish in the top 150 to skip the second stage of the Toru School. The good thing about last week was that the first stage is out of the way and I did what I had to do to get through and I can get one with the next five weeks. 

 Q.  Did you feel much pressure at the Q School? 
 RORY McILROY: Not much as I knew if I could play solid golf I could get through. If you are trying to win a tournament and finish in the top 30 that is just okay but at the Tour School, I had it in my mind that if I win then great but I am not going to chase it as finishing in the top 30 was the main objective and I achieved that. 

 Q.  Do you feel you have to dampen down expectations at all? 
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I think people have expectations of me and I have expectations of myself. If I can play some good golf and live up to the expectations, that's the way I am looking at it. 

 Q.  You said last week you had no nerves. If you have a putt to make the cut this week do you think they will kick in? 
 RORY McILROY: Probably. The Tour School last week was about getting the job done. I am sure if I have a five footer to make the cut, I am sure I will be able to make it but it is a bit different when you are playing for money and I am trying o make enough money to make my Tour card. If I can play well this week it will take a bit of pressure off me so hopefully I can go out and play good golf. 

 Q.  Did you earn money off Darren this morning? 
 RORY McILROY: That was only a half. I holed a good putt on the last for a half. 

 Q.  You are still positive? 
 RORY McILROY: I am hitting it well and the greens are so good if you are rolling the ball well you have a lot of chances. I think this course suits me and I am driving it well and if I can get a few putts to drop I will hopefully have a good shout. The greens are a lot quicker than last week. I was thinking about changing putter but have the light one in the bag which is good for these fast greens and I putted well this morning so I will keep that in the bag. 

 Q.  Chubby has said you are perhaps the most exciting amateur to turn pro in the last decade and that puts you there with Sergio and just behind Tiger - how does that make you feel? 
 RORY McILROY: It is nice to be mentioned in the same breath as Sergio and Tiger and if I cam make a start like they did in their professional career I will be very happy. I am just going to go and try my hardest and try and play good golf and hopefully the results will follow.
