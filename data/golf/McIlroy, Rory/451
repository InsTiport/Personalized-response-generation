 Q.   Rory, the last time that you won here, six 3s to finish and a 62.   61 this year and 22-under par.   What is it about this place that just flips on your switch?  
RORY MCILROY:   I'm not quite sure.   I think the golf course does sets up perfectly for me.   I had a goal today to go out there and birdie the par-5s and birdie the two drivable par-4s.   
I knew if I made 6 birdies out there there was pretty much no chance that anyone could catch me and with my length and the way like I'm driving it, it's a big advantage around here and it showed this week.  
   
 Q.   Golf is the sort of game as soon as you feel confident that's when you fall down but you seem to have gotten past that.   Everyone who was watching today, it was an overwhelmingly, staggering performance, it really was on a golf course that is not easy at all.   
You made it look simple.   How do you deal with that as well as you have and not fall into that trap of being overconfident?  
RORY MCILROY:   I think the great thing is I have fallen into that trap before and now that I'm in this position I'll realize if I ever get in that mindset again.   
Back in 2012 when I got to World No. 1 I felt like I got a little bit complacent and had to rededicate myself a little bit.   Not saying I ever lost that.   Just work as hard as I can and try and be the best that I can be and I think that's the only way sort of to fight overconfidence.  
   
 Q.   What is it like to be Rory McIlroy these days?  
RORY MCILROY:   Feels pretty good.   Playing well.   Really happy with my game.   Everything is sort of firing on all cylinders.   I did what I wanted to do the last few weeks.   I got myself up the FedExCup rankings, solidified my places at the top of the World Rankings.   Looking forward to put the feet up tonight and get a bit of sleep and get ready for the next couple many weeks in Europe.  
   
 Q.   Then the U.S. Open?  
RORY MCILROY:   Then the U.S. Open.   Still feels like a long way away.   It's fantastic to play like this.  
   
 Q.   Are you looking forward to the Irish Open in Northern Ireland at Royal County Down?   You got to be licking your chops?  
RORY MCILROY:   I am.   Especially this week with my involvement and the involvement of my foundation there.   It's sort of like my fifth Major this year.   Going to be trying extra hard for that at the end of the five week stretch, try and conserve all the energy that I can and hopefully I can put in a good performance.
