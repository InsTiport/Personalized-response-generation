 Q.  Could you have shot better?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I felt I did well to get to 3-under par for the round after 15.  It was a good birdie there.  I would have taken three pars on the way in and would have been happy going two behind going into tomorrow.   
I had a decent shot on 16.  The only hole I probably made bogey on was 17 after the tee shot, and I got away with a par there.   
I just need to get off to a fast start tomorrow.  I'm obviously disappointed after the way I finished, but I'm still in the tournament.  I'm only a few shots behind.  The wind is supposed to pick up a little bit.  So it will make things interesting.   
 Q.  With that in mind, what will the game plan be tomorrow?  As aggressive as today?  
RORY McILROY: Definitely.  Go out and hit a lot of drivers.  I felt like today the course was perfectly set up to take advantage of it and attack it.  Tried to do that for the most part.  Maybe my wedge play wasn't quite as good as it should have been, but I give myself plenty of chances.  I just need to regroup and get ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Rory, the two back nine bogeys, they were short-ish missed putts, but you putted really well to put yourself in position.  Are all the components, do you think, there to shoot probably the 65 or something like that that you need?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think so.  Even the putts that didn't go in today, I felt like were good putts.  The one on 12 was just a bit of lack of speed.  The one on 16, I probably just didn't give myself enough time to regroup after a photographer was in a world of his own.  And then actually, I felt like that was a good putt on 18 for bogey in the end.  I putted well.  I held out when I needed to.  If I can just -- obviously, if I can make the birdies and just try to limit the damage tomorrow.   
But it will be interesting.  The wind's going to be up, and there's a lot of guys that feel like they have a chance.   
 Q.  Rory, the way you have so much experience in majors, you know that, when you put yourself in position to win, 4 behind, it looks like, that you have a chance.  You know how to do it.  You've been there before.  Is that the feeling that you have to kind of build up between now and tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I've got a bit of experience at this.  Maybe more so than some of the other guys on the leaderboard.  But the leaderboard is packed with a lot of very, very good players.  I mean, Xander today that I played with, he didn't really put a foot wrong.  Obviously, Jordan had a great round.  So there's a lot of great players up there around the lead.   
The only good thing is there's not many players in between me and the lead.  It's not that bunched.  There's a lot of people behind, it looks like, at sort of 4-under and 3-under, but between 5 and 9, there's only a handful of guys, which is nice.   
 Q.  What's the number?  
RORY McILROY: It really depends on the conditions.  I mean, I think, if I can get to double digits under par, I think that would be a good score to post and see what happens.   
 Q.  Rory, you mentioned a photographer.  What exactly happened there?  
RORY McILROY: He was taking a photo of the crowd instead of paying attention to the golf.  It's fine.  That's one of the things that happens.  There's a lot of people out there, and it is what it is.  It's probably my fault, but I just didn't regroup well after it happened.   
 Q.  Seeing Tiger doing well in a major tournament, is that exciting for you in the field?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's good for golf.  He'll definitely be feeling it tomorrow.  It's his first time in the hunt for a major in a while.  So, yeah, it will be good.
