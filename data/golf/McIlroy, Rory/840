 Q.   Tell us about your game?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was obviously playing a little tougher today with the wind.   It's the strongest breeze we've had all week, and yeah, it was tough.   It was tough, the greens were a little firmer.   It was tough to get the ball close to the hole and there's a few difficult holes on the front nine.   I didn't play that particularly well.   
But I played the back nine pretty nicely, four easy birdies, and you know, it was nice to shoot under par and actually pretty positive.   Hit it a lot better today.   Struck it a lot better.   Didn't hole any putts, but felt like I hit some quality shots, which was quite pleasing.  
   
 Q.   Going to be a Top‑5, how pleased can you be with a Top‑5?  
RORY McILROY:   A little disappointed considering the position I was in going into the weekend.   I think all of the damage was done yesterday.   
But I can't be that disappointed.   As I said, I'm pleased with how I hit the ball today.   I struck the ball a lot better than I did yesterday, and that's a very positive take into the next few weeks.
