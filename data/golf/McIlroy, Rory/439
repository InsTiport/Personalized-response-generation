Q.   78 today, I know you would describe yourself as a little angry yesterday.   What emotion best sums up today? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I didn't really know to be honest.   I'm not angry.   A little disappointed I'm not going to be here for the weekend, but if there was any weekend to miss, coming off the back of three good weeks in the States, I'm probably in need of a little bit of a rest.   As I said, I'd still rather be here but it's not all bad getting to go home for the weekend.

Q.   Third missed cut in 45 events.   It's been one heck of a run, but I guess it stings because it's the defence of this great title. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is.   Any time you're defending a title, you want to come back and give it a valiant effort.   This week wasn't really that.   As I said, just dust myself off and get ready for next week at The Irish Open.

Q.   Nevertheless, it's, what, two wins, a Topâ€‘10 and now a missed the cut in the last four events.   You going to cut yourself some slack about all this? 
RORY McILROY:   I think so.   I'm not going to read too much into it.   The it was inevitable at some point that the run was going to come to a bit of an end.   I'm sort of back to my usual at Wentworth.   It wasn't great before I won last year and it hasn't been great after.   It is what it is. 

Q.   One long deep breath before The Irish Open, and in a way it is a huge tournament for you and I know it's sad for you to miss this weekend. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is.   I'd much rather be here for the weekend and try to win another tournament.   If anything good comes out of this, it's just that I get a little bit of a rest over the next couple of days, and feel a bit fresher for what's going to be a really big week for me next week.

Q.   Mental fatigue has been the phrase that's come up the whole time.   Was it possibly just a bit of mental fatigue?
RORY McILROY:   I think it was.   Especially when I was trying to muster up a few birdies coming down the back nine, I just couldn't really get anything going.   As I said, a couple of days over the weekend to refresh mentally, I'll be okay for next week.
