 Q.   Down here with Rory.   It was an interesting day on the golf course.   You looked like you were this close to being perfect.   Couple of swings towards the middle of the back-9.  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, it did, it was a very testing day with the conditions.   I definitely didn't feel as comfortable with my game as I did yesterday.   So, you know, it was a good experience for me just to try and do what I've been working on in my swing and under real competitive pressure.   
For the most part, I held up pretty well.   Few missed shots out there.   I'm only one off the lead and still in a good position.  
   
 Q.   You're not one of those players, you don't have an entourage.   You have your mom and dad.   You have your coach back home.  
RORY MCILROY:   He came out to Memorial last week, and we spent four good days in San Francisco, which was great.   Just trying to get me working on getting my hands a little higher at the top of the backswing.   Give me a little more swing.   I don't get it stuck behind me, and so trying to get the club out in front of me, get it on a better plane.   From there I have more room and time to hit the ball.  
   
 Q.   When you come into any tournament, only one chance to win Sunday afternoon.   Is that the case?  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, or Sunday morning as it's going to be tomorrow.   Yeah.   I'm only one off the lead.   I'm fortunate I'm only one off the lead.   Just going to go out there and give it a good one.  
   
 Q.   One back right now.   Little bit of a struggle out there, you couldn't really feed off each other.  
RORY MCILROY:   It was a tough day.   It was a day where, you know, for me I took one step forward and two steps back.   Every time I made a birdie, I followed it up with a bogey, felt like.   
It was testing out there, tough conditions and the wind was sort of swirling all over the place and made things tricky.   I'm so happy to get back a birdie at the last and one off the lead going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You're struggling with the swing a little bit today, the swing that I saw you make on 12, the knockdown shot you made really looked like you were more level.   The club wasn't underneath.   Did you really try to get more on top of that one?  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I did.   There was a couple shots like that where I took a little bit off where they were really good shots.   The tee shot on the par-3 as well.   So, you know, maybe that should be a good swing thought for me tomorrow trying to swing within myself, and when I do that, I usually hit some good shots.  
   
 Q.   180 yards, 9-iron tried to hit it?  
RORY MCILROY:   We thought the wind was helping a little bit more.   Again, you hit one more club there and you've got the back of the green, which is a tough up and down.  
I didn't leave it in the best of spots.   I was happy to birdie one of the last two and get in here.  
   
 Q.   Get the bad one out of the way.   One back.   That's it for Sunday morning.  
RORY MCILORY:   Yes.
