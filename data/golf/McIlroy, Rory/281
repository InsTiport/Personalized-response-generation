Q. (No microphone.) 
RORY MCILROY: The wind got me with my putt, sort of the ball went up the green instead of coming back down. 
So, yeah, disappointed to finish like that, but I'm still within five of the lead going into the weekend with better conditions on the way. I still feel like I'm right in this tournament.

Q. Still a very resilient display from you today. 
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, you know, I made a few bogeys at the start and then a couple birdies. And it was just one of those days again where you had to grind out pars and pick up birdies when you could. 
I was in position after birdieing 17 on the last to maybe get in at under par for the Tournament, and didn't quite do that, but I'll try to get off to a fast start tomorrow and that will all be forgotten.

Q. What do you think will be required from you tomorrow to get you to where you want to be?
RORY MCILROY: Mid 60s. Yeah, the weather's going to be better, the wind's not going to be as strong, I'm five behind at the minute and there's probably going to be a good few guys that finish ahead of me going into the weekend. 
So, if I can put together a 67 or a 66 tomorrow, I feel like I'll be right in there for Sunday.

Q. Did you adjust your perspective at the start of the week, knowing the weather conditions were going to be as they are, so that you would just be in position halfway?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, that's all you can do. Even just being in position going into Sunday, I know more than most what can happen on Sundays around here, good and bad. I shot 66 in the last round and I shot 80. 
So, it's just all about getting yourself in position, as you said, but I feel like I need something in the 60s tomorrow at least to get myself in there. 
But I'm not disappointed, I'm disappointed by what happened at the last, but I'm in a decent position going into the weekend.

Q. And it has been a bit of survival test the first two days. But you always knew that the weekend forecast was one where scoring conditions might be happening for you and that is really where you are right now. 
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it is, exactly. As you said, just put yourself into position, you try not to shoot too high over the first two days. And then, with the benign conditions, hopefully, for the weekend, I can try to make some more birdies.

Q. Is it in you right now to shoot that number? Do you feel your game is there, because I think it's only 16 competitive rounds this year is all?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I definitely think it is. In those 16 competitive rounds I've shot a couple of 65s and I shot a few good numbers, so it's right there. 
Obviously, it's easier said than done around this golf course, but when you take advantage of the parâ€‘5s, pick up a few others, there's something in the mid 60s, and it would be great score to go into Sunday with.
