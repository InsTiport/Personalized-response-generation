   RORY MCILROY: Again it was another frustrating day, got off to a terrible start, 4-over through some holes. I couldn't get my speed at all an the greens. Struggled with it all week. And yeah, I felt as if I actually played a lot better the back nine, gave myself a few chances, but yeah, just wasn't meant to be. It's been a bit of a frustrating week. I've got one more day to go. Hopefully give it my best and shoot a good score and take a couple of weeks off.   
  
  Q. Wrist all right?  
 RORY MCILROY: It's fine. Just have it wrapped to give it a little more support but it's definitely feeling better than it was yesterday. I mean, I can feel it but it shouldn't be an issue with the way I play.  
  
  Q. Are you able to shape shots --  
 RORY MCILROY: You know, I find that I drove the ball pretty well today. I found it fine hitting off a tee because you're not going into the ground and you're not taking a divot. I find that okay. It's when I start to hit iron shots, where it becomes difficult.   
  
  Q. Still expecting to be playing next at Crans?   
 RORY MCILROY: This is one of my favorite tournaments, so, yeah, I'll take a couple of weeks off. Might not actually hit balls until I get to Switzerland but I give myself the best chance if I just rest.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RORY MCILROY: You know, if I got back to even par for the tournament, it would be different. You've got to be optimistic. You've got to be positive. You know, I think I was tied with Charl for the lowest aggregate score for the four major this is year. I think he's going a little better than I am, so I've got a bit of ground to make up.   
 Yeah, I mean, it would be great to maybe post it. I need something really good to finish in the Top-20 or Top-30. You know, I want to try and do that.   
  
  Q. Do you feel disappointed with what's happened these three days or optimistic for a good round tomorrow?  
 RORY MCILROY: I'm disappointed that I have not been able to play my best, but I'm optimistic. I've got another chance to go out and play 18 holes tomorrow, and have another chance to go out and try and shoot a good score. I haven't shot under par so far this week, so it will be -- I think it will be a good effort to go out and do that tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How much do you regret now looking back --  
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah, looking back on it, it probably wasn't the right thing to do.   
 But if I had of been in that position again and not knowing what's going to happen, I probably would have done the same thing (chuckling). It's one of those things. It was tough. When my wrist hurt the most was on Thursday when I did it, and I shot the best score, so maybe I shouldn't have went and got it strapped up.   
  
  Q. How does it feel in terms of putting?   
 RORY MCILROY: To be honest, I don't know. I've putted terribly this week. So I'd like to say that's part of it but I don't think it should affect it that much. You know, it shouldn't affect it. I mean I don't -- want to make any excuses, because I just haven't played good enough.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RORY MCILROY: That would have been nice. Yeah, I think there was two pivotal moments in this tournament for me. It was obviously the shot on the third on Thursday, and the 6-iron on 17 yesterday.   
  
  Q. Have you had anymore tournament for your wrist over the next few weeks?   
 RORY MCILROY: It's still -- my pronator muscle is still quite sore, so whenever I do it, that there's still a bit of -- a few adhesions, so just try to get those worked out. But apart from that, just rest and ice and more ice and just make sure that it's okay for a couple of weeks' time.   
  
  Q. Rest of the season?  
 RORY MCILROY: I want to try and finish as high up in The Race to Dubai. Looks as if Luke has it sealed up. He's got to going well again today. There's a few more events and it would be great to win a couple more times, because I want to try to end the season well, because even though I won one tournament, it was a major, but I still want to win a few more times to call this season a success.
