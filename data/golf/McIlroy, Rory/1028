   RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, it's been good. I played well today. Just all the damage was done yesterday.   
  
  Q. The birdies didn't go in until 17 today.   
 RORY McILROY: I played well today. I played well both sessions today and held a few putts when I needed to, and Henrik struggled admittedly.   
 I played nicely, so, you know, won two matches today and probably will finish second in the group. I'm just taking one look at it and picking my target and that's all I can do is stroke it and if it goes in, it goes in, and if it doesn't, it doesn't.   
  
  Q. As far as The Race to Dubai is concerned, finishing second was important.   
 RORY McILROY: It probably will be. There's not a big difference between fourth, third and second in the group, but I mean, at least I'm gaining a little bit of ground.   
  
  Q. Will you head to China?  
 RORY McILROY: On Monday.   
  
  Q. Big run?  
 RORY McILROY: Big run: China, Hong Kong, Dubai, World Cup, and Sun City after that. So nice stretch coming up and then off for the rest of the year and then start again in Abu Dhabi.   
 An important stretch coming up and I feel as if I'm playing well enough to contend in all three.   
  
  Q. I wanted to ask you about the other thing, about America and all that.   
 RORY McILROY: I think I know what I'm going to do but I'm not going to announce it. I'll just keep you guys guessing.
