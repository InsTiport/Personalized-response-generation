Q.   Can you comment on today and the weekend?   It was kind of a‑‑
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was a disappointing weekend, just one of those things.   I played pretty well over the first couple days and then just came out on Saturday and really just didn't have it that front nine, and that sort of killed me for the rest of the tournament.   Yeah, I mean, just one of those things. 
But I'll come back next year and try my best again.

Q.   What kind of lessons did you learn this week? 
RORY McILROY:   I don't know.   I mean, I didn't play great, and I haven't really thought about it yet.   But I'll take a couple weeks off, reflect and think about anything that I tried to‑‑ that I didn't do so well and try and put it right and just try and get back at it and prepare for the U.S. Open. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY:   It was nice, yeah.   It was good.   I watched all of it.   They got off to a great start and held on well at the end. 

Q.   Was there one particular thing, driver?
RORY McILROY:   No, just sort of a combination.   I actually felt like I played okay, just was a couple yards off here and there and missed the slopes and missed the greens in the wrong spots, and if you do that here, it's very difficult. 

Q.   How did you play today?
RORY McILROY:   One better than yesterday.   No, I got off to a bad start and just couldn't really recover from that.   I felt like coming into the weekend I had a chance and sort of blew up the first nine holes on Saturday, and it wasn't great, so I was just trying to recover some today, but I didn't really have my best game today.

Q.   Going home what do you do to try and regroup for next year?
RORY McILROY:   I've got 12 months.   That's a long time.   If you take last year to now, a lot's happened.   You know, it's fine.   Obviously you hope you're coming in here to do a lot better, and I felt like I had a good chance coming into the weekend. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   That's one I really do try to get myself up for.   Just got to go out to SanFrancisco and try to get another major.
