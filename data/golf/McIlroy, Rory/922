  Q. What was the key to your round today and what'll it be tomorrow?  
 RORY McILROY: Patience and patience. Yeah, I stayed -- stuck to my game plan really well, stayed really patient. You know, things weren't going that well for me, 1-over through 12 holes, and then played the last six holes in 3-under. It was great. Yeah, that was the key thing for me, just really staying patient.   
  
  Q. After you make the putt on 17 it's human nature to think about the green jacket. How do you not get ahead of yourself?  
 RORY McILROY: 18 tee shot is really tough. I was just thinking about trying to finish off the round really well. I hit two great shots into the last so it would have been nice to hole the putt. But you know what, I'm happy with where everything is at. I felt as if I handled my emotions really well out there today, and hopefully I can just keep it up tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How are you going to sleep tonight?  
 RORY McILROY: I'll sleep all right. I probably won't get to bed until later on. There's a big rugby match on tomorrow. Ulster, my team, are playing Northampton, so I'll have to get up at about 10:00 to watch that. I haven't had any trouble sleeping the last three nights, so hopefully it'll be the same.
