Q.   You are just playing beautiful golf.   How would you describe how you have played?
RORY McILROY:   Definitely the best I've played scoringâ€‘wise.   I feel like tee to green it's been pretty similar.   I was able to take advantage of some of the good shots I was hitting today.   I putted a lot better.   I think I made 6 or 7 birdies there in 13 holes.   Really happy with how this morning went and we need of the same this afternoon. 

Q.   You were saying earlier in the week you desperately would love to get to Vegas and go to that fight tonight.   Any chance that you are going to making that flight over there? 
RORY McILROY:   I'll need to play even better this afternoon to have a chance.   I'm not sure.   Two tickets there, there's a plane waiting.   Whether I get on it or not we'll have to say.   Obviously this takes priority over everything else.   I'll give it my all this afternoon and try and get through to tomorrow.
