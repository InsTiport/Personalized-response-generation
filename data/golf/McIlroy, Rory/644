  RORY McILROY:   The back nine was much better than the way I played the back nine yesterday.   It was good.   I was falling way behind, nine or ten shots off the lead or whatever it was.   I just wanted to finish strongly so at least I can go out and have a chance tomorrow, if I get off to a fast start.   
Obviously there's a couple of guys, Poults and G‑Mac, between myself and Dustin, who is way out in front.   So try and catch those guys early and then see what I can do from there.  
   
 Q.   But it is a tidy third round score, isn't it, just in the context of others shooting lower.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, there's no wind today, and the course was a little softer, as well, just because of the moisture in the air.   So there was good scores to be had out there obviously; Martin shooting 62, Poults 63, G‑Mac 64.   There's a lot of low scores out there and shooting 67 seemed pretty average to be honest.  
   
 Q.   Do you still sense an opportunity?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, for sure.   Again, I need to get off to a faster start.   The last couple of days, I've sort of been even par through four or five holes, and really need to be 2‑ or 3‑under to give yourself a kick‑start because you've got two good chances on 7 and 8 to make birdies there, and you know, you see guys at 4‑ or 5‑under par and then you have some chances on the back nine, as well.   There's definitely a low score out there.   You just need to take advantage of the holes that you really should be birdieing.   
   
 Q.   And I take it, it's back to the positivity that you mentioned prior to the tournament, it's plenty of reasons to be cheerful.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, for sure.   I'm giving myself plenty of chances for birdies still and I'm up there contending in a WGC, so it's‑‑ yeah, good signs.   Still a little bit of work to do on a few areas of the game, but it's definitely heading in the right direction.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the fans in China compared to other tournaments on the PGA TOUR?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I mean, it's obviously‑‑ golf is still quite new, and I think the fans are learning all the time, every time we come back here, they are getting more and more knowledgeable about the game, and they are enthusiastic.   They want to come out and support us and watch us play, which is great.   So it's great to be able to play in front of fans like these.
