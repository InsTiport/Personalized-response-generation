  Third Round 66. 15-Under Total. 195

 Q. Nice way to finish the round? 
 RORY McILROY: Definitely. I shot the same score as yesterday, but definitely a nicer way to finish the round. It gets me within a couple of the lead, depending on what Poults and Kang do on the last. 
 But yeah, I'm a couple behind, but feel as if I'm playing well and made some key up-and-downs on the back nine to keep myself in there. I think my patience paid off with a birdie at the last.

 Q. A day that you had to be patient out there; the greens were a little tricky today?
 RORY McILROY: There were still scores to be shot out there. I didn't quite have it as well as I had it on Thursday and Friday, but you know, 66 is still a decent score. But I need to go out tomorrow and try and put a low one on the board and see what happens.

 Q. Certainly within you to shoot a low one tomorrow, isn't it?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, of course. If I can go out and shoot something similar to what I shot on the first day, I'll have a great chance. 

 Q. Standing on 18 just now, did yesterday's troubles come into mind?
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I took a different club off the tee and tried to get it down there a bit and it paid off and had a wedge into the green and was able to take advantage of it and make a birdie.

 Q. What do you reckon the winning score will be tomorrow, the winning number? 
 RORY McILROY: I'd say 21 or 22. I'll have to shoot something -- definitely it will be in the 20s. I know I'll have to go out and shoot a low one tomorrow and hopefully I can do that.
