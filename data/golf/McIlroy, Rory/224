Q. Could you wish for a better finish?
RORY McILROY: No, that was pretty nice.  I knew with the condition this morning, there was chances out there, obviously with the two par 5s and 17.  But obviously to take care of those and birdie a couple others, yeah, to finish 5-under for my last seven was a nice way to finish this morning.
Q. Were conditions very much conducive to that?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, very much so.  Especially with the greens being in the morning, they are just a bit better.  So if anything, it was nice to stop yesterday and get back again this morning.  The greens were pure and just gave myself chances.  Was able to convert a few.
Q. Having slept on that, what was the mind-set coming in?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, just to try to get closer to the lead.  I didn't really have a score in mind or anything.  I just wanted to go out there and play a good seven holes and hopefully get myself into contention for the last couple of rounds.  Sort of did that and maybe a little bit more and it's nice to go into the weekend in the lead.
Q. Playing 25 holes today, I guess will be good to see where the body is at after this today.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, feels good right now.  Probably got a bit of a break between now and going back out there.  So I'll probably get a little bit of physio treatment, make sure everything's okay and hit some balls and practise.  Look forward to getting out there again this afternoon.
