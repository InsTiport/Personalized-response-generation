 Q.  Again winning right here on this 16th green.  What has made the two of you such a good pairing?  
THOMAS PIETERS: We hit good shots together.  If I hit a bad one, he comes back and has a brilliant one after that.  It's been like that for the last two days and it's working nicely.   
 Q.  You know what other people are doing around you at all times.  Phil had beaten you three consecutive times in the Ryder Cup.  Was there a little bit more meaning to this one for you?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  When I saw the draw last night, I was like yes, I get to have ago at him again.  My record against him in the Ryder Cup isn't what I would like it to be.  So personally I may be wanted it a little bit more for that reason.   
But just to go out first, put a point on the board for Team Europe, that's what we wanted to do.  We wanted to start the session off in the right vein.  As Thomas said, we've got very similar games and I think that helps in foursomes as well.
