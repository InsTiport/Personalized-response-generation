 Q.   It's one thing to come into an event fresh but there's always the potential for the rust factor but four birdies in the first five holes, not an issue was is it?  
RORY McILROY:   No, it wasn't.   Probably should have been five in the first five, as well, to be honest.   It was a great way to start.   You never expect to start like that, but I've been hitting the ball well for the last couple of weeks that I've been practicing and it was just a matter of trying to take that good range play on to the course, and I was able to do that today, which I'm really happy about.  
   
 Q.   And that capacity to convert range play into competitive action, I mean, this is a happy knack that you've really developed this year, isn't it?   
RORY McILROY:   It is, yeah, it is.   I feel I've went through periods in my career where I feel like I've needed a couple of events to get back into it, and there's times where I've felt like the best thing for me is a couple weeks off before going into a tournament.   
Really just depends how you're feeling at the time.   As I said I felt really comfortable coming into this week after the long stretch off.   As I said yesterday, I probably feel fresher than quite a lot of guys, so hopefully that can be to my advantage over the next few days.  
   
 Q.   Is golf as easy as you're making it look?  
RORY McILROY:   No.   I've always said in golf when it's like this, you always wonder how have you ever played so badly.   Yeah, I'm very comfortable with my game at the minute, and as I said the other day, I'm on a really good path, and I know what I need to do to make my golf game work and that's what I'm working on at the minute.  
   
 Q.   And this course really does suit your eye.   Your scoring statistics around it are remarkable, aren't they?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I feel like it really suits my style of play.   I can be aggressive with the driver, and that can set me up to hit shorter irons into greens and obviously give myself a lot of birdie opportunities like I did today.   Didn't feel like I took as many of them as I could have but it still added up to 6‑under and I'm very happy with that.   
   
 Q.   The Tweet beforehand you were particularly excited about playing today, as well?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I haven't really‑‑ I played the two days at the PGA Grand Slam but I wouldn't really call that competitive.   
So the last shot that I hit was St. Andrews I guess, competitive shot.   So I was really looking forward to just getting out there and feeling what it was like again.   Yeah, I was excited.   
   
 Q.   Playing with Shane tomorrow, I'm sure you're looking forward to it?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, should be good. Shane has had a great last few months.   It's been really good to see because he struggled early on this year, and he's really found a good bit of form.   He's playing nicely and it should be an enjoyable round tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Have you had any stroke‑play rounds as pros?   
RORY McILROY:   I'm sure we've played somewhere.   I can't remember who I played with‑‑ I was going to say last week but I didn't play last week.   
   
 Q.   Take us through the first five holes.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I hit a driver and an 8‑iron on the first hole.   Hit it to 12 feet.   
Second hole, I hit a driver and a 3‑iron to about 30 feet behind the pin, 2‑putted.   
Even the third hole, I hit a 3‑wood and a 6‑iron to six feet and missed.   
Fourth hole, I hit a 3‑iron to four feet.   
5, I hit a 5‑wood and a lob‑wedge to four feet.   
   
 Q.   Great up‑and‑down on 12.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I've been over there before, so I knew that‑‑ I actually just wanted it‑‑ as soon as I saw it go left of the bunker, I thought that's better than being in the bunker.   
So I did get quite fortunate off the tee.   But it was a big par save.   It kept any sort of momentum that I had going, and not dropping a shot going into those last few holes was important.   
   
 Q.   Were you tempted to play any other shot than the flop shot?   
RORY McILROY:   No, because it was very‑‑ it's very grainy around here.   All the grass was into the grain so if you tried to bump it in, it would have stopped dead.   The only way was to go through the air.
