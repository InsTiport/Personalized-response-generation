Q. 74 but the finish --
RORY McILROY: Yeah, save on 17, as well, was good. Obviously just didn't quite have it today. I had a bit of -- there was a lot of -- obviously wind was up a little bit. There was a lot of into-off-the-right winds, and I was trying to hold them up and losing them left a little bit.
Just going to go do a little work on the range and try to figure that out. Sort of hung in there. The putts that went in yesterday sort of went over the edges today, and yeah, didn't actually know the rough was as bad as it was. I was hitting it in the fairway most of the week. Hit it in the rough today and was a bit more difficult.
Wasn't quite there. The wind was sort of tricky and the course played a little trickier, but obviously just didn't quite play as well as yesterday.
Q. Nature of the game, you shoot 64 one day --
RORY McILROY: Yeah, look, it's a very fickle game. I've always said that one day it can seem very easy and someone up there says, no, not so fast, and brings you back down to earth. That's golf. I battled through it. I'm still in with a shout to have a go at winning this tournament. Just need to stick the head down over the weekend and get in there and try to shoot a couple good scores.
