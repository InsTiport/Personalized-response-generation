Q. Rory, 1-under par today. If we can get you to assess your third round.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, started pretty similar to the first day, a little scrappy. I birdied the two par-5s and one other hole. I had a couple of loose iron shots on the 7th and the 8th, which cost me bogeys there. But yeah, I guess I didn't feel like I played very well today, but looking at the leaderboard, no one else really pulled away. I'm still going to be within striking distance going into tomorrow. If that's a bad day out of the way, then hopefully I can post a good one tomorrow.
Q. Speaking of that being within striking distance, how do you think not having fans here will affect sort of the atmosphere coming down the stretch?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's funny, like I feel for a Saturday afternoon being in contention on the PGA TOUR, it felt sort of weird out there. The first couple days it was fine, but definitely today it's feeling strange. I'm sure tomorrow will feel pretty strange, especially with so many guys in and around the lead.
Q. Just this golf course, how is it holding up and what can we expect from it tomorrow?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, so obviously they need to keep the greens really soft and water them a lot and keep them slow. It's so hot here, to prevent them from dying. I've struggled all week with the speed of the greens. I've been leaving a lot of putts short, and you'd think after three days you should adjust, but it's still tough to get yourself to hit them.
But the golf course is holding up well. It's not as if anyone is going super, super low. If I can sort of emulate what I did yesterday and post something in the low to mid 60s, hopefully I'll have a chance.
