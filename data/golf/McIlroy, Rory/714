 Q.   Chance to get back to your proper job today, how was it out there?  
RORY McILROY:   It was a bit of a struggle to be honest.   Hit some good shots, hit some not so good shots.   But yeah, as I've been saying all week, this is a work‑in‑progress and I'm working at it and I'm staying patient.   
But yeah, you know, I've got another three rounds here to try and work on it a bit more and shoot a few good scores and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   When things started going against you in the course today, did you think, oh, here we go again?  
RORY McILROY:   Not really.   I mean, I just had to try and play each hole as it came.   You know, just try to shoot the best score possible.   
It was nice to sneak in a couple birdies on the last three holes and make it look somewhat respectable, even though everyone seems to be going pretty low out there today.   It was a day where it was perfect scoring conditions, not much wind, and you could really shoot a good one.   
   
 Q.   You spoke yesterday about last week and the events that followed, being a pressure valve being released, did you feel more clear of head today?  
RORY McILROY:   Definitely, I wasn't putting as much pressure on myself and that's why I didn't get as frustrated.   If I had of played like that last week, I would have been not so happy but as I said, I understand that it's a work‑in‑progress and I'm working at it and it will come together pretty soon.   
   
 Q.   In a strange kind of way, did you enjoy yesterday as a sort of therapeutic exercise?   
RORY McILROY:   It's a lot more of a challenge to be honest.   But yeah it was fine.   Look, I just wanted to come and share my side of the story I guess and get it out of the way and concentrate on the golf.   
   
 Q.   One thing that stuck out for some is that you said that you don't want to change, you want to have an open and honest relationship with the media for the next 20 years or so; how important is that to you?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's very important.   I mean, I don't want‑‑ I don't want there to be any friction or any tension.   As I said every time I'm asked a question, I try to answer as honestly and as openly as possible, and I'll do the same thing.
