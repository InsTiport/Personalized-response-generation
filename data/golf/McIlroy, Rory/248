 Q.  How was it today?  
RORY McILROY: It was okay.  It was a little bit of a struggle.  I think we got the better of the conditions.  We can't have to contend with the rain like the guys did in the morning, but the wind got up in the morning, which made it a bit trickier.   
Yeah, there was chances out there.  I just didn't get off to a great start.  I played okay on the way in, but I obviously need to go a bit lower on the weekend to have a chance.   
 Q.  What do you reckon is going to make the difference to go low tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY: Just a few putts to drop.  Can't really -- I feel like I'm hitting decent putts.  I'm not reading them right, at all.  I hit a couple of weak ones out there, as well.  Keep giving myself chances, and hopefully a few putts drop.
