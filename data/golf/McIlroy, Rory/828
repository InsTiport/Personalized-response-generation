Q.   Tell us about the match from your point of view. 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, it was a decent match.   We both didn't have our best stuff with us.   I needed to grind out a few pars, and I won a few holes with pars, which was ‑‑ I was pretty fortunate to get up‑and‑downs on 15 and 16 to close the game out.   I'm just happy to be through to the third round.

Q.   Great short game shots on 14, 15, and 16.   Which was the best of those? 
RORY MCILROY:   The one on 15.   I enjoyed it.   The slope was sort of right to left.   I put a little bit of cut spin on it to hold it against the slope, and I was just ‑‑ the way I visualized the shot was exactly the way it went.

Q.   You could get a World No. 1 if you win this thing. 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah.   Everyone keeps telling me, so it's hard to put it out of my mind.   It's a little bit of extra motivation this week knowing that if I can get through four more matches, I could go to the top of the World Rankings which is obviously a huge moment for my career.

Q.   With your game in the shape that it is, do you feel like there's a good weekend coming up for you or are you going to go do some work? 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I'm going to go do some work this afternoon, but if I can just improve day by day ‑‑ I felt like I was a little better than I was yesterday.   If I go to the range and do a little bit of work and come out tomorrow and I'm a little bit better, I just want to try to keep progressing as the week goes on.   Hopefully by the weekend I can play some really good golf. 

Q.   A lot of players seem very confused with the greens.   You seem confident.   You had a few slip‑ups.   How would you explain your confidence right now with these greens?
RORY MCILROY:   The greens are okay.   I mean, to be honest, I feel pretty comfortable reading them.   I don't feel like ‑‑ I mean, it's very obvious, the greens.   It's not like some of the greens you get where it's very subtle.   It's very obvious.   The green just basically goes with the slopes, so if you have a right‑to‑left putt and it's a little bit dark from one side, you just give it a little bit more.   I feel like I've read the greens okay this week so far.

Q.   How confident are you right now?
RORY MCILROY:   I'm pretty confident.   I mean, I'm confident that I can hang in there.   I hit a few loose shots, but, you know, to play the way I have the first two days and get through two matches is ‑‑ it gives me a little bit of confidence.   I still need to go to the range and do some work, but I'm just happy to be through to the third round. 
He definitely didn't have his best stuff with him today.   And to be honest, neither did I.   I was able to come through and I played some good shots.   I chipped in on 14, which was pretty fortunate.   And then two great up‑and‑downs on 15 and 16 to close the game with.   So even though I haven't played my best, I'm through to the third round so I'm happy with that. 

Q.   That's the essence of this tournament, though, isn't it?   It's about just dogging out the results? 
RORY MCILROY:   It is, yeah, exactly.   If I can just keep improving day by day, I'll be happy.   To play like this and get through‑‑ I could have easily came up against Anders today and he could have shot 5‑ or 6‑under and I would have went home.   I was able to hang in there and make enough pars and make a few birdies, and at the end of the day that was enough.

Q.   Are there specific areas that you need to work on for the rest of the tournament or is ‑‑
RORY MCILROY:   To be honest, I missed a few iron shots left, so I'm going to go work on the range a little bit to just try and straighten that out.   I feel like I'm driving the ball very well.   That's a good thing around here.   I'm driving the ball long, and for the most part I'm finding the fairways.   The fairways are pretty generous, but still if you can do that you know you can set yourself up for a few opportunities for birdies and wins, of course. 

Q.   When you make it to the Friday of an event like this, does that really start to get the juices flowing?   It's almost like you've gotten over the hurdle of the prospect of an early finish? 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, definitely.   I sort of ‑‑ I set myself a goal this week just to try and make the weekend for a start.   And then see what we can do from there.   I have still got one match to go until I get to the weekend and hopefully I'm able to get through that tomorrow.
