RORY McILROY: It was a step in the right direction, I guess.  Looking at what happened the last few weeks, which is obviously a lot better.  But as soon as I started off and I saw what Haotong finished at, that was my -- I wanted to get level with him or at least level with him if not beat him, get in the clubhouse at 6- or 7-under, I didn't quite get there.  And it looks like it might have a chance, depending on what these guys do coming in.   
It's tough out there, it really is.  It's tough coming in.  The conditions sort of worsened as the day went on, and that's why you're seeing some of the guys struggle out there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I got within four at one point.  Playing 14, playing 13, 14.  So I felt with the two par-5s coming up, I thought I had a chance to post a number, and at least scare them a little bit.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean the PGA is only three weeks away.  So I'm happy that's coming quite quickly on the back of this.  The game is in much better shape than it was heading into this week.  So I'm happy with that.  I have to take -- it's hard whenever you feel like you've had a chance to win a major and you're not quite there, so it's disappointing.  But at the same time I have to take the positives.  And I'm looking forward to the next few weeks.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I wish I could have had that start back, obviously.  But these things happen and I'm just proud of how I held it together and battled.  But I feel like with the way my game is I'll definitely have a great chance at Akron and the PGA.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it does.  Look, I'm excited for the next two weeks.  I haven't played at Firestone for a couple of years.  The last time I played there I won.  And I've had some good finishes.  Quail Hollow, I've played well there.  Shot a couple of course records, a couple of wins.  Got beaten in a playoff, as well.  Another couple of top 10s thrown in there.  So I play well at Quail Hollow.  I love the golf course.  I know they've made a few changes, but I'll have some really good vibes going into that week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, of course.  Geez, one year, one major feels like too long.  But these things happen.  You look at Jack Nicklaus, he went through a stretch where he didn't win a major in three years.  I'm not comparing myself to Jack.  It's hard to win them.  It's very hard.  It's the reason especially in this generation, excluding Tiger, no one's got above five.  So it's tough to win them.   
We have 20- or 30-year window of where we can.  And I got off to a great start in my career.  But, as I said, I've still got 15, 20 more years to add to that tally.  But, yeah, look, I feel like three years has been too long.  But at the same time I'm not going to rush it, I'm not going to stay impatient.  I'm going to play my game.  And hopefully my chance arrives at some point and I'm able to take it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think iron play let me down a little bit this week.  That's it.  If I hit more greens, I give myself more chances I'll shoot better scores.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I think I held some really nice putts over the course of the four days.  And my short game is really good when I needed it to be.  My ball-striking got a bit better as the week went on.  So, yeah, it's definitely reinforcement that I'm working on the right things.  And I saw a lot of improvement as the week went on, and hit some good shots out there.  Yeah, it's getting there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's tough.  It's tough -- yeah, whenever you've got a three-shot lead and you lose it within the space of a few holes you start to -- everything just becomes a little bit faster and you have to slow yourself down.  Yeah, going out with a three-shot lead in a major isn't really that much.  Especially on this golf course where things can happen.  Things can happen very quickly.  But he just birdied 14 there to get back tied for the lead.   
He's a fighter, he's shown that the whole way through his short career.  He can dig himself out of these holes.  And I think it will be fun to watch coming in.  But it would be great for the game if he does it.  He's an absolute star and it would be great to see him win another one.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it is.  It's a lost opportunity.  I said that yesterday.  I felt like I had a chance to get in a few shots better than I did.  And I didn't.  And that would have put me a bit closer to the lead going out today and maybe it would have -- maybe I would have been able to put a bit of pressure on the guys in front of me.  But that's the way it goes.  And just got to wait a couple weeks and try again at Quail Hollow.
