 Q. Maybe just look back on your week, how things went. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it went well. I'm probably going to finish in the Top 15. I'm pretty disappointed the way I finished. I got myself into a great position this afternoon and just let it slip. 
 Yeah, I mean, I played -- I feel as if I didn't play -- I played a lot better last week at the Match Play last week than I did this week but I'll still finish Top 15. It's been a solid week. I was hoping for a little better, but I still have a big event next week to try and do well there. 

 Q. Talk about what a whirlwind last few months it's for you since winning in Dubai. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's been huge. I knew my game was there. Just a matter of time before my game broke through and obviously I did it there. Ever since then, I've played really well. 
 As I said, I didn't feel as if I played that well this week, but I was still able to get around and still able to post a respectable finish. I'm pretty pleased with that, and I'm hoping to do a little better next week.

 Q. Doral just a few days away, Top-70 in the world and Tiger Woods is going to be there; talk about your anticipation to play Doral. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I can't wait. I've played a lot of junior golf at Doral, so it will be nice to get back. It will be nice to get back to a place that I'm familiar with. 
 As I said, if I can just keep playing the way I have been, maybe just try and give myself a few more opportunities and try and limit my bogeys, I'll hopefully have another good one next week.

 Q. Tiger Woods tried to bomb it off the tee at 16; will you try to do that if the wind is favorable? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm quite an aggressive player, tried to go for the pin at 18 and didn't quite come off. If the wind is there and if I feel as if I can get it on to the green, I'll go for it.
