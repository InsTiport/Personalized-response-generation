Q. Thoughts on the day?
RORY McILROY: It was nice to get to minus four.  But you can see some of the guys scores out there today, it was there.  The wind wasn't as up as it was yesterday afternoon, and the greens were rolling a little better for us.
You know, if there was any day or any time to make a good score today, that was it.  Looked like I was heading towards that.  Gave a couple back on the way in.
Anything in the 60s around this golf course is going to be okay.
Q. Is this a little symbolic of your season, sort of two steps forward, one step back kind of thing?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit.  It's been a little bit like that.  A little bit stop/start.  Just when I feel like I'm getting momentum, I sort of get stopped in any practices a little bit.  It's getting there.  I'm staying patient and I'm working hard.  I'm trying to take a long-term view on things, especially with what I'm trying to do on the greens.
It's all a process and as long as I keep seeing tiny little improvements here and there each week, I'll be happy.
Q. How is the course?
RORY McILROY: It can get tougher.  It's still soft.  With the humidity -- there's no real root system under the greens, so even if they do get firm, it's sort of sandy underneath.  So the ball is not really going to run on like it normally would.  So you've got to hit fairways.  The fairways could firm up a little bit, which could make some of the doglegs tricky.  It's pretty tough at the minute.  I mean, it could get a little bit tougher but with this wind, it's playing tough enough.
Q. What happened on the bunker shot on 16 there?
RORY McILROY: I was plugged in the lip.  So it was just one of those things, just blasted out.  You don't really practice those shots very often, so I had no idea how hard I had to hit it.  I just tried to hit it as hard as I could.  I actually felt like it came out okay.  Did well to get it to 12 or 15 feet there, whatever it was, and just didn't hit a great putt.
