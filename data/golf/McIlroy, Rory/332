 Q.  What was the thought process heading into 18 and were you aware of (no microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I thought I needed to make 4, so that's what I was trying to do.   
 Q.  Talk about the lie in the bunker and what happened there on 18.  
RORY McILROY: I wasn't in the bunker.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: It was a tough lie.  It was a tough lie.  I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.   
 Q.  A lot of after hours work on the putting green yesterday.  Did you see any progress?  
RORY McILROY: Not really.   
 Q.  How would you sum up this year?  
RORY McILROY: Disappointing.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: No, I mean, I'm trying to concentrate on myself.  I knew Jason was having a good round and putting well and hitting good shots.  I was trying to focus on myself and focus on hitting good putts and obviously give myself plenty of chances.  Tee to green was good, but it was just pathetic when I got onto the green.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, I thought when I birdied 4, at least got my first birdie of the week and kept going from there.  Played well, fairways, greens, made another one on 6.  But I just, yeah, just need to do a lot of work.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: I was planning on taking two weeks off and then practicing the week before Barclays.  But I'll still take two weeks off from tournaments, but I'll have to see what practice schedule looks like.  I need to go something.  Tee to green is good, I just need to figure out what to do on the greens.  I need to have a long hard think about that.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
RORY McILROY: Putting.  Putting let me down at Merion.  Let me down at Merion.  I think I missed the cut there, too, didn't I?  Oakmont, and then putting let me down here again.  My tee to green game, there's not much wrong with that.  It's pretty solid.  Driving the ball well, hitting good iron shots.  I think if you had to given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.  It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.   
 Q.  Does that make it more frustrating, giving yourself those chances and not being able to finish it out?  
RORY McILROY: I've hit the ball really well this week and I'm walking away not playing the weekend.  It's really disheartening.  As I said, I need to go back to the drawing board and see where we go from here.
