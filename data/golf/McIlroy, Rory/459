Q.   Rory, how would you describe that, the toe‑to‑toe battle you faced?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was good.   It was back and forth.   I thought the match was pretty good.   I made a couple key up‑and‑downs when I needed to coming down the stretch.   And had a couple of opportunities to close it out, one at 18 and one there, couldn't quite convert.   And it was getting pretty dark. 
So come back in the morning and try again. 

Q.   Really getting difficult to see out here.   No question that was the right decision, Rory?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was.   Even playing this hole was a little questionable.   And I think we were both struggling to read our putts there.   We wanted to try and get finished, but we'll come back tomorrow morning and do it all over again.
