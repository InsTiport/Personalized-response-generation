 Q. Rory, 71 yesterday, 67 today, what was the difference in your play?
 RORY McILROY: I think from tee-to-green it was very similar. The funny thing is I probably hit it better yesterday. Even though I gave myself plenty of chances today and was able to just roll a few more putts which is probably the difference.

 Q. Last year you came here and contended and did very well but still sometimes you struggled to read the grain on the greens. How is it this time?
 RORY McILROY: I think it's the colour of the greens that really gets me, because they are a light sort of -- they are not as green as other greens that we play. So I find it very difficult just to see the subtle differences in the greens. So I get JP in to read a few for me.

 Q. Last year you were making some changes to your swing. Is that process complete now?
 RORY McILROY: It's getting there. I'm very happy with the progress I've made over the last two weeks. I feel as if I'm hitting it a lot better and I'm actually hitting it a lot better than I was at the end of the year when I was contending in some of the tournaments. That's a big positive for me and trying to go into the season with a few swing thoughts and working hard at it, should be a good one.
