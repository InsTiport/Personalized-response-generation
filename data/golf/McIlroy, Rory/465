Q.   (No Microphone.)
RORY MCILROY:   I wish I would have finished off a little bit better.   But, yeah, happy with how I played over the last couple of days.   Even the last 45 holes I think I was 15‑under par for those. 
So, happy with how I finished, just obviously left myself with a bit too much to do after 27 holes of this tournament and that's what really cost me. 

Q.   I know you said early on that you try to treat it like a normal tournament and not think about everything that went with it, but did you feel like you maybe pressed at all early on in terms of your approach or anything like that?
RORY MCILROY:   No, not at all.   I prepared really, really well for this tournament.   I came in feeling good and, no, I felt like I played okay on Thursday.   I got it in in red numbers.   Just the start on Friday was really what killed me. 
But as you've seen over the last 45 holes, again, there I'm playing very nicely.   It's just a matter of putting it all together. 

Q.   Was it a technical difference over the last two and a half days or more mental?
RORY MCILROY:   No, when I missed it, I didn't miss it that much but when I missed it I missed it in the right spots and I was just a little more efficient and got it up‑and‑down, I holed out a bit better yesterday and today.   So all those little things sort of add up and especially when margin of error is so small here.
