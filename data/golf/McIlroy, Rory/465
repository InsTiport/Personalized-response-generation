 Q.   Rory, that didn't last too long, less than 15 minutes, good to be on to the semifinals?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it is.   I really just wanted to try and get it done as early as possible.   
I had two great shots in here to the first.   Actually thought the second shot was going to end up better than it did.   But thankfully twoâ€‘putted from the front of the green.   
And Paul had a great second shot.   Got a little unlucky just to go over the back of the green.   
I knew long wasn't a good miss.   I tried to err on the short side.   As I said, thankfully two putts and on to the semifinal.
