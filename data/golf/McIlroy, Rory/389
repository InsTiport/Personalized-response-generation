 Q.  Thought on the week?  
RORY McILROY: Tee-to-green it felt pretty good.  One of those days, I couldn't really get anything going after the good start.   
 Q.  One of those courses that you probably need to play a couple times?  A lot of nuances to it.  
RORY McILROY: Even you look at, I was 12-under after the first hole today, played a solid round of golf after that and you have a great chance.  I let a few shots slip away.   
The 3-putt on 4, put it in the bunker on 6 and really couldn't get it up-and-down there.  3-putt on 7, just mistakes like that you shouldn't make.  They are the mistakes I made and that's what cost me today.   
I felt like I played three solid rounds of golf and didn't make many mistakes.  I was very solid in that department.  Today I just, yeah, I just couldn't really get anything going.   
 Q.  Besides the unusual traffic a few days out here, how would you describe your weekend?  
RORY McILROY: It's been fantastic.  I really enjoyed it.  This is definitely going to be a regular for me on the schedule going forward.  I really enjoyed it so much.  The golf course is great, but the area, staying in Santa Monica and having the beach there, there's so many great things to do.  Glad I played this year and I'll definitely be back.   
 Q.  You called this your first event in the run to the Masters.  If this is the first event, do you like that first step you've taken?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, as you said, there's encouraging signs, but I turned a chance to win into a Top-20 at the end of the day, so that wasn't too good.  Yeah, I'll have a nice day off tomorrow, regroup and get ready for next week and hopefully put myself in contention again.   
 Q.  Has Riviera lived up to your expectations?  
RORY McILROY: Most certainly.
