Q.   66.   Congratulations, that was well played today, how would you assess your round?
RORY McILROY:   I played well.   Obviously very happy with how the weekend went, and even the last nine holes of Friday, which I needed to just get in for the weekend.
Happy with how I played, obviously going to take a lot of positives from it.   If someone had told me I'd finish 12â€‘under at the start of the week, I would have taken it and sat back and seen where I finished.
But a few guys have just played a bit better than that.   Jordan obviously started off fantastically well, and has just kept his foot down, and really impressive.

Q.   You know how hard this is, what Jordan is doing, how would you in general assess what he's done over the four days?
RORY McILROY:   It's awfully impressive.   I've been fortunate enough to be in a similar position, winning my first major, and having a nice comfortable walk up the 18th.   And it's impressive.   Here coming in, being the guy in form, as well, having won and a couple of seconds, played great at the end of last year, it's nice to get your major tally up and running at quite an early stage of your career.   Jordan is going to be 21.   And it's great to see.   Great for the game.   And I'm sure he'll win many more. 

Q.   Nice job today, 66, Rory McIlroy.
