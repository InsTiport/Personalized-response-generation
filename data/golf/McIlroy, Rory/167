Q. You battled through this morning.  How would you describe the round?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I mean it was sort of uneventful, apart from I had the chip-in on 14 after not a great iron shot.  But I birdied the two par-5s, which you should do here, and didn't make any other mistakes.  I sort of hung in there.  I only hit one green in the last six holes and played them in 2-under.  So I did what I needed to do.  I felt like the cut was going to be 1-under par, it ended up being even.  But it was nice to shoot 3-under this morning and get in at least a little closer.  I need to go out there this afternoon and post a low one and try to get myself in the tournament.
Q. Your game plan going into this morning with different conditions, knowing that all the rain that we received yesterday?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, still the same.  Even without the rain yesterday it was still so soft, so just be aggressive when you can.  The ball wasn't going quite as far this morning as it was yesterday afternoon, so you have to take that into account, but I think as the day goes on the balls start to go its number.  It was very heavy, the air's very heavy out there.  So just distance control and get a little more control on my short and mid irons and I'll be okay.
Q. Your mindset heading into round three this afternoon?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, as I said, if I can get my short and mid irons in a good place and just start seeing some putts drop, I feel like there's a really low one out there.
