Q. Not much else to be done but suspend?
RORY MCILROY:   There wasn t much else they could do to be honest. I have never seen anything like that at golf tournament. I ve seen snow on the course when I was a kid, but nothing like that on any of the Tours. It was crazy. But at least they have called it early enough to let everyone get out of here and get warm again. We just head off now and get ready to come back and have another go tomorrow.

Q. If it is going to happen, then this is the week because they have so much time to play with to catch up?
RORY MCILROY:   Exactly. The way this tournament works means we lose so many players every day that they will have loads of time to make it up. That depends on the weather of course but it looks like it is going to get a bit better from tomorrow so we will come back and have another go. I think they definitely made the right decision to call it for the day.
