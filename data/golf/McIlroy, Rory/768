Q.   How was it today?
RORY McILROY:   It was very tough.   You know, we've been practicing all week on this range, which the wind has been right‑to‑left, and then the first few holes were like that but then you turn through that stretch,6 through 13, and every hole, the wind is off the left.   It took a little bit of adjusting to; I missed a few balls right at the start but was able to get into it. 
When I turned for home, it was nice to make a couple birdies.

Q.   Given the conditions, pretty satisfied? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it wasn't too bad.   It could have been a couple shots better, of course, but I limited the damage as much as I could, and I'm in a good position going into the weekend so I I can't really ask for much more. 
15 was a downwind put but I needed to get it up over the hill and once it got over the hill it would have just fed down towards the hole but I was getting bustled a little bit with the wind and misjudged the speed.   It was unfortunate to give that shot straight back after birdieing 14 but it was good that I was able to get it back again on the par5 at the next. 

Q.   Do you keep playing like you're playing or do you go more aggressive?
RORY McILROY:   You can't get aggressive with this weather.   You don't even care where the pin is, you just try to hit it on the green somewhere.   I'll just keep playing how I am and see how this thing unfolds.   I don't know if the wind will be quite the same tomorrow but if it is, it's going to be another tough day and another long grind. 

Q.   Inaudible?
RORY McILROY:   It all depends how confident you are in your game and how confident you are seeing shots.   At the minute, you know, I'm pretty comfortable in the wind.   It's still tough to play in and I think everyone finds it tough to play in, but you've just got to deal with it the best you can. 
And you know, try and be prepared for it as much as you can; I think that's one of the most important things is mentally prepare yourself that you are going to have to‑‑ if the wind is off the left, you're going to feel like you're having to hook it in just to hit it straight.   That's something I struggled with the first few holes was actually trusting how hard the wind was.   Once I got into that, I started hitting some better shots. 

Q.   How do you feel about your position?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I feel good.   At the minute, only three behind.   So anything can happen over 36 holes, especially in weather like this, so I'm pleased going into the weekend. 
I said at the start of the week that I wanted to just give myself a chance going into Sunday and if I have a solid one tomorrow, I'll hopefully be able to do that.   You know, who knows, anything can happen.   Happy going into the weekend.
