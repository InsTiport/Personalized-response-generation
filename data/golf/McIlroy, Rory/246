Q. 2-under today, you're plus one going into the weekend.  Your thoughts on how it went out there, because you had some pretty good looks on the finishing nine that just wouldn't fall?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I did.  I actually had some good looks and I actually felt like I hit some good putts, as well.  Especially that one, the one on the par 5, I felt like I hit a good putt.  It just went a little further left than I thought it would, and then the one on the par 3, I didn't see it going right at all.  I sort of played it straight and it just missed on the right edge.
They were two decent putts that could have fallen on another day.  I feel I need to hit more fairways.  That's been the big thing.  The rough is so thick here, if you're not playing from the fairway, it's very hard to give yourself birdie opportunities.  I hit some fairways today; I drove it a little bit better, but I need to drive it even better over the weekend to be able to shoot a couple of good scores.
Q. Scrambled well, six of six, so the short game is pretty good.  Just have to get the putts to fall.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, short game's good.  Yeah, I did scramble well.  I just need to keep giving myself chances.  If I keep giving myself chances, hopefully they will fall and I can shoot a couple of good ones.
Q. They didn't pull away on the leaderboard.  6-under is still the lead.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, 6-under, I guess before going out there, I was surprised that 6-under was still leading.  But after playing the golf course and seeing how it's firmed up overnight, I can see why 6-under is the leading score.
Yeah, again, go out there tomorrow morning and hopefully post a good score and move up the leaderboard.
