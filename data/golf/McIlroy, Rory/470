Q.   I know the first 11 holes you were over par.   Got things going in the last seven.   Talk about being patient. 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I just kept telling myself to be patient out there today.   It was a tricky day.   The wind was swirling a little bit.   Pin positions were tough.   Anything under par I felt was a pretty good score. 
It was nice to pick up a couple birdies on the back nine, on the parâ€‘5s there.   Pretty satisfied with today's work.

Q.   Was that one of those rounds here which might have been one of those 77s, but maturity here now has given you the ability to get it around in 71? 
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, I think so.   It could have been a round that got away from me. 
I made bogey on 11 and I just, again, I just stayed patient, realizing that it's a 72 hole golf tournament and not having to press too much.   That's what I did. 
It was good to get into red numbers after day one and I feel with the way I'm driving the ball, if I can keep doing that and just be a little more patient with my iron play and give myself more opportunities, I'll hope to be right there at the end of the week. 

Q.   What were your personal expectations coming into this tournament and how it's gone in that respect, from within. 
RORY MCILROY:   I haven't put too much pressure on myself.   Look, I obviously know what I can achieve this week, but I'm not letting myself think about it too much.   Just trying to play it one round at a time.
Today was a pretty good day.   I feel like I can do better.   But happy after day one and go out and just try and do a little bit better tomorrow.
