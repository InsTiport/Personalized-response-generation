Q.   Can you explain or describe your disappointment for not being here the weekend? 
RORY McILROY:   It's disappointing.   I was just disappointed with how I played yesterday more.   I actually feel like I played okay today, a little bit better.   Didn't really‑‑ when I missed a green, I didn't really get up‑and‑down and I didn't hole many putts. 
But I thought ball‑striking‑wise was definitely a little bit better today.   But yeah, it's not nice to, I'll probably be still be here the weekend and practice.   But not nice to not be out there competing and obviously trying to win a tournament at the weekend.

Q.   You said yesterday on the range that you were hitting the ball quite well but not being able to take it to the course; is that a trust issue? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I think it's more of a trust issue.   I guess as well on the range, you get more than one chance on the golf course.   You've got one chance to hit a shot and you've got to make the most of it.   There's definitely a few good signs out there today so a good bit of work over the next couple of weeks and get ready for The Open.
As I say, I just need to work on my game and try to keep doing the right things and put the work in and if I can do that, you know, it should turn around at some point, whether that's in a couple of weeks or a little bit further down the line. 

Q.   An improvement on yesterday but unfortunately not enough?
RORY McILROY:   No, not enough.   But you know, I played better today, so I can't be too disappointed.   I'm disappointed I'm not here for the weekend, but played better today.   Guess my attitude was a bit better out there, and I was trying to get there for the weekend.   I played a three‑hole stretch on the back nine not very well on 14, 15, 16.   I guess that sort of cost me a little bit.   But you know, I saw a lot of better shots out there today, so it was definitely an improvement on yesterday. 

Q.   Have you been surprised as to just how difficult a test this course has provided, because yourself, not here for the weekend and a lot of other big names not here for the weekend. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I think we didn't get the great end of the draw, either.   I think the conditions were definitely a little tougher on our side, and I think that makes Shane's and Thomas's effort to be up there in contention going into the weekend even better.
It's a tough course.   Conditions weren't easy today.   It was windy.   Yeah, even though the rough's been cut back, it's still a tough test. 

Q.   And from what you've seen playing alongside Shane the last two days, do you think he's in a very strong position for winning this? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, for sure.   He didn't play quite as well as he did yesterday, but he scored very well and birdied the last two holes to tidy up his scorecard a little bit.   Yeah, I definitely think he's got a great chance.   He played well in the tougher conditions in the two days and only two behind going into the weekend, he's got a great chance. 

Q.   Talk about what seemed to be another disappointing day for you?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it obviously wasn't the two days that I was hoping for, but today was a lot better than yesterday, so I guess that was a good thing.   But still a few too many loose shots out there. 
I guess if I had of been a little sharper around the greens, it would have been a better score and I probably would have been here for the weekend, but I just took too many putts and didn't get it up‑and‑down and that's when I missed greens and that was the real difference.   But I thought off the tee was much better, and my ball striking in general was a big improvement today compared to yesterday. 

Q.   Are you getting any closer to working out exactly what is off? 
RORY McILROY:   I think so, yeah.   I just need to put in the hard work and put in the hours now and try to get ready for The Open Championship in a couple weeks' time.   Yeah, hopefully two weeks is a lot of time to try and get something right and to work on stuff, so hopefully I'll be ready for Muirfield.

Q.   How do you sum up your disappointment, all of the major winners not being here for the weekend? 
RORY McILROY:   It's not great for the tournament, but we have Shane up there at least.   I've played alongside Shane the last couple of days and he's played really well, so I think he's got a great chance going into the weekend, only a couple back and played in the tougher conditions, as well.   Disappointing for myself, Graeme, Darren, PÃ¡draig, Paul McGinley, as well who had a good score yesterday.   It's not great, but it's just the way it is and it's golf.   You have good weeks and you have bad weeks.

Q.   Is it the pressure and expectation are performing? 
RORY McILROY:   I don't think so.   I don't think those guys really let it affect them too much.   That definitely wasn't the case for me this week.   I just didn't play my best, especially yesterday. 
Yesterday was disappointing because I felt like it could have been much better.   Today I saw the positive side, so I'm not too disappointed about today, but yeah, if I had of shot a better score yesterday or just a little sharper around the greens today, it would be a different story. 

Q.   Do you think you can get back to the winner's circle this season?
RORY McILROY:   I think so, I hope so.   I still have a lot of big tournaments, two Majors and still a lot of golf to play this year, and just going to try and work as hard as I possibly can to get back to the golf that I know that I'm capable of playing.
