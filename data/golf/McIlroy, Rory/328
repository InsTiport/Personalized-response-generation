 Q.  After you guys had kind of the harder of the draw yesterday with the wind in the afternoon, how important was it for to you come out and attack this morning?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was.  It was important.  As you said, yesterday's conditions were a little dicey with the wind and then the way the greens were.  So I think you had to make the most of good greens and obviously not a lot of wind this morning.  Felt like I did that pretty well for the first 14 holes.  Let a couple slip on the way in.  But overall, pretty happy with how I played.   
 Q.  You haven't wanted to make too many adjustments with the clubs in your bag yet with Nike, but you do have a new putter this week.  So how is it treating you this morning?  
RORY McILROY: Better.  It felt better than it did yesterday.  You have to hole a few to get under par on this golf course, and I held a couple.  I actually held a couple of good ones for par on the back nine to keep the momentum going.   
It's a work-in-progress but it's getting better.  As long as I keep seeing improvements, I'll be happy.   
 Q.  Two-shot swing from Thursday to Friday.  What changed from the first round to the second?  
RORY McILROY: I think I just held a couple more putts today really.  But I took advantage of the conditions and the better greens this morning.  Birdied all the par 5s.  Converted another one with a good iron shot.  A little disappointed to give a couple back on the way in but it's a tough golf course, and it's sort of inevitable, you're going to drop shots here and there.   
2-under par is good.  As I said, I felt it could have been a bit better but moving in the right direction.   
 Q.  When you had it to 4-under par, what happened coming in?  
RORY McILROY: I just missed a couple fairways.  I missed the fairway on 15.  I hit a really good recovery shot to get on the front of the green, like a 60-footer up the hill and left it ten feet short and didn't hole that.   
The same, missed it left on 16.  Plugged it in the face of the bunker.  Actually hit a good bunker shot and had a chance for par there.  Didn't hit a great putt.  So tried to get one back on 17 and 18, but didn't quite; wasn't able to do that.   
2-under is still a decent score.  I don't think I'll be too far away going into the weekend, as long as the guys don't go nuts this afternoon.  I'm excited about going into the weekend and trying to shoot a good one tomorrow to get into contention on Sunday.
