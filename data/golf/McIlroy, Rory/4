Q. Another close call in Abu Dhabi, clearly not the day you were hoping for.  Just give us your thoughts on it?
RORY McILROY:   No.  Started well.  Started great with two birdies in the first three.  And then I felt like there was a few putts I hit today, the wind affected the putts more than maybe the last couple days.
So the one on 4, the three-putt, and there was a couple others, the couple bogeys around the turn didn't help.  I thought I was in good position on 10 and Tyrrell was outside of me, makes that putt for birdie, and then I can't make mine for eagle and that was a huge sort of momentum-keeper for him.
Then I bogeyed the next and after that, it was sort of hard to get back into it.  I don't feel like I played great this week.  Felt like I was managing my game a bit.  Nice to get a competitive week under my belt and see where my game is and what I need to do to keep on improving.  Hopefully I'll get on the plane tonight and head over to Torrey Pines and tee it up there next week.
Q. Leading into the final round, what were the main positives you'll take away?
RORY McILROY:   I thought for the most part of the week, my short game and my putting was good.  I scrambled well.  Had some pretty good approach shots, especially last night coming down the last few holes.  I thought there was parts of rounds where I got the driver going, even the last few holes this evening there I got the driver going a little bit.
But still, sometimes I'll have a few holes where it's like that and there's a few holes where it sort of gets away from me.  So a little more consistency and being able to replicate the good ones hole after hole and then day after day until you sort of put four rounds together.
