Q. How would you assess the week?RORY MCILROY: It was okay.  I feel like I've played pretty well.  I've given a lot of shots back over the past few days.  I've given five shots away, on the 12th hole, for one. So, it hasn't been what I wanted.  But, I'm playing solidly and hopefully, I can just put everything together next week.Q. Is it fatigue at all?RORY MCILROY: I don't know if it's fatigue, because I don't know if I've lost concentration out there at all.  It's not that.  I've just given a few shots away. Hopefully, I can just keep it together a little bit more next week in Atlanta.Q. Have you ever known anything as bizarre as that?RORY MCILROY: Two four putts on the same green?  It's not my worst, I have five putted before.  But, it's one of those things that at least I can laugh about it and move on.Q. When was that?RORY MCILROY: Oh, it was way back.Q. Was yesterday's one in your mind at all?RORY MCILROY: Over the second putt it was.  I wasn't -- it wasn't -- I said to myself, I said, like let's not give anymore shots away to this hole.  That was what I said. So, I maybe put a little bit too much pressure on myself to hole the second putt. On the third putt, I'm thinking, okay, you don't want to 4-putt again, and I actually held a decent length putt for a four putt, so. (Laughter.)Q. Talk about your time in Denver.RORY MCILROY: It's been really good.  The fans and the crowds have been amazing all week.  I'm going to go watch the Broncos tonight, win, hopefully. So, yeah, it's been a great time.  It's a beautiful area, and it's been a pleasure to play in front of so many people.Q. Is there no choice but to kind of poke fun at yourself when something like that happens?RORY MCILROY: Of course, I mean, geez.Q. Don't beat yourself up?RORY MCILROY: Exactly.  It short of shows everyone out there that we do the same things as they do every weekend.
