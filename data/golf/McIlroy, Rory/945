 Q. Ian, you told me this morning on the driving range that you were going to win a point, and I said, 'Are you that confident,' and you said, 'Oh, no, I'm going to win a point.' How does it feel to have done that? 
 IAN POULTER: This is a special day, for European golf, to putt on a display, in Wales, with this many fans, is just truly unbelievable.
 Seve is at home watching this, and he can't be with us right now, but every player out there today has watched what he is for European Tour golf, and this means everything to him, and we have played from the heart today. And do you know what, we brought this trophy back. This is a special day. 

 Q. Rory, you had had some bad, if you like, performances down the 18th, you hit a poor 3-wood and wedge, and the bunker shot that didn't come off; how do you feel about that up-and-down, because half point gave the momentum to go on. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, probably didn't realise it at the time, but it was huge. You know, was Poults said there, to win this, to regain The Ryder Cup and bring it back to European soil, to do it for European golf and for Seve and for everyone involved; it's been the best week of my life. 

 Q. A word for it Graeme McDowell, you need someone with huge pressurability, and he came up with it, didn't he. 
 IAN POULTER: Monty and the vice captains, they have been absolutely different class. To put G-Mac out last, there was some discussion about that. There was a reason why he was put there. U.S. Open Champion, he pulled it off. 

 Q. They say once you play one Ryder Cup, you never want to miss it, can you confirm that for me? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, two years' time, I do not want to be watching this on TV.
