  Q. Some birdies in there but one or two mistakes. How do you feel overall?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I feel as if I could definitely be two or three shots better, but I'm playing okay out there. I hit some really nice iron shots coming in and need to hit a few more fairways to give myself chances to go at some of these pins. I feel my game is in pretty good shape and will hopefully give it a good run over the weekend.  
  
  Q. Seems like you and Phil were getting on really well.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was good. It was a nice couple of rounds out there. I said this yesterday, but we enjoy each other's company. It helps whenever both guys are playing pretty good, as well. So yeah, I mean, I really enjoyed myself out there, and hopefully I can just feel that relaxed for the next two days, as well.  
  
  Q. He has his own way of playing. Does he hit some shots that you just go, wow?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, he did. Some of the shots that he can hit, but that's just years of experience. He's experienced it all, and he's hit it in a few places that others don't hit it. You know, he just knows how to get the ball around the golf course. It's very impressive to watch close up.  
  
  Q. You think there's a low one out there for you tomorrow?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I do. I gave myself a lot of good chances out there, and I gave myself five good chances coming in and hit really good putts. I could have birdied three or four of the last five and wound up playing them in just level par. If I keep giving myself these sorts of chances, I feel as if I can go pretty low out there.   
 I'd like to be a couple of shots closer to the lead, but saying that, I'm only four back, and if you can get off to a good start on this golf course you can get yourself into contention, so that's what I can do tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Do you sense the course is drying out a bit, the wind is blowing, the sun is coming out?  
 RORY McILROY: A little bit. It's still very soft out there. You're getting 4 and 5-irons to stop on the green, so hopefully there's a bit more wind and a bit more sunshine tomorrow and it can really dry the course out for Sunday, but it's still soft out there, and that's why the scores are still pretty good.  
  
  Q. Is it a learning experience to play with a guy like Phil?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, in a way, I suppose. I suppose just sort of handling the crowds and everything, and if he finishes out first, they're all trying to get to the next hole. Just learning to take my time and just sort of focus on my own game and not get carried away in it all.  
  
  Q. Have you heard about Lee? He pulled out with a leg injury. Your thoughts on that and how it might affect the Ryder Cup team?  
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, he's been struggling with it for a little bit. He was talking about taking six weeks off after the U.S. PGA anyway. I'm sure by the Ryder Cup he'll be fine. Yeah, it's a pity to see that he had to pull out this week.
