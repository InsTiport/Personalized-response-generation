RORY MCILROY: Yeah, so I thought if I could get to 4-over, I thought that was two 72s, I thought that would have a good chance.  Especially the forecast looks like the wind is going to die down.  I though we got it pretty windy this morning, and we got it pretty windy yesterday afternoon.
So I'd say that in terms of the scoring between the two sides of the draw, I'd say ours was maybe a shot tougher.  We'll see how that pans out at the end of the day.  I felt like if I could -- I wanted to shoot 3-under on the back nine.  That's what I needed to do.  And I said to Harry going up the 18th, Let's not shoot any worse than I shot yesterday.  So let's make 72 the worst score we're going to shoot.  And it was nice to go one better than that and shoot 1-over in the end.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, it was a little bit I put myself out of position off the tee.  And then probably I tried to take on too much for my second shot on 10.  And then that went left in the other rough and then didn't get -- hit the green with my third.  And, you know, it's hard to get it up-and-down on some of these lies around the green.
So, yeah, it's tough as well.  You go from the range and then you get in a car and you're not hitting another shot for another 25 minutes.  So feel like you could warm up again basically so that first tee shot is a little challenging for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
RORY MCILROY: Pride.  Just pride.  Just trying to play a good round of golf and try to get something that's close to the best out of myself.  And, yeah, I don't like missing cuts.  It's not something that I'm used to fortunately, and I wanted to be around for the weekend.  And at least if you're around for the weekend, you can go out there and maybe shoot a good one tomorrow and at least give yourself half a chance.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
RORY MCILROY: Oh, yeah, I was 4-over through 3 in Boston a couple years ago and ended up winning the tournament, and that just sort of came back into my mind after I made that start.  So in a way it's calming.  I've been in this position before and I've been able to come back.  Or you go back to Birkdale a couple years ago where I was 4-over through 5 or 5-over through 6 and shoot 71 and all of a sudden finish, you know, had half a chance on the back nine that day.
So it's not as if I haven't been in those positions before, it's just a matter of not pressing too much and staying patient and letting the good golf sort of come through.  Took a while today, but it eventually got here.
Q. (Indiscernible).
RORY MCILROY: 7-iron.
