Q. As you've played this golf course, it seems like the front nine, you've got to kind of hang on but try to take advantage of the back nine?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, that's pretty much what it's like, especially today.  I hit a really good drive down 1 and still had a 4-iron in my hand for my second shot to that pin position to the right-hand side of the green.
Second hole, again, it's a 5-iron to that green.  It's a pretty tough start, 1 and 2.  If you get through those in even par.  And they moved the tee up on 3; it's a bit of a chance.  But yeah, front nine, definitely, if you get anything under par, you should be happy.
Yeah, you can take advantage of the back nine, some more gettable holes.
Q. You hit a lot of good shots, maybe some not so good. Still trying to find that timing?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I am.  It's very in and out.  There is some good in there but just a bit of inconsistency as you've seen out there.  There's some good stuff, some bad stuff, and just sort of trying to hang in there, battle away, and under par, 1-under, is a fair reflection of how I played today.
Q. You and Ian chatting a lot out there, you're good buddies, give him a little needle there on 18 with the drop?
RORY McILROY: A little bit.  I can't believe how much that ruling's happened this year.  I'm sure there's been at least half a dozen guys that have sort of got that lining thing in the bunker.
But it was more just the drop that he took because he dropped it on the flat and I thought for sure it was going to plug but it actually got out -- it was a good drop in the end.  He didn't quite take advantage of it but yeah, just give him a little bit about that.
