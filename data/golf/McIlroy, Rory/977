 Q. 10-under, but probably not quite enough do you think? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, the guys still have to play the last four holes here, so you never know what can happen, but yeah, I gave it a good go. I hit a good putt at the last, hit it exactly where I wanted to. It just never came down for me. 
 You know, 66 out there today was a pretty good score. I can definitely take a lot from this week. 

 Q. You're not kidding when you say the last four hole, we've just even Kenny Perry take 9 at the 18th and Derksen take 10 at the 15th. What is it like the last four holes for the leaders coming in? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, 16 isn't playing too bad because the pin is in the middle of the green. It's really 15 and 18 you've got to be careful of. You just have to put your ball in the fairway. And the pin positions are pretty tricky, but you know, pars on those holes are pretty good today.

 Q. You're not going to be leaving just yet though, are you?
 RORY McILROY: Not yet. I'll wait around and see what happens. Fingers crossed, someone might doing some, might be able to get into a playoff. I'll hang around and see what happens.

 Q. 17 and 18? 
 RORY McILROY: It was two good shots, really trying to make birdie at the last, so it was good. Good to hit two shots like that when you need to. 

 Q. And saying whatever happens here, good confidence builder? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I can take a lot from this. I'm hitting it great. Started to putt a bit better today. But you know, giving myself plenty of chances, and, you know, feeling pretty comfortable with where everything is at at the minute.

 Q. Feeling as good as you have been since you won last in America? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's feeling good. I feel as if I've done a good bit of work with Michael Bannon over the past couple of weeks and things are really starting to come around. I'm more comfortable hitting the ball both ways now and the ball flight is good. 
 Everything is -- if I can just keep this form going until St. Andrews, if I can go into St. Andrews with the way I've played this week, I should have a good chance. 

 Q. What are the keys there for you?
 RORY McILROY: St. Andrews? 

 Q. You've got great memories. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I've got great memories. I suppose keeping them out of the fairway traps is one thing. You've got to really -- and then from there, it's all about, St. Andrews, there's so many different levels of the greens and you've really got to put yourself -- I've never played the golf course in July when it's going to be probably a little firmer than what I've had it like in the past. You've really just got to put your ball in position. It's not the longest golf course in the world, but you've just got to know where the good angles are to come in to some of the pins and some of the greens.

 Q. Looking forward to it?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I can't wait. It's going to be great. 

 Q. When is the first time you played? 
 RORY McILROY: '06 in the St. Andrews Links Trophy.

 Q. What did you do there? 
 RORY McILROY: 69 I suppose.

 Q. One round? 
 RORY McILROY: Two 69s I think, yeah. I think. 

 Q. Finish? 
 RORY McILROY: I finished like eighth or something. Didn't play too good around the Jubilee Course.
