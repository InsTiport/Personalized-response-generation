Q.   Obviously not the way you wanted to end the tournament.   What were the conditions like and how difficult was it? 
RORY McILROY:   It was pretty difficult.   It felt like I was coming into it pretty well.   Tough conditions, blustery winds, obviously, it was very wet today.   I thought anything in the 60s was probably going to have a chance.   I made a couple of mistakes coming in.

Q.   I saw you on 10, you saved par.   12 was a tough one. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, 12 was the turning point.   Didn't play at all well there this week.   Some positives are I hit the ball very well from tee to green for the most part of the week, and looking forward to THE PLAYERS next week.

Q.   You probably feel good about your game right now? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, tee to green it was really good.   I got a good feeling.   I'm doing well and looking forward to doing well at Sawgrass next week.   Hopefully, I can take the good things from this week into that next week.
