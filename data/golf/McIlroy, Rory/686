  RORY McILROY:   Tee to green I thought I played really, really well.   I just didn't hole the putt.   So I've got a week off now, and I'll go and work on that and see if I can improve around the greens.   If I can do that and keep hitting the ball the same way, I think it's very, very close.  
   
 Q.   Is it fair to say your putter laid down this week, di you have to tweak it coming in?   Anymore changes or you just didn't hole them?   
RORY McILROY:   I just didn't hole them.   I struggled a little bit reading them, and I got a bit indecisive.   I holed some nice ones coming in today.   But, yeah, I guess over the course of the week, if you keep seeing putts miss, it's hard to visualize them going in the hole when you're reading them, and that was sort of the problem this week.  
   
 Q.   Did you figure anything out about this course this week?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I think my game plan worked pretty well.   I didn't play the par‑5s particularly well.   I played the 9th hole in 3‑over par.   You play that at level par and you're 10‑under for the tournament and you're short up there.   But I thought my strategy off the tee worked really well for the most part and that enabled me to to have more opportunities for birdies.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a simple type of strategy for the next Wentworth and Merion?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, and if it gets hot at Memorial, too, there are not many drivers there either.   So it's sort of a little stretch here where you're not going to be going all guns blazing off the tee.  
   
 Q.   Is it fair to say some of your best competitive rounds have been on Sundays this year?   
RORY McILROY:   I'm not sure.   I think it would be a good thing if I was closer to the lead going into Sundays, but I guess, yeah, it's nice to be able to save your best golf for the end of the week, and it would have been nice to go out there and get off to a better start.   That's what I needed today.   I wanted to try to get off to a fast start, and I wasn't really able to do that.  
   
 Q.   I know you said you love the course.   
RORY McILROY:   Sure, I love any course.   A golf course is a golf course, but there are still a few golf courses that I like more than this one.
