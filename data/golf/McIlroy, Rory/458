Q.   (Inaudible)?
RORY McILROY:   Or even faster.   Yeah, that's probably‑‑ I think I finished that round in two and a half hours.   I'll need to do something similar this afternoon to try and make it. 
But just happy to be into the quaterfinals.   Obviously this takes priority over everything else.   Going to go out there and give it my best this afternoon and try and play in a similar way as I did this morning. 
I'm feeling really good.   If I make it into the semifinals, I'm not too disheartened if I make the fight or not.   I'll be able to watch it on TV.

Q.   What was better about your game today?
RORY McILROY:   I putted a lot better.   I gave myself plenty of opportunities over the first few days and the same again today, but I just holed a few more putts.   That was really it. 
Didn't feel quite as comfortable off the tee as I did the first couple of days, but my iron play was good and scrambling and on the greens especially the past couple of days has been good.   So very happy with that.

Q.   You have a pretty aggressive mindset in stroke play.   How much of an advantage, if any, does that give you in match play that you like to be aggressive anyway?   It seems like this format accentuates that mindset?
RORY McILROY:   I really don't feel like I have to make any adjustments coming from stroke play to match play.   There is that.   Maybe some other guys might feel that they need to play a little bit more aggressively if they are conservative type of players and use a lot of course management.   That's not my game.   I'm aggressive, I try to get the ball down there as far as I can and give myself relatively short shots into greens.   I've done that again this week.   Continue to play that way because it's the only way I really know how to play.

Q.   Can you follow what else is going on out here while you are playing?   Can you be a fan of this? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, of course.   You are always keeping an eye of what's going on.   There's a couple of good match‑ups this morning with some of the European guys.   I was keeping an eye on those. 
You've got quite a bit time walking from one shot to the next.   You are looking at leaderboards and you are seeing what everyone else is doing.   Obviously you are looking at who you can possibly play in the next round, as well.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
RORY McILROY:   I've always said even from five years ago I would have paid anything to make it to that fight.   It's good.   My best friend Harry is here.   He flew in yesterday, so he's going to be able to make it anyway.   It depends.   I could be sitting next to him or it could be somewhere else.

Q.   Did you take care of him? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah.   Our first Vegas fight, we went together.   We always said if Pacquiano and Mayweather, we would go.   It was little bit of a birthday present to myself as well.   My birthday is in a couple of days' time.

Q.   What makes it so much better to be there as opposed to watching it on the big screen?
RORY McILROY:   Just the atmosphere. 

Q.   Can you describe it for us?
RORY McILROY:   It's like something I've never experienced because it's such an intimate venue, MGM only holds like 16,000 people.   Half of the crowd were Filipinos the other half were British.   It was very‑‑ it would have been great to go tonight, but as I said we'll see what happens this afternoon.
