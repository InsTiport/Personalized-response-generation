 Q.   Rory, what a tremendous performance.   It all began on Saturday late after the rain delay.   You birdie your last two holes and begin the final round with three straight birdies.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, that was a really important stretch of the golf tournament.   The final two coming in last night, and the way I started today, 4 under through the first five, I just started really, really well.   
Put some pressure on Sergio early.   I rode my luck a little bit on the back nine.   Sergio had some putts to get close to me.   I had a couple of tree limbs that went my way.   
But I played another really solid round of golf.   Obviously, really pleased to get my first World Golf Championship so soon after winning The Open.  
   
 Q.   You were just so impressive with your driver, averaging 333 yards per hit this week.   That set up everything in your game.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I've said it all week.   It's the foundation of my game when I drive it like that, I have a pretty good chance to win most weeks, and I've shown that the last couple of weeks.   
Hopefully, going into Valhalla in good form and try to get three in a row.  
   
 Q.   I'm looking forward to your action in Louisville.   Best of luck.   
RORY McILROY:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Going to Valhalla No.1 in the world, what does that mean?   
RORY McILROY:   It's awesome to go back.   It's felt like a long time since I lost that No.1 spot, but it feels good to be back on the top.   Hopefully, I can keep it for a while.
