 Q.   How does it feel going into the U.S. Open?  
RORY McILROY:   It feels okay, actually.   I found a couple of little things this weekend.   I hit the ball much better today.   I actually putted a little better, too.   It feels pretty good.   
A little bit of work next week.   Get to see Merion a couple of days, too, so that will be beneficial.   Yeah, it's not that far away.  
   
 Q.   Are you going in next week for a couple of days of practice?  
RORY McILROY:   Yes, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you know what days it will be?  
RORY McILROY:   I do, yeah (laughter).   I've got to go down to Oak Hill tomorrow because PGA media day is there, as well, so I get to see a couple of courses.   
   
 Q.   What adjustments did you make with your putting?  
RORY McILROY:   It was just a little bit of adjustment with green reading.   I felt everything I was reading, I was reading it too far right and pulling it.   So it's just a matter of‑‑ I guess it's like whatever I see on the left‑right putt, sort of double it.   Whatever I see on I left‑to‑right putt, it's not so much.  
It's just a little bit of an adjustment and something I can work on and something it was good to figure out this week, so I can work on it next week.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel in general after that first round?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I played really well on Friday and came back on Saturday morning.   
Yesterday was a tough day.   I think everyone struggled out there.   
And today it was out there.   Today I felt there was a low score out there.   It's receptive, it's not as windy.   I thought one of the guys from the pack might have shot like a 65 or 66 and put themselves up there.   As I said, it doesn't feel too far away.
