 Q.  Your thoughts on where you stand after 11 holes of this second round?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm in a good position.  It was hard waiting all day to go out there.  Got off to a really good start, 3-under through five, and then made my first bogey of the week on the eighth, which was a bad tee shot.  I nearly got away with a par but dropped shot.   
But it was nice to get a shot back there on 10 at the end of the round.  Hopefully I can come out in the morning and make a few more birdies and get closer to the lead.   
 Q.  Following the delay, what did you do with your time this morning?  
RORY McILROY: Not a whole lot actually.  Tried to sleep in a little bit but I'm an early riser, so that was a little tough.  Got a good work out in, which was good.  Then yeah, maybe just a little bit of extra practise, which was nice.  Felt like I hit the ball better today.  Drove the ball a lot better.  So that was nice, so hopefully I can continue to do that.   
 Q.  How did it compare to yesterday?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, similar enough.  I may be didn't put quite as well as I did yesterday.  But as I say, I drove the ball a bit better and gave myself opportunities to score.   
So you know, feel like I can put the ball in the fairway for last few holes in the morning and create some more chances and as I said, try to get myself to the top of the leaderboard.   
 Q.  Two par 5s to play still.  What are your thoughts on that?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, two par 5s and obviously 17 is drivable.  Yeah, I've got some chances coming in but I just have to stay patient.  There's some tough holes, as well, coming in.  The first hole of the day tomorrow will be 12, which will be playing quite long.   
So yeah, hopefully I'll take advantage of the par 5s and get myself in one of the last couple of groups tomorrow afternoon.   
 Q.  Would you rather be on this side of the draw in this scenario or be finished?  
RORY McILROY: I don't mind.  I don't mind.  It will probably be a good test for me to play 26 holes tomorrow.  See how the body sort of responds to it.   
 Q.  If you get going early, you can take that into the third round.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, exactly, a bit of momentum, as long as it's not too much -- as long as obviously I finish after whatever time, nine o'clock in the morning and hopefully, if there's no more fog but it would be nice, maybe get a bit of momentum going and keep it going into the third round.
