 Q.  You missed a few short ones on the front nine which I thought would have put you in control?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I thought overall it was a good match.  I did miss a couple of opportunities on the front side.  Jason played very, very well.  I think he made one mistake on the second hole today, and apart from that I don't think there were any dropped shots between us.  Good quality match.  He got off to a great start.  I didn't birdie 12 or 13.  That was probably, I feel, what cost me the match.  And then from there I was really just battling back.   
Jason showed why he's such a great champion on the putt on that hole there to close out the match.  Obviously disappointing for me, but try to gather myself and play well this afternoon, and put some sort of positive spin on the week.
