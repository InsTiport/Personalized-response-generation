Q.   Assess the week as a whole, coming in here, this course, what you take out of it? 
RORY McILROY:   It was okay.   I mean, I felt like I hit the ball‑‑ I hit the ball very well from tee‑to‑green.   I think my putting just sort of let me down on the weekend a bit, but I think everyone was finding it tough out there on the greens.   They are not as smooth as we are used to at times.   They were a little firm, they were a little bumpy. 
But I felt like I played well enough to be in contention, anyway, and you know, the putter just wasn't working throughout the week.   So I think that was the biggest disappointment of the week. 

Q.   What's your plan between now and Boston?
RORY McILROY:   I'll go to Manhattan for a few days.   I'll probably get up to Boston Wednesday night and then I've played there before, and you know, know the golf course a little bit.   So just play the Pro‑Am on Thursday. 
It's a really good golf course; I like it.   It's a big golf course.   You've got to hit it well.   So it should be good.   Even though it's not the finish I would have wanted this week, still in a great position going into the next few weeks.

Q.   Is it a different attitude, kind of like playing this week, or do you get another chance to keep this thing going, from making it so far at least? 
RORY McILROY:   Even though I didn't have a great finish this week, I'm still in a great position.   You know, it has not really done me too much harm this week.   So you know, hopefully go out and have a better one next week and get some more points.
