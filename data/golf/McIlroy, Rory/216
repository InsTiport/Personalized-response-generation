 Q.  You tried to make him work for it there at the end?  
RORY McILROY: I made him earn it at least.  I made the score line a little more respectable.   
I just came away a little flat.  I didn't really necessarily play badly.  He played pretty well.  It was a few under through 9, and got down early and he didn't make a bogey all day.  So it was -- it was hard to sort of claw my way back.   
It was gusty out there, the conditions were a little tricky.  As I said, I made a run at him at the end, but it was a little too late.   
 Q.  And you just forget it and go on to tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY: Exactly.  Forget it, go on to tomorrow.  Obviously it's out of my control now.  So I've just got to win my next two matches and hopefully the draw works in my favor.
