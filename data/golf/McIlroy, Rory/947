  Second Round 66. 11-Under Total. 129  
   
  Q. Rory, all in all a good day, take away that last hole, you would have been right at the top of the leaderboard.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, obviously very disappointing way to finish but played well up until that point so can't really complain. I just need to go out tomorrow and get off to a good start and get back on the golf course.  
  
  Q. Seemed like a fun round with Poults playing well, as well.   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, at one stage it looked like he could shoot 59, and yeah, it was great. He played really good. We were both hitting good shots out there. He's playing very well and he'll be tough to beat this week. I'll just have to go out this weekend and try and play really well.  
  
  Q. Kind of a slow start for you, the eagle on 9?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, the 7-iron on 9 that was good. It sort of kick-started my round and made a few birdies after that.   
  
  Q. All in all still good position?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely. Only two shots behind the lead so right in there. Need to as I say get off to a good start tomorrow and try to make as many birdies as I can.   
  
  Q. Reflect on the last hole. What went wrong?  
 RORY McILROY: I didn't hit a very good tee shot. I was hitting an iron off the tee and just trying to get it in play and hit it into the bunker and it was a very difficult shot. I was trying to hit it under the tree with a cut and just got a little steep on it and took a bit too much sand.   
 But that's golf and that's life. Hopefully go out tomorrow and get those tee shots back early.   
  
  Q. The earthquake, were you aware of that, did you feel it?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I felt it on the 14th tee box, and to be honest my legs were like jelly over the tee shot. Never felt one of those before.
