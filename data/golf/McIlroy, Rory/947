 Q. On a day when every halve point is absolutely crucial, how much pressure did you feel over that putt? 
 RORY McILROY: You know, probably not as much as I felt over the first bunker shot. You know, I played such a good bunker shot, the first one and it just caught on the fringe and came back. 
 But it was nice to have an opportunity to get the halve. I've had three great matches with Stewart this week, and I thought today we both played very, very well. A halve is probably what we both deserved.

 Q. You've been watching this since you were six years olds, what is it like to play in?
 RORY McILROY: It's great. It's fantastic. I wouldn't have said this a year ago, but this is the best event in golf, by far.
