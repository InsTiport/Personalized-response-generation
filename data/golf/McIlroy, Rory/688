  RORY McILROY:   I think looking at the scores this afternoon, everyone found it a little more difficult out there.   It was a little windier.   The greens were getting a little firmer, as well.   
But overall I felt like I played okay.   I didn't play as well as I did yesterday and didn't really hole anything on the greens.   Yeah, I mean, I'm still in there and just need to get off to a good start tomorrow and get myself back in it.   
   
 Q.   On No.9 was that an aggressive play, second shot?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, but it was‑‑ if I was ever going to do it, today was the day to do it, and I just caught it off the bottom of the club and didn't put enough height on it, and obviously went into the trees and sort of messed about in there and made 6.   Wasn't very happy after that.  
   
 Q.   What was your yardage on that for the second?  
RORY McILROY:   It was like 258, 265 pin.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that third shot into 16, sort of had to clear the branches?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, just, yeah.   I didn't have a great lie after my tee shot, so I was just trying to get it up there somewhere.   I didn't really have much control over it, and it flew a little bit on me.   It went a little closer to the tree than I wanted it to, but I was still able to get it up and over, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   Did you hook it in there?  
RORY McILROY:   A little bit.   I was trying to, trying to hook it in there because the wind was obviously a little left‑to‑right so I was trying to spite the wind a little bit, as well.   It would have been a nice 4, too.  
   
 Q.   Was it simple for you to play well around here as scaling it back on the tee or is there another key that you've kind of figured out this week how to play here?  
RORY McILROY:   I think that's been the most important thing for me is scaling it back off the tee and not making stupid decisions like the one I made on 9 today.   
   
 Q.   Obviously a couple low scores the first two days.   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, given where the pin is and if you get it up there near the green it's a relatively simple up‑and‑down.   But if you hit it where I hit it, it makes things a bit more difficult.   
   
 Q.   Is this tournament still up for grabs because there's 20‑odd players within five shots or because of the golf course?   
RORY McILROY:   I think both.   And I think the guys who played in the morning today will probably find it a little more difficult tomorrow afternoon.   The greens are drying out.   If it's as breezy like it is, I think they're going to find it a little more difficult to make birdies out there.  
   
 Q.   Were you closer to the railroad ties on 17 or 18?   
RORY McILROY:   On 17.   My foot was on on 17.   On 18 last year I hit a ball and it was close to the water and I didn't actually have a stance, I just had to play it out sideways.  
   
 Q.   The line you took on 18, was that the one you wanted?  
RORY McILROY:   It was probably five yards left of where I wanted, but I knew it was going to clear the water.   It's just sometimes it can just kick off that little slope and it can run close to the edge.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you left a couple out there today?   
RORY McILROY:   I'm still in there.   I mean, I've made the cut, which I'm delighted about.   But I am still there with a chance.   As I said, if I can get off to a good start tomorrow, get off to a faster start, I'll only be a few out of the lead.   Yeah, I mean, I just need to go out there and play the way I know I can play and hopefully make a bit of a run and make some ground up on the leaders.   
   
 Q.   When the course does dry out like you mentioned it might do for tomorrow, does it change your philosophy at all?   
RORY McILROY:   No, not at all.   I guess you've just got to just play extra smart and be careful.   I think around here, as well, if you short‑side yourself, especially in this Bermuda rough, you really pay a penalty for that, and that's something that I did today a couple of times.   It's better off missing it in the right places here.
