Q. Rory, 65-69. What do you think was the biggest difference between the two days?
RORY McILROY: Actually I was going to say I didn't putt as well as I did yesterday. I holed a couple of nice ones at the end, played the par-5s even par today from three really good tee shots. I need to clean that up a little bit, be a little tidier from inside four or five feet, and if I do that, then if this is the worst round out of the way, then it's not bad.
Q. I was talking to Gary Koch on the air about it. He was mentioning that saying patient is so important out here on the PGA TOUR. How were you able to do that today and turn it around at the end?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was a very slow start. I made eight pars in a row, and then it's like, okay, you're either going to make a birdie or a bogey, what's going to come first, and I ended up making a bogey on 9. And yeah, there's a long way to go. There's 36 holes left. At that point I was a few shots behind, but I knew there was somebody else coming up, but yeah, I just stayed patient and try to bide my time and made a couple of nice putts coming in, and I guess my patient was rewarded a little bit.
