 Q.   Rory, on a windy day, 1-under par.   I guess every golfer there's a couple shots you left out there.  
RORY MCILROY:   Yeah, for sure.   It's 3-under through 10 and, you know, with three par-5s to play, thinking maybe get a couple more, but ended up giving a couple back, I was a little disappointed.   
Feel like I could have been standing here a few shots better, but you know, played pretty solid again.   Haven't really got anything going.   I haven't had much momentum.   Trying to have a strong weekend and shoot a couple of mid 60s and see where that leads me.  
   
 Q.   Of course when it's this windy and the greens are getting a little crusty, it's hard to put together a string of birdies during the run.  
RORY MCILROY:   It is.   I still think even though this wind is up, the greens are still receptive and they're still, you know, medium pace.   They don't die much quicker or anything.   There's still opportunities to score out there like some guys have.   
Yeah, when it's windy like this, sometimes it's hard to get the ball to the hole, and I didn't quite do that today but still pretty happy with my game.  
   
 Q.   How did you play 18, how hard is that playing right now?  
RORY MCILROY:   Playing tough.   I hit driver, 5-iron.   I hit a good shot, came up a little short, and rolled back down the bank, but it stayed up and didn't go in the water and was able to get it up and down for a par.
