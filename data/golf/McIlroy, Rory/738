Q.   What were your feelings as you stood on the opening tee shot this morning? 
GRAEME McDOWELL:   It was a very bizarre experience.   I was actually feeling very calm and very cool until I stepped over the ball.   I couldn't ignore the silence.   The silence was deafening, and it made my mind go blank.   It was very strange.   Didn't put a very nice swing on it after that. 
RORY McILROY:   We are going to go to lunch, get ready for the afternoon.   We are out again together.   Not sure in what order or where in the order, but all I know is I'm playing with this guy again and I'm looking forward to it.
