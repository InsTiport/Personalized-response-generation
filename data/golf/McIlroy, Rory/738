  RORY McILROY:   It's my own fault, but if I let down these 11 other boys and vice captains and captains this week I would never forgive myself.   I'm just obviously happy to get the point and help the cause out a little bit today.  
   
 Q.   Was it a police escort or what was it?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I was in a police car.   I was with a policeman, getting through traffic.   I got here with about 10 minutes to spare, put my shoes on, a couple of putts, just your average sort of warm‑up back at the course.  
   
 Q.   Keegan has won all his matches this week.   Extra special to take out what is their talisman really?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah.   When I got the match‑up, I liked it.   I liked the idea of playing one of their strongest players and go out there a put a point on the board early for the team, and I was able to do that.
