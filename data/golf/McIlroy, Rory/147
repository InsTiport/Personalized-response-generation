Q. 71 and a 72 to hope the tournament.  Give us your thoughts on things so far?
RORY McILROY: Getting better.  I actually played nicely yesterday.  I was 3-under through 13 and then had that bad finish and then today, got off to a nice start.  Had some really good opportunities the first few holes, and just sort of stalled in the middle of the round.
So yeah, it's been a frustrating couple of days.  My game is not really where I want it to be, but I've got two more opportunities this week to try and put a couple of good rounds together and then go to Dubai and try to finish the season on a high.
I haven't been giving myself that many chances to be fair.  It was good the first few holes today but I was very scrappy on the way in.  I haven't been putting myself in position off the tee to give myself chances with irons to get it close enough to have a good look at birdie.
I need to tidy up my game off the tee, and then if I do that, you can give yourself a lot of chances around here but you need to get the ball in the fairway first.
Q. You've not played this event for a while.  How nice to get it back on your schedule this year?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's been really nice.  It was a brief visit in and out.  I think I got sick on the Wednesday night; I tried to get through Thursday and I think I left Friday night, so I didn't really spend much time here.
It's been wonderful.  We've done a couple of game drives which has been really cool and it's such a great place.  The weather is fantastic.  The course is in great shape.  There's no excuse not to go out there and be in a good mood and play well.
