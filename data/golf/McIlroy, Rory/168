Q. Just first of all through eight holes, just talk about your play today.
RORY MCILROY: Yes, I guess the story of the last couple of days, I just haven't taken advantage of the opportunities.  I kind of felt like I had a couple really good looks on the front nine today and didn't take them.  But I'm in the middle of the 8th fairway and I've got a chance to hopefully make birdie there in the morning and hopefully that will kick start me and I can get off and running from there.  But, yeah, it's been, I think it's been 16 pars in a row from yesterday to today, so hopefully I can break that run in the morning.
Q. What's it like when you have to kind of reset like this?  You've got a night of sleeping on it obviously, but --
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I think it depends where you're at and for me I think it's a good thing.  It just let's me sort of reassess where I am and come out tomorrow fresh.  I was getting a little frustrated out there, but conversely if you're someone that's really got some momentum going, and you have to stop like that, then it can be a little more difficult.  But the break tonight and going into tomorrow will hopefully be a good thing for me, I can make the most of it in the morning.
Q. It's not like you were on 2 or 3, so, what, you have to go, I know you got another back nine, you got basically 8 and 9 to finish on the front nine and everything, and the longer play, I mean, you kind of figure this happens enough.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, of course it happens enough.  Tomorrow's more than likely going to be a very long day and that's totally fine.  But, yeah, no, I'm happy to get back out there in the morning and get after it again and yeah, I think when you play a PGA Championship in August, this is always going to happen, especially in St. Louis.  So the guys are, we do this sort of stuff week in, week out, so it's nothing new to us.
