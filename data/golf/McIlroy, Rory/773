  RORY McILROY:   I did better.   I played the last 14 holes yesterday in 3‑under, so that was good, and played solid today.   I didn't make‑‑ I doubled the 1st, but apart from that, it was pretty good. 

Q.   You got in the swing of things after that week off?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, going out there and making six birdies, it was nice.   Yeah, just keep‑‑ try to just keep improving and keep improving on my score.   If I can get lower for the next two days, I won't be far off.

Q.   What aspect of your game is working for you? 
RORY McILROY:   Everything is pretty good.   I'm driving the ball a lot better, a lot more confident with the driver, which is good.   Once I put it on the fairway I can give myself chances for birdies, which is nice.   My wedge play has been great.   I've been giving myself a lot of wedges and hitting a lot of wedges close, so that's been good.
