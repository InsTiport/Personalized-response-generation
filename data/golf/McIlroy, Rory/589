 Q.   Are you warming to Wentworth?   
RORY McILROY:   A little bit, yeah.   You know, it's a golf course that I've always liked.   It's not a golf course that‑‑ I like the layout of it, and it can sometimes play a little bit tricky because of the conditions.   
But with the way the golf course is at the minute with it being soft, I think I can play it a little bit better.   It's not a course that I've had much success on in the past, but I feel like I'm handling myself pretty well around it this week.  
   
 Q.   You're handling yourself remarkably well, and presumably having shrugged off that first hole; nice to come in in this kind of fashion?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, very similar to how I finished yesterday, as well.   Didn't get off to the greatest of starts.   Was 2‑over through three yesterday, as well, but was able to come back and make a few birdies and take advantage of the par 5s on some of the holes that you should out there.   I was able to do that for the most part today.   
A little bit disappointed I didn't birdie 18 just to edge a shot closer to the lead.   But I'm in the mix, and go out tomorrow, try to shoot a low one and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   I gather our leader has just birdied 18, so makes it even more of a gap to close, but the chances are there, aren't they?   
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, they are.   Look, I've had big leads and let them slip, and come from behind and one.   There's a lot of ways to win.   18 holes of golf is still a long way to go, but I'm going to need something very special, maybe something similar to what Thomas did the first day.  
But if the condition are favourable, then you never know what can happen.
