 Q. Rory, can you put your finger on what happened to your comfort level today because you had it so beautifully under control for three rounds?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, I thought I hung in pretty well the front nine today. I was leading the tournament going into the back nine. Just hit a poor tee shot on 10 and I just sort of unraveled from there, just sort of lost it 10, 11, 12, and couldn't really get it back. It's one of those things. You know, I'm very disappointed at the minute, and I'm sure I will be for the next few days, but I'll get over it. I've got to take the positives, and the positives were I led this golf tournament for 63 holes. 
 You know, I'll have plenty more chances. I know that. It's very disappointing what happened today. Hopefully it'll build a little bit of character in me, as well. 

 Q. I know one thing about you, at 21 years old you have a head that's a lot wiser than that on your shoulders and you're a very, very quick learner. You learned from the British Open last year and you came back here and played beautifully. Do you have any idea at the moment what you might learn from today? 
 RORY McILROY: Not at this point. If I reflect on it over the next few days I'll probably be able to tell you a little bit better. You know, I can't really put my finger on it. I lost a lot of confidence in my putting around the turn. I didn't really get anything going and was sort of second-guessing lines and second-guessing my speed, and on these greens you can't do that.
