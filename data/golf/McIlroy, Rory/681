 Q.   Obviously you had some shots that seemed like a lot of them went to the right today.   How do you explain that?  
    RORY McILROY:   Yeah, that's sort of been my big miss all of this year is leaving that shot out to the right.   It cost me today, obviously.   I hit a few shots, especially around the front nine in the water and stuff.   Yeah, it was just a bit of a struggle out there.  
   
 Q.   Does the last putt kind of sum up today?  
    RORY McILROY:   Yeah, pretty much.   Yeah, that's sort of how it's been.   The game just isn't all there at the minute.   But I'm working hard and I'm trying to figure things out and hopefully they'll come around soon.  
   
 Q.   Now you head to the range and coming into tomorrow, what do you think you've got to shoot?  
    RORY McILROY:   I've got to get some lunch, I'll head to the range and practice most of the afternoon.   I need to shoot something like 66 or 65 to probably make the weekend.   That will be the target tomorrow try to shoot the lowest score possible and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Rory, on 12, you had the 4‑putt, missed like a 4‑footer.  
    13, you missed another inside 5‑footer.   Is that focus or what?  
    RORY McILROY:   I don't know, the last four weeks have been the same.   I've missed a lot of short putts.   It's probably lack of confidence more than anything else.   And those are the sort of putts that are important to keep the momentum of the round going.   And they're the putts that I'm not really making.  
   
 Q.   Is there any correlation, you have so much going on off the course to what's happening inside the ropes?  
    RORY McILROY:   No.   Once I'm here I'm focused on what I need to do.   Right at the moment it's not happening for me.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel coming into this week that the game was coming?  
    RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it feels good.   I don't think I've played as bad as what this score suggests.   But, yeah, I mean, just one of those rounds that sort of got away from me.  
   
 Q.   As well as you were last year, talk about how far from your expectation this year has been so far for you.   Coming into this year you probably were on a high?  
    RORY McILROY:   Yeah, of course.   Coming off the back of last year, I was playing very well and winning a few times.   And won a Major championship.   
    Of course you want to come into this year and try and do the same sort of things.   It just hasn't really happened.   So, yeah, I mean obviously I haven't lived up to my own expectations this year.   But I'm working hard to try to live up to them and working hard to try and get the game back to where I know it can be.  
   
 Q.   On 2, it looked like you had a wedge in and left it out to the right?  
    RORY McILROY:   Yeah, shots like that, I hit one in the water at the next hole, as well, on the third.   It's shots like that.   Just silly mistakes, that if you don't let creep into your game it sort of is a different story.  
   
 Q.   Given that you just said that you're hitting the ball better than the numbers indicated.   Can you just give me a reference of where you are kind of on the frustration meter right now?  
    RORY McILROY:   I'm pretty frustrated.   I'm trying not to let it get to me.   It is what it is.   A few bad rounds of golf isn't going to ruin anything.   But I'd definitely like to start playing‑‑ I felt like it was really coming around at Charlotte and TPC, I started playing some good golf.   And last week, the Wentworth was bad conditions and stuff.   And it was sort of a weird week.  
    But I don't really have many explanations for this.   I felt like my game was good.   I felt like I was coming in here and hitting the ball well.   And I felt like I needed to hole some more putts and things would be okay.   And I'm still sort of struggling on the greens a bit.   And just missed a few too many shots out to the right and that cost me.
