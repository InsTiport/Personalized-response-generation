 Q.  Just comment on your final round.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, got off to a decent start, and then the ball in the water on 4 just sort of stopped any momentum. I played okay after that, I guess. I birdied 9 and then birdied a couple coming in on the homestretch. So it's fine. It's one of those weeks where, obviously, low scores, very bunched. You had to hole a lot of putts, and I didn't over the week.   
But I'm still pretty happy with how I played going into the next weekend in Hartford.   
 Q.  Is this a one-off based on sort of the way the schedule worked this year, or do you expect to come back to Hilton Head?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, once I got here and I played the golf course, I sort of remembered why I haven't been here for a while. It's tough. Like it's a lovely place. There's other courses on TOUR that probably fit my game a little bit better, and obviously the week after the Masters is always a tough one. Guys like to come here and decompress, but my idea of decompression is not seeing golf clubs for a week.
