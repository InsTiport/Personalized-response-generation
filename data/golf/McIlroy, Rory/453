Q.   Legends continue to grow here with the No.1 player in the world.   You come back again with a birdie at 17 and an eagle on 18.   What were you thinking when you were 1‑down on 17?
RORY McILROY:   I guess when I went 1‑down on 15, I sort of said to myself I've been in this position before.   So I've gained confidence from the previous matches. 
And I felt like the last three holes set up well for me, compared to Jim, with my length, and being able to maybe hit it on the green at 16, have a bit of a shorter iron into the green on 17, and then with my length there doesn't really come into play too much.
I think the confidence has built from all the matches that I've played this week.   And thankfully into the final.

Q.   Do you get a sense that when you're the favorite and if you're down that perhaps if you just apply a little pressure that it's going to go your way at the end?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I've sort of had that feeling.   I've felt very comfortable even when I have‑‑ when I was 2 down against Billy early in the week.   I was really trying to press hard. 
But even against Paul last night, against Jim here, I've always felt comfortable.   I felt like I just needed to keep hitting good shots and good putts and hopefully it will turn my way, and thankfully it did.

Q.   1‑down, 3 to play, you finished birdie, birdie, eagle.   You're the No.1 player in the world. 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I wish I didn't have to finish like this all the time.   But it's been great.   I think that the way I finished off matches this week, it's given me a lot of confidence to do what I did over the last few holes there and continued to grind.   And luckily into the final.   And I'll need to keep playing golf like that if I want to win.

Q.   44‑foot eagle putt on the 18th.   That was really a sweet 7‑iron you hit into 17, as well?
RORY McILROY:   It was.   That was the best iron shot I've maybe hit all week.   It was important.   The 17th has been good to me this week.   I made a couple of good twos there.   And Paul missed a putt last night which helped me out a little bit.   Even though I was 1‑down playing that hole, I still felt pretty comfortable.

Q.   1‑down and 3 to play, in trouble, not for the first time this week.   You finished birdie, birdie, eagle.   Try and describe how that feels. 
RORY McILROY:   I guess I've been very comfortable on the closing holes this week.   I played a lot of them, more than anyone else, probably.   Even when Jim made birdie on 15, I went 1‑down but I felt like the way the course was set up with the tee moved up on 16, the long par‑3, 17, and then a par 5 to finish, I felt like I had a little bit of an advantage there with the way I play and the way Jim plays.
I made a good 3 on 16, but so did Jim.   But I probably hit the best iron shot I've had all week on the 17th.   The 17th hole has been good to me this week.   It's pulled me out of a couple of holes.   And then obviously a great way to finish on the last.

Q.   Describe the adrenaline rush you get to hole a putt like that to win a match?
RORY McILROY:   It's hard to describe.   You're really into what you're doing and you're just focusing on the spot you've picked somewhere out there and you know you just had a good putt.   And as soon as it was halfway there, I knew it had a good chance.   And obviously a great way to finish.   I need to gather myself again and try to do it again this afternoon.

Q.   Gary Woodland in the final.   Have you played much with him?
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I know Gary's game pretty well.   Very impressive ball‑striker when he gets it going.   I'm sure he's played very well this week to get to this point and I'm going to have to bring some of my best stuff, as well.
