Q. Talk about that last birdie, how important it was for you coming off.
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was nice.  You wouldn't have thought looking at the three of us today and yesterday that we'd all finish on even par.  We all sort of did it in a different way.  But yeah, I was pretty happy with my round today.  I made a lot of pars.  I thought the course was -- it felt gettable, but looking at the scores, no one went super low.  Felt like there was a lot of pins you just couldn't really get that close to.  You really had to hit some high-quality shots to get close.  Shooting under par, getting myself in for the weekend, I wish I could have been closer to the lead, but the guys haven't went that low, so tomorrow morning maybe shoot us a low one and get myself back in the tournament.
Q. Along that line, I thought your shot into 4 was a high-quality shot.  Is that to your point where it may not be gettable?
RORY McILROY: Just fine margins, and yeah, that second shot, you have to keep it right of the pin.  That went straight over the pin.  It wasn't quite right of it.  But for a shot to pitch, whatever it is, four, five away from the pin and end up 50 feet away, that's the fine margins around this golf course.
Q. Some guys go through an adjustment period with new equipment, new ball.  Putting them in play all together at once, does that factor at all?
RORY McILROY: Not really.  Surprised at how far the ball goes at times, which is a good thing, I guess.  Like that shot on -- I wasn't anticipating pitching it past the pin on the 4th hole, which I alluded to.  It pitched a few yards past.  But no, it's been really good so far, even in the wind.  It feels like it gets through it much better than the one I have been playing, so that's all positive.
