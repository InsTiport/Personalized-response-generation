 Q. Four rounds in the 60s around Firestone. How good a heart does that put you in for next week's PGA?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's been a very productive week to, as you said, shoot four rounds in the 60s, have a good weekend. There's a lot of positives going into next week, which is great. It would have been nice to give myself a little more of a chance to win this week, just didn't hole enough putts. But you know, again, it was a good week and a good confidence builder going into next week definitely.

 Q. The attention on you next week is going to be unbelievable. Are you ready for that?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, I'm playing well. I'm really happy with the way I'm hitting it and driving it a lot better than I have done the last couple weeks, so yeah, I'm ready for it. 

 Q. You'll play the first two rounds with the other two major champions from this year. Your thoughts on that?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think it'll be great fun playing with Darren and Charl. It'll be great. It's always -- not many people say they're part of the major champions' group at the PGA. It's going to be great. I'm going to enjoy it.
