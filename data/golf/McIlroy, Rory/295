Q. What's your take on the week?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's been good.  I think Hideki has played much superior golf than the rest of the field this week.  You know, he's going to be a deserved champion, that's for sure.
It's been a decent week.  Obviously there's a couple good scores in there mixed in with a couple of ones that I'd like to take back.  But you know, overall, the week's been pretty good.  It wasn't the win that I wanted, but I'm going to finish in the top 5 it looks like anyway, so not a bad week.
Q. So many positives but was it mid round third day when you actually thought, yeah, this is slipping?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, mid-round, third day, and obviously didn't get off to the fastest of starts with the 71.  So again, those two rounds were a little bit disappointing.  But felt like I played pretty good golf and when I got it going, I was able to make some birdies and just not as many as I had to.
Q. What is the approach when you start a final day knowing that the leader so far advanced?
RORY McILROY: Just try and shoot the best score that you possibly can, that's it.  There's not really anything else that you can do, and you can't control what anyone else does.
So if I go out there today and shoot the best that I can and see where that ends up -- there's always something to play for, even if you don't think you can win the tournament.  There's still points up for grabs and everything else.  That's what I was playing for today.
Q. On that subject of points up for grabs, that's a nice gap closed in The Race to Dubai, isn't it?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it is.  Obviously it depends what Henrik does down the last.  He's a good bit ahead of me anyways.  Hopefully we just tie, so I'm a little bit behind him.
Yeah, it's a step in the right direction, anyway.  Still need to do a lot more.
Q. I appreciate your plans have changed.  So what happens from here?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I guess it's out of my hands.  That's the thing.  I took the decision not to go to Turkey next week, and those boys can battle it out.  If I have somewhat of a chance going into Dubai, that's great.  But if not, I think over the course of the season, they have had big wins and played well.  They are two major champions, so I'm okay with that.
