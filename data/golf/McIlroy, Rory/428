Q. Overall thoughts?
RORY McILROY: I felt it was good.  It was a solid round of golf.  Happy with the way I struck the ball.
Obviously I was pretty nervous on the first tee.  It was just getting back there, it was nice to get that opening tee shot out of the way.  It wasn't the best of starts, but to hit those two shots on the second hole and make birdie, that sort of settled me down and I could get into the round.
But I think anything under par this afternoon was a decent score.  I set myself a target going into the back nine.  I knew there would be a few chances, so I thought trying to shoot something under 70 was realistic.
I sort of had a chance to do that after birdieing the 16th.  I missed a good chance there on 17.  Unfortunate bogey on the last, I guess.  Just hit a 3-iron and held it up a little bit too much into the wind and leaked it right.  But as I said, anything under par today is a good score, or this afternoon, anyway, is a good score.
Q. How is the ankle after 18 holes walking in competition?
Rory McILROY:  Fine, just as it is walking 18 and practicing.  The exact same, no different.
As you can see out there, the way I'm hitting the ball and the way I'm getting around the golf course, I have full confidence in it.  It doesn't bother me one bit.
Q. The second shot you hit at 9, what club did you hit?  And when you hit a shot back here after along layoff, what is that like?
RORY McILROY: I hit an 8-iron from 153.  I think the purest shot I hit all day was a 3-wood into the second.  It was 286 pin or something.  I hit it to 15 feet.  That was one of the best 3-woods I've ever hit.  So to hit a shot like that, coming off that layoff, I guess it just shows -- the only thing I was a little bit worried about, I guess, going into today is whether I could bring this good golf that I know that I have been playing into a competitive round.  Thankfully, after those tee shots on the second, I felt like I did that.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RORY McILROY: It was fine.  The only thing I was trying not to do was get my feet wet.  Because if the water gets through this shoe and through, then the tape gets wet and then that would be a little more than just sort of annoying or uncomfortable for the rest of the day.  But it was fine.  I just, it was a little bit deeper on the right side, so I just rolled my right trouser leg up and it was fine.  I just had to remember to hit it hard.  And I was very fortunate to escape with a par there.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RORY McILROY: Not surprised, just to be fully committed to a shot like that, second hole into a tournament, I know when I start a season off the first couple of rounds are sometimes a little bit tentative, just trying to get your way around.  But that was full bore as good as I can do, especially with a wind like that.  So it was a nice feeling.
Q. What's it like for your nerves?  You said you were nervous on that tee shot.  To play with this group where you probably had the biggest crowd following you?
RORY McILROY: It's not really the crowd.  Obviously we're all used to that by now.  It's not that.  It's more as I said, just being a little bit anxious coming back and seeing how my game's going to react whenever I'm put under a little bit of pressure and have a card in my hand and have to really score.  And that was really, once I got those first couple holes out of the way, I felt like I settled into the round really nicely.
