 Q.  A different day out there today, you woke up, a bit of wind out there.  How do you assess it for us?  
RORY McILROY: I mean, yeah, it was a bit of a more difficult day, but I think with the way the course is and how soft it is, there's definitely still scores out there.  I didn't play very well today.  I was just a bit flat out there.  So yeah, left myself a lot to do over the weekend but hopefully I can shoot a couple of good scores and get myself back up the leaderboard.   
 Q.  Haven't been feeling well, a lot of time spent in the room with a dodgy tummy.  Is it better now?  Are you 100 per cent or getting closer?  
RORY McILROY: I wouldn't say I'm 100 per cent.  I struggled to hit balls today on the range, get a few cramps in the stomach.  But I took a couple of tablets and it sort of went away as I went through the round.  Still not 100 per cent but I'm getting there.   
 Q.  You're still in it, you're still in this championship.  This is your bad day, I feel; you've got a low one out there.  How low do you feel that you'll go around this golf course, because there's a lot to be had out there?  
RORY McILROY: There definitely is.  You take advantage of the par 5s and a few of the other sort of gettable holes; I've shot 63 around here before.  No reason why I can't go out and shoot a score like that over the weekend and get myself somewhat back in the tournament.   
 Q.  Little bit frustrating not to get the forward momentum today?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  Considering I thought yesterday was going to be the struggle, yeah, I just didn't -- I played okay.  I started off okay, and 2-under through nine I guess, and feeling like I could at least shoot something similar to yesterday and be right up there.   
You know, missed a few chances on the back nine, a couple of loose shots, a couple of bogeys and that was really the story of my day.  Bogeyed two of the short par 4s out there and didn't really take advantage of the par 5s on the back nine to try and salvage some sort of score.   
So yeah, a bit of a disappointing day.   
 Q.  Does it feel like a microcosm of your year in a sense; that every time you feel like there's just going to be a bit of forward momentum, something gets in the way?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit.  To sum up my year, it's been a little bit like that.  I feel I've taken a couple of good steps forward and I'll knock back a bit and try to get going again.  That does feel how the year's went for me a little bit, but as I've kept saying, try to end this year on a high note and play well over the weekend here and try and play well in Dubai.   
 Q.  That's the thing, isn't it, to just try to get that momentum, forward movement, with a big finishing prospect.  
RORY McILROY: Exactly.  If I can get a big finish over the next two days and then in Dubai, at least go into next year with some -- I mean, there's a few positives to take.  But with the good finish of the season hopefully fresh in my mind, then I can get off to a good start next year, as well.
