   RORY McILROY: It was okay. It wasn't really what I was looking for. I felt as if I could have been a lot lower. I'll need to do something pretty good over the weekend if I want to try and win this tournament. 

 Q. What do you think of the course and which hole do you think is the most difficult to play?
 RORY McILROY: It's a great golf course. It's actually one of my favourite golf courses that we play all year. And the most difficult hole I think is No. 9. No. 9 today played very, very tough. 
 But yeah, I think everyone enjoys playing here. 

 Q. Does your girlfriend bring any pressure to you today? 
 RORY McILROY: No, not at all. No, it's nice to have her support out there. 

 Q. Did you chat to each other during the game? 
 RORY McILROY: No. 

 Q. Birdies?
 RORY McILROY: I birdied three in a row, on 6,7 and 8. Hit a 3-wood to eight feet on the 8th hole which was my best shot of the day. 

 Q. How far out was that? 
 RORY McILROY: 260. 

 Q. And you generally are just a little bit off the pace? 
 RORY McILROY: Every time I made a birdie, I made a bogey and I was just always trying to play catch up. I feel like over the past two days, I've left quite a few shots out there. But it's one of those things. I just have to try and make them up over the weekend.
