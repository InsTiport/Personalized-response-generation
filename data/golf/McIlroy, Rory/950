 Q. Can you talk about why you didn't go for it in two, you had about 246 to the front. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Because I don't have the 3-wood capabilities this guy might have. There was a bit of breeze against, and I honestly didn't have a 3-wood in the bag. 
 RORY McILROY: I would have struggled. 

 Q. 17, sort of a classic match play, you were on the wrong end of it at that point, but classic match play. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, classic match play. Vintage. Matt hits it in there to 20 feet and Graeme hits a phenomenal shot into six and Stewart holes and looking like we are 1-up with one to play and all of a sudden we are 1-down with one to play, and that's match play. That's the beauty of it. You know, we have been on the wrong side of it this week but hopefully be on the right side of it tomorrow.

 Q. The range of emotion today that you experienced, even at that one hole, 17, where you hit the long one, walk us through. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, that was probably my high and low of the day. I mean, the wedge shot this afternoon wasn't great, either, but the adrenaline I felt when I holed that long putt on 17 this morning was incredible. Yeah, I mean, it's been very mixed emotions today, this session.

 Q. What do you know about The Ryder Cup, right now, that you didn't know, say, on Thursday before it started? 
 RORY McILROY: It's a lot of fun. Oh, it's just incredible. It's just completely different to any other golf event I've ever played, and I think all of the guys are having a lot of fun out there. 

 Q. Just a little bit about Lee Westwood who has been a stalwart for this team. Any question that this guy is the backbone of the European side? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: There's no doubt about it. The guy takes six weeks off, barely hits a ball, comes here and is hands-down our best player this week. Without him this week, we would be in trouble. The U.S. are putting up a phenomenal display themselves, and without guys like Lee Westwood on our team, Luke Donald, we would be in big trouble right now, and fair play to Lee. He's our No. 1 player for a reason.
