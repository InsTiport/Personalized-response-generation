Q. You finished the day where you started, at even par.   What do you make of this round?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was okay.  I think everyone saw it was difficult conditions out there.  Felt like I probably could have been a few better, missed a couple of short ones.  I hit the ball pretty well from tee-to-green.  I think anything under par today in the afternoon especially is a good score.  Have to get back out there tomorrow in better conditions with the greens a little bit better and try to do something.
Q. What exactly happened out there on No. 4?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I addressed my ball, so I put my putter behind it, but with the wind, that's a very exposed green.  And with these poa greens, as well, sort of what happened to Dustin at the U.S. Open, as well, any tiny bit of movement, whether it's wind or even pressure of your feet -- not really making the ball move but told the ref what happened, and he said with the wind and everything, I don't think you caused the ball to move.  I just played it from where it was.
Q. How tough is it fighting off the rust?
RORY McILROY: Tee-to-green it wasn't -- I worked pretty hard on my game the last week or so.  Tee-to-green wasn't really there, but on the greens, yeah, finding something new point putter, and that was the thing I felt a little tentative at the start.  I left a couple short early on and then I missed the short one on the fourth hole today.  I struggled a little bit but I stayed with it and stayed patient.  Felt like even par was a fair reflection of how I played.
