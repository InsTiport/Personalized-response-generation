Q. A lot of players made a big move up the leaderboard, and we know you've achieved great success here in the past.  Overall when you look at the number, what's your assessment?
RORY McILROY: I mean, I have to be pleased.  It's a massive improvement considering the golf I've played the last couple weeks.  So to shoot two scores in the 60s is great.  I feel like today was even an improvement on yesterday.  I missed a few putts that I felt just slid by the hole.  I hit good putts that just didn't go in, and there's always something about playing with Patrick that seems to bring the best out of him, and I seem to play pretty well, too.
It was a good round of golf.  Would have been nice to make a birdie at the last, but I'm right there at the end.
Q. Did that catch you by surprise, the approach, the green-side bunker?
RORY McILROY: I was sort of in-between clubs.  It was either a high, floaty 3-wood or a real strong draw with a 5-wood and I tried to hit the strong draw with a 5-wood, but the draw has been a shot that I've struggled with all year.
I just got a little bit late on it and left the club open.  Not the first time I've hit a shot like that this year but happy it ended up where it did and I wasn't in worse trouble.
Q. You've made adjustments with the driver.  Got to take a lot of confidence with the way it's been performing?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, wish I would have had it earlier in the year.  It's almost frustrating because it feels easy.  It feels easy to hit it where I'm looking, where it's been a bit of a struggle the last few months.  But it's great that I've found a club setup that works for me and hopefully will continue to help me shoot good scores going into the next few months.
Q. What's the significance of what this weekend could mean for you?
RORY McILROY: I just want to give myself another chance to win a golf tournament.  I've given myself plenty of chances this year.  I just haven't capitalised on those chances.  I need to shoot another good round tomorrow to get myself right in contention on Sunday, and hopefully if I can do that, I can play some good golf and it would be nice to win for a third time out there.
Q. You posted a number in the 60s yesterday and two better today.  Watching you, do you feel like you left a few out there?  Your ball-striking seemed to be strong?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was good.  My iron play and wedge play, there's been big improvements in those two areas of my game this week.  I've driven the ball better, so I've been able to give myself opportunities from the fairway.
I felt like even the putts that slid by, for the most part I hit good putts.  I just didn't read them right or the pace was just a little bit off.  Overall, considering the golf that I've played the last couple of weeks, I'm happy with my start.
Q. Considering you tweaked the weight in the shaft of your driver, where are you right now with that?
RORY McILROY: I'm really happy.  The way I've driven the ball the last two days is a massive improvement compared to the way I've driven the ball over the past few months.  Big strides in that department, and two more rounds to get a little bit more comfortable.
Q. Seemed like you and Patrick were having fun.  Do you guys maybe bring the best out of each other?
RORY McILROY: I think I certainly bring the best out of him.  But yeah, it's fun.  Patrick and I get along great.  I think there's a are the of respect between each other and the way we play the game.  I thought the way he gutted it out at the Masters this year to get in, that was fantastic.  I have a lot of respect for his game.  We get along great.  It was a nice pairing.
