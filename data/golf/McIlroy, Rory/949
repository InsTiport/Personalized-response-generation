 Q. Rory, half a point from your first two matches, you've just won your first full point in Ryder Cup. How big of an adrenaline rush is that? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's massive. Firstly for me it's great to win a point but it's more important for the team. We are rallying today and we just really need to keep it going to win the first two matches and lead from the front, that's what we set out to do and we have been able to do it.

 Q. You had to get points on the board early and you've faced that pressure in a major championship; how does Ryder Cup pressure compare? You're playing for your continent, your team, your tour. 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: It feels completely different. You can't compare the two, Sunday afternoon at a major championship is a completely different feeling being out here. This is pure adrenaline. 
 The crowd were huge the last couple of days. We had a big night last night. Our strategy today was we knew the US were going to come out and go hard at us this morning. Zach Johnson holed a 40-footer on the first green; if we needed any indication how they felt, that was it. We had to dig deep. 

 Q. How does it feel to have literally thousands of people willing every putt into the hole? 
 RORY McILROY: It's fantastic. It's fantastic. I mean, the support that we are getting out here this week, this is our 13th man, and we are trying to do this for them and for everyone else, and it's just a great feeling, great feeling. 

 Q. How much does this team want to win this? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: Very, very badly. You know, Monty has been very inspirational this week. We have a great backroom staff. We desperately want to win this. This session is enormous for us and we are going to go out and shout the boys on right now.

 Q. Rory, you're on your own tomorrow, how do you feel about that? 
 GRAEME McDOWELL: He's too good.
 RORY McILROY: I'm up for the singles tomorrow. It's going to be a great battle out there with whoever I'm playing and it will be great to get out there and try and win a point for the team.
