 Q.   You've come close here twice before and judging by that reaction on the last, this one really means a lot?  
RORY McILROY:   It does mean a lot.   I wanted to win this tournament so badly since that playoff in 2008, and I've had to wait a couple years to get there, but finally, to get this trophy in my hands, is very special.   And it means a lot.   It meant a lot to go out there today, knowing that I had to play well, to keep myself in The Race to Dubai, probably to keep myself in second place in the World Rankings.     There's a lot to play for, and to produce the sort of golf that I did today was very pleasing.  
   
 Q.   Like you said, going back to yesterday, you looked like when you were out on the golf course, that's the last place you wanted to be but today you're a different man; what was it?   
RORY McILROY:   A bit more sleep.   Yeah, I mean, I was feeling‑‑ I still am, energy levels are not as good as I would want them to be.   But I slept for nearly 12 hours last night, and actually went into the gym this morning.   I went for a run just to get my body sort of going and try to get a bit of energy and get it moving and that seemed to work, because that's the best I hit it all week today.  
   
 Q.   You've played a lot of golf this year and you're very tired; have you learnt from this year how you'll treat your schedule next year?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I am, but I'll always come back to the tournaments that I love, and Hong Kong is one of those tournaments.   I absolutely love it here, and it will be great to come back next year and defend this title.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through the last hole.   We know you hate to play conservatively but that's a tough tee shot.   What goes through your mind, do you think about hitting an iron to the top of the hill?  
RORY McILROY:   I have played it like that before, but if I'm 100 per cent honest, I'm not as confident with my golf swing this week as I have been, so it's better to make a full committed swing when you're not 100 per cent sure.   
So I just said, you know, I've hit my 3‑wood good today and that's what I've played the last few days so I'm just going to stand up there and hit it as hard as I can, and if it goes down the middle, great, and if not, I'll try and make a par another way.   
Tee shot was a little left but I got away with it.   It's been so hard to control the ball out of the rough this week and came up a little short.  
   
 Q.   This golf course different from what you've played in the past, isn't it.   
RORY McILROY:   It is.   It's much firmer and it's harder to get the ball close to the hole and the wind has been very tricky.   You sort of saw that today‑‑ all week, the scores have reflected that this has been a very challenging golf course, and to shoot 65 today and do what I needed to do, it's great to just be able to do it.   
   
 Q.   Two more tournaments left this year.   What are you going to do after that?   
RORY McILROY:   I'll have to stay in my bed for about a week (laughing).   I still have a couple of weeks left to go.   I'm going to try really hard next week‑‑ this has still kept me in The Race to Dubai and I've still got a chance to win that.   I've got to conserve all of my energy and put them into the four tournament days.   
   
 Q.   You're a fan favourite everywhere and they definitely love you here, so we do hope you come back next year.   
RORY McILROY:   I hope so, too.   I would love to come back.   The support that I've had here in Hong Kong over the last few years has been phenomenal, and it definitely helped spur me on today.
