 Q.  Round of 2-over par 72.  What's your assessment of day No. 1 here?  
RORY McILROY: I mean, it was a pretty tough day.  Wind was up.  Greens got a little sort of crusty and firm.  I felt like I was hanging on pretty well.  I was doing everything I needed to do, just sort of grinding out pars.   
Sort of was pushing for a birdie at the last to try and shoot under par.  Just tried to hold a 3-wood up into the wind and over did it a little bit.  A disappointing finish.  Get back out tomorrow morning and try to rectify that mistake and start again.   
 Q.  When you rattle of a string of pars and maybe try to push it, as you said, at the end -- is it to try to sort of leave feeling under par and you can build into Friday with that?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, you know, if you look at the back nine, the 18th was the hole that was going to present the best chance for a birdie.  I was trying to make 4 there.  I felt my best way it make 4 was to hit 3-wood and get it up by the green or on the green and go from there.   
It was the right shot.  I just didn't execute it the right way.   
 Q.  With the challenges this course has presented, will likely moving forward, what adjustments, if any, do you make on Friday?  
RORY McILROY: Not a whole lot.  I feel like I was pretty solid out there.  I didn't do much wrong.  I struggled to read the greens.  I hit a couple of putts that did the exact opposite of what I thought they were going to do.   
Just fairways, greens, and sort of grind out pars and try to pick up birdies when they come along.  If the wind stays like this, it's going to be a tough week.   
 Q.  When you and I spoke at Pebble Beach, you talked about being refreshed, motivated, most importantly, healthy.  How much do you lean on that combination, not only after rounds like this, but the bigger picture and what you look to accomplish?  
RORY McILROY: Big picture, I'm so happy to be playing, and this is my third week in a row and don't feel any ill effects from health-wise or mentally or anything like that.  It doesn't really feel -- usually when you play your third week in a row, you feel like you're looking forward to the week off.  But I feel great.   
Obviously disappointed how I finished today but excited to get a chance to go out there tomorrow again and shoot a good score and find my way back up the leaderboard.
