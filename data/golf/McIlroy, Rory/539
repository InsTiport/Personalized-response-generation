Q.   Overall assessment? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, I just wasn't very good.   I actually felt like I got off to a decent start.   First couple of holes were solid.   Short‑sided myself on 12.   Made double from there, and after that, compounded that with a bogey on the par5 at the next and sort of tried really hard to get some sort of momentum going in the round and I couldn't really do that.
It's very important here, if you are going to miss greens, miss it in the right spots, because I missed it in the wrong spot a couple of times today and it's really tough to get it up‑and‑down.   But I hung in there.   I shot 1‑under par on the back side, which was the front nine, and obviously need to play well tomorrow to be here for the weekend.

Q.   Is it fair to think that there's any mental come down or fatigue after the high of the two majors and how much you were doing in the past week? 
RORY McILROY:   No, I think it's more to do with just not putting the adequate time into my game over the past week for obvious reasons.   I think that's really been it.   So I'm going to grab a bite to eat here and go to the range this afternoon and work on a few things and really just catch up on some practice that I probably missed out on over the past week. 

Q.   Were you fatigued at all?   How many different places were you from the PGA to this? 
RORY McILROY:   No, three different places, three, four‑‑ five‑‑ no, four.   But yeah, it hasn't been too bad.   Look, I'm used to the travel.   I'm used to doing that.   It's nothing new to me. 
Fatigue isn't playing a part.   It's I think just not putting the time in that I probably should have over the past week and I think I allowed myself that and deserved that.   But this is the sort of consequence of it and I need to work hard on this afternoon and go out tomorrow and shoot a good number. 

Q.   How much of a concern was it knowing you had not put in the practice time coming in‑‑
RORY McILROY:   It wasn't really a concern.   It was inevitable, after such a great few weeks‑‑ I wanted to enjoy it for a week.   I came here Monday morning, hit some balls, practiced pretty well.   But I guess taking a week off and sort of getting back into it this week, I probably just needed to give myself a little bit more time.   But I wasn't going to do that.   I was enjoying myself. 

Q.   Phil said, look, you win the British, you win the PGA, it's like a season for most people‑‑
RORY McILROY:   It's a career for a lot of people.   You know, it's behind me; it's gone.   I've done it and I want to move on.   I want to achieve more things.   I want to be successful from here to the end of the season.   So it's just all about giving yourself new goals and new targets. 

Q.   How bad is the rough? 
RORY McILROY:   It's thick, it really is.   Yeah, there is such a premium on putting your ball in the fairway and I didn't really do that for the most part today.   Obviously the thick, juicy rough around the greens makes it difficult, as well. 
So, yeah, it's a real‑‑ it doesn't seem it, and I missed it wide enough at times where the rough was actually okay with the spectators and everything.   But if you miss it just two or three yards off the fairway, it is really juicy and it's tough. 

Q.   Given the stretch of four weeks coming, is it almost not such a bad thing or maybe you're not as disappointed today because there's going to be a lull, or do you feel like a lull isn't maybe a bad thing? 
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's not a bad thing.   I'm not‑‑ yeah, a score like this would be tougher to take if I had not just come off the weeks that I had.   But at the same time, I want to play well and I want to give myself chances to win tournaments.   I'll need to get off to a good start tomorrow to try and do that.   But there is chances out there.   There is chances on this golf course to make birdies.   I feel like I can do that.
