 Q.  (No microphone.)  
RORY MCILROY: Just give yourself chances for birdies and not having to scramble all day.   
 Q.  How did the new equipment react in tournament play?  
RORY MCILROY: Good, obviously we had a little breeze out there, I felt my distance control was okay for the most part.  But, yeah, I mean it was definitely more the user of the equipment than the equipment today.
