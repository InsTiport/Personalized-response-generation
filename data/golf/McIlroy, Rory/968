  Q. Pleased with your position?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I played very nicely out there. Putted well, which was the big key. I think I missed one for birdie on 17 but apart from that, it was pretty good out there and I gave myself plenty of chances, and saved my pars when I needed to.   
  
  Q. You seem to be immune to pressure. Do you ever feel any out there? Seems like a stroll in the park for you.   
 RORY McILROY: I wouldn't say it's a stroll in the park. It's nice out there. One of the big things this week, because the crowds are so far back from the fairway, they don't feel on top of you, and you don't really feel the atmosphere that there is out there, which I suppose helps a little bit. It was nice out there today, especially playing with Dustin, who played well; sort of fed off one another, and you know, we both hit it nicely.  
  
  Q. How excited are you about tomorrow?   
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it will be great. I'm going to be a few back, but I feel as if I'm playing well enough to really give it a good go.   
 Yeah, I've just got to go out there and keep doing the same things I've done for the last three days, just stay as patient as possible and not let things get to me. Once I get my mind in the right place, I know that I've got a pretty good chance.   
  
  Q. Game plan change tomorrow even if you're a few strokes behind?   
 RORY McILROY: No, I just have to go out there and try to do the best score possible, which is what I try and do every day. I'll just go out there and keep the same thoughts and try to give myself as many chances as I can.
