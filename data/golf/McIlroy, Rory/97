Q. Thoughts on the week?
RORY McILROY: I think I got what I wanted out of it for the most part.  I would have loved to have been in the thick of things going into today, but probably just made a few too many mistakes over the week to do that.
But I've learnt a lot this week.  It's the first time playing links golf in a while.  Just, you know, different turf, ball goes different distances into the wind.  You know, little lies around the greens, all that sort of stuff, that just sort of takes you awhile to get used to again.  Yeah, I think it's been a productive week.  Obviously not the finish I would have wanted, but I'm really happy with what I've done this week, and happy to be going to Portrush.
Q. In terms of your game; there any part of it that you feel just want to tune up a little bit more for Thursday?
RORY McILROY: I think just again, I haven't -- I didn't judge the lies around the greens very well this week.  You know, I thought -- I'd look at a lie and say, okay, I know the ball is going to maybe come out a bit faster or a bit slower and I misjudged a few of those.
Again that's just getting used to links golf again.  If I can just sharpen that up and sharpen up those little shots around the greens, I'll be right there.
Q. How do you anticipate the first tee is going to feel next Thursday?
RORY McILROY: Honestly, I think it's going to feel normal.  It's going to feel like just another Open Championship.  I've played in a few of them now.  I know what to expect.  Might be a little louder.  Atmosphere might be a bit different but the objective is the same, to go there and play good golf and hopefully give myself a chance to win the Claret Jug.
Q. Just finally, you're already an Open Championship, but to win it in Northern Ireland, where would that sit on things you've done in your career?
RORY McILROY: It would be right up there.  You know, at this point in my career, I don't want to sit back and look at things too much.  I mean, I'm on a journey and this journey, it started 11 or 12 years ago and hopefully I still have another 15 or 20 years left in it.  It's part of the journey.  It's part of doing what I do.
But you know, if I'm being honest, it would obviously mean the world to me.  But just like winning Hoylake meant the world to me, as well.  Just getting my hands on that Claret Jug again would be a huge accomplishment.
