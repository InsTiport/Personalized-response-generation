Q. Incredible week.  Let's start with today and the match that you had.  Those first eight holes, I mean, it was like a football game broke out here.  Can you talk about the emotion between you and Patrick?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, for sure, I knew what I needed to do right from the get-go.  Two of the leaders of our team in terms of what we did this week and the emotion that we show out there, I knew I needed to keep doing that if I wanted to have any chance to win that match.
For the first eight holes I was doing it pretty well.  Just ran out of steam.  It's been a long week.  Patrick played great today as he has all week.  I didn't have enough at the end to try and stop him.
Q. A lot of fun stuff going on between the two of you.  Was it fun stuff?  Are you guys good?
RORY McILROY: Oh, for sure.  We were congratulating each other after playing some great shots.  It was all played in the right spirit, which was great.  I think that's the most important thing.  We mocked each other a little bit and whatever, at the same time it was all in good fun.  No problems with Patrick Reed at all.  He's been immense this week.
