 Q. How would you assess your week this week?  
RORY MCILROY: Well, I was in a great position going into the weekend, a shot back in the final group on Saturday and I just didn't play the golf I needed to when it really mattered. That's the thing that I take away not just from this week, but from previous Masters. I've been in position before and I haven't got the job done when I needed to and I don't think that's anything to do with my game, I think that's more me mentally and I'm trying to deal with the pressure of it and the thrill of the achievement if it were to happen. I think that's the thing that's really holding me back.   
So, the more times I can get in position to win this tournament, the more times I'll learn and I'll know what not to do. And I feel like I learned a lot yesterday reflecting on it and that's something that hopefully I'll do things differently.  
   
 Q. What are you going to reflect on?  
RORY MCILROY: Just how I played, how I felt out there. I felt very tentative, played very defensively, felt very similar to how I played the last round at Doral, playing with the lead. You're just trying not to make mistakes instead of attacking and trying to make birdies. Trying not to make mistakes is not my game, that's not what I do. And if I were to have yesterday back that's what I would do differently.  
   
 Q. You mentioned that if this one in particular you're feeling more pressure, obviously any Major Championship you're going to feel more pressure but is it because this is the one that you haven't won?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, this is the one that I haven't won and this is the one I want to win more than anything else. I won a Claret Jug, I want to win more. I won a Wanamaker, I won the U.S. Open, but this is the one that I haven't.   
Once I overcome that mental hurdle that I'm struggling with at the minute, then I know how to play this course, I've played this course very well before, and I can string good rounds together here, but it's just a matter of doing it.  
   
 Q. You said the mental side was the big thing earlier just there, but what about the speed of the greens and just your performance on the greens this week?  
RORY MCILROY: I feel like it's been okay. I'm not coming away from here that disappointed with my putting, to be honest. Putting here is more difficult than anywhere else that we play on TOUR. I hit good putts that didn't go in and I've hit not so good putts and I made a few 3â€‘putts, but that's to be expected out here. When I look back on it, I don't think that's what's cost me the Tournament this week at all.   
   
 Q. Is it a case of maybe wanting it too much and then you mentioned the mental stuff, does it just sort of spill over and kind of exponentially cause mistakes?  
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, again, trying not to make mistakes, trying to be too careful, that's the stuff that's holding me back. As I said, that's not the way I play. And it's almost as if I need to go out here and not respect the golf course as much, to go out there and not really care where I miss it or where I don't miss it, everyone talks about at Augusta you need to miss it here, you need to miss it there, it's all about your misses, but I would rather hit it right on line than miss in the right place. So, yeah, I just, I was a little too careful out there yesterday, trying to just be a little bit too tentative, I guess. I don't know how else to describe it.
