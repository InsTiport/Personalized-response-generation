 Q.   A couple quick comments about the round?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it was good.   I played pretty similar to the way I did the first two days.   I just scored better.   I took advantage of some good shots in close.   Holed a few more putts and birdie the holes that you need to birdie out there, the par‑5s, the short par‑4s.   
Today it was nice to see a few putts drop and get myself back in the middle of the pack, so I can maybe shoot something similar tomorrow and maybe push the top‑10 or top 15.  
   
 Q.   Nice to have Carolyn is here.  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's nice for her to be here.   It was nice in the delay, I persuaded her to in the delay to come up here for a night.   It was nice.   After this we'll go back to New York for a few days and hang out, which will be nice.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, you're feeling good heading into tomorrow?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, it's been a few early mornings, and it will be another early morning tomorrow morning.   So just‑‑ yeah, just get some sleep and get out there tomorrow morning early and try and put up another good number, and move up on the FedExCup rankings and give myself a good shot going into the Chicago to progress into Atlanta.
