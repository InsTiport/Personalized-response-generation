 Q.  Happy with your position? 
 RORY McILROY:  Yeah, it was okay, I'm here for the weekend and played a bit better today.  Still struggled a bit to be honest.  I think I'll find something in my swing I'll go ask work on this afternoon, so that was positive. 
 Yeah, 69 is probably the worst I could have shot in a way, you know, and I sort of putted well again.  Just didn't make that many. 
 It was nice to hole that one on the last.  I think three probably going to be good enough anyway, but to be one clear of the cut; it's okay. 

 Q.  What you were saying about tiredness and a little bit of fatigue, yesterday in particular? 
 RORY McILROY:  Yeah, this is my seventh week on the go, so I'm getting a little tired.  But it would be nice to finish off this last week with a good finish and looking forward to a couple of weeks at home just to rest and sort of reflect on all that's went on the last few weeks. 
 Yeah, obviously, I'm looking forward to the weekend and hopefully I can move up the leaderboard and looking forward to a little time at home. 

 Q.  Are you accepting that Valderrama might be a little too much to get to? 
 RORY McILROY:  Well, with a couple of 65s, we'll see where I am on Sunday. 
 But, I mean, it was never in the equation when you're trying to get into the Volvo Masters four weeks ago, so to even be talking about it now -- no, I have a lot of work to do.  I'm happy with where I am.  I've played nicely and I'm here for the weekend, so four out of four is not too bad, so, it's okay.
