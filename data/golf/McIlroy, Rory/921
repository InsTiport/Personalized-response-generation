   RORY McILROY: It feels good. It's a great position to be in. I stayed really patient out there today. I was really, really happy with the way I stuck to my game plan and it paid off in the end.  
  
  Q. That's the thing that struck me today was the confidence that you displayed, at least on the outside. I presume you were somewhat calm on the inside?  
 RORY McILROY: A little bit, yeah. I've been saying it all week, I feel comfortable, comfortable with my game, comfortable with the way I've prepared, and all of a sudden I'm finally feeling comfortable on this golf course. A combination like that, you know, you're going to feel pretty good and post some good numbers.
