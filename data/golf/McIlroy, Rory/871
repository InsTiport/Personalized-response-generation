 Q. An eventful week for a number of reasons, give us your thoughts on the week as a whole. 
 RORY McILROY: To be honest I'm glad to be done. It was a struggle. I basically played 70 holes of this tournament not at 100 percent, so it was always going to be tough. Still, some good play out there the last few days, birdied the last, so nice to come off with a positive each day.
 Yeah, looking forward to a couple of weeks off, and you know, get rested up and get ready for the end of the season. 

 Q. And the wrist? 
 RORY McILROY: It's fine. To be honest, the swelling in the tendon went down. The pronator muscle is still a little sore, and going up into the medial ligament up into the inside of the elbow, so just a little bit of rest. 

 Q. You clearly love the 18th, but you won't be sad to see the back end of the third. 
 RORY McILROY: No, I won't. Has not been a great hole for me this week. Yeah, I mean, I made triple there today again which wasn't nice. 

 Q. Off the tees --
 RORY McILROY: The whole scores, I didn't feel even though I played a couple of practice rounds, I felt funny sort of -- funny course off the tee for me. The bunkers are in fantastic position, but I felt as if I drove the ball pretty well. I drove the ball well, but I think today I missed on 13, only hitting 3-iron off the tee and missed the green, silly, stupid mistakes like that. 

 Q. How long was the drive on the last? 
 RORY McILROY: I'm not sure. I hit 8-iron in from 152. 

 Q. Will you be going house hunting now? 
 RORY McILROY: No, actually. I'm actually going to go to Cincinnati for a few days. I hear it's nice there this time of year (laughter).

 Q. Any thoughts on The Race to Dubai? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, pretty much Luke's got that wrapped up, or looks like he's got it wrapped up. You know, he doesn't seem to -- he just keeps grinding out every week. 
 So I'm going to -- yeah, I'm going to try and finish as high up on that as possible, and there's still a few events left that I want to try and do well in. 

 Q. China? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, obviously HSBC in China is a big one. You know, the Dubai World Championship, Hong Kong is always a nice event for me, I really like, Switzerland, Dunhill Links. There's still a few events that I really want to do well in.

 Q. Overall, your major season? 
 RORY McILROY: Looking back at the results, with the win, obviously the win was great but 15th at Augusta and 25th at The Open and then 66th here I think, so it's been -- the first half, the first 2 1/2 majors were -- I was right in there, and just one bad day on the Saturday at The Open really cost just been unfortunate.
 I feel comfortable in these events, and the win this year in the U.S. Open will give me a lot of confidence going into them next year again.

 Q. Any thoughts on this being your -- I think this will be your last event in America this year; correct? You wouldn't be coming to Tiger's tournament, right? 
 RORY McILROY: No, it's on the same weekend as the Hong Kong Open, so I'm committed to playing that. 
 Yeah, it's the last event. Yeah, it will be awhile until I play back over here again, probably the Match Play in Arizona. So hopefully by that time I'll find myself a place in Florida and be comfortable over here enough to play more events.

 Q. Is the house hunting put off till after the season now then? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, there was no point in going down there for a couple of days and rushing around and trying to pick something. I'll see how it is, maybe rent something down there for a while and choose the area that I would like to live and go from there.

 Q. Said on Thursday that there's another six or seven months until the next major, when do you start thinking about the Masters and the buildup to that?
 RORY McILROY: You know, I'll play the rest of the season and try and do well and try and finish up The Race to Dubai as high as possible, and I'll think about it during Christmas and the off-season and try and get ready for it, basically from January to April.

 Q. You mentioned this was a funny course. Is there something about it that would explain the funny --
 RORY McILROY: Maybe. I think the course has changed so much in ten years that experience can't really come into it, course knowledge. 
 The course, I didn't play ten years ago, but it's much different than it was whenever David Toms won it and Phil Mickelson is defending. Yeah, it's basically a new course for everyone. That's probably why a few of the guys that are up there -- but the guys, I watched some of the coverage yesterday and I thought Jason Dufner played awesome golf on the way in. I thought Keegan Bradley did really well after starting with double. Brendan Steele did well the whole way through. If those guys can keep it going today, it will be an exciting finish.

 Q. After going through these majors, what do you think you have to do to have more Sundays like you had at Congressional and fewer like you had here?
 RORY McILROY: It would be nice to go in with an eight-shot lead on Sunday. Just get myself in position. You know, I led by four going into the final day of the Masters, and led by eight going into the U.S. Open, so there has been a few positives from the majors this year, and one win, it's nice to get my major campaign started and get one under my belt early.

 Q. You may have been asked about this, but No. 6 played over a hundred yards shorter today. Did you drive the green?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I actually hit it to 12 feet with a 3-wood. 
 It's a great risk/reward hole. You know, you can lay it up and take your chances with a wedge, or you can risk putting it in the water right, or miss it in the water left; a miss in the bunker right is not a guaranteed up-and-down either.

 Q. Can you recall playing a hole shorter by that much, over a hundred yards?
 RORY McILROY: I think 13 was shortened by a good bit yesterday as well.

 Q. What will you do for the wrist this week? 
 RORY McILROY: I'll be in regular contact with Stephen McGregor and tell him how it's feeling. Yeah, just basically play it by ear. It's definitely not as painful as it was, but it seems like the pain went a little further up my arm and more into the inside of my elbow and pronator muscle.
