Q. All season you talked about keeping things in perspective.  Is that a key for you?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I think so.  It's definitely not a golf course or a golf tournament where you can go chasing.  And, yeah, I have to -- it's -- even though I'm still a few off the lead, it's a wonderful opportunity for me to go out there and I guess try to add to my major tally.
I've been very pleased with how I've played all week.  I felt for the most part today I did the right things.  And I need to do 18 more holes of that, but just get a little bit more out of the round tomorrow than I did today.  I'm expecting the conditions to be similar, but I could see the course just getting a little firmer and a little faster and just being a touch trickier.
Q. They say you can't chase here, but do you have to look at those first seven holes, and feel I've got to have a crack?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, but you don't -- you can't put yourself under pressure to have a crack at those holes, either.  You've just got to let it happen.  There's going to be a few decisions to be made.  I would expect the pin to be at the back of the green.  Do you have a crack at that?  Do you not?  I'm still going to have to play the holes pretty much the same.
But whether you can take that aim and try to get it -- it will really just depends.  Those first seven holes you can get some momentum going and you can play them in 3- or 4-under, and that's where the real meat of the golf course starts.
I'm going to take it as it comes.  Yes, I'd love to play those holes in a few under and get myself right in the thick of things, but I can't put myself under pressure to do that because it's just -- you've just got to let it happen.
Q. What would you say to golf fans that say the course is playing too easy?
RORY MCILROY: Come play it yourself (laughter).
Q. What's been the biggest challenge of the golf course, what have you found the most interesting to take on, and which things have you done really well and which things have you found more difficult?
RORY MCILROY: I think the greens are so small, and when it gets a little firm like this and they start to tuck pins in little corners, it's angles, it's all angles.  You're trying to think and move ahead.  It's a little bit like chess where you're crossing paths, going from the third green to the fourth tee and seeing a group tee off 17 and watching their balls land on the right side and kicking in.  You have to anticipate what your ball is going to do along the ground, as well.
It just takes a little bit of concentration because there's some shots where you need to land the ball ten yards short of the pin and some holes, like back into the wind, it might only be three or four yards.
But you can't go firing at pins because you're going to one-hop it over the back all day.  It's playing to the front edge of the greens.  Hitting the right trajectory, so the ball does what you think it's going to do when it hits the ground, basically.
