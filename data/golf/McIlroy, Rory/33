Q. Just some general comments about the round and how you're feeling heading into the weekend.
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, didn't quite have it like I had yesterday, but I felt like the course was a little trickier this afternoon than we had it yesterday morning. The wind was swirling a little bit. Greens were getting a little firmer. I feel like I could have went a little lower, but still right there going into the weekend. I know what it feels like to go low out here, so I'll need a couple of good ones over the weekend. But the game feels in decent shape, and obviously get out early tomorrow and try to get back in the mix.
Q. You're obviously in the midst of another great season. Are you able to kind of ride that wave? I know every week is a new start, and as well as you're playing right now there's got to be a comfort level that translates into relaxing on the course?
RORY MCILROY: Yeah, I think so, and I think just the environment that we're playing in creates a bit more of a relaxed environment anyway, which is a nice thing going into the weekend in contention. You can sort of just let it go a little bit. But yeah, I've been playing well. The last two weeks I went to places that I wasn't very familiar with, so I played okay, but back to a course that I know a little bit better and feel like I can compete a little bit better on. I'm excited for the next two days.
