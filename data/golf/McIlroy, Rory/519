 Q.  You are expected by these fans to deliver your point.  You know it's not that easy.  Describe the satisfaction in doing just that.  RORY McILROY: Obviously very satisfying.  I knew Paul wanted to play me up the order.  I was very comfortable with that.  I knew what was expected of me and I knew what I expected of myself.  I was probably more up for this day than I was the first two.  I was just so up for it, there was no option other than to win. I played my best golf of the week.  I mean, I started so well, 6-under through six holes.  That built a comfortable lead that I was able to hang on to.   Q.  Inspiring golf.  How big a rush do you get?  RORY McILROY: It's great.  All week has just been a pleasure to play in front of unbelievable crowds and fans.  We don't get to experience it too often.  It's one every four years, a home Ryder Cup for us.  It's been an amazing experience.  I'm just going to go now and cheer on the rest of the boys and hopefully we can bring this thing home.
