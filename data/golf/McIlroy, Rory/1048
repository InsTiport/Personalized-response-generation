 Q. Is that a fair reflection of how you played? 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, probably is. I struggled yesterday, big time, and turned a 76 or 77 into a 72, so I didn't play myself out of it. 
 And then today, I gave myself a lot more chances. I worked hard at the range last night and was swinging it really good and hit a lot of good shots. 70 out there after noon was a pretty good score. 

 Q. I know you felt for a while your swing has not been quite on song, but today the first day it felt better on the course?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely, I was starting to trust it a lot more. On the range yesterday, before I went out, it was really good, but then actually taking it from the range to the course is a little different, and I just wasn't trusting it and committing to it yesterday. But I committed to all of my shots today, and I hit a lot of better ones.

 Q. How was the wind this afternoon? 
 RORY McILROY: It was okay. Probably took a couple of wrong clubs off tees. But apart from that, it was okay. You've just got to trust it again, just look up, because when you're in the trees, it feels completely different than when you get up above the trees. 
 So you've just got to go with where you know it is and just trust it.

 Q. Feeling a bit more confident and playing well, but going into the weekend, what are the prospects you think coming from a few back?
 RORY McILROY: You realise that you have to look at, I'm only four behind second place, and so if I can go out tomorrow, it's a tough start out here, and maybe get a couple under through the first six or seven holes, that's a really good start and go from there. 
 You know, I think it's very tricky to score well on this golf course. I think it's very hard to go really low, and hopefully tomorrow, if I can go out all guns blazing, try and do that.
