 Q. Fantastic round. Not a lot of people going low in the afternoon. 
 RORY McILROY: You know, I got it up-and-down a few times when I really needed to to keep myself at a couple under, and then was able to birdie a few holes coming in, and that was really the difference. I made a good up and -- I chipped in for birdie on 15, which looked like I was going to do well just to make par, and then up-and-downed it on 16 and up-and-downed it on 1, up-and-downed it on 18, as well. So there was a few up-and-downs that kept me going, and I was able to find a few birdies near the end.

 Q. Do you feel like you're in a good position going into tomorrow to build on this?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely. I always prefer a late-early tee time because if you shoot a good score on the first day, you don't have much time to really turn around and you're straight back out on the golf course. 
 Hopefully I can just keep it going, and yeah, just -- the conditions are perfect out there. You can't really get it much better. Hopefully I can play as well as I did today and shoot another good one tomorrow.

 Q. Talk to me about No. 9. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I knew that the lead was 6, and I hit a good putt. I read it straight, and Gary was coming from the complete opposite side to me, and his putt broke right, so I didn't think mine would break the other way. It just sort of -- it lacked a little bit of speed, but I hit the putt that I wanted to, it just didn't go in. But I'll take 66 on the first day.

 Q. Does this place remind you of Quail Hollow? 
 RORY McILROY: A little bit. You know, the fairways are probably a little more generous here, but yeah -- and the rough this year is obviously thicker because of all the rain they've had. But visually it does look a little bit like Quail, and the greens are very similar. They're undulating and they're fast, and you've got to really put your ball in the right positions.

 Q. Does that give you some confidence?
 RORY McILROY: A little bit. I love golf courses the likes of here, Quail Hollow, Akron, where we play the WGC, golf courses that are tree-lined and give you a little bit of definition off the tee. I like golf courses like that and I seem to play well on them.

 Q. Anything changed from last week to this week?
 RORY McILROY: Not really. It's about 30 degrees warmer (laughing). But last week was very tough. I found it very difficult to score on that golf course at Wentworth. The winning score was 6-under par. I thought at the start of the week if you shot four rounds in the 60s, four 69s, you were going to be in with a great chance. This course is probably giving up a few more birdies. As long as you give yourself opportunities you have a good chance to shoot a low number.

 Q. Fatigue a factor at all?
 RORY McILROY: No, not at all. I've been sleeping great. Last night was the only night that I felt a little tired. But you know, woke up pretty early this morning and felt fresh going out there this afternoon. 

 Q. You've finished in the top 10 here before. What would it mean to kind of wrap this thing up?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it would be fantastic. You know, there's 54 holes to go, and there's a long way, but I feel as if I am playing good enough to get myself in the hunt come Sunday. As I said, go out there tomorrow morning and post another good number and hopefully set myself up for a good weekend.
