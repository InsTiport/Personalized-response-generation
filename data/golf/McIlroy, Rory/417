 Q.  67, bogey-free, what pleased you most about today?  
RORY McILROY: I thought it was good.  I felt like my game came together a lot more on our back nine, which is the front nine of this course.  I felt like it was okay.  I was sort of trying to find my rhythm a little bit for the first few holes and then I actually made a good par save on 18 which gave me some momentum going into the front nine.  I hit a lot of quality shots on the front nine and gave myself a lot of looks and held some putts.   
Overall, pretty pleased about everything today.   
 Q.  The first birdie at 11, you started on 10, not quite on the green in three but a very nice chip.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was.  It's nice that you can get some sort of scraggly lies around the greens here, so we're playing lift, clean and place and able to place the ball.  Helps get a good contact on it and that one went in.   
 Q.  A lot of good iron shots and some putts that just missed.  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a few putts that just missed.  But still, putts like that, they are still good putts.  Maybe lack a little bit of pace but for the most part I felt like my putting was a lot better than it has been.   
 Q.  And doing the Phil Mickelson impression here --  
RORY McILROY: I couldn't do much with that.  Got myself out of position on 18 but to make a par on 18 gave me a little bit of momentum going into the front nine.   
 Q.  Any expectations coming into today?  
RORY McILROY: I feel like I've been hitting the ball well in practise and I've been putting a bit better.  Just a matter of trying to take what I've been seeing in practise out on to the course and for the most part today I did that.  I said to JP after I held this one on three, probably the longest putt I've held in about four months.   
So it was nice to see a few putts go in like that.  Definitely gives me some confidence going into the next three days.   
 Q.  And two shots into the heart of the green at 4?  
RORY McILROY: Two lovely shots into the middle of the green and again, give it a good run.  It's still a good putt that only missed on the low side.  So I think one of the keys to this golf course is trying to take advantage of those par 5s and did that for the most part today.   
 Q.  Do you ever start with a number in mind when you tee off?  
RORY McILROY: Not really, I don't start with a number in mind.  I think you really have to see how the course is playing, how the conditions are, where the pin positions are and go from there.   
But I feel like if you play well on this course, you've got the five par 5s and you've got some other holes that you can pick up shots on.   
I think you're looking at something in the 68 or 67 range before you even go out to play.   
 Q.  Golfing-wise in Rory's to-do list, what's right at the top?  
RORY McILROY: In my game?   
 Q.  In what you want to achieve right now.  
RORY McILROY: I guess coming into these three weeks, it's about trying to win The Race to Dubai.  I'd like to win a tournament first and foremost, try and get another win under my belt this year.   
It would be nice to go to Dubai with another win under my belt, so whether it's this week or in China next week, I feel like I've set myself up for a good three days to have a run at it this week.   
 Q.  How important is it for you to be the European No. 1?  
RORY McILROY: It's very important.  I've done it twice before and it's always been a huge thrill and Dubai has been a very good place for me throughout my career.  It would be great to go to Dubai and win The Race to Dubai again.  It would be another great achievement to putt on my C.V.   
 Q.  And from the sublime to ridiculous, playing golf today, 67, very good.  What about cooking last night?  
RORY McILROY: It was okay.  We had a lot of help from our sous chefs.  So Charl and I have looked better before, that's for sure.  Both came in our sort of checked shirts and the chef hats and didn't really pull it off.  But the food was okay.  I feel like Charl's tasted a little better than mine did but I got the win in the end.   
 Q.  Before we let you go, what would be the go to, cannot possibly miss about Rory dish you could serve up?  
RORY McILROY: Poached eggs on toast.
