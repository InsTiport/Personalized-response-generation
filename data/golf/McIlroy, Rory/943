 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 RORY McILROY: It's always good playing with my dad and playing with Lee and Johann, as well, it was nice. And obviously the weather was great. 
 I got off to a great start, 3-under through three and just made a couple of bad mistakes and I don't know if that was just mental or whatever. But I hit a couple of good shots out there.
 Overall it wasn't too bad. I'm going to St. Andrews tomorrow where I feel as if I can shoot a good score.

 Q. The crowd reception was fantastic. 
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it was fantastic. Everyone was saying well done last week. It was great. It's great to get that sort of reception. 

 Q. Tomorrow night Northern Ireland are playing against Italy?
 RORY McILROY: Yes. 

 Q. What do you expect? 
 RORY McILROY: I expect a very tough game. I know we are at home, but it's going to be -- it's going to be extremely tough. But I think Northern Ireland would be very happy with the draw. 

 Q. Have you talked to the Molinari brothers about the game? 
 RORY McILROY: No, I haven't, actually. I haven't really -- I saw them last night for dinner but haven't really spoken to them about it.

 Q. Do you hope your performance can inspire your national team?
 RORY McILROY: I hope so. With two northern Irish guys doing pretty well in The Ryder Cup team last week, I feel that can inspire a few of the boys to go pretty well in the pitch, as well. 

 Q. And your personal prediction? 
 RORY McILROY: If I know the way Northern Ireland play, I'll say nil-nil draw. 

 Q. Talk us through those couple of early birdies?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, I hit 7-iron at the second about 25 feet beyond the hole and held that. 
 And then I hit a driver and an 8-iron to it 12 feet at the third. 
 And then --

 Q. How far was the 8-iron? 
 RORY McILROY: 191 yards. It was straight downwind. And then I birdied the 9th, hit a driver and a 4-iron just to the right of the green. Chipped it up to six feet. Birdied 12. I hit a driver and a 3-iron and a pitching wedge to about 15 feet just short of the feel. 
 15, I just hit it just a little too far right of the pin. It caught the slope and came back down into the hazard and I chipped it up to six feet and didn't make it. Then hit a driver and 5-iron on to the green on 16 and 2-putted.

 Q. How much do you feel the difference between playing stroke play back against match play last week?
 RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's a little different, definitely. You're playing the man in match play and today you're just out there -- it's very enjoyable out there. This format isn't really like a normal tournament, anyway, because I'm playing with my dad, and it's sort of -- it's great fun.
