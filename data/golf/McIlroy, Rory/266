RORY McILROY: Very happy.  I think anything around even par today is going to be a great score.   
I got off to a good start, which I think is important today.  The back nine is playing really, really difficult.  So to birdie three of the first six and give myself that little bit of a cushion to play with was nice.  I made some key up-and-downs on the start of the back nine.  To be in after two days and be under-par for this championship after the way I started, I'm ecstatic with that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, huge.  They're the putts that haven't quite been going in over the past few weeks.  That's all it takes to keep a round going, and to see those putts go in on 10 and 11 gives me a lot of confidence going into the weekend.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, even the six holes that I played them in what, eight shots better than I played them yesterday.  But I hit some quality shots out there.  I saw a lot of better iron shots.  I saw some really good putts going in.  So, yeah, there was a lot of quality out there and I was happy to see that.  Just have to try to keep that going for the next two days.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's not as if I went through war out there.  It was just a round of golf.  I just stay patient.   
Yeah, it was good.  I was very proud of myself that I hung in there and tried to stay as positive as I possibly could.  But, look, I just had to turn it around.  I had to find a couple of little key thoughts, and I feel like I have.  And I went with those today and it worked.  I'll try to keep those in my head going forward the next couple of days.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, just a little -- yeah, a couple of little mental thoughts, a couple little keys that I tell myself before I step in to hit a shot or step in to hit a putt.  A couple of little things.  Very simple, but obviously quite effective over the past 27 holes.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: He does.  He does do it quite often, it's just whether it penetrates my head is a different thing.  But he does.  He's great.  He tries to keep me as positive as he possibly can.  And sometimes I get down on myself.  We've been together for nine years now, I guess.  He knows me pretty well.  And he knows what to say out there and what not to say.  And he definitely said the right thing yesterday when I needed it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, sort of.  I think when the wind is this strong you just have to go with it.  It's so hard to work against it.  Yeah, I was trying to keep the ball down a little bit.  The 12th hole today was playing 162 yards and I hit a 5-iron and it came up short.  That's how windy it is out there.  It's tough to pick a club and commit to it.   
But then in the crosswinds it's okay.  I feel like, without sounding too much like a sponsorship plug, the new golf ball I am playing, the TaylorMade golf ball is great in the side winds and it holds its line better.  It's easier to trust that whenever I am facing a shot with a mid iron with a heavy crosswind.  At least I know if I strike this way, it's not going to deviate too much.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, in a way.  I set myself a target of being in a better position today than I was yesterday.  I finished the round 1-over.  I wanted to be at least level-par or under-par if possible for the championship.  And I've been able to achieve that goal that I set myself.  They're both huge rounds for very different reasons.  But this was definitely the round that got me back into the championship.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I mean, it's not really much.  It's more about creating a picture in my head and being very clear with how my visualization is.  I felt like that wasn't very good the first few holes yesterday.  So just a lot of that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I thought that was Lee speaking Spanish (laughter).   
Probably -- that stretch, 10, 11, 12, just to keep the momentum going and keep the round going, they were all huge.  I don't think any one was more important than the other, but all three together were massive.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, when you see a shot like the one I hit into 6, that does give you a lot of confidence.  The long iron I hit into the 17th.  I guess it's almost like a validation that when you hole putts like that this is really good, you're fighting for it and you're mentally where you need to be.  I don't think it gives you confidence but almost more satisfaction.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I guess the spectator signage to where to go, they've bolted those into the ground and they needed to get an Allen key to remove it.  They wouldn't give me a drop.  I actually had an embedded ball there.  Every other week we get relief from.  But because we're playing with the R&A rules this week, we don't get relief from an embedded ball, so a double whammy.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, go back.  Have a bit of lunch, put the feet up.  I'll watch a little bit of the golf.  But I've battled enough and I've thought about golf enough today that I don't really need to see those guys out there.  But I'll keep an eye on the leaderboard.  I'm happy to be in the clubhouse and happy to be on a good score.
