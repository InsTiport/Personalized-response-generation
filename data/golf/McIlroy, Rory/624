 Q.   A first round of victory for Rory.   You said earlier this week you feel good about your game, your start to the season, you've been working hard on things.   How would you assess today's play?   
RORY McILROY:   Today was good for the first sort of 11 or 12 holes, which is good.   Then I went 4‑up through 11 and I got a little complacent, I think.   Lost a little bit of concentration.   I probably went a couple of holes further than I should have.   
Just getting through to the next round is what this tournament is all about, and I've been able to do that.  
   
 Q.   What is the most difficult part?   As you hope to be here throughout the week, you've had success in the past here.   You said not getting complacent, but still trying to rest and ultimately win?  
RORY McILROY:   It's a long week, especially the deeper you go in the tournament.   It's all about just trying to beat that guy that's in front of you.   I've got a tough opponent in Harris English tomorrow.   I think you have to prepare yourself for that mentally.   You are going out there and you have to play really well.   Not really care what he does, but just play well.   If you do that, you have a good chance.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?   
RORY McILROY:   I mean, this place hasn't been kind to G‑Mac.   He's went home a lot on the Wednesday and played well, actually.   It's not as if he's playing badly.   It's sort of maybe one that he deserves something like this to happen to him, because he's a great match player.   He's done well, won the Volvo Match Play in Europe last year.   He's a good player.   
It's one of these, especially this course, the last few holes are tough.   Even if you can squeeze a birdie or two out of the last three holes, they're tough pars.   Tricky pin positions.   
I was 4‑up through 11, then all of a sudden I'm 2‑up standing on 16th tee.   I'm thinking I just want to get this over and done with.   You don't want to go down those last two holes.   Lucky enough for me, Boo missed a three or four footer.  
   
 Q.   We're going to be here tomorrow morning with only 32 guys left.   Good memories here?  
RORY McILROY:   I was going home last year after not playing very well, but, yeah, I got to the final.   The first year I got beat by the eventual winner Geoff Ogilvy.   I mean, I played well against him, five or six under par.  
It's the nature of this format.   You either play well and go home or you can sort of scrape by.   As I said, it's all about just getting through to the next round.  
   
 Q.   Were you okay with keeping this format the way it is, no stroke play?  
RORY McILROY:   I'm easy.   They can have stroke play qualifying and match play or they can keep it the way it is.   It's all good with me.   
Wherever they want to play it, I'll be, and whatever format they want to play it in, I'll play.  
   
 Q.   You come here understanding you can leave disappointing when you haven't even played poor?  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, exactly.   It's fine.   If you've shot 5 or 6 under par today and you're going home, you should be confident and be positive on your game.   You've played well.   It should give you a bit of confidence knowing that going into the next few weeks.
