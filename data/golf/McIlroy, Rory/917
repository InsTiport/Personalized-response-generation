 Q. First time in the 60s on this golf course. Did you start to figure it out pretty fast?
 RORY MCILROY: I wouldn't say that. I think that Augusta National, it takes years and years of figuring out and they make tiny little adjustments here and there, but I feel a lot more comfortable on the golf course this year than I did the previous couple of years, which is great. And it showed in the way I played today. I played some really good golf out there. 

 Q. After missing the cut last year, how good does it feel to put down a round like this?
 RORY MCILROY: It's great. After the second round here last year it was probably the low point of the season for me. I went back home for a couple of weeks to sort of try and find my game again and won Charlotte whenever I did that. 
 And it's nice to come out here and shoot a really good round and get into the 60s and get that little monkey off my back and get go into the next three rounds in a positive frame of mind. 

 Q. You shot a 63 at the British last year, is there any nervousness or intimidation for Major play go on for you at this point?
 RORY MCILROY: No, I think that you're always going to be nervous teeing it up in a Major Championship. It's very natural and it's a good thing. It means that you want it. 
 But I feel like I'm sort of, I've practiced and I've prepared myself for this week. Everything that I've been doing for the last since I got the clubs out again after the new year on the 7th of January it's just been working towards Augusta. And it's paid off today and hopefully it can pay off for the next three. 

 Q. Was there any particular part of your game that's really clicking for you today?
 RORY MCILROY: I thought I drove the ball really good. Then, when you drive it well, you have a chance to give your self opportunities for birdies. 
 And I felt like I hit my irons really good, but I just stayed committed to the targets I was picking, I wasn't trying to get over aggressive, I was playing smart and really just trying to leave myself in the best possible place and I did a good job of that today. 

 Q. Were you surprised the greens were as receptive as they were?
 RORY MCILROY: Yeah, they were very receptive. You could feel them firming up a little bit as the wind started to pick up the last few holes for us. 
 But it was as nice as you're going to get it out there for Augusta. Receptive greens, not much wind. 
 I felt as if the pin positions today were quite generous. So you could get some irons shots quite close. There's a couple of holes, like 14 and 16, where they sort of fed into the pins if you got it in the right place. So there's some birdies to be made out there.
