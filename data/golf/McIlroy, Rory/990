 Q. In terms of the work that you've done to right the swing changes or the swing problems that you've had, you were full of confidence. In terms of that, how was the round in the perspective of getting back to where you were say two months ago?
 RORY McILROY: I feel as if I hit it pretty well. I hit a lot of good tee shots and hit a few good iron shots. As I said, the wind made it very tricky out there. Some of the times you were just trying to hit it to the middle of the greens and take your two-putts. But I was happy the way I played. As I said, I didn't take my chances on the par-5s, and I wanted to give myself pretty good birdie opportunities. But I'll take 74 going into tomorrow, and if I can get off to a good start, maybe get back to level par for the tournament after a few holes, then I'll be happy enough.
