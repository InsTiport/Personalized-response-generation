  Q. Would you like it to dry?  
 RORY McILROY: I would like it to get dry. I would like a little bit of cloud cover. Yeah. I mean, it's something we got to deal with because it is very much that time of year. You get so sweaty and stuff, your hands start to get on the grips. You struggle to really -- everything feels a little bit uncomfortable.   
 It's fine. Everyone has got to deal with it sooner or later. I'm just glad I got this afternoon round out of the way. I can hopefully go into tomorrow and make some more birdies.  
  
  Q. Are you a soccer fan?  
 RORY McILROY: Yes.  
  
  Q. What's the deal with the World Cup? Got to ask.  
 RORY McILROY: You know, obviously Northern Ireland, I'll be hopeful that they'll do okay. Not too good. I'd like one of the European teams to win, maybe Spain or something. I think Spain has got a very good chance. They've got a lot of good players and won the Euros.  
  
  Q. U.S.A. versus England, that's on Saturday. Any words of wisdom for either one of those teams?  
 RORY McILROY: Not really. I think, you know, all the practice is done by now. They want to get out and get at it. You know, England should beat the U.S., but England hasn't really -- the last couple of World Cups, I haven't got into them. It wouldn't be -- it wouldn't surprised me with an upset.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 RORY McILROY: When we go to Asia at the end of the year, Singapore, Malaysia and stuff, we can get it.
