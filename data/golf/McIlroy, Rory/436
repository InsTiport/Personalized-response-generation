 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I felt like I played good in parts.  Drove the ball pretty well again.  Maybe my iron play wasn't quite as good as it was yesterday and the greens that I did miss I wasn't very sharp around the greens.  You're going to do that, you're going to miss greens around here.  You're going to have to have more of a short game to be able to salvage par sometimes.  I wasn't quite able to do that today at points.  But there's still enough good stuff to give me encouragement and make me feel that I can shoot a low one tomorrow and get myself back into it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I don't know if it's rust or I just didn't putt well.  I don't really want to blame it on rust.  But I didn't putt as well as I would have liked.  So, yeah, maybe just work on that a little bit before I tee off tomorrow and it would be great to hole a few more putts, because I feel like I'm giving myself plenty of chances.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: No, not at all.  I feel like I've been very committed to the shots that I'm playing.  I've been nice and aggressive, making full and committed swings at it.   
So I don't think -- that was probably one of the most surprising things about yesterday is how quickly I got back into the mindset of tournament golf and being aggressive.  So that was a nice surprise in some ways.  That hasn't really been an issue, it's just being a bit more efficient, whenever you give yourself chances, take them, and be able to get it up and down when you put yourself out of position.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I think it's just the way that the golf course is.  I think it all levels out at the end of the week, these things even out over the course of time.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean I felt like I played better than what the score reflected.  A little bit annoyed.  I felt like I should have got that ball up and down on 7.  And then I had a great chance on 8 for birdie and didn't take that.  A couple of days in a row where I haven't finished the round of golf the way I wanted to.  I'm not annoyed, I don't feel that I should be annoyed, but just a little more disappointed with how I finished.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I always thought this course was -- it suited the longer hitters, and it does to some degree.  But I feel like there's a lot of ways to get around this golf course.  And Jordan showed that over the last couple of days.  He hasn't hit the ball miles, he hits it far enough, he's definitely above average in terms of length.  But he's the prime example of someone whose game is very efficient, when he gives himself chances.  Especially today he took them, and then when he got out of position he was able to get it up and down.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: I don't really know.  It's hard just coming off the golf course to really have an answer to that, it's not like I'm looking at them very closely all the way around, I'm just concentrating on what I'm doing.  Maybe ask me at the end of the week, I'll be able to give you a better answer.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I guess the short game that I have been practicing, the lies you can get here are very awkward and very different.  And I think it's got a little bit to do with that.  It's more the putting.  I feel like I was striking the ball well, I feel like I still am, I just had a couple of bad putts today, and I need to figure out how to do that and fix it for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How does your ankle feel?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it feels good.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I only noticed them on the last couple of holes.  It's cool.  Obviously this is a big area with Green Bay, it was cool to see them out here.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, the second shot on 18 was definitely a reaction to the second shot yesterday, not wanting to miss it right, especially with that right pin, just double crossed it.  Yeah, I was sort of in between clubs there, as well.  I was trying to cut a 3-iron.  Maybe should have hit a committed 4-iron and hit it in the middle of the green and taken four.
