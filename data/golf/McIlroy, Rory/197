  RORY McILROY: Probably some of my best golf Ive played here. Just wasn't meant to be. 

Q. How much more frustrating is that you got yourself in such a good position to win this tournament?
RORY McILROY: Look, it is, of course it's frustrating. But it's hard to take any positives from it right now, but at least I put myself in the position. That's all I wanted to do. The last four years I've had top‑10s, but I haven't been close enough to the lead. Today I got myself there. I didn't quite do enough. But, you know, come back again next year and try.

Q. You still leave here with the belief that you can come back here and very much win this tournament?
RORY McILROY: Oh, yeah, 100 percent. I've played in two final groups in the last seven years, I've had five top‑10s, I play this golf course well. I just haven't played it well enough at the right time. 

Q. Is there anything that you'll take that you'll examine from this that will hopefully serve you in the future?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, I mean, look, I can't give you a good answer to that right now, because I'm just off the 18th green. But I'll sit down and reflect over the next few days and see what I could have potentially done better. More whether it be mindset or‑‑ I don't know, I just‑‑ I just didn't quite have it today. I played some great golf yesterday. I just didn't continue that golf into today. 

Q. (No microphone.)
RORY McILROY: Yeah, a little bit. Just wasn't quite as trusting as I was the first few days. That made a big difference. 

Q. When you got a bit flat out there and it got flat, could you diagnose it, was it a case trying so hard to rectify it?
RORY McILROY: I was trying to hit good shots and good putts and anytime I felt like I hit a decent shot, I either left myself on the wrong side of the pin or gave myself a tricky one behind the hill. And then when I did get some opportunities I didn't take advantage of them. Yeah, tough day, but I'll be back. And hopefully I'll be better. 

Q. Was the putt on 2 really the one that will stick in your mind?
RORY McILROY: No, because the putt on 2, I still made birdie after where I was off the tee on 1. I would have taken 1‑under through 2. It was more giving that birdie back straight away on 3. And then obviously birdieing 4 was huge, and then giving it straight back on 5. It was like every time I took a step forward I took a step back on the next hole. And that ‑‑ I had a chance to maybe put a little more pressure on him than I did. I would say 3 and 5 are the ones that I look back on, and if I could have made pars there it could have been a different story. 

Q. You had so much confidence yesterday and last night, what was the difference today?
RORY McILROY: I don't know. I had a decent warm up. I had a bit of a shaky drive off the first, but it was a really good up and down for par. And I hit some good shots out there. It wasn't as if I just didn't‑‑ again, there's a lot of‑‑ I feel like momentum is a huge thing, especially in final rounds. You look at what Jordan and Rickie did. They got on a roll and I didn't. Patrick and I didn't at all. We were both around even par, and just sort of grinding out there. And it wasn't quite what we both had in mind. He just hung in there a little bit better than I did and got the job done. 

Q. Is it more pressure than you expected? You said you didn't feel like you'd have much pressure; was it?
RORY McILROY: I think when you're playing in the final group of a major there's always going to be pressure. But after I parred the first, that sort of settled me down. So it wasn't as if nerves got to me. I just didn't quite have it.
