 Q.   How was your round today, Chris?   
CHRIS STROUD:   It was a struggle.   It played very, very difficult this morning.   I wish I was on the other wave.   These guys have a huge advantage this afternoon.   The greens are soft.   It's playing easy.   We had wind, rain; it was awful.   
Anybody that played well in the morning was a bonus, because it played very difficult.   I didn't play well at all.   I hung in there, hit a lot of fairways.   Missed a lot of greens.   Chipped it okay.   Missed a bunch of short putts.   Almost hung in there, but I think I'm going to miss it; missed the cut by one.   
   
 Q.   You played well yesterday, but the weather‑‑  
CHRIS STROUD:   We finished in the dark on 18.   Missed a 4‑footer on the last hole.   For as poorly as I hit it, I scored pretty well.   I just kept missing short putts, and you can't do that out here.
