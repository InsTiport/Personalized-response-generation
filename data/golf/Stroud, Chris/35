Q.   13, if you could just take us through it. 
CHRIS STROUD:   13, 188 to the hole.   We were trying to land it 179 which is short of the ridge that goes away.   We can't see the bottom of the hole, so we're trying to get it just short of the ridge and into the wind and let it release over and the right‑to‑left wind into it. 
So we're playing a 184 shot, for us we call it flighted, so we're trying to keep it down.   I hit it exactly how far I wanted to, but I pushed it a little bit farther right than I wanted to.   The wind didn't touch it, came down just short of the ridge and we saw it disappear toward the hole off the hill.   And then we had all of our friends and family here, and they started going crazy, so we knew it was going to be pretty good. 
They were walking toward the green, and we could see them start standing up and they went crazy.   It was a good feeling.   It was a good feeling.

Q.   Did you ever see it go in? 
CHRIS STROUD:   No, we can't see it.   We could only see the top of the flag.   We just heard everybody getting louder and louder.   It is cool.   It is cool.   It's only my seventh hole in one, and you don't get to have many hole in ones very often.   Actually, it's my first hole in one on the PGA TOUR in regulation play.   How about that, but I have made a triple eagle.   I'm the only person in the world that has a triple eagle.
