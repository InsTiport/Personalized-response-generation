   CHRIS STROUD: Very solid. It was tough for us. The weather yesterday was strange. When the greens are rolling 13, I mean any wind over 10 miles an hour is going to be very difficult, but they've got the course in phenomenal shape and luckily got some great weather.  
  
  Q. You had a good chance for birdie there at the last hole. On greens this fast, do you tend to overread them when you miss or underread them?  
 CHRIS STROUD: No. You know, honestly, anything outside 15 feet for me, I'm always thinking about the speed anyway. I really hit a great putt there. I underread that one. But I really don't feel like I have any tendency, or most of us don't have a tendency. As long as the speed is pretty good, we're going to make a lot of putts.  
  
  Q. What's working best for you right now? The putter?  
 CHRIS STROUD: I'm trying to hit one shot at a time. Being here with the hometown crowd is awesome, really have a good vibe off the family and friends, and the weather is going to be great. I'm really looking forward to a good week this week.  
  
  Q. Chris, I've given you a hard time about this before, your trademark was kind of the flop hat, the wide brim hat. You're not wearing that anymore. Is there a reason?  
 CHRIS STROUD: I could have pulled it out. I don't pull it out unless it's really sunny and no wind. I couldn't do it yesterday. I could have pulled --  
  
  Q. It would have blown away yesterday.  
 CHRIS STROUD: I don't -- you don't want to mess anything up. If you have your jacket on and shoot 8-under, keep it on. I think we've all learned this type of thing. I really didn't think about it.   
  
  Q. Don't change your hat if you're playing good golf.  
 CHRIS STROUD: Yes.  
  
  Q. Chris, good playing. Keep it up this week.  
 CHRIS STROUD: Thank you so much.
