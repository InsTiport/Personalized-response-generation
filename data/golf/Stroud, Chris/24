Q.   Chris, I thought you really hung tough out there.   You had a stumble at 16, but you respond and come right back with that birdie at 17.   That could have been an eagle on that pitch shot. 
CHRIS STROUD:   It really was.   I'm really proud of myself for hanging in there.   I told myself let's finish this off strong and see if we can make two birdies and get out of here.   On 16, it was one of the best drives of the day.   The wind turned just into us when I hit.   Right where I was trying to clear was about 285, 280, it was right on my number to carry.   I thought it was fine, but it fell out of the air a little bit and hit the rock.   Maybe a foot or two longer and it might have been a birdie. 
It's okay.   I've got a whole other day tomorrow.   I didn't drive it well today.

Q.   Still within driving distance.   The attack plan for Sunday? 
CHRIS STROUD:   Same thing as today.   Get the ball on the fairway first, get myself more chances.   I didn't put the ball very close to the hole.   Now the pins were very difficult today.   I think that's why‑‑ I don't know.   I haven't looked closely.   But there were probably not many low scores today.   I thought the pins were very difficult.   That's why nobody ran away with it.   I know Billy's playing well.   Hopefully tomorrow I'll give myself some chances for birdie.   Get inside 10, 15 feet and make some birdies tomorrow.
