Q.   Good day out there.   You're in good position heading into the weekend. 
CHRIS STROUD:   Yeah, pretty solid.   I left a few out there.   But it's a pretty short course, a lot of wedges.   I missed a few more fairways today.   But if you hit the fairways out here, you can make a lot of birdies.   Obviously, you've got to make the putts too.   But I left a few out there.   I'm in good position, that's all I can ask for.

Q.   It's an interesting course.   There is a lot of strategy that goes into a course like this with such tight fairways.   There are some holes that are shorter than others, but it's not a course that you can necessarily overpower, even though it's shorter than this. 
CHRIS STROUD:   Right.   Even though the yardage shows that it's that short, because the fairways are so soft, it's still not playing that short.   I mean, there are a lot of short holes, some of the long holes are downhill, a lot of wedges, but when the fairways are this soft, it plays 200, 300, 400 yards longer.   But it's enjoyable. 
You can ask anybody out here.   You miss a fairway, you're going to have a hard time make a par.   It's a great test of golf.   The greens are actually nice and firm.   Put some nice pins out there today.   But Keegan's setting a good pace out there.   And I believe that's where the number's going to be.   4‑under, 5‑under a day is where the pace is going to be.   I'm going to do my best to see if I can get up to about 20 for the week.

Q.   This your first trip out this way? 
CHRIS STROUD:   It is.   I got in two years ago and didn't come here, but I'm happy I came.   My wife and I came for the first time.   It was an easy trip.   Felt it wasn't too bad.   I adjusted pretty well.   I'm used to this nice, hot, humid, Houston weather, so I'm used to it.
