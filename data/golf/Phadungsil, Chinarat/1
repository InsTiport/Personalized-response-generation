  Q.  Must be pleased with your start in the opening round here?   
 CHINARAT PHADUNGSIL:  I am happy with my result but my putting has been very poor today. I could have produced a better score but for instance at hole number 12, I missed a three foot putt and I then three putted the 17th hole.   
  
  Q.  The conditions were tough out there. But you seem to be consistent throughout?   
 CHINARAT PHADUNGSIL:  My putting was poor so I knew I had to be spot on with my driving and second shot. Fairway to green was my plan and I kept to it.   
  
  Q.  It has been a really cold week so far. How do you cope with the weather?   
 CHINARAT PHADUNGSIL:  I do a half hour warm up in the locker room which is not my normal routine, even at cold conditions. It can get really cold in the mornings here and I can't even hit the ball at the range sometimes because of the fog. So I warm up inside. But once I'm out there on course, I am fully focused on the game.   
  
  Q.  Your last event was at the Volvo Masters of Asia last year. How did you spend your break since?   
 CHINARAT PHADUNGSIL:  I have been playing golf with my parents. My mom (Noo) and dad (Anan) are both single handicappers so playing with them help keep my game in check. My dad also gives me tips about course management every single time we play together so that helps the mental aspect of my game on how to tackle a golf course.   
  
  Q.  Your thoughts heading into the second round?   
 CHINARAT PHADUNGSIL:  I will just stick to what I've been doing today. I hope that my putting will improve so I can produce a better score but I am definitely pleased with my current position.
