 Q.  Jerry Kelly joining us for a few minutes (inaudible.) 
 JERRY KELLY:  I think the wind was a little easier today.  I think the direction changed about a quarter and that made some of the tougher holes a little more cross-wind than they were into the wind.  So it gave you a few more easier par opportunities and then more birdie opportunities.  But they can stick the pins in some tough spots on these greens, and put the tees back farther than they have.  They can get in trouble doing that, too, but this course is plenty tough enough and plenty good when the wind blows and they cut the pins. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  I had mud on the right side of the ball, trying to hit kind of a cut shot, and I hit it very good, very hard, and the mud was still on there when I had my chip, but I was just off the green with a very easy chip shot and I just misplayed my chip. 
 I got a little worried that it was going to release down grain, and as we saw on some of these downhill putts, you still have to hit them, and that's the same thing with the chipping, as well. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  Yeah, well, I played well at Tampa and Honda, but I didn't really get as many birdies as I would like, and my missed shots were pretty bad.  I have cleaned up some of my missed shots to where they are just off the green, and my good shots, I am giving myself good birdie opportunities, and I feel like I am rolling it better. 
 So it's one of those timing things, when things start coming together and you start gaining more confidence.  Last week was kind of a tough deal.  It's the first time I have ever had my coach out, and I overthunk everything, so -- overthunk?  Overthought.  I misremembered that word. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I keep on going back, you put me on an island, I am going to be a happy guy.  I just love having water around me.  We went down to Old San Juan yesterday, ate at Al Dente and visited Balmoral -- is that the castle -- is that the -- yeah, that was fantastic.  You know, my son, Cooper, was playing on the cannons, and, you know, we were having a good time out there. 
 And I think I know how I have to be in a good frame of mind to play well.  I have played well sparingly, not being in a good frame, but I play fairly well consistently when I am in a good frame, so it's nice to come to an island. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  Well, it's difficult.  I mean, I missed a few short putts, but made some longer ones, too.  Sometimes the longer ones, you know, you can give them a good run, so if you don't have the side hills, which will really take the ball hard on the side hills, that grain.  If you have got a fairly flat run at it, you can hit it pretty hard and have it hold its line.  They are rolling beautifully, they are just very slow and very grainy. 
 And it's tough to hit some downhill shorter putts as firm as you really need to hold the line.  You try to crawl them down there and they are going to fall off line.  But we are not used to hitting downhill putts this firm. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  Yeah.  I think -- I will be fairly confident going forward.  Anytime you shoot two consistent rounds, striking it good, putting was good, you know, there is always going to be things to clean up, but I felt like I was in control of my game, where a lot of times I am kind of flailing at it a little bit and reacting.  I think I held my finish more than I ever have. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  That's a good question.  You have got to be -- you are playing a game.  You got to have fun playing a game, even if you are missing the putts and you are missing the hole, you are not hitting it the way you want, you got to have fun, but it's a game.  And know that you can always make it with the next shot, so it's tough when you are at the end of the 18th hole, then you have to be excited about coming back the next day and playing well.  But you are always going to have those days, so don't get too disappointed, there is always tomorrow. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 JERRY KELLY:  No, I didn't strike my drives as well as I like, didn't have a lie that I like on the fairway, I hit a decent shot up there and a decent bunker shot and I hit a really good putt. 
 You are going to play 10 holes like that and get 5 birdies, it wasn't perfect, perfect, perfect.  I played it, though.  I hit the last two putts exactly like that, downhill and -- really good putts.  (Inaudible) I definitely misremember all the time.
