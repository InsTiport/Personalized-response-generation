(First thing he did after finishing was hug his parents.)  
 Q.  How huge is this for you? 

 JERRY KELLY:  Wow, it's huge.  Still can't believe it.  First top-10 in a Major.  A long time coming. 

 It has put me in a different league.  Have you ever seen me let loose after that much pressure? 

 I've had so much trouble hitting my utility on the range.  I hit it four times today.  Hooked it on range.  Used it on 13.
