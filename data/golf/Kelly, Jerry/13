 Q.  Talk about your round.  You just go out hot and seemed like everything you did was by the pin.  
JERRY KELLY: I hit the ball really well today.  I've got both my trainer and my coach.  My coach, Jim Schuman, is playing in the tournament as well.  So he really helped me and got me squared away.   
It's a new/old move type thing and I just kept it up all day and felt really comfortable with it.  Shots were coming out where I wanted them to.  So fun round.   
 Q.  After you got to 5-under at 13 what happened after that?  Was it one of these you really wanted the round to end while you were still sitting at that point?  
JERRY KELLY: No, not even close.  I hit it close a couple more times.  We just happened to have a 540-yard par-4.  Pretty good par, I thought.   
18th hole is a tough drive.  I knocked it right in the middle.  Kind of misjudged the wind a little bit.  Thought it would play under 150.  It was 157, and probably played right on the number.  No, I was hitting it good enough.   
Man, I ran out of holes.  No lie.  That's the way you think.  (Laughter).   
 Q.  The par you saved on 15, was that the chip shot after it had rolled back down a little bit?  
JERRY KELLY: Yeah, shots on 10 and 15 were great.  Putts on 9 and 18 not so great.  But I felt very comfortable.  And there's a long way to go.   
 Q.  How were you able to manage the wind?  
JERRY KELLY: You know, every time we guessed, we guessed right.  That's pretty much what it was.  It's a calculated guess, just like hitting it out of the rough; you just don't know what you're going to get until you hit it.  And today the guesses were right.  So there it goes.
