Q. For a 65, some things don't change.  Jerry Kelly playing good in Hawaii and the Packers in the playoffs.
JERRY KELLY: You know, it feels so good to be back here.  I love it so much.  First win came here, and it's just a ton of great feelings, and people are so nice.
The swing's been working great.  Jimmy Schuman has really got me swinging it better than I have.  Can't stop the gyrations, but it's better at impact.
Q. Nice finish there, birdie at 17 and 18, what was going right for you today?
JERRY KELLY: I kept the ball in play.  If I missed a green, it was pretty much a fringe.  I had the putter in my hand most of the day.  Didn't get deep in the rough to give myself too tough of looks coming into the greens.  Just missed a few short ones and didn't capitalize on No. 9.  Other than that, just played very solid.
Q. Packers win their first game, headed to Arizona this week.  What do you think?
JERRY KELLY: Well, Arizona should be a little overconfident since the last game we played them, but something happened with our line last week, and it shored up.  We had a rookie in there, and after that first safety, Aaron wasn't on his back.  So you keep Aaron upright and we're going to have a fighting chance.
