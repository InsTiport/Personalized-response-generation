Q.   Any thoughts?   There was a lot of guys up there to start the day.   How pleased were you with what you were able to do?
JERRY KELLY:   Starting with a bogey, I was happy the way I came back, showed some good mental fortitude in there.   It's something I've been lacking in recent years.   I tried to get myself to relax a little bit, work my way through the rest of my career and enjoy it, and that's what I'm going to try and do. 

Q.   It seems like this is the place for you.   It's another year where you're right there at the top. 
JERRY KELLY:   I love it here.   The people are great, course is fantastic, and the hotel is great, food, can't beat it.

Q.   It's kind of a funny thing about Hawai'i, people start to adopt you.   Did you start to feel that?
JERRY KELLY:   I did, even before I won here.   That's one of the reasons I won here, and I appreciate the people of Hawai'i so much, the way they've taken me in.   I respect the place, and that helps me get along well. 

Q.   Do you feel like you'll always be coming out here as long as they'll have you?
JERRY KELLY:   Absolutely, as long as they'll have me.   I'll be on crutches and a wheelchair and still be playing oneâ€‘handed on the side.
