  Q. Just talk a little bit about the round today, your overall impression.   
 JERRY KELLY: I didn't strike it quite as cleanly. I was definitely off a few fairways where I shouldn't have been, and I was off a few greens because of that. And then I had a real hard time with the speed of the putts today. You know, the greens were much tougher in the afternoon. We knew that was going to happen. I'm glad I got off to a good start yesterday. I'm pretty disappointed I didn't have any birdies today. But you know, it's a tough golf course, and I hung in there mentally and that's all I can ask for.  
  
  Q. Same thing for tomorrow?  
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah, same game plan. I've just got to get the ball in the fairway number one and then I can work on the shot into the green, then I can work on making the putt. It's clichÃ©, but that's what it is in major golf.
