  Q. Talk about the conditions during the day and how that was a factor.   
 JERRY KELLY: It hasn't changed that much yet because it's still pretty humid. The sun isn't out. So it hasn't really firmed up and been really sped up quite yet.   
 So I don't know what it's going to do this afternoon, the wind is definitely swirling, it's gusty, but very manageable. So it's set up to score today, there's no question about it. I think they were very kind thinking there might be some heavy wind and some tough conditions coming in. So but I think that's as easy as you're going to see Augusta, which is not easy.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 JERRY KELLY: Tees are very generous. But I think that they have done that thinking that the weather's coming. They were nice today.   
  
  Q. The same thoughts coming in this week as you did coming in last year?  
 JERRY KELLY: I'm a much better player now than I was then. It's just a matter of playing golf. Just letting go, I'm just, I just got a brain cramp on three or four shots and those are the ones that cost me, so. I'm playing fine, as long as I keep it in the fairway.  
  
  Q. The scores are not terribly low considering that the course is set up fairly easily. Is the wind still playing a factor in that?  
 JERRY KELLY: You got to understand what easy is.   
  
  Q. It's relative?  
 JERRY KELLY: We're at Augusta, you know, so there's nothing easy about an easy setup. I said it's as easy as we're going to see. And I said that it's still not easy. So be smart when you print that so that everyone understands. There's nothing easy about Augusta, but they set it up nicely.   
  
  Q. So is 72 pretty good then for you?  
 JERRY KELLY: Not for the way I hit it, but I'll have to take it and come back tomorrow.
