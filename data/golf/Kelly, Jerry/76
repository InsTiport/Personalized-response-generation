   JERRY KELLY: You know, I felt so good, but it's a feel that I found on Monday. Jimmy saw it for the first time Tuesday night for 15 minutes. Loved it. Wednesday I played with it. I didn't hit it great on Wednesday, but the feel was so good.   
 I come here and, you know, you're trying to hit really shots, real pressure. Something was going a little bit haywire and it was different a couple different times.  
 I think I saw both sides of whatever the heck I was doing, like overcompensating, and you know, at times it was great. You know, over there on 4, just driver, 3-iron dead into the wind to about eight feet and made it.  
 I think I started putting better on the back. You know, I haven't been here in a few years. You know going from that putting green over there to the golf course, it's so fast. Just came out here and it's slower. I left my first putt probably six, seven feet short.   
 I know that, you know? (Laughter.) But I've been gone for a few years. You know, I made some great par saves and good birdies coming in. I made some awful bogeys. A 3-iron layup hole and I make bogey, 3-putt on the first hole.  
 You know, it was -- I'm ready. I mean, I usually start fast here. I usually like to stay, oh, 5-, 7-under, something like that to get the ball rolling.   
 But I haven't finished that well here except for the one time I went to the playoff my rookie year.
