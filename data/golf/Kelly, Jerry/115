JERRY KELLY:  I've had trouble with the majors, and this is definitely a Major-style golf course, so for me to hit 17 greens the first day and 17 greens the last day, you know, I put myself in the top spot on the green on 17, and then 18 I just hit a bad shot.  It was the only green I missed all day.  Those are tough holes coming in.  You don't expect to make pars all the time, but I played my heart out.
Q.  We wrote off anybody below 5 yesterday, but you gave it a run.  Did you think you might actually have a chance?
JERRY KELLY:  What I knew is if they didn't get a quick start, and I got a quick start, I could always just keep piling up the birdies.

You're much better off a little bit back in the pack because of the spike marks on the greens.  I've always thought there was a 9, 10-under out there, which is an amazing thing on this golf course, but fairways and greens, fairways and greens, but the pins lend themselves.  You've got some back, got some front.  You can spin some back and access those tough pins out there sometimes.
Q.  What's the most exciting thing you're going to do in the off season?
JERRY KELLY:  Most exciting?  Boy, I'm going to be so boring, but it's going to be exciting.  How about that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JERRY KELLY:  No, Jim Weathers has got me a massage therapist, has totally got me to where I've got some range of motion.  I can bring my hand up here, so it's totally all right.  It's manageable.  I'm waking up ten times as usual during the night when I move, but it hasn't been painful to move at night.  That's the first time in ten months.  I'm going to see him in the off season and have him work on me some more.  It's really promising.
