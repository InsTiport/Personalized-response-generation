Q. Your day with Steve, you said you had to be flawless and you had to be aggressive; obviously that wasn't exactly what happened, but you gave it a good shot?
JERRY KELLY: I hit much better shots.  I was playing much better today, but I couldn't make anything today.  That's just coming down the stretch is exactly -- you know, you just can't do that.  He still played very steady, made some great up-and-downs.  He put himself in some tough spots at times where I got excited, like all right, here we go, and he got it up-and-down every time and up and in one time.  You do that, it's tough to catch.  I had to make a run of birdies, and I just didn't do it.
Q. When you had the birdie and he made the bogey and the lead got to five, what was in your mind at that point?
JERRY KELLY: Yeah, I mean, birdie as many as I can.  That's all I can do.  Just hit aggressive shots.  I mis-hit the next one and ended up against the fringe, and then I thought I hit a really good shot on the next hole, landed into the hill and it still bounced over it and I had an impossible putt, and I lipped out on the next two.
Q. Competitors, it's hard for them to understand that you've got two runners up in a row at the Senior Open.  That's not what you're playing for, but still, that's pretty darned good.
JERRY KELLY: Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm always going to be disappointed and want to come back for more.  That's what drives me to the next week.  It will just make me work that much harder on my week off, and I'll be ready to play next week.
