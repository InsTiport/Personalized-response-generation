 Q. You got a couple back there on the back nine after struggling at the start. 
 JERRY KELLY: Start of the back nine. It started to become easy for me again on the front side, and then all of a sudden I tried to hit a cut with a 9-iron, got underneath it, got underneath the next 8-iron and just I couldn't get out of it.
 So all of a sudden I went to having a good swing to absolutely struggling. So straight not range again. It still wasn't great on the front side but I was getting it around very comfortably. I didn't expect three bogeys. I mean those were three really terrible bogeys. I was in great position on all of them, and then to miss that short one for eagle; I didn't do very well today.

 Q. What do you think you have to shoot tomorrow to have a realistic chance at this? 
 JERRY KELLY: I don't know. 

 Q. Four, five? 
 JERRY KELLY: Well, I really don't care what I have to shoot. I just want to shoot -- I don't care. I could put a number it. Put a number on them, go ahead. Shoot as low as I can, that's what I try to do every day. If I shoot for -- if I say I'm going to go for a 64 and I'm ten it under, do you want me to make a few bogeys to shoot 64 or what? I'm going to play as hard as I can just the way do I every single time, whatever score I get.

 Q. Do you think you have a chance?
 JERRY KELLY: Absolutely. I was seven back starting Sunday when I won the Western, seven back when I went into a playoff with Loren Roberts.
