Q.   Talk about your round today. 
JERRY KELLY:   It's nice to get some birdies under my belt.   I struck the ball really well today.   Didn't go too good on the last hole.   I thought I was in, apparently it was down.   It had a couple shifts of wind, but not enough to miss it that bad.   It just got away from me. 

Q.   46 years old, still grinding out here, this is I think your 16th time in this golf tournament, what kind of goals have you set for your self this year?
JERRY KELLY:   You still just got to win a golf tournament.   That's No. 1.   That's what we're out here to do.   I'm not out here to just grind along, I'm out here to give myself every chance that I can to win a golf tournament, because that's really all that matters out here.

Q.   A lot of publicity about players who change clubs, shafts.   Anything different in your bag this year?
JERRY KELLY:   Not really.   Cleveland has been so good to me over the years, I've been with them since my rookie year, so I had my chances to chase it, but I've always kind of wanted to stay in the family with them. 
It's a great company and I enjoy it.

Q.   Well good start, good luck the rest of the week. 
JERRY KELLY:   Thank you.
