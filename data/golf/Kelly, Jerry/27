 Q.  How did you get it up and down from there?  
JERRY KELLY: Brendan showed me how fast it was going up that hill.  I would have hit it the same speed he did, I thought he hit it the perfect speed.  It looks like it's such a steep hill, but it's still on a downhill.  It was faster than we both thought and I got to see his.   
 Q.  You started the day 7 shots back, do you think you've played your way into contention?  
JERRY KELLY: Yeah.  I don't know how many shots I am, but 7 shots, I won the Western Open 7 shots back.  I know it can be done.  I was a hair younger then, just a little.  Anybody can play the perfect round at any time.  It would take something fantastic from me.  I wouldn't count myself out.  But there's some great players out there.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to be able to contend at your age?  
JERRY KELLY: I love it.  I love having conversations with the young players and having them rib me like I like to rib them.  Jordan is a heck of a lot of fun to go back and forth with.  We've had a great time.   
I think I've gained some of the respect in the last few years.  I had a few down years and I was working on some things and had some injuries.  And I've come back real strong for my age.  I'm happy with what I'm doing.  I'd always like to do more, everybody would.  But I just like the fact that I want to scrap it up with those guys a little bit.  I've got to get up with them a lot more.  It's fun.   
 Q.  What do they say to you when they rib you?  
JERRY KELLY: Old man.  Grecian formula.  No play for Mr. Gray.  Yeah, there's a lot of them out there.   
 Q.  What do you say to them?  
JERRY KELLY: Change your diapers when it gets wet and you should be in good shape.
