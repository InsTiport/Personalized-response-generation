  Q. Nice run you put on there at the end.   
 JERRY KELLY: Well, no, I just had Stricker in my sights up there. I wanted to catch him, but that's all right. I knew we weren't gonna be able to play together whether I got 10 or 11.   
 I figured I just wanted to get close to him.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
JERRY KELLY: Absolutely. It's fun to do that. When I go out first, I try to tell him, I'm gonna put a number on the board for you to chase. He certainly put a number up there on the board to chase today.   
 That's the kind of thing we have fun doing.   
  
  Q. Was something just clicking in the stretch there on the back?   
 JERRY KELLY: No, I been hitting it really well and just wiggling the putts by. I started hitting it so close that I wasn't really missing them. Then I got a few of the 10-, 12-footers to go in.   
 I hit it pretty close all week. Been happy with my swing. Just started to leave me there in the last. Started to get tired, so I gotta go work it out real quick and make sure I got it for 36 tomorrow. I'm pretty tired.   
  
  Q. What's your feeling on 36?  
 JERRY KELLY: I'm in good shape. I'm in good shape. I'm not worried about that at all. It's just a matter of staying in it mentally the whole time. You stay in it mentally and you'll stay in it physically. The mental is what usually what drains your physical, so...
