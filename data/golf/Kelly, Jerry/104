  Q.  Talk about your tough finish?   

 JERRY KELLY:  Hit three great shots at 17 and then tried to jam a putt in there (about a six-footer) I wasn't striking it that well all day.   

 I did birdie number 13 and number 15.   
  
  Q.  On still being within range of the leaders.   

 JERRY KELLY:  That doesn't matter to me.  I'd love to get four or five shots back, but you don't get them back.
