JERRY KELLY:  I never even had to go look at it from underneath the hole.  I knew I was going to make that one for some reason.  I was thinking about giving him that one, but I saw a big old heel print in his line, so I couldn't.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
JERRY KELLY:  No, we both hit decent shots.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
JERRY KELLY:  No, I would have done actually the same.  You've got to putt the hole to win the match.  I clearly expected to putt the one on 17, which was a foot and a half.  This was about the same distance.

He's a good friend, we had a good match.  He putted with his 3â€‘wood off the green, but other than that he hit every fairway and every green.  And me, I probably missed three greens and a fairway or two.

So it was a really steady match for both of us.  We both could have made a lot more birdies, and neither of us did.
Q.  Stroke play tournament, you guys are going to play video games tonight?
JERRY KELLY:  Exactly, unbelievable.
