JERRY KELLY:   That putt I left 18 feet short and 3-putted.  If I had birdied the last two, I would have a chance to win this thing.  Campbell was 16, if I finished 13, maybe 14, he can certainly make two bogeys coming down the stretch.  So whatever Campbell is doing, I could have beat him.  So, bottom line, that's why I'm pretty mad.
Q.  Did you think that putt was going to run more or did you just not hit it the way you wanted to?
JERRY KELLY:   I thought I hit a perfect putt.  I was trying to trickle it down there and play the break.  Should have hit it hard.  You know, I wanted the next one, but I always play for past the hole so I can see the break on the way by it.  And to hit it that short after actually hitting it pretty close to the way I thought  -- that's the way it's been on these greens all week.  I was into the grain coming down that hill the first section and it fell off after that.  Now I'm caught up in the second section and down in the first section.
Q.  Talk about 17.
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, I was going for farther left.  I knew the bunker was fine.  It just didn't need to end up exactly where it did.  It's just  -- I don't care if  -- inaudible -- that was buried.
Q.  Ryder Cup points?
JERRY KELLY:   Wanted to win.  If I win, takes care of the points.
