  Q.  About the round.   

 JERRY KELLY:  The cold didn't get me.  I prepared.  The people from the north can handle the cold.  (He had hand warmers.)   

Came out on the putting green, it was dead at about 15.  It was totally different than the greens on the course.  It took three shots right away.  That hurts the scores   

 The course is taking them from you (shots).   

 You are right next to the pin and you find yourself 50 feet.  It's a one mile per hour difference.  It was extremely fair out there.  If you hit it in the right spot, it would stop.  It was not unfair.  It was good, solid, Major conditions.  It was tough.  When the wind's blowing, it just has to be perfect.  There's no margin.  The course is in perfect shape.  I was just focused on the golf course.  I cut myself some slack.  I just went through my routine.  There's an even par score out there.
