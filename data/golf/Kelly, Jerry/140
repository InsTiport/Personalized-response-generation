JERRY KELLY:  Really just a lower 4-iron.  Got it up in the air and it wasn't going to get there.  Just a little right of the pin.  Released just perfectly into the hole.  I mean, it rolled like a putt so it was kind of fun.

Q.  Did you see the it the whole way? 
JERRY KELLY:   We were watching the crowd.  It was great.  You could see him crouching and then all of the sudden all of the arms went up in the air and I think that one went in.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
JERRY KELLY:   I saw that.  I'm a board watcher.  I know exactly what he was doing.  It was a little disheartening, but you still knew that you had 16, 17, 18 to play.  You could make up two shots on every single one of those holes with birdies. 
David and I just couldn't get the birdies to drop, especially, I mean, we let the par  5 get away, we both could reach and things like that. 
We didn't do our best, but boy, we tried our hardest.

Q.  How strong is Vijay's play, given how the course is playing?
JERRY KELLY:   10 and 11, that's pretty  -- and to be 2-under on 10 and 11 in one day, that's just  -- oh, I was, too, sorry.  Just kidding.
That's great play though.  Great play though, especially when he knew we were coming closer and it looked like he had it in neutral for a while.  He knew that he had to do something and he did so that's what makes it impressive.

Q.  How many of those aces were on the PGA TOUR?
JERRY KELLY:   Just three out of eight.
