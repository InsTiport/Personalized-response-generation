Q.
How do you like the position you're in right now?

JERRY KELLY:  I don't see any boards on this golf course so I don't know.  I saw Tiger at 8 finished, so I knew that was probably the number to get to, but it's a struggle out there.  That was tough playing.  Two out of the three first starting holes were the toughest holes we've played all year probably.
Q.  Was this course tougher today than TPC was yesterday?

JERRY KELLY:  Well, starting out, if that wind would have stayed the way it was at the beginning of the day all day with the coolness it had, it would have been definitely tougher than yesterday because you still can't miss fairways out here, the rough is so deep.

It was a little more consistent all day yesterday.  It calmed down on us on like the 13th hole, something like that, so it wasn't benign out there, but it wasn't blowing as hard as it was earlier, and that cold weather makes the ball go pretty short.
Q.  Usually when you're two strokes back going into the weekend -- (inaudible).  Is it different to see that Tiger is on top?

JERRY KELLY:  It doesn't matter who's on top.  You go in and play your game.  I know it's cliche, but that's what you do.  I'm not playing against Tiger, I'm playing against myself basically.  You know, who knows what's going to show up for either of us on the weekend.

There's plenty of guys out there.  When the scores are bunched up anybody can come from anywhere out here, and if it's going to be calm you have to go low.
Q.  (Inaudible).

JERRY KELLY:  Eight shots, absolutely.  You know, if the wind picks up, he shoots a couple under, you shoot 8 under, you're right there.  We've seen it time and time again, there's no safe lead going into Sunday.  We can shoot whatever it takes at times.
