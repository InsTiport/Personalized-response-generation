 Q.  Coming down the stretch there, after the second shot on 18 were you more relieved you didn't have to make another full swing or were you happier that the ball was in there inside five feet?  JERRY KELLY: Just get me off the golf course.  Just -- I only get one day off.  It's going to be tough.  Something has to settle down.   Q.  When you're standing over the second shot on 18, did you kind of know where you stood in relation to the top seven?  JERRY KELLY: I knew exactly where I stood.  I actually was kind of pausing on the putt for par on 17, waiting to see where I stood.  I saw 70 and I'm like --   Q.  Was there much debate between hitting the draw or the cut, even though the cut hurts about three or four times more than trying to hit a drive?  JERRY KELLY: I had to hit a cut.  It was such a perfect number.  And I missed it so well that it landed into that upslope and just kind of trickled up there.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.
