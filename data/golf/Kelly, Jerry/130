 Q.  How nervous were you guys?  Everybody talks about first-timers, how nervous they were.
 
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Hitting the tee ball I was pretty nervous, but other than that on the first tee, you know what, I was into the game.  We were trying to win.  You know, it was just one of those things.  Today, you know, it sounds repetitive but the bounces didn't go our way and it went their way.  It's one of those things.  Vijay made a 60-footer on the first hole and that kind of set the tone for the day.  Not that we got down, we where are grinding and going.  Just one of those things. 


Q.  Well, it's early in the week.

JERRY KELLY:  It's real early in the week.  We'll be back.  I want him as a partner still, and I think he'll have me. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yes, we will be back as partners and we'll be doing a different end of this conversation, I can promise you.
