Q.   Jerry, 16 of 18 greens, but it was that 49â€‘foot putt that I'm going to remember on the 12th green. 
JERRY KELLY:   Oh, me too.   I was actually kind of walking that one in and I stopped and did my normal routine.   I should have just kept walking and knew it was going in.

Q.   Yeah, it was really a spectacular putt on a difficult hole.   The whole day I thought you did a good job controlling your golf game and flighting the golf ball. 
JERRY KELLY:   I felt pretty solid.   The last two days were some of the worst I've hit the ball in a while.   I've been working on some good things and just lost sight.   After two weeks off, lost sight of some body movements and really thought about it last night without a club in my hand, and picked up right where I left off before today.   So it was kind of like get rid of those last two days, get the good thoughts flowing, the good feel, and it felt great other than that drive on 17.

Q.   It was strange watching you hit tee balls because it looked like you were finishing trying to hit a draw with a high right shoulder, and you'd have painful expressions on your face.   I thought, oh, he lost one, and by and large, the draws were okay. 
JERRY KELLY:   You haven't watched me very long, have you?   Me, Vijay and Fred Funk, man.   That's what my caddie, Eric always says when he's caddying with guys.   Oh, that's right, and don't worry, it will land in the fairway. 
No, I'm painful because I'm 47 and it hurts.

Q.   You get some fresh greens in the morning. 
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, I'm excited.   I'm putting well, and I feel really good there.   Just got to tighten up the drives.   The drives were the ones that I was just caught behind consistently off the tee.   Had to catch up, and it just wasn't that pretty.
