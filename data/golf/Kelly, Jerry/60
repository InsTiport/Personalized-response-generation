  Q. A hole-in-one on 4 today. Could you see it?  
 JERRY KELLY: Absolutely. I want everyone to know when I made the hole-in-one at Riviera you were in my group, but you were in the bathroom.  
  
  Q. You made a hole-in-one on the same hole twice on the PGA TOUR, same hole?  
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah. Same club, too. Hole-in-one then I chipped in the next hole, and then knocked it about six inches the next hole. I was 5-under and hadn't made a putt yet.  
  
  Q. You're in the middle of a pretty tough stretch. You get to go back to The Masters next year, no matter what happens. Obviously you love this place. You played here before, and you're defending next week, how are you pacing yourself?  
 JERRY KELLY: I am pacing myself. I really did a good job of staying loose and not doing too much this week. This in-between week right here I played nine holes and didn't hit many balls on Tuesday. I was actually out here for almost three hours with the short game on Monday, so that paid off, but didn't take a full swing at all. That was hard. Wednesday I played the Pro Am and probably hit six balls after. I definitely thought about next week and pacing myself this week. I need to work this afternoon a little bit. I was very loose out there. It's different.  
  
  Q. I heard Eric say it should have been nine. Is that a reasonable assessment?  
 JERRY KELLY: It should have.   
  
  Q. Could have been nine, I misquoted him.   
 JERRY KELLY: I didn't make any of the ones -- I hit it within 10 feet probably four or five times and didn't make any of them. You make a hole-in-one and you chip one in, those things kind of even out in golf. And I still feel like there's plenty of them out there for me. I feel really good.
