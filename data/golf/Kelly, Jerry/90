  Q. 6-under par out there today, I mean, I know you had to feed off Matthew Goggin a little bit, but, holy cow.   
 JERRY KELLY: We were having fun today together. We both hit the ball real well. I was only in trouble in a couple of holes and that was after -- really a couple of shoots too, which this course can do to you.   
 So just a solid ball-striking day. And I putted pretty well. I got a talking to from Carol, you know, so she straightened me out.  
  
  Q. It's a lot of help when the wife goes, sit down, I need to talk to you, and the player goes, I know I'm in trouble now.   
 JERRY KELLY: Absolutely. I was put in the corner a little bit.   
  
  Q. The wife gives you a timeout, you come out here and play really well. How fast are these greens?  
 JERRY KELLY: These greens are awesome. Very similar to Augusta, if not faster. Because they have got the same type of slopes. It's playing really fun out here. It's nice to be able to hit your line. If you're not, it's trouble.   
  
  Q. Which do you think is harder, hitting it in the fairway off the tee or that second shot into the green?  
 JERRY KELLY: The second shot into the green. There's just some of the widest fairways we play. And I think that's why Jack grew such incredible rough out here. Because if you hit it into the rough, you deserve to be penalized. And it is penal. I hit it in there once and I came out with a little hurt wrist. So I don't want to hit it in there anymore.
