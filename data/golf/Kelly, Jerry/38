Q.   Jerry, just tell me a little bit about that round you. 
JERRY KELLY:   I probably struck it better yesterday, but it was tough.   We caught the calm part of the day with an awful lot of mud out there.
I had balls moving 50, 60 yards sideways, so it was some good up‑and‑downs with actually some good strikes.   So it was tough.   That wind was blowing all day yesterday, and then unlucky with the mud this morning, and then we get the wind this afternoon.   So you know, it's one of those luck‑of‑the‑draw things.   We'll see how it blows this afternoon for these guys.

Q.   You mentioned it a little bit, but do you mind just expanding on what the course has been like for you?
JERRY KELLY:   I mean I like the golf course.   It's solid.   You gotta hit the ball in the fairway, and you know, they usually have some pretty good pins out here. 
Plays a little longer when it's wet, and then you just really have to pay attention to the mud.   I tried to hit some knock‑down drivers just to try and not get some mud on it.   So that ends up costing you a little bit because you don't hit your normal shot.
But you know, you gotta play it the way you see it.

Q.   It's been a good year for you so far.   You already have a Top 10 finish.   Tell me a little bit about how your game is feeling. 
JERRY KELLY:   My game feels pretty solid.   You know, I just get on a good feel and I over do something and I have to go back to square one.   So that's the nature of the game.   It's a pain in the ass.

Q.   Just one more thing.   Let me ask you, how are you liking Puerto Rico so far?
JERRY KELLY:   I enjoy Puerto Rico.   Met a couple of chefs, Lou and Mario, and I'm looking forward to getting to their restaurants down at San Juan.   It's just great food, great people.   I enjoy it.
