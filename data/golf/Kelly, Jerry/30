 Q.   Isn't that the poops to leave that short putt out there?   
JERRY KELLY:   That's all right.   As long as we're going in I don't have to sit here and play more shots.   It's one thing coming back for a putt.   I'm guessing with a little bit of the outlook and the weather that's coming, you know, we're probably going to play threesomes right away anyway.   So it's not going to be a big deal.   I get here two and a half hours before, so that's probably when I'm going to be hitting that putt.  
   
 Q.   You measured it, about three feet, give or take?   
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, give or take.   I mean, I know in my step where it was, so I'll put it back there.  
   
 Q.   You're around pretty good, not bad, huh?   
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, no, I hit the ball well, putted well.   I just got a little overcautious on the last hole and hit 3‑wood, and put myself out farther than I wanted to, and hit a bad lay‑up.   Then I had mud out of the rough and a tough next shot.   Good chip up there, so I've just got to putt well.  
   
 Q.   Your group played really well, didn't they?   
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, absolutely.   He's 10‑under.   I guarantee you he's going to chip that one in for par and go from there.
