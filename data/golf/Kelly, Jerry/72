 Q. 8:10?
 JERRY KELLY: I got two holes in and started really well, so actually was able to sleep well last night. 

 Q. Wasn't that great? Did you get a good break?
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah. If we would have played the next hole, the scoreboard would have been like parking lights on us, so it worked out pretty good. 

 Q. Clean card. You gotta be really pleased with the way you've played the last couple of weeks. 
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah. I'm striking the ball better than I ever have. 
 And the putter is coming back again, so I'm ready to go play some golf. 

 Q. Is the strategy here you gotta get the par-5s and then whatever else, kind of fill in from there, because you got them all?
 JERRY KELLY: The big thing is just hitting on the fairway so you can see your ball. 

 Q. How much different conditions this morning from when you guys played last night? Much at all?
 JERRY KELLY: Zero. No. It was exactly the same. 

 Q. Still good? Still soft?
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah. You can get after it. 

 Q. And you're going to get after it. Keep it up. 
 JERRY KELLY: Thanks.
