 Q. Guess you can't complain too much. It's a pretty good day for you?
 JERRY KELLY: No, I'm really happy. Very comfortable with the swing. It wasn't completely on. But it was helping me get in there and chipping it well. So birdies can be had out there. 
 It's still a tough golf course. That wind is blowing, and it can bite you.

 Q. I imagine there are a lot of guys who wish they could play every round in the morning, because it seems the easiest time to go on this course is before noon?
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah, we hit the wind I think it was right on 10. So we played nine holes in the wind. I don't know what they got to play yesterday in the wind. But it's a different style out there today. 
 There's a lot of clouds, so the greens aren't going to bake quite as bad as they did for us yesterday. And the five and a half hours it took us yesterday is not going to happen today either with some of the pins. We had a tough round yesterday. 

 Q. If the wind is down tomorrow, I was talking about the magical number. I heard it's about 20 under?
 JERRY KELLY: The wind is not down. So everybody who plays well the first two days is not going to play in the afternoon. And the wind is not going to be down. It's supposed to be 15 to 25 tomorrow. 
 So I would take 20 under and I would sit my butt right over there and watch everybody play, because I don't see that. 

 Q. It's been a long time since you picked up a trophy?
 JERRY KELLY: Yeah.

 Q. You're in position now. You've got to feel good about your chances going into the weekend?
 JERRY KELLY: I've put myself in this position a decent amount of times. I just, I haven't been comfortable enough with my game to be comfortable in this situation. 
 I feel a little more comfortable about my game, now let's see how comfortable I can be in this position.
