 Q. You're right there going into the weekend, just talk about your play today?
 JERRY KELLY: I felt like it was coming yesterday. Had a lot of chances. Hit the ball really well. It was a really tough day. So nice to come out here, a little more benign conditions, even though it's a tough golf course, and hit the shots. 

 Q. Key to the round today?
 JERRY KELLY: Just getting the ball rolling. I struggled on the back side, par, par, birdie. That's a good way to start. Just gets you into the round a little bit after you get through that little 10 and 11 gauntlet. Just felt good going forward. 

 Q. How about the putt on the last? 
 JERRY KELLY: It was just great. I'm really enjoying the way I'm playing. All I can do is go out there and try and get the job done. My body feels good finally. 

 Q. A couple 64s that matched the course record; was it a day made for scoring? 
 JERRY KELLY: You know, this is a great golf course. I love the quote from Harrington, it couldn't have been any better. He said, "You don't like this golf course, you're not good enough," because it is a great golf course. 
 The scores doesn't ever really surprise me but there are quite a few near that course record. The course gives you a decent amount, but it doesn't give you a ton. You've got to take advantage of the shorter ones, because the long ones are tough.
