 Q.   Bubble week.   You're in good position, 120 heading into the week.   How much of a factor is the Top 125 heading into a week like this?  
JERRY KELLY:   I know I have to compete this week, you know, I have to play well.   Could easily get past this week.   I want to be in the Playoffs, which if I do, I have to play well.  
   
 Q.   Is it looming in your mind, is it nagging or you just go out and do what you do every week and let it take care of itself?  
JERRY KELLY:   It's always right in front of my brain.   There's no way for me to put things like that out of my mind.   I've done well sometimes and poorly other times and, you know, I tend to put it on goals and things like that and sometimes it doesn't work out.   You know, when it comes down to it, you just got to perform.
