 Q.  Just comments on watching that last hole.  
JERRY KELLY: Yeah, I mean, that's a heck of a putt.  I didn't think Russell would leave it to that one.  He's been playing great the last couple years, and you know, it's cool to see him have such solid play.  I was happy to be in the mix again, and I'm really excited.  These last three I was so excited just to play because they're all really fun tournaments, and I'm really looking forward to the Deere, which is the closest tournament to my home now, and then Greensboro, which is one of my favorites of all time.  Rejuvenating, yes.  I'm ready to go.  It's fine.   
 Q.  You've earned your spot next year.  How does that make you feel?  
JERRY KELLY: I know, it better not be opposite anything.  But no, I'll be coming back.
