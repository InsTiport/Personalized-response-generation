 Q.   Good day for you, 66.   What went right for you?  
JERRY KELLY:   You know, I finally got the ball in the fairway.   That's my game, and I haven't been doing it all week.   Just trying to concentrate on staying stable on my tee shots, not trying to stretch it past the bunkers, just get them in between them.   
   
 Q.   You're going to be in pretty good position heading into the final round.   There will probably be a bunch of guys ahead of you, but just thoughts going into the final round on what you want to do?  
JERRY KELLY:   I mean, boy, the course is there.   If you get the ball in the fairway, the course is right there, just crisp iron shots, get the ball in the fairway, crisp iron shots, make putts.   That's it.  
   
 Q.   How important is it for you these first five or six events during the fall to kind of get off to a good start where you can secure your card for next year and do all that stuff, get it out of the way early?   
JERRY KELLY:   Yeah, it would be nice, but it's not a priority.   You know, it's a long year, as you know, and I've been improving.   I found something like Riviera last year, and I've been improving all year, and that's all that matters to me.   I keep getting better.   I'm getting older, so getting better is a good thing.   But I feel really good about the game.   It's not going to be there every day, but it's been there a lot more consistently than it has in my recent past.   
   
 Q.   And in terms of being relatively early in the season, nice to have a noâ€‘cut event where you know you're going to play four rounds and maybe get a little momentum or maybe if you're not playing well maybe find something in the third round or fourth round?  
JERRY KELLY:   Absolutely.   Tough travel on the old man, but they hand out those greenbacks for nothing, I'm coming.
