 Q.  Off to a good start again, 3-under today. 
 JERRY KELLY:  Yeah, I started off pretty calm, just a birdie thrown in there, but just missing birdies, missing birdies, and then I just got real loose with the swing, and boy, you get loose with the swing at this place and it jumps up and bites you.  I made a quick bogey and a double and kind of felt like I was reeling. 
 Then made a great save on 12 for par and then I righted the ship after that, went, birdie, birdie, eagle, par, birdie, so it's a nice little comeback. 

 Q.  When you've had the recent success you've had, you make a couple bad swings, you feel like you can right the ship a little easier than you normally would have because not only are you playing good golf but also the confidence level? 
 JERRY KELLY:  No doubt.  If I could just find some way to get back to what I was doing, the feel I had, just settling down and do what you're doing, that's great. 
 It's hard when you don't have anything good to draw on.  You don't know where center is.  I can bring it back to center pretty quick right now.
