  Q. 5-under par, nice clean card, great playing. Tell me about the round.   
 JERRY KELLY: Thanks. I started out hitting it fantastic, and really didn't hit it as well when the wind started swirling. I started having some questions whether I was going to cut this one or draw it. Just kind of got a little double-crossed on a few things. But I understand the feels, and I just like to be happy with the way I played.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about the next few weeks going into the Playoffs? What do you need to do this week to keep advancing?  
 JERRY KELLY: Well, I felt pretty good last Sunday. I looked at myself, and I was 33rd going into the final day and shot 5-under to get myself back inside that Top 30. You know, I know what I need to do, and that was kind of the start of it for me, and I'd like to just keep flowing from there.
