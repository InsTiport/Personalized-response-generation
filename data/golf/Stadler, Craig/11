  Q.  How did you feel it went out there for you today?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  About the same as every or day, really.  Except I made a few putts today.  Playing good.  Just threw up on myself coming in.  Which I pretty much have done every day.  So it's getting old.   
  
  Q.  Have you found that big a difference between the back nine and the front nine?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  No, not really.  Yesterday I 3-putted 16 coming in and today I bogeyed 15, 16, 17.   
 Hit it close on 18 and missed it, so, you know, just kind of go away with a bad taste in your mouth every day.   
  
  Q.  You're not enjoying this golf course at all?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  I played wonderfully today and was just real solid.  And then 15 and 16 I was in or 15, 16, I was in good position and just hit irons left.  Which I haven't done in weeks.   
 I fired it left on 15.  It was down there in what they call the bunker, but it's made of brick.  I made a good up-and-down for bogey there.   
 16, I just pulled a little 9-iron and missed the green and I was in somebody's footprint about that deep on the top of whatever it's called, bunker.  Couldn't get that one -- I was fortunate to get that one 25 feet.   
 And then pulled it again on 17.  Hit a good chip about four feet and missed the putt.   
 Then hit two good shots at 18 and missed it.
