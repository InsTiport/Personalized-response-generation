 Q.  Can you talk about the conditions? 
 CRAIG STADLER:  The greens were getting firm, but they're playable and puttable.  The course is in great shape, but you can almost see the greens getting lighter and firmer. 

 Q.  Regarding the game and his double on 16. 
 CRAIG STADLER:  I got tired of losing it to the right, so I made sure on 16 I didn't and I hit it straight. 
 I had two bad swings on 16 and 17, otherwise it was a pretty decent round. 
 The golf course gets harder and longer, but I don't get any younger. 
 I made some good putts and some good saves.  I just tried to go out and have a decent round.  Last year I actually hit it better and shot 77 and 78, so you never know.  It was nice to kind of hang in there. 

 Q.  Does it seem like 25 years since you last won here? 
 CRAIG STADLER:  Yeah, it does.  That was a long time ago.
