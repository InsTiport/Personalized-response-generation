  Q.  How did you think the course played today?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  It was all right.   
  
  Q.  Did the wind or anything seem to affect you a lot?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  On the back nine, of course it was our second nine.  But, yeah, it was there.  It wasn't easy.   
  
  Q.  How did that start, how did that, did that -- just tell us about the start this on 1 and 2.  You had the birdie and the eagle.   
 CRAIG STADLER:  Well, yeah, I hit it about 15 feet on 107 a then chipped in on 11 and gave it right back with a double on 12.  So easy come, easy go.   
  
  Q.  And how do you feel about going even for the round and finishing up the day pretty far up the leaderboard?   
 CRAIG STADLER:  It's all right.  I played probably played a couple under.  I gave away two or three shots that I shouldn't have.  But no complaints.  Got done with it.
