  THE MODERATOR: Next up on the podium will be Craig Stadler.CRAIG STADLER: I have no idea why I'm in here.Q. Obviously, it was a tougher day for you out there.  Can you take us through what were some of the struggles for you?CRAIG STADLER: Just to finish, you know.  Played the last three, four over par.  Hit three horrid iron shots.  But what Tom was saying, I did everything that I was supposed to do.  I drove the ball really good today, and I couldn't hit an iron to save my life. I think I missed three fairways, and I did not get anything over wedge on the green from the 13 fairways I hit or whatever, the 11 that I hit.  Just ridiculous with the irons. Finished the way I hit my irons all day, so sloppy.Q. More you than really the course is what you're saying?  You like the way the course is set up and playing?CRAIG STADLER: Yeah, it was set up good today.  I said I drove the ball really well, gave myself every chance to play well.  Just couldn't hit an iron on the golf course.Q. How do you think the hot weather -- you'll be playing in the afternoon tomorrow.  How that will change the course as well as maybe affect some of the players?CRAIG STADLER: I'm sure the afternoon will be a little faster than it was today.  Greens were fairly firm this morning.  I think it will be a little firmer in the afternoon.  But like everybody said, if you drive it in the fairway, it's very playable.  It's a good test, good solid, good long, good hard golf course.
