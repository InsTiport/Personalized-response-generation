  Q.  Talk about the course conditions?   

 CRAIG STADLER:  It was difficult.  I made a lot of saves.  Kind of hung in there.   

 The greens will get a little crusty this afternoon.   
  
  Q.  In reference to the 25 year anniversary since his win.   

 CRAIG STADLER:  It's good to play on the weekend.  My putter hasn't been good lately, but it's been good this week.
