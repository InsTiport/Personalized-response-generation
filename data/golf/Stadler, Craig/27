Q.  Craig, just a couple quick thoughts about the round today.
CRAIG STADLER:  Well, I drove it sideways three times on the front nine.  I had to chip out three times.  And then I just made no putts.  I made two putts all day.  That's about it.
Q.  Any way to assess the week?
CRAIG STADLER:  Yeah, it was a good week.  I got off, obviously to, a bad start today, having to chip out three times.

But I came back good and I put it in perfect position on 16, just totally misjudged my second shot or whatever, I should have had a very, relatively simple birdie there.  And if I make birdie there, then I'm right back in it.  But I made five and the week is shot.
