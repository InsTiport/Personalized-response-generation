 Q. How did your day go today?
 CRAIG STADLER: Good holes, bad holes. A lot of birdies. It was good, bad and ugly. A lot of good, a lot of bad, and a lot of ugly.

 Q. How was the course playing today?
 CRAIG STADLER: It was all right. It's wet, but it should be. 

 Q. About the same as yesterday, any better or worse? The course playing about the same as yesterday?
 CRAIG STADLER: Yeah pretty much. About the same. A little dryer, well, not really. Probably about the same. Tee to fairways are still a mess, but that's about it.
