Q.  Congratulations on your round.  A rough, shaky start, but you got it into red numbers at the end.  What went right for you today on the golf course?
CRAIG STADLER:  Well, I actually hit the ball well all day.  I just didn't make many putts the back side.  I had a lot of opportunities, finally made one on 7 coming in there.  Made a good about 10 footer, 8 footer.  But I played well today.  Drove the ball good.  Hit a lot of good iron shots.  I didn't get many putts into the hole, but that's all right.
Q.  Talking about that, when did you actually know that, hey, this is going to be my day.  When it started to turn, you say, hey, I I'm distinguishing going to put a low number on the board today, when did that come about to you?
CRAIG STADLER:  Pretty much never.  Getting off bogey, bogey.  I made two bogeys and as I said, I just hit a lot of good shots and didn't, you know, 2 under is a good score for openers, it's not a great score, but considering the way I started, I'm very happy with it and I didn't think it was going to be my day, I just thought I was hitting the ball good enough during the week to get it back from the start and that's what happened.
Q.  All golfers think that they could trim a couple shots here and there, was there any particular hole or shot that kind of stands out that you wish you had back?
CRAIG STADLER:  Second shot on 1.  On the first hole we played.  The second shot on 10 we had a little mishap there.  We had 20 yards off in yardage and hit a pretty good little shot in there and it was 20 yards over the green.  So it was a quick bogey for no reason.  But, you know, that happens every once in a while, not very often.
