Q. Great start with 69, 69.  You had to finish this morning.  Clearly you had the difficult conditions:  cold this morning and then kind of windy today as well.
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, since yesterday it's been tough; it's cold and windy, how you said.  That makes it hard to swing; you're tight.
So I just been trying to make pars and I found a couple birdies, so pretty happy with both rounds.
Q. Your a graduate of the Web.com Tour this year onto the PGA TOUR.  Got to be exciting to be in a good position heading into this fall wrap-around schedule?
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, I mean, it's good when you're playing the weekend.  Have two more rounds; hopefully they're good ones.  Try to finish as high as I can.
Q. Absolutely.  I visited your beautiful hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico, for the Lorena Ochoa Invitational.  How much of a role model has she been in your growth as a golfer?
CARLOS ORTIZ: She's been probably the person I looked up to as a professional as I want to become something like what she's become during the years.  It's going to be really hard to even come close.
If I can come halfway what she's done, I mean, it will be an amazing career.
