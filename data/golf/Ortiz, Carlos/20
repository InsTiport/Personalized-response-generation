Q.   Carlos, a little bit different round than your opener.   You got 2‑over very early in the round with the double bogey at 16th. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, obviously it was different starting yesterday.   I started a little slower.   I was doubting some of the tees and this golf course is doing that.   But I'm proud of myself, I got it back and finished under par, so that's good.   I'm still in the tournament.

Q.   Absolutely, you followed up that double with four birdies.   You posted 2‑under, 6‑under at the halfway mark.   You're still very much in contention here. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Oh, yeah, after that start, I'm pretty happy with my round.   I missed a couple putts coming in, but if I didn't make the weekend, I didn't have a chance to win, so I'm happy with my result.

Q.   Why doubt in your mind off the tees?   I thought you struck the ball very well in that opening round. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I don't know.   Same question my caddie asked, so I don't know.   I was very indecisive on the tees with the wind, but after 17 or after 16, I hit it really well.   I probably had a chance every single hole to make birdie.   Now I'm happy with my result today.

Q.   Did you club down off the tee again?   You didn't hit many drivers in the opening round. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I pretty much hit driver everywhere here.   When I keep doing the same thing, I'm hitting it great, and I just need to trust myself.
