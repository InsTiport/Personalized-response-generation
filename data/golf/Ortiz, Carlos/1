Q. Carlos, I want to keep my distance because you're red hot right now.  What a day.  You started eight shots back and now tied for the lead.  How excited are you?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I'm excited.  It was a good tournament.  I played great today, but it's just weird, golf is weird sometimes.  Probably today I didn't hit it the best.  I don't know, just somehow I just scored and made some good putts.
Q. Do you think there is a chance you can get in a playoff maybe?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I don't think so.  I think there is a lot of scoring holes coming in.  It's going to be hard.
I mean, I'm just proud the way I played.  At the end of the day, I did all I could today.  Pins are a little bit harder, so I think 7-under is a great score.  I just left myself too far back.
Q. Since the ZOZO Championship you haven't missed a cut.  This will be your second Top 10, second highest finish behind the win in Houston.  What have you found in your game that you discovered that you're really consistent of the week in and week out now?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I think it's more the way I'm thinking around the golf course.  Swinging the same honestly.  It's just being more patient.  I'm accepting more bad shots.  We hit some terrible shots and you can let them affect you, and I'm getting better that way.  It's easier playing when your mind is clear.
Q. What a day.  Could you have imagined where you would be at the top of the leaderboard this morning?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, I mean, I been playing great all week.  I been thinking it's a bit of an advantage on the back nine during the first three days, and finally today I think I did what I had to do.
I'm really happy the way I'm playing.  Really happy the way I finished the tournament, too.
Q. Is there something you've been working on, something you can you attribute to this?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   No.  Honestly, just trying to have fun.  I'm trying to, you know, let things go, don't let bad shots affect me.  I think I'm way clearer the way I'm thinking around the golf course.  I think that's reflecting on the score, too.
Q. Talk about the finish with the eagle then birdie, birdie on 17, 18.
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, eagle 15, par 16, and birdie 17, 18.  Yeah, and then that's where you really scored here on this golf course, starting on 13, and I did it great today.
Honestly, if I had done that yesterday or even on Friday I would have been right there.  Honestly I think I'm going to be a couple short, but I'm really proud the way I played.
