  Q. How would you assess your match?
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   I played great today.  I did what I had to do.  I put myself in position.  I didn't really concede any holes.  I just felt like I played really solid, and playing like that, I was going to be tough to beat.
 Q. Do you feel like -- this is your first appearance in this event if I'm not mistaken.  Did you feel a pressure to win this first match with it being pool play or do you kind of feel like the next couple days you could --
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   It's always nice.  We don't really play this format, so it's always nice to start with a win.  It gives you confidence.  Just one of those formats you have to stay in every shot.  You can't give any shots away, any holes away, and I think I did that pretty good.  I mean, it's just one of those formats you have to be aggressive at times and then just make sure you're in the hole every single time.
