  JOHN BUSH:   We'd like to welcome Carlos Ortiz into the interview room here at the Frys.com Open, recently named the Web.com TOUR Player of the Year.   First of all, congratulations on that honor.   We can get you to talk a little bit about what that meant to your career to win that award. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Thank you.   It's a great honor.   I'm really thankful to all my peers for voting me Player of the Year.   It's been a great year.   I had those three wins, so I couldn't ask any more, and I'm excited to be back this week on the PGA TOUR.
JOHN BUSH:   Tell us what the fans can expect to see, what type of game you'll bring to the plate this year. 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I think I'm a pretty complete player.   I think I hit the ball pretty good.   In good weeks, like everybody, I putt good, and my short game is in good shape.   I think it's going to be good.   They're going to enjoy it. 

Q.   I'm interested in your reaction back where you're from to your success.   What kind of reaction have you been getting?   Has there been more excitement about the game, more kids taking up the game, that kind of thing?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, definitely.   Lorena Ochoa did a great job bringing up the game in MÃ©xico.   It's not really big in MÃ©xico.   Soccer, or football, how we call it, is the main thing.   Lorena did a great job in that, and there's more people getting involved definitely.   With me now getting on the PGA TOUR, I think there's more kids looking into playing golf, and I think I'm going to do a great job of helping out there and seeing if people can get involved more. 
I'm excited to see if I can help the game down there in MÃ©xico. 

Q.   How did you kind of get started in the game?   Sounds like Lorena inspired you or you admired her.   How did you get started in the game? 
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, I mean, my friends played, and that's how I started.   I used to go out there with them to the golf course and then play, and then I had a couple‑‑ a group of friends that we used to go out there in the afternoons and play, and I was pretty fond of it.   Obviously I grew up watching Lorena become No.1 golfer in the world, and it was pretty inspiring.   When you watch somebody that comes from nothing to be No.1 in the world, it comes with a lot more than just playing good.   She did a lot of hard work, and how humble she was and everything, so that was a big inspiration for me. 

Q.   What do you have to do to make people in Guadalajara forget about Lorena?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   There is a lot to cover.   I don't know how many times she won, but I'm going to do my best.   I don't think if I'm going to be able to top her, but I'm going to do my best.   It's different playing the PGA TOUR and the LPGA.   I think there's more people excited about watching it on TV, me playing against Rory or Tiger, but I'll do my best to get close to her. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Coach Stracke, he recruited me.   I had a lot of options.   I didn't play much here in the States growing up, and I had plenty of options, but they were kind enough to open me a scholarship, and everything worked out, and it was pretty fun.   I graduated from there last year, and I had a great time. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CARLOS ORTIZ:   He coached in the NAI, junior golf, I'm not sure.   But he knew a guy from MÃ©xico that knew me, and that's how we got in contact. 

Q.   What was it like when you came to North Texas, because I remember when Lorena went to Arizona, she knew‑‑
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I mean, I think it's good.   I'm flattered, but I think I'm still working.   It wasn't as good as right now, so I had trouble at the beginning.   Writing was the most difficult for me, and all the classes were in English.   There's a lot of places to get around it in school. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, those two guys I'm good friends with, and when you play with people you like, it's easier to enjoy it, and that's going to be great.   Definitely we're going to have fun out there.   I can talk to those guys the whole day, so I'm excited. 

Q.   Can you talk about the golf course, what you've seen, what you have to do well out there?   Everyone has to learn new golf courses as a rookie, but is it nice that everyone is starting from scratch and having to learn the golf course for the first time?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I guess that's a little more of an advantage.   Other weeks it's like the 20th time they've been out there, so it is more fair for me, I guess.   This place is good.   Napa as a host, it's amazing, and this golf course is in great shape.   The greens are in unbelievable shape, and the golf course is fun.   You have to shape the ball, and it should be a pretty good test. 
JOHN BUSH:   Carlos Ortiz, thank you, sir, and best of luck.
