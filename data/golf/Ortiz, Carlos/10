Q. 10-under 62 at La Quinta.  That must be pretty satisfying, especially that finish.
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, it's great.  I started great in the round and then I had kind of a slump there that I just didn't know where the ball was going.  But figured it out and started to make some putts and had good momentum.  So just happy that I could put a good score on the board.
Q. What did you figure out part way through to make that stretch at the end happen?
CARLOS ORTIZ: I don't even know.  I just hit it kind of close on 2, that was my 11th hole, and made the putt and then kind of from there just rode the momentum.
Q. Have you ever had a stretch like that where you're 7-under in six holes, especially to close a round?
CARLOS ORTIZ: I don't remember.  I think I have, but it's definitely one of my best scores out here.
Q. When that happens do you feel like -- they call it the zone -- do you feel like you get in the zone to do that or do you just try and block everything out?  What happens?
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, it's kind of -- this golf course you get some good momentum and you can go after every single pin.  The golf courses are soft, you can be aggressive.  So I just had great numbers coming in and that's easy when you have the right number.
