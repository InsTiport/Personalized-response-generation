Q.   Carlos, 66.   What was working so well for you out there?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Actually hit the driver well today.   Hard driving golf course and hit it straight and far and it's always nice playing from the fairway.

Q.   Getting that rhythm, it seems like you're building it more and more as you play out here on the PGA TOUR, what is considered right here as the World's Greatest Tour?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   It's okay.   I've been playing okay.   I'm not playing bad.   Just getting more comfortable out here.   Lot of new stuff.   Everything I do is new.   You're feeling and getting to know everything.

Q.   Lot of golf still in the golf course right now.   You could be in the mix heading into tomorrow. 
What is your mindset now heading into the final round with an opportunity to win this tournament maybe?
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Play great.   Good round tomorrow and have a chance and since mainly have a chance in the back-9.   I can play good enough the first 9 holes, I have a chance on the back.
