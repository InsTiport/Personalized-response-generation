Q. One bogey, currently 15-under, and one behind right now.  What are your emotions at the moment?
CARLOS ORTIZ: Good.  I feel good.  I played great.  I been actually playing great the whole week.  I just hit fairways today, and somehow it's easier from the fairways.  I'm just happy with the round.
Q. Well that's exactly right.  This course is in such great condition.  How did you find the wind conditions?  Did it make it a little bit more challenging do you think today?
CARLOS ORTIZ: It wasn't really windy the first 9 holes.  After 10, 11 holes it started blowing a little bit more.  It's warm and the ball is going through the ball so it was easy to judge.
Q. Well, it's hard to know what exactly is going to happen in the next hour or so.  I'm sure you'll be anxiously watching.
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, I'll be watching.  Either way I'm happy with my week.  I played great.  If it's enough, it's enough.  If not, I'm happy.
Q. (Wind interference.)
CARLOS ORTIZ: It's right in there.  That's why I wanted to play great.  I played good in Napa, I played great here, and obviously when you're hitting fairways on these kind of golf courses you're allowed to shoot low.
Q. Hopefully with the top 10 you can make your way into the field in Vegas like you were telling me off camera.  But also somewhat of a new dad with five-month-old Sophia at home.  How has life changed on and off the golf course?
CARLOS ORTIZ: It's awesome.  Now it's everything for me, and definitely changes the perspective.  I'm really happy how everything is going my life right now and I'm grateful to be back on the PGA TOUR and hopefully keep playing good.
Q. You also said it's almost like having a new toy every time you go home.
CARLOS ORTIZ: Yeah, definitely.  It's exciting going home.  It doesn't matter if you play good or bad.  You go back to a little kid and they really don't care.  You just try to play with them and make them laugh.
