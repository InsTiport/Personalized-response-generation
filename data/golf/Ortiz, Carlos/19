 Q.   Great round of golf.   
CARLOS ORTIZ:   This morning, I was kind of scared on 10 after the first few holes and then I relaxed.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CARLOS ORTIZ:   That's a tough hole.   That's a really short hole where it's easy to make a bogey ‑‑ if you play it the right way ‑‑ that's the way to play that and almost had a good chance for birdie.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CARLOS ORTIZ:   For that pin, it varies, depending where the pins are the next days, I might hit driver.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, I hit some great drives and once you're in the fairway, you can be aggressive.   With good lies, it's easy to hit it close.
