  Q. What a tough golf course.  Have you ever more pleased with a 70 or an even-par round?
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, I mean, I feel like I played pretty much a perfect round.  I didn't really miss a lot of shots.  It's just really hard to get it close to the hole and then the greens are getting really fast, baked out, so I'm pleased the way I played.  I didn't really see many under, maybe one or two, but other than that, I played pretty good.
 Q. Did you look at any leaderboards out there?  I know it's Thursday.
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   Yeah, I just saw that nobody was really taking it low.  I didn't see how they were going to take it low.
 Q. But you didn't look at a board and were surprised by anything you saw?
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   No, that's what I was expecting.  I saw the boards, and a couple under was leading the whole time, and I don't see how people are going to shoot much lower than that.
 Q. Do you need rain?
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   I mean, I don't care.  I'm okay playing like this.  It's fair for everybody, but if it rains it's a little bit nicer.  You can spin the ball a little bit more.
 Q. What was it like playing with Tiger for the first time?
 CARLOS ORTIZ:   It's good.  He's pretty good.  He hit some good shots.  It was fun playing with him.
