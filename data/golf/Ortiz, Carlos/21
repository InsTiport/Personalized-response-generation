 Q.   Thank you.   I'm here with Carlos Ortiz after Saturday's round.   First of all, Carlos, the patience required when your putting this much and it's just not going in.   Tell me how you handled this issue.   
CARLOS ORTIZ:   Well, that's golf.   Some days the putts don't go in and you have to be patient and wait.   In the end I didn't make a lot, but I'm still there.   Tomorrow's another day.   Let's hope they go in.   
   
 Q.   Obviously, after two days of good weather, lots of sun, a little wind, everything changes completely in this round Saturday.   What were the adjustments you had to make and how did the day work?  
CARLOS ORTIZ:   I kept playing golf, you can't be thinking too much about the weather, you have to try to keep it out of your mind.   
It's a difficult situation, but it's the same for everyone.   I finished 2â€‘under par, I'm happy and I'm still in the tournament.   
   
 Q.   Thank you, Carlos.   Only one bogey in this conditions back to the studio.
