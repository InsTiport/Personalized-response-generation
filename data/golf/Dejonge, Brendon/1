Q. It had to be great to finish with that birdie on 18.  We haven't seen many there today.
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, it was nice.  Obviously a nice way to finish.  Got a little tricky out there when the wind picked up for our back nine.
Q. Yeah, in particular No. 16, the wind there, tough to hold the green from where you were and that pin location?
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, 16 is tough, and then you play 10, 11 and 12 all into the breeze.  So it made us think a little bit for sure.
Q. Talk about the decision on 16 to putt from where you were instead of chip there because it looked like you were just into the rough there.  The lie had to have been good.
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, the lie wasn't perfect.  I figured if I putt it, the worst I could be was hopefully five, ten feet.
Q. You like this golf course it would be fair to say, considering runner-up in 2012 and 4-under yesterday, 5-under today?
BRENDON DE JONGE: Yeah, I've always enjoyed it out here.  I like the city.  It's always been one that I look forward to.
Q. Any plans tonight in Vegas?
BRENDON DE JONGE: I don't know, my wife and kids just came in, so it'll probably be pretty quiet.
