   CRAIG SMITH:  Casey, I think we sat here yesterday with some big smiles and today a little bit disappointed.  It just got away pretty steadily down the road.  You just couldn't catch a break. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Yeah, no doubt about it.  You know, he came out playing solid and he aimed for center of greens, he hit a lot of fairways.  I couldn't get it going.  But he was, he played better today.  So he deserves it. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Was it Mike that won it or was it you that lost it? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  You know, I had a couple opportunities to get back in the match.  But unfortunately I didn't and I didn't take charge of them.  But that's just the way it goes sometimes. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What was not clicking for you today that worked the rest of the week? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  I think there was just a couple putts.  If I make just a couple of these couple 10 footers, couple 12 footers and get some, it gets you back into the match.  And I just needed that one little spark, but I just never got it. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  And from just being here a few times here, but I don't think you were nervous at all, were you? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  No, I had a little butterflies on the first tee.  But like I said, said, I had nothing to lose and I won't be nervous. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  How disappointed between the contrast of being a semi-finalist and yet not getting a win here? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  It's a little disappointing.  But you got to look at the whole big picture.  I won four or five matches four matches and made the semi-finals of the U.S. Amateur, and if I won today, you never know what would have happened.  But unfortunately somebody's got to lose and that was it. 

 Q.  Is it tough not to think about what's at stake today, it's not the finals, but in some ways there's much more at stake with the Masters invite and all that? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  You think about that before the round but during the round I really nothing really, I wasn't thinking about it at all. 
 Just kind of before last night, you know.  If I win tomorrow, you know, I have a chance to go to the Masters, but like I said, somebody's got to lose. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  You didn't go through without a fight though.  Birdie on 15. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Yeah, I told myself, let's take this a couple extra holes and let's see what can happen. 

 Q.  What do you take away from this whole week, the whole experience and going now into your senior clear year at college? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  I'm going to take a lot from it.  Hopefully I'll learn from it and be a better player. 

 Q.  What do you think about tomorrow's final, you obviously saw Michael today, I gather you know Colt's game a little bit.  What do you expect tomorrow? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  It's going to be a good match, I think.  Colt's a great player.  Michael's a great player.  And it's going to come down to the putter. 

 Q.  What about Michael's game impresses you? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  He just seems like he's always there.  You know what I mean.  He just seems like he won't give you a lot. 
 And when he does, he'll bounce right back. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  The two of you met before in anything? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  No.  This is the first. 

 Q.  Given that you were in the, what, 17 for 6 I think playoff.  To go through that and then end up here in the semis, I mean it's not that, it's sort of an interesting path.  Given you went through that to make it this far I am imagine has got to feel good. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  After I got through with that I just told myself, just anything can happen and you've already made it through the playoff and it just seemed like anything that came my way wasn't as hard to deal with. 

 Q.  How hard was that getting through that playoff? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  It was pretty brutal because everybody is waiting on you up there by the green.  And there was 17 guys playing in it.  It just took, it just seemed like it took forever.  So you're always thinking about other things you shouldn't be thinking about. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  How's college golf season going to be, are you ready? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  I'm ready.  I'm not ready for school, but I'm ready for golf season. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Is school in session? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Yes, started on Thursday. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  That's the hard part about losing. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  That's the hard part. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What classes, like yesterday?  Did you miss classes yesterday. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Thursday and Friday. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What did you miss? 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Couldn't even tell you. 
 (Laughter.) 
 CRAIG SMITH:  That's a senior.  Thank you, Casey. 
 CASEY CLENDENON:  Well thanks.
