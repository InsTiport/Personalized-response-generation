Q.
Tell me about your round today.
JIM KANE:  Oh, it was great.  I couldn't have dreamt it any better.  Just had a little hiccup on 18.  But other than that, I was really proud of myself.
Q.  You had a lot of good second shots, was that the strategy today, going with a lot of good second shots?
JIM KANE:  Yeah, you know, I was fortunate to play with an old friend, Tom Pernice, yesterday and he really gave me some good tips about hitting out of the rough and hitting out of the bunkers.  It really helped a lot because I think I got up and down out of every bunker today.  So I was real excited about that.
Q.  Were the bunkers really good today?
JIM KANE:  Oh, the bunkers were perfect.  Execution and I    I didn't have the right execution and Tom spent some time with me yesterday while we were playing, and he really helped me out.
Q.  What was your best shot of the day today?
JIM KANE:  Probably the second shot I hit on No. 9.  I hit a 4 iron to about four feet and made birdie there.  That's probably my best shot of the day.
Q.  Your birdie on 1, what did you hit there?
JIM KANE:  Yeah, I had a good birdie on 1 but the shot I hit on No. 9 was really good.

You've just got to take each day as it comes, each shot as it comes, one shot at a time and you'll do that stuff, so try not to get too far ahead of myself.

I like the golf course.  I liked it when I came here about a month ago and it suits my game.  If I can just keep it in the fairway and make a couple putts, who knows what will happen.
