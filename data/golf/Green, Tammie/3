Q.  If you could talk in general about your match.
 
TAMMIE GREEN:  Well, when we first started out, we really didn't get in sync early and, consequently, we missed the first seven greens.  And any time you do that, you can't score very well and we put ourselves in a hole.  We ended up coming back on the 9th hole to only be 2 down, and then we went over and we were putting ourselves in bad positions, either above the pin -- where it's real fast coming down -- and we just didn't get in sync, really, all day.  I know we're better players than that, and we'll team well again. 
   
   
 

Q.  If you could just talk about the match in general, how it went.  You got off to a fast start, made all of the 9 greens on the front 9.
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, I mean, we played really very steady the whole way around and had a couple of birdies on the front 9.  We were really just trying to hit the fairways, hit the greens.  I think in foursomes, especially, you can make pars, hopefully. That's usually good enough, I think.  We just tried to keep it on the fairways, on the greens, take the two-putts.  We're lucky; we never seemed to lose a hole.  We won the next hole again and got it straight back. 
 

Q.  Is that why you and Annika compliment each other well, kind of get on a roll with her putting and your irons?
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, she holed a couple of good putts there, just in the front 9, really got us up to connect 2, 3 up.  We just kind of never looked as though we were going to lose and we didn't.
