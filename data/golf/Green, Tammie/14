TAMMIE GREEN:  I guess we will talk about my  match today.  If I would have lost my match today I  would have never lived it down.  I had a great match  with Annika Sorenstam.  I don't know that I really went  out and won the match.  I got off to a real shaky start  this morning and we both 3-putted the first green and  then I put it in the water on the second hole and she  went one up and I just tried to play; get back into my  rhythm and throw some good shots in there.  I didn't  make very many putts this week until I got to the back  side today and started to roll the ball much better.  I  had trouble reading the greens and always seemed to be  leaving it on the wrong side of the hole, but I hung in  there; hit some good shots tee to green and  unfortunately Annika had a lot of 3-putts out there  today.  And then I made a couple of putts on her on  number 11 and then the 16th hole and that is really  about all the putts that I made all week.  She is a  great competitor.  She always plays steady and I was  never really assured of a victory until that putt went  in on 16.  She made the put on 15 and her back to two  and I was still two up and it was just a great match  and I am real fortunate to be associated with the  ladies I am associated with this week and it has been  fun.  


Q.  Were you concerned about being -- you are the  hometown hero, sort of; were you concerned about  leading 0 and 3 this morning before you teed off?  

TAMMIE GREEN:  I don't think you ever want to lose and Kelly  and I just had a couple of -- we ran into a buzz saw  yesterday and we just didn't make any putts.  We played  steady.  I feel like I played good golf all week from  tee to green.  It is just the putter that wasn't very  hot for me this week.
