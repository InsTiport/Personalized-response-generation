   OLIVER FISHER: Good finish, hit a good wedge inside, that was good.   
  
  Q. Overall?  
 OLIVER FISHER: Overall, I just played really nice. Hit a lot of fairways and gave myself a lot of chances on the greens. Only mistake there was on 11 just missed the green there. Pretty happy with the way things are right now.  
  
  Q. Did you play here last year?  
 OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, last two seasons I played here. It's nice coming here. It's good.   
  
  Q. In terms of how much practise did you have leading up to this?  
 OLIVER FISHER: Well, I came out to Dubai on last Tuesday day, so I've been out here -- I had five days practise at the Montgomerie there and come down here on Tuesday morning.  
  
  Q. Who are you tracking with?  
 OLIVER FISHER: Just on my own. I was there with my dad. He helped out a bit. Michael was there, as well, and Rory come down on Saturday. I played a couple of times with Rory.  
  
  Q. Nice to be able to go up to Rory and say, "I shot better than you today."   
 OLIVER FISHER: The course was set up for good scoring, a bit of rain this morning, so just hitting the targets, and everything is sticking in the fairways. The course is in great condition, so it's perfect for scoring right now. It not that windy.  
  
  Q. He's always talking about his rivalry with you.   
 OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, he's had a great run, hasn't he, so it's good.   
  
  Q. Nice to have a win yourself.   
 OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, definitely. It was a good group.
