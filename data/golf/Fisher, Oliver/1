 Q.  Talk about that 4-under opening round today.  
OLIVER FISHER: It was solid.  Solid day.  The course here is strong, so you need to sort of drive the ball well and do a lot of things really well to give yourself a chance.  I think with the greens, the way they re-designed, it's quite tough to give yourself a lot of good chances.  You kind of have to fiddle shots in and trying and get on slopes and that, which is pretty tricky at times.   
Today I played pretty solid.  I was on a lot of fairways and the score reflected that.   
 Q.  You can't really complain about a bogey-free round, either?  
OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, for sure.  It's always nice to go bogey-free.   
 Q.  How is your game trending at the moment?  
OLIVER FISHER: It's been a hard kind of season, really.  I've not played a lot, early on in the year with the Middle East swing, and Oman and Qatar, and had a few weeks off after that.  Struggled with a little bit of an injury after India there but now I'm kind of getting back into it getting ready for the thick of the season.   
 Q.  What's your game plan for tomorrow?  
OLIVER FISHER: The same.  Really lucky the course here is in great condition.  It's set up perfectly out there for us.  Hopefully the weather stays like this, and go out there and enjoy myself.
