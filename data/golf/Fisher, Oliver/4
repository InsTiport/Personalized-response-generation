 Q.  Very well played.  How happy are you with your performance through 36?  
OLIVER FISHER: Really pleased.  I played nice today.  Had a nice run on the back nine there from the second to the fourth, made three birdies in a row.  It was a good round and I'm pleased with my 67.   
 Q.  Coming to a course like this where you know the scores are going to be low, what does that sort of do for confidence that if you get on a run, you can post some low numbers around here?  
OLIVER FISHER: The big thing when the scoring is low is just to be patient.  Just keep on trying your best and give yourself chances eventually and a few will drop.   
As this week goes, you can see the guys ten under already, so the scores are there for the taking if you can hit it close to the pin.   
 Q.  The Race to Dubai, in terms of what you need to do this week, what's your way of dealing with the pressure and the situation you find yourself in?  
OLIVER FISHER: I don't think you can really kind of think about it too much.  I'm in that position, so it is the way it is.  All I can do is approach it just like any other week and go out there and do my best and shoot as low as I can.   
 Q.  Spoke to a few of the guys yesterday, and you mentioned the word patience, as well, staying positive?  
OLIVER FISHER: Attitude is key, any time of the season in any tournament.  Here I think where the scoring is good, you can go out there and be aggressive and try and shoot as low as you can.   
 Q.  How excited are you about the weekend now?  
OLIVER FISHER: Really excited.  I think 14-under is leading, so hopefully go out there and have a good weekend.
