 Q. You must be pleased with that one. 
 OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, for sure. I played nicely. Gave myself a lot of chances and it's pretty wet out there, the course. As long as you're hitting fairways, the greens are rolling well, so you're going to give yourself plenty of chances, and that's what I did.

 Q. Was it tough with that rain delay?
 OLIVER FISHER: It was. We got it on 16, it came down so heavy, got our waterproofs on really quick. The rain was so heavy. I think it was right how they did it, give us a sort of 20-minute delay and get going again. I birdied 17 and 18, so pretty pleased with that.

 Q. You had a good result in Wales; what's been the difference? 
 OLIVER FISHER: Patience, really. We all go through bad spells every now and again. 
 As long as I keep sticking in there and working on the right things, it will come together sooner or later. 

 Q. Has confidence got a lot to do with it? 
 OLIVER FISHER: No, my confidence is good at the moment. I'm hitting the ball where I want to. I drove the ball really nicely today, so just see what we can do over the next few days.
