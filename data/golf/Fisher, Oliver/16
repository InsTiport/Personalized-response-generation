   Q. Satisfying two days? 
 OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, satisfying. I don't know what Francesco has finished on, but I'm in a nice place going into the weekend so that's good. 

 Q. That's what you want. 
 OLIVER FISHER: Of course it is, a lot of golf to be played yet. My game is in pretty good shape. I can improve a bit the next couple of rounds, so just go out there and enjoy it.

 Q. What was the key today?
 OLIVER FISHER: I had a good finish. Birdied 14, 15, 16 and eagled 17. So that's what I was pleased with, really. 
 17, I hit a drive and 3-iron ten feet behind the pin and holed it. 

 Q. Ollie was remarking how impressive it is to see you playing so well; annoying sort of season?
 OLIVER FISHER: What can you do? You've just got to try your best and get on with it really. 

 Q. Thoughts for the weekend? 
 OLIVER FISHER: Just go out there and keep enjoying it, have fun, and see what happens really. 

 Q. Are you starting to think about winning and mathematics? 
 OLIVER FISHER: You've just got to get on and play really. You know, you can still -- you never know what can happen really. 
 You never know what can happen. Like Ross did last week, you never know what can happen and what's around the corner and stuff.
