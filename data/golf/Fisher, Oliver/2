 Q.  68 today, how was that?  
OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, good.  I was very pleased with my back nine, which was the front.  It was playing tough today.  I think I hit 3-iron into the second, and 6-iron into three, and 3-iron into four.   
So those holes were playing probably as long as I've ever played them here.  I think the fifth, I had 72 yards on and I hit driver, 3-wood, 9-iron, which that hole is usually a pretty much gimmie birdie.  Very pleased with my back nine.  I'm happy to get around here today in 4-under.   
 Q.  What was the strength of your game today?  
OLIVER FISHER: I think I holed out very well from sort of four or five foot.  It wasn't easy on the greens, you know.  When you play a season of golf like we've just played, the greens generally coming in here have all been fairly quick.  And you come out into the breeze and the greens are a little slower than maybe what we play week-to-week on The European Tour, which obviously they have to be because of the conditions -- it's just a little bot to adjust to.   
So I was pleased with the way I holed out.  I drove the ball well coming in, which I was pleased with, too.   
 Q.  Birdie at the last, at well, positive way to end?  
OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, definitely.  It was playing downwind.  It probably was one of the easier holes out on the course today, so it was good to make a nice putt there.   
 Q.  Carnoustie tomorrow, looking forward to it?  
OLIVER FISHER: Yeah, always looking forward to Carnoustie.  I think we kind of play it quite generously if the Dunhill Links here but it's always a great test. Hopefully the weather looks after us.
