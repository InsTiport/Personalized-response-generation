Q. Looked like you struggled with your putter a bit?
CHEYENNE WOODS: Yeah, I had three 3-putts on the back nine which definitely hurt me.  Overall, I felt like I played well today.  Gave myself a lot of chances for birdie but my putter just wasn't as hot as it was yesterday.  I'll work on a few things and hopefully get it back tomorrow.
Q. With your position, are you quite happy at four behind?
CHEYENNE WOODS: I felt like I really needed that birdie on 18 to at least get myself up there a little bit closer.  I'm really happy with where I'm sitting going into tomorrow, so I'm looking forward to a good day.
I do think it's going to be close tomorrow.  I do think that anybody could win, and I think that I have a shot, so I'm happy with that.
Q. Do you think with a 64, you would have that in the bag around this course?
CHEYENNE WOODS: I do.  I mean, yesterday I had it to minus seven through ten holes.  I'm playing well so I think it's definitely out there.
Q. Obviously a fast start tomorrow is what you're looking for.
CHEYENNE WOODS: I've just got to stay patient and take advantage of opportunities that I give myself and really just take it one hole at a time.
Q. Are you happy with the way you hit the ball, despite the tough, windy conditions?
CHEYENNE WOODS: I thought I hit the ball decent today.  I didn't get into too much trouble.  I hit like 14 or 15 greens.  I gave myself great chances for birdies.  I just didn't quite putt well.  The greens are tricky this afternoon, I don't know why.  Maybe it was just me, who knows.
