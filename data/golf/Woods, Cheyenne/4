Q. Birdie on 18 to finish your day.  How good does that feel?
CHEYENNE WOODS: Yeah, felt really good.  Felt like I did leave a few out there.  Just a few putts within five feet that I missed.
Felt good to finish with a birdie and head into tomorrow feeling good about my game.
Q. How did your round go overall?  Any up and downs?  A high maybe?
CHEYENNE WOODS: Pretty steady overall.  It was a little slow getting started.  I gave myself so many birdie opportunities today, so it was nice to be able to feel like I had a lot of chances for birdie.
Once I made the turn I started making a few putts and got the hang of the greens.
Q. How did the course change from when you started in the morning versus yesterday?
CHEYENNE WOODS: The course is playing totally different than I played it earlier in the week.  The greens have firmed up quite a bit, so it's playing a little bit shorter maybe.
And then the greens just being a little quicker, a little firmer.  But it's a great course.  It's in really good shape.  Looking forward to see how the conditions are in the morning.
Q. Last time you here I think you had a top 10.  Do you feel comfortable here?  Do you feel like you could break through maybe?
CHEYENNE WOODS: Yeah, I do.  I played great last year.  I really enjoy the course.  Good vibes coming back.  I've got my family out here this week as well, and I'm staying with a women who works with us at Nike Golf.
It's just really comfortable here in Portland and I'm enjoying it so far, so looking forward to the rest of the week.
