Q.   Congratulations.   First cut made on the LPGA Tour. 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I know.   So exciting. 

Q.   Just how do you feel?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I'm so excited.   It feels so good, one, to be out here in France, and then to play so well and finally make a cut. 
This is the best I've played since I've started playing, getting exemptions and playing here on tour.   So it's really exciting.

Q.   Just take us through your round today.   What worked for you?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I was hitting the ball really well.   I think I hit like 15 greens.   Still didn't make a few putts here and there, but overall I was very happy with my game.
Ball‑striking was the best it's been in a while.

Q.   Just for the weekend, obviously I'm sure one of the goals was to make the cut, but now what are you looking for in the next 36 holes?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I mean, just to continue what I'm doing.   Don't change my game plan.   Just continue to play my game and stay calm out here. 
I feel a lot more comfortable out here this week.   I think the last two tournaments I've played have given me a lot of experience, so I'm thankful for that and excited to be here.

Q.   Was that a birdie at the last?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yes. 

Q.   So you finished at 4‑under overall.
CHEYENNE WOODS:   4‑under, yes.

Q.   Great.   Do you think there is less pressure to make the cut here that you are far from U.S.A. or not?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I don't know.   I guess you could say, but it's still a lot of pressure.   I mean, it's still a big event.   It's so prestigious to be out here.   I'm so thankful to be out here.
I think it's different being away from home.   My family is not here.   I'm here with my friend Danielle Kang. 
I don't know why I played better here. 

Q.   You seem very relaxed on the course, because I saw laughing.   I don't know why.   Maybe you almost fall or something. 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yes, we tripped. 

Q.   Okay.   So that was very funny just to see you this way. 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yeah.   I mean, I think it helped a lot playing with Danielle.   We're rooming together, and it's nice to have somebody there that I know.   We have fun throughout the entire round. 

Q.   Do you have a way to handle the pressure, or is it your natural behavior?   You seem very smiley girl, even in a country you don't know.   You are always like that? 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yeah, for the most part.   I mean, I enjoy being out here playing golf and being on the LPGA; playing in these events is awesome. 
I usually don't get too down on myself on the course.   Today was just a good day, so I had no reason not to smile. 

Q.   Do you think Tiger will have a look on this little part of the world?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I don't know.   Hopefully he's checking up on scores.   I'm sure he's busy though.   He's a busy man. 

Q.   No tweets from Tiger? 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   He doesn't really tweet this much.   He's not big into Twitter, so... 

Q.   What happened at 15?   Did you hit a bad shot?   Miss the green?   Wrong iron or something?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yeah, on 15 I didn't catch the slope on my second shot so I was up in the rough with a bad lie.   I just didn't get it up on the green.   Hit it left in the rough and chipped it and missed. 

Q.   You're very smiley.   Tiger usually has his game face, and that's not your game face.   You are Madam Smiles.   Don't we all agree? 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   That's so funny.   I didn't realize I smiled so much.

Q.   It's nice and you've got a lovely smile. 
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Thank you.

Q.   Have you been to Europe before?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Well, I've been to Scotland a few years ago.   This is the first time to France and everything.

Q.   When you were in Scotland did you play?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   It wasn't a tournament.   I was just there with a golf group from the United States and we just played different courses in the area.

Q.   Where did you go?
CHEYENNE WOODS:   St. Andrews.   We didn't play St. Andrews, but we played like the Castle Course and some right in that area along the cliffs and stuff.
