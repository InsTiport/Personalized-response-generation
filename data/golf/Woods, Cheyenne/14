  THE MODERATOR:   Talk about playing at home this year.   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   A lot of the year, I'm in hotel rooms, living out of a suitcase, so this week, staying at home, had my own car, a home‑cooked meal that my mom is cooking for me every night, it's nice to be at home and have that extra comfort.  
THE MODERATOR:     Your name has been in the headlines a lot this year, particularly after your first big win on the Ladies European Tour, you won the RACV Volvik Masters in Australia.   What has that win done for your confidence level and how has that changed how you view your career already?   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   For me, it's just shown that I'm able to win.   You know, I've been competing at the professional level for the past year and a half, and to be able to have that win under my belt really helps me know that I'm capable of that, and every time I come out here to play, I do come out to win.   
So with that competitive nature, that win helps with my confidence and in the future hopefully I'll be able to have a few more wins.  
   
 Q.   You have stated that you're playing the Symetra Tour primarily this year.   What was in your decision factor of doing that, focusing on the Symetra Tour, the LPGA's official qualifying tour?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   For me the Symetra Tour was the opportunity for me to earn my status on the LPGA.   I have been fortunate enough to receive invites to this event and the Australian Masters, but I don't want to depend on invites and have to try to hopefully play well and earn my way here.   I'd rather play a full season on Symetra and have a great year and earn it that way playing Top‑10 on the Money List.   
So that's always been my plan, so I don't plan on changing it after the win or whether anything else happens, you know, unless I win here, that would be good.   But other than that, I plan on playing the Symetra.   
   
 Q.   What is your first memory of going to an LPGA event and who you followed around, and how much experience do you have at this particular course?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I started watching the ladies‑‑ when they were out at Moon Valley, I remember I was there when Annika shot 59.   That was my home course growing up and so I would go out there every day.   
And I remember on the driving range I got to meet Grace Park.   She is one of my favorites and still is one of my favorites that I've ever watched play.   So just being able to watch them and see them firsthand and how friendly they were, that's really exciting for me growing up.   
Here at this course, I don't have a lot of history at this course, I've played only a handful of times.   I played a Cactus Tour event here last year and then just a random round here or there.   But I don't get to come out here that often.   
   
 Q.   Did you watch any of Annika's 59, and what did that do for you in terms of blowing your mind as a kid?   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I didn't have the opportunity to watch her play that day, but I remember being on the course and hearing that she had shot 59 and I just couldn't imagine somebody shooting that low.   I remember it was a huge deal and it was so cool because even weeks after‑‑ that was my home course and so they had the scorecard up in the clubhouse and so it's cool to see that and be so close to it.   
   
 Q.   You've been playing competitive golf for a long time; how does it feel now that you're almost at the doorstep of the LPGA?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   It's exciting for me because I have been playing competitively since I was eight years old and it's all been my dream to play the LPGA Tour.   
So for me to have an opportunity to play in an event like this means a lot.   But it would mean even more if I was able to earn my status here and be able to play full time.   That's always been a goal of mine and my ultimate dream, but I think it's definitely close and I'm looking forward to when it's finally here.   
   
 Q.   Is it going fast for you or has it been a long time?   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I feel like the time flew by, and it does feel like just yesterday that I was out here watching the ladies rather than being inside the ropes so I think it's gone by really quick.  
   
 Q.   So there's no suffering?   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   No, no, never any suffering (laughing).   
   
 Q.   How important was it for to you win the tournament in Australia, that you have not just the name, but also the golf to play?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Yeah, it feels great.   A lot of times I would come to a press conference like that and that was the main topic.   But for people to see that I am able to play and I'm a competitive golfer, and that's what I'm here for‑‑ I'm not here to answer questions about Tiger or give inside info or whatever.   
I've always been a golfer and I've always been competitive, and for me to actually go out and do what I know I'm capable of doing feels great and for other people to recognize that feels even better.  
   
 Q.   Has the name in that sense been difficult because the focus hasn't been on your golf game so often?   
CHEYENNE WOODS:   Not necessarily difficult.   It's something that I have always had and I don't know anything different.   Ever since I started playing golf, ever since I was eight years old at tournament, I've had the cameras or interviews; so I've always had those questions thrown at me.   For me it's just normal and what I've always had, so it's not necessarily difficult.   It s just what my path to professional golf has been.  
   
 Q.   Pardon me for asking, but since you talked about it, do you talk with Tiger much?   Has he given you any advice, any advice that you've held on to over the years?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   We definitely talk with occasionally and he definitely keeps up with what I'm doing and is always a fan of how well I play.   But in terms of advice, never really anything on‑course, no mechanics.   I have my swing coach here in Phoenix that I work with.   
But one thing he's always said is trust your abilities, and I think that's something that really helped me when I won is to trust and to know that I'm able to be in this position and for four days straight be able to carry it out.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel that the Wildfire Course suits your game, why or why not?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I think it does.   I'm generally a pretty straight ball hitter so I don't have to worry about the desert or anything.   And then also, my putting has been really good this season and it's been something that I've been working on along with my short game.   These greens are pretty tricky.   They are firm and good speed and so I think that will help me this week.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe your name?  
CHEYENNE WOODS:   I'm a pretty steady player.   I don't hit the ball super long, but I definitely keep it in play.   And I think what's made the difference, like I said this year, for me, is my short game.   I've worked a lot on that with my coach here at home and my putting is something I'm always trying to improve on.   
So I'm able to keep it in play and when I'm able to get up‑and‑down and make those birdies, that's when it makes the difference.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.   We wish you the best of luck this week and hopefully look forward to seeing you more out here on the LPGA Tour.
