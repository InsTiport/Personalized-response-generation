 Q.  Hypothetically, how pleasing would that be?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: It's really nice.  This has been quite a long stretch and it's kind of a nice bonus to play well this week and just automatically get into next and have another opportunity.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind today?  Were you thinking about the chance?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: I was.  I was tracking down who was in and who wasn't going into today and where I stood.  My goal was to get into red numbers.  I thought that would give me a great shot.  Unfortunately I didn't but hopefully it was still enough.   
 Q.  What happened on day one, 6-over?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: Day one, the wind kind of got me.  The course I think played the total opposite than my practice rounds and couldn't get comfortable, and I was just forcing a lot of shots and that kind of showed in my score.   
 Q.  Does this give you confidence the way you've played the last three days?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: I think so.  I think these conditions will be pretty similar maybe to next week.  I've never been there before.  But it is always nice just to have a good four rounds in and a good tournament, so I'll take that momentum into next week.   
 Q.  Were you watching Tiger at Carnoustie?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: I was.  I watched the whole round.  It's exciting to see him back up on top and playing well.  He looked like he was in total control of his game so it was really good to see.  I think we all see he's got that confidence and the game to back it up.   
 Q.  Did you fear he might never get back like everyone else?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: I didn't, no.  Everyone kept asking me.  I'm like, of course, he's going to win.  So I was always cheering for him.   
 Q.  Are you going to pick his brains about Lytham?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: I might give him a call and see if he has any two cents he can share.   
 Q.  I read that he said the rough was unplayable in 2012.  
CHEYENNE WOODS: It will be interesting to see that.   
 Q.  It's a little tighter than here.  Looking ahead to that, you haven't played Lytham before?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: No, I've never been there before.  It will be exciting to see the course.   
 Q.  How many British Opens have you played now?  
CHEYENNE WOODS: Two, I think.  Yeah, I've played two total.
