Q.
Nancy, the exciting moments just do not end.  Congratulations.  You brought the Solheim Cup home to US soil on US soil.  Can you possibly describe what this moment is like.
NANCY LOPEZ:  It's like a dream.  I can't believe it's been two years that we have been working on this.  These players played their hearts out, Kay.  I love them.  We have formed a wonderful relationship to this team.  Friendships have grown.  That's what it's all about.  It's awesome.
Q.  Can you put your finger on two for three points that really made it possible for you guys to win this thing?
NANCY LOPEZ:  I think coming here and practicing with the team and spending more time with the team, especially with the alternate shot, I think they were ready to go.

You know, we played, they were ready.  They weren't afraid of it.  They said, "Let's go, girls."  We have been here for each other, and it's been a great team effort this whole week.
Q.  You have perhaps 12 MVPs, but what about those rookies?
NANCY LOPEZ:  They're not rookies to me.  They played like veterans.  They were awesome.  I knew I had to use them.  They were the best players coming in here.  I had to trust them, I knew they could do it.
Q.  Congratulations.  You did an outstanding job.
