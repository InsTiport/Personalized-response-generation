Q.  Talk about Christina out there early in the morning.
NANCY LOPEZ:  She's a firecracker, I just love her.  She gets everybody fired up.  The team loves her.  Her enthusiasm, I mean, I was kind of upset they were playing fourth today, because I wanted them first again, but she says, "Hey, we'll be clean up."  I was freaking out that she was going to be last, and the first thing that came out of her mouth was "No, I'm going to be clean up."  That's awesome.  I love that attitude.
Q.  Do you want her to    were you going to switch up a little bit, why didn't you?
NANCY LOPEZ:  Because they didn't have enough time to make the earlier tees so I started the other group.
Q.  What did you say to them on number 5?  Michelle said whatever you said kind of sparked them a little bit.
NANCY LOPEZ:  I told them to "Forget what's going on over there.  Play your own game.  Be by yourself, put yourself on the golf course by yourself.  If you guys start to struggle, start talking about something, tell a dirty joke, do something, but don't shut up inside yourself.  Go ahead and talk to your partner, do that, and get their mind away from what's happening so you can stop whatever was happening and keeps happening."
