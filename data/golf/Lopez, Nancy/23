Q.  Nancy can you believe all the exciting things that are happening right now?
NANCY LOPEZ:  I've got so many chills.  These players have played their heart out.

I told them to go out and play their own game and play with their heart, and they just did it.
Q.  How do you describe Cristie Kerr and what you just saw on 18?
NANCY LOPEZ:  They're the best.  I love it.
