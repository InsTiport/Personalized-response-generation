 Q.  Nancy, after 25 years on the LPGA  Tour and 25 tries at this Open championship, that's the great omission from your career.  Are you okay with that?
NANCY LOPEZ:  It's hard, because I played the game so long and it's hard to step away from it.  Being able to play in the U.S.  Open for all these years has been a wonderful experience.

Q.  The walk-up on 18, the fans were all there, you have won their respect and admiration, all these fans you've won their love, it's hard to walk away from that, isn't it?
NANCY LOPEZ:  You give to your heart to this sport.  It's been a great time for me, but I find myself a little short of the dedication I need to be able to play the type golf that I want to play. 
You know, I could work on it a little bit, but I'd have to leave my family and my husband for a while, but I have to just say thank God for what I've experienced and what I've been able to accomplish, and it's time to go take care of my kids and my husband.

Q.  After 25 tries at winning the  Open, if you had a mulligan what would it be?
NANCY LOPEZ:  I think 4 seconds should equal a first.

Q.  We'll have to talk to them about that.  I don't know how far we'll get with that.  Congratulations on a wonderful career and a good-bye to the U.S.  Open.
NANCY LOPEZ:  Thank you all very much, too.  Thank you.
