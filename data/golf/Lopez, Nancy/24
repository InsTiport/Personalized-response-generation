Q.  Nancy, what are you thinking about?  All your decisions seem to be turning out great.
NANCY LOPEZ:  I have a great team, no decision is bad.  It's awesome.  I love it.  They played their hearts out.
Q.  How proud of Pat Hurst and Michele Redman are you?  They had their backs against the wall, everything was clicking in Europe's favor.
NANCY LOPEZ:  I went out there and said, "Get in your own world, play one shot at a time.  Put yourself away from everything that's happening.  Concentrate on your game.  Get into your mind.  Don't let anything bother you.  You're the best.  Say 'I can hit this shot,' and you can.  Go make the best one you can," and they did that.
Q.  How can anyone not believe what you say?  You instill a lot of confidence, Nancy.  Congratulations on this great morning.
