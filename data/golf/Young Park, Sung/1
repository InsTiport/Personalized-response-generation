Q. Well, Sung Hyun, you didn't get win you needed to today but you made a very good start:  four birdies in the first 11 holes.  How would you assess the day?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Actually although I didn't win I think I had a really solid, good round.  It's not easy to lower your score in the final champion's group, and I managed to catch four birdies.
I think I did a great job.  Obviously Jin Young was doing outstanding today.  Overall I'm pretty satisfied with my round.
Q. Obviously you had the lead in the final round.  How disappointing is it for you to not win even though you did play well?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Of course it's obviously very disappointing.  I think at this point that is all I can say.
It seems that after last year, again this year victory is just outside my reach.  I did a really good first round, but I'll be thinking about the second, third, and fourth rounds for a while.
Q. How crucial was that three-putt bogey on the 14th?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I think I actually putted quite well at the beginning.  I read the lie accurately but the ball descended someplace I didn't intend it to.
That was a very disappointing hole obviously.
Q. The world No. 1 ranking not there yet for you; still within reach.  What are your thoughts about that?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  There are still many event s left, and I think that's the type of goal you continue to work hard to reach.  There are events left, so I'll just give it my best shot.
