 Q.   Davis, that was an enormously eventful putt right there.   Give us your feelings right now.   You have a fourâ€‘point lead.   Are you just a little bit disappointed?   
DAVIS LOVE III:   No, we're not disappointed.   These guys birdied, I don't know, the last four or five holes, and our guys all played real well today.   We lipped out a bunch of putts, and we hung in there, but we haven't lost a segment yet, we're just going to try tomorrow and try to keep that string going.
