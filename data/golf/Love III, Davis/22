 Q.  The unexpected ending to the Spieth and Reed match, are you at all concerned at how they may play this afternoon?  
DAVIS LOVE III: I know Patrick is going to be mad.  Jordan is always a great competitor.  They'll come out and play tough.  Overall they played really, really well and wanted to get them back out there.  It's tough to sit anybody, but it's tough to sit them.
