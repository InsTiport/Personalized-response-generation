 Q.  Not being used to being reduced a spectator.  Are you surprised at how things have developed over the last half hour or so?  
DAVIS LOVE III: Both teams have been playing very, very well.  It's been unbelievable today.  Both teams have been playing great.  I watched a lot of that first match.  Those guys are making so many birdies.   
Rory is playing unbelievable this week.  Our gays are playing great.  I hate to see a few little putts missed.  I saw Zach miss a couple and some of our guys, as well.  You can tell the pressure is getting to everybody.   
 Q.  Must feel good to see J.B. Holmes and Ryan Moore, two captain's picks, get their first points on the board, as well?  
DAVIS LOVE III: It was great.  They didn't play bad yesterday.  Obviously, a little tight going out.  I knew today I had a couple guys on our team also saying they had a really good feeling about them.  They played well.  They could have ended that match a little bit earlier, too.   
The whole team is playing great.  I have been saying it all week, it's been hard to sit guys out on this team.
