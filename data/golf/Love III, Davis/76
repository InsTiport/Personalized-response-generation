 Q.   Thoughts on the first round of play.   
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Well, it was tricky out there.   I had a lot of bad shots and got tricked by the wind a few times and threw some shots away.   
But it's going to play tough all afternoon.   We got about three holes of a break in the beginning and then it just got really gusty.  
   
 Q.   Nice to be able to put some points on the board on the final hole?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Well, yeah.   I hit three good drives on three of the parâ€‘5s and didn't get any points.   I was kind of frustrated.   It was nice to finish with at least two points.  
Long way to go, but you can do a lot of damage in this tournament if you get on a roll.   Hopefully I can do something tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   How hard was it out there to fight this wind?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   It was tough.   I'm not a veteran of this course obviously, so a lot of guessing game for me.   It's a battle.   The greens are going to get faster and crustier as the day goes on.   Obviously the wind is not going to let up until the guys are almost finished, so it's going to be tough.
