   DAVIS LOVE III: I played well. I played better than I scored obviously. The last hole was really bad. There were a couple of other holes that were really bad. I just got away with it. Putted pretty well, made a lot of nice putts. Just disappointing to finish that way.  
  
  Q. What was the best part of your game?   
 DAVIS LOVE III: I putted real well. Except the last couple of holes, I putted real well.   
  
  Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?   
 DAVIS LOVE III: I'm playing pretty good. I'm just not getting much out of it. Another week where I could have done real well. I've got a chance tomorrow to get in the U.S. Open, look forward to that. Maybe go check a course out this afternoon and get the last hole out of my head and go play tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Your two back to back had to be unexpected?   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah. Tripling the last hole is unexpected too. It comes and goes.   
 But I'm putting real well. The greens are perfect. You can hit them if you make them good. It was fun. I missed a couple little bitty putts to start off with, and I missed a couple short ones in the end and made a couple long ones. Couple of nice ten footers for birdie. It balanced out.   
 I could have shot 4 or 5 under, and I could have shot 2 or 3 over.   
  
  Q. Does it almost feel like kind of a Major, you and Jim and Tiger and the guys all with similar numbers charging to big roars.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: It was. I wasn't paying any attention to the leaderboard. I don't know who's doing what. Saw Tiger's score in there at 12 under when we finished. I've been saying it all week. It's like I'm in a Major.
