Q. We were just asking if you had any quotes about today's round?
DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, I played bad.  Yeah, just never made any putts and missed a lot of fairways.  So just wasn't very good.
Q. How about the back nine in particular?
DAVIS LOVE III: Missed the putts and missed the fairways.  I'm hitting it solid, just not in the fairways.  Just can't play out of the rough.
