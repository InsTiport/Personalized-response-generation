  Q. Davis, 1-over 73 today to start, a little blustery day.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah. It was very blustery. I woke up with a really stiff neck, and didn't think I was even going to play. I only hit balls for about 10 minutes before I played. And then I started good.   
 I was 2-under real quick, and would have been 3-under, but I hit a wrong ball, so I started good, just got stiffer and stiffer as I went along.   
 So hopefully it'll loosen up. If not, I may be done for the year.   
  
  Q. Wait and see tomorrow; right?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah. I'm going to rest is probably what I should do.   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah. I can't turn my neck.   
  
  Q. Okay. I'll let you go.
