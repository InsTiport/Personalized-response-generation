 Q.   Today, kind of up and down all week for you?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Been up and down.   Today, I actually hit the ball real well and just made a couple mental errors, wrong club a couple times and couple bad drives and really didn't play that bad but bad score on a day where scoring was good.  
   
 Q.   Hard to walk away with a kind of a bad taste in your mouth.   You had it going a little bit on the backside.  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   I'm playing a lot better than I'm scoring.   That's disappointing.   Try to make something out of it tomorrow, try get one good round in.  
   
 Q.   How did the course play for you?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   I thought is played easy today.   It was calm, the greens were great.   Just a good day for scoring.   Saw a lot of guys shoot good scores.  
   
 Q.   Any idea on what they'll have to do tomorrow to finish up, and have you seen some of the pin placements?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   It will be a little tougher tomorrow, I'm sure.   It's always going to depend on the wind.   This course, the wind blows, it's tough.  
   
 Q.   After a day like today, what's your mindset going into tomorrow?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Just the same old thing, keep being patient, try to make some birdies and try to get it in the fairway and the greens here is the secret.   If you miss fairways, you're going to pay the price.
