 Q. Davis, just talk about the hole-in-one out there. 
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, the guys were hitting ahead of me, fortunately, and Heath Slocum hit a 3-iron and kind of cut it up against the wind. And Matt Avery hit a 4, and I knew that if I hit a 4 really good, it would be too much, so I kind of was just going to cut a 4 in there. And I hit the straightest 4-iron I've ever hit, and was right at it and hit, rolled six or eight feet and right in. So it was a good one.
 I made two 4-irons this year for hole-in-ones, and I think that doubled my output for hole-in-ones. It's been a good year for par-3s.

 Q. We've had three in this tournament. How many is this for you in your career?
 DAVIS LOVE III: I think that's five, four on the TOUR and two of them had been on that nine holes.

 Q. Oh, wow. 
 DAVIS LOVE III: I aced the other par-3 on that nine a few years ago. So that's a good nine for me.

 Q. You said your other hole-in-one this year was where?
 DAVIS LOVE III: No. 4 at Hilton Head. 4-iron as well.

 Q. Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. Hey, have a good off season. 
 DAVIS LOVE III: Thanks.
