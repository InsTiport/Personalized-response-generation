 DAVIS LOVE III:   It was trickier than yesterday for sure.  A lot of wind.  I didn't have the ball go right at the hole on the greens like I did yesterday.  It was a little bit more of a struggle, but I was patient and hung in there.  A long way to go.  Two more rounds.

Q.  How do you feel where you're at right now?
DAVIS LOVE III:   I'm feeling pretty good.  I haven't done anything spectacular.  I hit the ball pretty good yesterday and okay today, so I feel like if I can get the putter rolling and get some putts going in, I'll be in good shape.

Q.  You had a great shot at 18, same with 9, driving it into the bunker yesterday.  Do you feel a little disappointed on those two, not scoring the birdies there, or do you just have to say forget that? 
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, that one on 18 today, I left a bunch more out there.  I hit a lot of shots where I could have made birdies.  I hit a lot of good drives where I didn't hit it close enough to the hole to make a birdie.  I left a few out there, but with tricky conditions today, guys are going to do that.

Q.  So that means tomorrow if everything rolls, right you'll get a 63?
DAVIS LOVE III:   I hope.  That's what we are shooting for.  I'll get better every day so hopefully I will hole a few tomorrow.
