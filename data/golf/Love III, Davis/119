 Q.   1‑under 70.   Was your prediction that this course is going to be as tough as it is coming true?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   It is.   I think it's playing a lot like a U.S. Open.   Not quite what they wanted last year, but they got it this year.   The course is playing tough.  
   
 Q.   What was working for you out there today?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   I putted well.   Our whole group was 1‑under, and we all could have been better.   But I didn't drive it in enough fairways, and if you miss the fairways it plays really tough.   But I did hit a lot of good shots, and I putted well.   
   
 Q.   As Ryder Cup captain you're playing with a couple of potential team members in Hunter Mahan and Dustin Johnson.   A little scouting going on out there, as well?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, I got a little info on them, but I know they're going to play well.   It's fun to get out there.   I've played with Dustin a lot.   I haven't played with Hunter in quite a while, so it was good to get out with him.   I get more info from their caddies probably than I do from them, so it was good to be out with Johnny Wood and Bobby because they're all good guys, and they're all an integral part of the team, and we're all working together to get ready for September.
