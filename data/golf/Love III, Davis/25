Q. What do you think turned it around for the Europeans this afternoon?
DAVIS LOVE III: They seemed to birdie every hole.  They played really well.  We played really well in the morning, and we actually played pretty good this afternoon.  They just made a bunch of birdies.  Obviously Rory made a ton of them.
We just ran into a couple of buzz saws.  Our guys still played really well and I'm proud of them for fighting all day.
Q. What will the message be now that you have got one day out of three in the books?
DAVIS LOVE III: I thought we came out and competed real well.  Even the guys that were getting run over, buzz sawed still hung there and still kept making birdies and got these guys as far as they could.  Looked like for a while we weren't going to see this hole.
Brandt and Brooks, they played spectacular and I think everybody played a lot of good golf today.  It was a long day, frustrating a little bit to not come out a little bit further ahead.  I know Darren is happy with the momentum.
Q. With a 4-0 session victory this morning, will you have the same pairings go out tomorrow morning?
DAVIS LOVE III: Maybe.  I don't know exactly what we're going to do.  We've got to go back and meet with all the assistant captains and see how guys are feeling.  You have got to ask guys:  Are you tired?  Did this take a lot out of you?  No matter what we do, we put out four good ones this morning and four good ones this afternoon.  They just outplayed us in a few matches this afternoon.
