Q.   You came very close.  Did you have a number in mind today?  We talked about that the other day.
DAVIS LOVE III:  I thought today if I could get to 5-under, I thought I might have a chance.  That would have been plenty, 10-under would have been very nice.

I got off to a bad start.  I got some bad breaks on the par 5s on the first nine, and I played them 1-over.  That kind of killed me, and then I was fighting the whole rest of the way.
Q.  How was the course playing in terms of wind and all that?
DAVIS LOVE III:  Well, the wind was not as strong but it still played very hard, and it was tricky and the greens were very hard and fast.
Q.  For a minute there you had a chance to go to 6-under and it looked like it might almost be enough to get into a playoff.
DAVIS LOVE III:  Yeah, it was kind of one of those up-the-hill-and-slow ones, I didn't hit it hard enough.  A little two-putt and 7 will be the number, but 6 would have been a lot better than 5, looking at all the ties.
