  DAVIS LOVE III:   It was tricky this morning.   Most people don't realize, it was cold and windy and all it takes is a little bit in alternate shot to get you messed up.   We knew we had some really good bestâ€‘ball teams for this afternoon, so we just stuck with them.  
   
 Q.   One of your assistant captains told me that they think the crowd here might be worth a point, point and a half.   How important is it for you to get the crowd involved?   
DAVIS LOVE III:   You've got to get them involved.   We didn't do a very good job of that right out of the gate this morning.   They were here in the dark this, and we came out a little bit flat right in the beginning.   Now obviously we're getting the crowd into it.   The sun is out, and they're excited.   This could be a good afternoon the way it's starting now.
