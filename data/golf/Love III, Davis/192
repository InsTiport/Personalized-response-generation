  Q. 66, I think it was catapulted by the great play at 18. The second shot was pretty spectacular.  
 DAVIS LOVE, III: Bad drive, great second shot. Sometimes you get right out of the rough. The ball bounced up there. Nice to get a birdie there and got me on the role for second 9 nine.  
  
  Q. Doesn't seem like the Davis of old. You're close to being healthy, aren't you?  
 DAVIS LOVE, III: I'm close to being healthy and close to playing well. I've got to be patient and wait for something good to happen rather than try to force it. I tried to shove it at pins where I shouldn't have been.   
 Should have hit in the middles greens. I got away with it a couple times coming in, made some good up and downs. I'm hitting it well enough to play well. I've just got to stay with it.  
  
  Q. I followed you around, lot of family and friends. That must be fun for you.  
 DAVIS LOVE, III: It's nice to play here. I get a lot of support anywhere in North Carolina but especially around Greensboro. Hopefully I give them something to cheer about this weekend.  
  
  Q. Keep it going.  
 DAVIS LOVE, III: Thanks.
