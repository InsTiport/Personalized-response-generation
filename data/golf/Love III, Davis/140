 Q. You got yourself in the hunt for tomorrow?
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, I did. Pat is obviously playing well. I haven't studied the leaderboard, but I caught a glimpse of it on 18, and it looks like Pat is 14-under maybe. I didn't get it as close as I'd like, but I moved up a little bit and I'm improving every day, so that's a good move.

 Q. By and large are you pleased with your round?
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, by and large. I'm hitting the ball real well. I mis-clubbed a couple times and I missed one little putt, but other than that -- you always have a couple you could have gotten in. But as I said, 2-under the first day, 3-under the second day, 4-under today, so hopefully tomorrow is my really good day.

 Q. Seve Ballesteros did pass away today. Your thoughts about Seve and his passing?
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, he was an icon of the game, and we all looked up to him, and he inspired a lot of people. It's a big loss. He's one of those guys that you think is going to live on forever like Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer. They're always going to be there hitting miraculous shots. It's a sad day.
