Q. Just a couple comments. Still right there in. Just a few comments today.
DAVIS LOVE, III: Yeah. I didn't quite get the putts to go in today. I didn't have the speed the last two days. Kept leaving them short. Hit one too hard. Lot of them were short. I didn't get them to drop. If I can get back to making some putts, I'll -- seems like there's some low scores out there. Got to get on a roll. Today I was flat.

Q. How much does the crowd motivate you, obviously you're one of the favorites here by far? Does that give you a little extra?
DAVIS LOVE, III: It's nice to have support out here for sure. It was a fun day. I just -- I hit the ball well, hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens. I just didn't get anything going. Unfortunately, I didn't get a good score. Still hitting it good. Might be in a really good position tomorrow to come from behind.
