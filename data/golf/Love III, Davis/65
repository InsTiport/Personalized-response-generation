 Q.   Davis, just a quick comment on your opening round today.   
DAVIS LOVE, III:   Not very good.   I hit the ball pretty well, except for three or four shots, and then just let a chance to shoot a good one get away from me a little bit today.  
   
 Q.   I know we've asked before, but in terms of all the hosting duties and stuff and everything tonight, how hard is it to sort of focus on your game?  
DAVIS LOVE, III:   I was ready to play.   I came in, I practiced a lot last week, had a good week getting ready.   I'm a little‑‑ my back's a little stiff, probably a little tired, but playing wise, I should have done a lot better.   Just hit, like I said, couple bad drives.   
I had it going and then drive it in the marsh at 13, and missed the fairway just on the edge on 14 and 15 and 18.   That just killed me.   You can't play out of this rough very well.
