Q.  Is this a course where anything can happen tomorrow?
DAVIS LOVE III:   I don't know.  We saw one low score.  So they are out there.  But, you know, it's hard to say till you play it.  Guys protecting the lead, the greens get smaller maybe.  I don't know, they are playing good.  It would take probably a real low and out of the guys 7 , 8  , 9 under to catch up.
Q.  Pettersson just 5 putted, how hard is it to protect that on this kind of course?
DAVIS LOVE III:   You're trying to hit the ball into the middle of the greens anyway.  Sometimes that's hard to do and you're shooting away if pins.  Sometimes you can make a tentative swing trying to     instead of trying to hit it at one, you're trying not to miss the green.

I think sometimes you've got to get refocused.  It's like at Augusta, you shoot away from the pin all day, you get bored and you get lazy.  I did that with a couple of wedges today and a couple long irons.  Instead of shooting it right at the pin, I could just hit anything up there.  I was trying to make sure you let the wind bring it just enough to get it on the green so it doesn't go over and you start thinking other things.
Q.  Do you feel better about your chances if the wind blows tomorrow?
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, I don't know what today is doing or what the other guys are doing.  I've just got to make more birdies.  I made maybe three today.  I've got to go out there and make six or seven probably to have a chance.  There's going to be a lot of guys shooting at it.

I'm in the good.  I like my chances either this week or next week or the following week, because I'm hitting good; I'm just not scoring great.
