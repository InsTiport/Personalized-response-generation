 Q.  Since 1975, this is the first time the Americans have swept the morning session on a Friday at a Ryder Cup.  How did your team do it?  
DAVIS LOVE III: They have come together really over the last couple of weeks.  It's been an emotional trip for this team the way the picks went down.  Obviously with Arnold's passing was a shock for both teams at the start of the week.  Just little things that made this team bond together really well.   
From top to bottom, all 18 of us have really come together, supported each other.   
It's a good start.  But it's long way to go.  There's a lot more points out there.  Keep doing the same thing over and over every session.   
 Q.  A lot more points in the afternoon as well.  How does something like this dictate what you might do with your afternoon pairings?  
DAVIS LOVE III: It's tough.  We had four wins, so you are going to sit out some guys that won or you are going to leave a bunch of guys on the bench.  I think top to bottom we are all playing really well.   
The guys that are getting ready to go out there, we've had some conversations and they are ready to go.  I think we've got a good lineup no matter which four we put out at a time.
