  Q. The things you mentioned yesterday, one hole like last year at Pebble Beach kind of was like speed bumps. How did you fare today?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: I played a lot like yesterday. I could have been a lot better, but any time you're under par at the U.S. Open you're in pretty good shape. I keep hitting it down the middle of some fairways and not taking advantage of it, so it's a little disappointing. You know, normally you'd be happy at 1-under after two days, but now you're way back, you're ten shots back. But again, stay under par, you're in good shape.   
  
  Q. You try to avoid looking at the scoreboard obviously, but when you look up, Rory has got almost a lap on everybody. How do you keep it in perspective?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: You know, you've still got to go play and just play your own game. Certainly I didn't see 11-under out there for sure, but 5 or 6 for sure, and that's what I felt like I should have been, so at least I'd be in range of him if I'd have got everything out of my game.   
  
  Q. Is that in you for tomorrow, to get everything out of what you know you can do?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, just keep plugging away. It's a long week. It'll get a little bit tougher on the weekend, so just keep plugging away.
