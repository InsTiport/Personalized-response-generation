  Q. Some general comments on the round?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: It was erratic again. A lot of good and a lot of bad, and you know, really, I feel bad that my strategy let me down a little bit. I got a little aggressive at 12 and tried to knock it on the green out of the bunker and got in another bunker, which we've said all along, you don't want to be in the bunkers.  
 I was close to playing well. I just, you know, shot at a couple of pins and got a little aggressive in a couple places. And then I had not 3-putted all week and then two 3-putts hurt. So I'm still in it, I guess, but I threw away a lot of shots today.   
  
  Q. When you say "the strategy." Was that to be aggressive?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: I wanted to try to go for it at 12 in the bunker and put it in another bunker, because you don't want to be in the bunkers here at all. That was a mistake; I thought if I laid up with a wedge I would have made 5 at worst. And then I wouldn't have been frustrated going to the next hole and I might not have made six.   
 So two sixes in a row, more mental mistakes than physical mistakes, is what really shot the round.
