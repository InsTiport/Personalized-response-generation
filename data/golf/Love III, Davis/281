DAVIS LOVE III:  Any time I hit a bad shot, he was always right there and kept us right in the match.  If it was not for a couple of putts that didn't go in, we would have finished earlier.


Q.  The birdie at 12 and kind of, you know it looked like you were in trouble on 13, the par  5, and you squeezed that out with a halve. 

KENNY PERRY:  Hit probably the best 6-iron I've hit in a long time on the 12th hole.  Hit it four feet right under the hole a perfect place to putt from and we both drove it bad on the next hole, and he hit a beautiful recovery iron and I hit a wedge probably eight feet ten feet past the hole.  And thank goodness K.J. did not roll the eagle in there. 


Q.  How about it, Davis, are you going to go this afternoon? 

DAVIS LOVE III:  I told Jack that I would prefer to sit out and rest for Saturday and Sunday but that I would play because it's really only half a match in the afternoon.  He said he would let me know when I got done.  I don't want him to keep Kenny out for sure, and some of these other guys are playing good, so I would be happy to sit out and watch.
