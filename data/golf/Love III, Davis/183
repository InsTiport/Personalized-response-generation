  Q. Good round out there today.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, it was a good score. I actually played better today than any other day. I hit a couple of bad shots, but missed a few putts that probably woulda, coulda, shoulda made. I made a few early on the back nine.   
 Seems like I make a good score on the front, then I don't get a good one on the back, and vice versa. I need to put it all together tomorrow to catch these guys.  
  
  Q. How much difference does it make playing in the Kona wind?   
 DAVIS LOVE III: 17, I'm used to hitting 8-irons in there and I'm hitting 5-iron. It looks like big green until you start trying to hit a 5-iron in the wind coming off the left rather than an 8-iron off the right.   
 It throws you a curveball, because you're so used to doing things the same way every time, hitting 4-irons off of tees that you normally are hitting driver off of, you have to think. It's almost like the British Open, if the wind turns around, all the strategy gets thrown out the window and you have to start thinking a little bit.   
  
  Q. You and Kenny both shot 5-under, but he's still under the weather.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, he wasn't feeling too good, so his 5-under was probably better than mine.
