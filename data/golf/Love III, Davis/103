 Q.   Historically, as you're well aware, the United States has not feared very well in these team pairing things, but it's been just the opposite this week.   How do you explain it?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   They are playing really well.   These guys make my job easy.   These guys came in really prepared.   They came in playing very well.   They went out with guys they like to play with and they are having fun.   
I think that was really the key is that they bought into if they just went out and played their game with their friends, they were going to have fun and play well.   And they have done that, really except for Saturday morning for about nine holes, they have done that all day the last two days.  
   
 Q.   You know well that the largest come back in history was in an event that you played in, and that was only four points and it's entirely possible that you could have a lead larger than that.   You told us this morning, the idea is not to get them to look ahead, so now what do you tell them?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   Now we just get them to think about where you want to play tomorrow; do you want to go first, do you want to go last, middle, so let's go back and get some rest.   We are going to have a fun night tonight and just come back out tomorrow a little bit more rested, because we had some guys sit out today and then we get to sleep in in the morning.   
I'm just excited that these guys are having this much fun.   Everybody is out here watching golf now and this is what the Ryder Cup is all about; this team enjoying being out here.
