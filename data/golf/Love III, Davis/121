Q.   How do you balance what you have forthcoming with the competition and trying to play here?   Where is the line?
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, I'm more focused on playing, until someone asks me about it.   It's been a lot of work, but I try to do that on my off weeks.   I'm just enjoying it.   I do have a lot of conversations with players and friends and stuff about it. 
But it's ramping up more and more.   So I'm going to have to be a little more cautious with my time from here to the end of the year.

Q.   You win out went out here in pretty good shape.   What was the key to scoring on this course today?
DAVIS LOVE III:   Like any day here, you have to keep it under the hole and keep it on the fairway.   I didn't shoot at quite as many pins.   But it's tough the course has been set up almost exactly the same every day, same firmness and same green speed.   If you make a little mistake you're going to make a bogey, probably, so it's really tough out there.   You just have to be cautious and persistent and very patient. 

Q.   And the best thing about your round in terms of avoiding those pitfalls?
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, I drove it pretty well and I putted pretty well.   I didn't get into too much trouble.   But I think I was cautious off the tee, and that helped.   I think if you get it in the fairway, it doesn't matter if you have a 4‑iron or 7‑iron sometimes, you're not going to shoot at the pin anyway.   You have to be parrot and keep it under the hole as much as possible.
