DAVIS LOVE III:  Unfortunately I had to come back.  I had such a bad start yesterday, and I'm still a little bit rattled from the bad start yesterday.  I hung in there today.  I drove the ball very well, even yesterday.

I've got to score better.  You never know what's going to happen on the weekend.  If I get one hot round, I might be able to get close enough.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DAVIS LOVE III:  It was much better today.  It wasn't great, but it was much better, but I think I learned a lot this week about how to fix it when it goes and stuff I need to do to keep it loose.  I did a lot of stretching yesterday.  I feel a lot better about it.  I think I'll be fine for the weekend and for Augusta.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DAVIS LOVE III:  Well, I realized about halfway through the round today I missed the cut at Pebble when I was defending.  I said, you don't want to get in the habit of this because you've got four of them this year.  So I started buckling down.

I hit some bad shots into greens.  That was disappointing.  I think I just wasn't relaxed enough to hit the ball close to the middle of the greens.  I kept missing greens, especially the par-5s, except for 9.  I was hitting at the par-5s and missing the greens.  That was a little disappointing.

I look forward to the weekend, but I want to get back in the golf tournament.  The only way to do that is to get back closer -- I want to get back to at least under par.  I didn't quite get there, so another quick start tomorrow.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DAVIS LOVE III:  I had a little morning massage and did a lot of stretching, some stuff in the trailer.  I spent all afternoon trying to get to where I could play today.
