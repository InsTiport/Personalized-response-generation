 Q. I don't know if you know this, but that last putt on 18 was worth 165,00 extra. 
 DAVIS LOVE III: That's why I made it, because I wasn't thinking about anything. I'm not supposed to be looking at the scoreboard, and they put it right behind where I've got to look at it (laughing).
 I knew it was important and knew I would get second if I birdied the last hole. The wind turned around and I hit a great drive, but could hardly get to the green. I putted good and made a couple of putts on the last two holes and made up for some I missed earlier. 
 Happy to get off to a good start in Hawaii and looking forward to next week.

 Q. It was tough wind conditions out there, and it would blow into the face on holes it was supposed to be downwind and switch. You made great adjustments. 
 DAVIS LOVE III: It was crazy. Experience helped. Even Camilo said, You threw it up in the wind past the hole and it came down perfect. I was thinking, and, yeah, been out here since 1986, we've learned a few things. 
 This course is fun to play no matter what. I say it all the time. It's not fun to walk, but it's fun to play. And you know, when the wind changes, you've got to be creative, and we certainly had to do that today.

 Q. When you see Geoff at 24-under par playing the 18th hole, what does that make you think? 
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, I caught a glimpse that he was 17-under at one point, and then he just ran off. Something made him mad I guess, somewhere coming up on the 9th fairway, and then I guess he made eagle and went nuts. This is a great course for a guy that hits it like he does. If I would have got up-and-down a few more times and made a few more putts, I would have been a little closer, but I don't think I could have got to him.
