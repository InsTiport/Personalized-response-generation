 Q.  Condition of the course. 
 DAVIS LOVE, III:  This is probably the best we're going to catch this course.  By the turn it had gotten a lot tougher.  All the moisture was out of the course and it certainly played harder. 
 It was very tricky out there.  Make a mistake on the wrong side of the hole and you will pay the price. 
 I got off to a good start and didn't shoot myself out of it.  I didn't get behind the eight ball. 
 I don't think 8-under is going to be leading. 
 You have to get off to a good start.  There are no easy holes out here.  The course is drying out fast and unless they water them, the greens are going to get crusty. 
 The nice thing is, they can finally do what they want to, they can dial it in right where they want it.  It's perfect right now.
