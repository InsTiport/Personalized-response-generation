  Q. How did it play today?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: It played pretty tough. You had to be in the fairway. Even though I made a birdie on the last, on 9, out of the rough, it was with a sand wedge. It's just hard to get it close if you're in the rough. And then the bunkers are almost worse than the rough. You can't catch it solid out of the bunkers. Hitting the fairways is really important.  
  
  Q. How about the finish on the back nine; you played it in even par, pretty important way to play it?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Yeah, you don't realize it until you see what everyone else is doing, how hard they are. Again, if you get them in play, it's all right, but as soon as you miss a fairway, every hole is hard, especially the long ones coming in with the lakes. You've just got to hit a lot of good shots, and it's a tough course. You're going to see a lot of birdies, but you're also going to see a lot of bogeys and doubles.
