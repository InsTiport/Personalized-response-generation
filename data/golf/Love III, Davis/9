Q. Twice a Ryder Cup Captain, three times an assistant on The Presidents Cup team but never a Presidents Cup captain.  Give us your perspective on this week, what you saw from the American Team.
DAVIS LOVE III: Well, they came in excited and ready to go.  You know, Steve has been talking to them, really all year, about being prepared, being rested, being fired up about it because of the momentum we had from the last two year, in Korea on The Presidents Cup and obviously last year at Hazeltine.  We wanted to keep that momentum going.
Q. You've been around for a while.  There's some talk this week that this may be one of the best teams for a number of reasons.  What did you see?
DAVIS LOVE III: Well I saw they have really come together over the last couple years.  These guys, they are famous for traveling together and having fun together.
The thing is, they support each other so much, and that was a big message the last couple teams is you guys get together, support each other.  Don't listen to the outside noise, because they talk about the Americans don't care or they don't try.
You see these guys in the team room are working hard on the golf course; they are trying sometimes too hard, and I think they finally figured out how to relax and play.  It showed the first couple days here that they just came out, you know, guns a-blazing.  I'm proud of them for what they have done, really, the last three Cups is they have changed the attitude for our U.S. Team.
