Q.   I'm just curious as to how anxious Tiger may be to get out there.
DAVIS LOVE III:   He's very anxious.   He came in around the corner, carrying his own bag smiling, and then he stole one of our carts.   He's excited to get out on the golf course.   I think that's really what everybody on our team needed was a break at some point.   Phil gets his break this afternoon, and he was asking for his break.   After all that great golf, he wanted his break because he knows how important tomorrow is going to be.

Q.   With this kind of a lead, is there some kind of danger? 
DAVIS LOVE III:   Yeah, thinking about the outcome.   What I keep telling these guys is we're not even halfway over with this tournament so far.   There's a lot of points left, let's keep doing what we're doing.   They're buying into it.   They're playing great.   They like what's happening so far, and they're just going out there and playing golf.
We saw it a little bit with a couple guys this morning that were a little bit tight, a little bit anxious, but they're going right back out there, and when you get in this format you tend to free up a little bit, like we saw Tiger and Strick play much better in the afternoon than they did in the morning.
