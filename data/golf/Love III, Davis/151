 Q. Just 4-under par good solid start to the tournament?
 DAVIS LOVE III: Good start to the day. Good start for the playoffs. And I hit the ball pretty well except for a couple of drives. 
 And it was kind of putting for birdie a lot today which you needed to do on the early morning with the good greens, nice to get off to a good start.

 Q. Seems like course conditions are good for scoring today with being a little wet and not a lot of wind out there?
 DAVIS LOVE III: The wind's starting to get up. I think afternoon it will obviously be harder. But the greens are real soft. If you get on the fairway you'll shoot at the pin. And these are tricky greens. So when they're firm and fast, it would play a lot different. So a guy gets on a roll can shoot a low score.

 Q. Talk about your goals for the next four, five weeks, what you're trying to get accomplished?
 DAVIS LOVE III: That's my goal, the next four or five weeks. You want to keep going. I'm right about, you know, the cut-off for next week. So you've got to move up every week. So anybody can win, but you gotta move on to the next week. So I'm focused on just playing golf every day and trying to put all the other things, FedExCup, you know, winning the tournament, making the Ryder Cup, a whole lot of distractions, just go out and play and have fun.
