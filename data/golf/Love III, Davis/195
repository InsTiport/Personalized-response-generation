  Q. First couple days?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Good scores, high winds, and tricky. Glad to get it in, and, you know, afternoons on Fridays when the wind is blowing is usually the toughest day of the week. I'm glad to get in under par.  
  
  Q. What words will describe those conditions?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: It's frustrating because, you know, you never really can get comfortable. It's never really an easy -- an easy shot or an easy hole. You catch some downwind, but they're still tricky because the greens are so firm and fast. It's an uncomfortable feeling when the wind is blowing that hard and the greens are that fast.  
  
  Q. How is your confidence going into tomorrow?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: It's good. I'm hoping that the weatherman is right and wind blows down a little bit. Maybe we can make a few more birdies. But, you know, I'm hitting the ball pretty good and happy about the round I'm playing.  
  
  Q. What do you think will be a winning score here?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: I don't know. It's all going to depend on the wind and weather. Rain and calm makes the scores go down, and hot and windy makes it go up. So it just depends on how hard the wind blows this weekend. The course is not easy, and the wind makes it even harder especially the par 3s, the holes around the water.  
  
  Q. How do you adjust your game to that?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: We're getting pretty used to it. It's pretty windy a lot this year. Last week was windy. You just try to be patient and take what the course gives you and don't try to force anything.
