Q.
Well, you're in position.  Do you have what you need to close the deal on Sunday?
DAVIS LOVE III:  I think so.  I'm cutting pretty good.  I missed a few, but the ball is bouncing around out there and I'm feeling better about it every day this week.  I didn't shoot the scores I wanted to early in the day, but I'm feeling better and better, so if I get the ball in play it's anybody's ballgame.

Q.  How is your health?
DAVIS LOVE III:  It's pretty good.  My back is a little stiff.  Three straight weeks, and digging out of this rough too many times the last couple weeks, but I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm excited about tomorrow.  Darren is going to be a great front runner, he always is, so we're going to have to be aggressive, but I'll get the ball in the fairway and get some birdie chances starting off and anything can happen.
