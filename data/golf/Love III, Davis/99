  DAVIS LOVE III:   I don't have a reaction yet.   We are all kind of stunned.   We know what it feels like now from the '99 Ryder Cup.   It's a little bit shocking, and you know, we were playing so well, everyone on our team was playing so well, we just didn't figure it didn't matter how we sent them out there. 
But we put who we thought was our hot players up front and who we thought was our steady players in the back that would get us point and we all thought it would come down to Jason Dufner and he played very, very well.   We got a couple matches flipped there in the middle that cost us.
