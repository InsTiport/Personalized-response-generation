  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, it seemed boring on the card, two birdies and a bogey, but I made a lot of nice putts for par. And it was tough out there today. I thought it was really tricky. If you didn't hit really good tee shots, really good second shots, you weren't going to have any chance for birdies. I guess I kind of survived a day that was pretty tough.  
  
  Q. Do you attribute that to the winds in the afternoon?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, I think somebody forgot to hit the water-the-green button last night, and the greens picked up some pace and dried out, plus the wind. It was just a little trickier today.   
 They weren't going to get a whole bunch of 7-unders today like they did the last two days.  
  
  Q. There have been a record low number of balls hit in the water on 17 this year. Any particular reason in your opinion?  
 DAVIS LOVE III: Well, I think wind direction is helping us. It was up against you a little bit the last two days but not blowing hard, and it's played short. They've had some short yardages. I was shocked today that it was 116 front.   
 So tomorrow, back right, with a northwest probably or northeast wind, it'll be a little different, I think. We'll see some more 8-irons in there.
