 Q.   Here with the host, Davis Love III.   Davis, another big round here for you.   You've gotten off to some pretty hot starts here coming off that Ryder cup captain seat.   What is the comfort level you have not only playing, but playing a course you play quite a bit?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, it was nice today.   It was a little soft, so it was hard to get the ball close to the hole with the wedges and stuff.   
We all hit it in a lot of fairways in our group, and we had a lot of birdie chances.   We all could have shot a little bit lower than we did.   But Zach didn't get off to a start with birdies and I did, and he made them all on the second nine.   I told him we'd be a good best ball team.  
It was nice out there.   The greens were perfect, so you felt like you could make every putt.  
   
 Q.   What kind of adjustment have you made in year three to all the responsibilities you have off the course and being able to combine that with good playing?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   The only adjustment I've made is more Red Bull to keep my energy up.   After the Ryder Cup, I've been playing these last two weeks, I'm ready to play, the responsibilities, the parties and all that are a lot of fun, but when I get up in the morning, I can tell I'm not getting a whole lot of rest.  
But I'm feeling good.   I'm excited to play.   Obviously I had a great pairing, so it was easy today.  
   
 Q.   What is going to be the key ingredient to actually taking this through all 72 holes?  
DAVIS LOVE III:   Well, I've been hitting a few bad shots every day the last two weeks.   Today I hit one bad drive off No. 1, my tenth hole and a couple bad iron shots.   Other than that, I hit the ball really well, so just being patient, being consistent and not trying to think about winning.   Just going out and playing and having fun.
