 Q.  What are you feeling right now?  
DAVIS LOVE III: I'm just proud of these guys.  They had a lot of pressure on them for the last two years.  And every time we picked a guy, there was more and more pressure on the team and more and more questions, and I'm just proud the way every one of them played.  It was a great team effort.  I've never seen a team come together like a family like this.  So much has happened over the last week.   
Unbelievable golf.  The Europeans played just some stunning golf.  I told Rory McIlroy it was best month of golf I think I've ever seen.  I'm just proud of them.  They hung in there all week.   
 Q.  What was this day like for you with the shifting tides, the European team took three out of the first five matches.  It looked like their strategy might be playing off or potentially might pay off.  At what point did you start to feel comfortable?  
DAVIS LOVE III: About 20 minutes ago.  We saw the board get really blue when I was on the first tee and I felt like in the past that I've hung around and not supported guys correctly on Sunday.  We took off as soon as Zach got on the tee, didn't even watch him hit.  Just took off and starting watching guys.  And all the assistant captains seemed to go to the right guy at the right time and would make some putts or make a birdie or win a hole.  So I think we had a good strategy laid out by all these guys to support these guys all day and make them feel like they were not out there by themselves all of a sudden in singles.
