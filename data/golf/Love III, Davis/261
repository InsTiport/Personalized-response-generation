Q.
Well, I know you left some out there, but are you happy with 3-under?
DAVIS LOVE III:  I left some out there but also saved a bunch so I came out about even.  I made a few bad shots and I made a few nice saves, but I missed a few birdie putts, too, so they're out there if you can just stay out of trouble.
Q.
Are you happy with your game?  Do you feel like you're where you need to be?
DAVIS LOVE III:  As I keep saying, I'm pretty close.  I hit the ball better today.

I had a little talk with Jack Lumpkin last night and I hit my short irons better today than I have been, and I drove the ball pretty well except for a couple of tee shots.

So I'm ready for this week and I'm ready for a few practice rounds at Shinnecock, and I'll be ready for the Open.
Q.
It's amazing how a 6-, 700-yard course can be so challenging, isn't it?
DAVIS LOVE III:  Yeah, this is a very tough golf course.  It's a course that will frustrate you.  You can play pretty good and get bad bounces and not get a good score, and guys that scramble around good can get away with a lot sometimes.  It's like a U.S. Open.  You have to be very patient and take what the course gives you and not try to force things.
Q.
I know we got a little rain last night, did that help the course at all today?
DAVIS LOVE III:  I didn't see much difference today.  I think it was just enough to keep the grass growing, but they say it might rain this afternoon and that might make a difference if they get a half an inch or more.
Q.
Overall you're pleased with your first round?
DAVIS LOVE III:  Overall.  It was a good start.  You want to be under par here, and 3-under is going to be a good score every day, so if I can put three more of those together, it might be nice.
