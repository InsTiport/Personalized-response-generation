Q. You had something you had to do and you went out and did it and you made your way to next week?
BRONSON BURGOON: I've been playing well, and I tried not to think about the FedExCup points.  Just go out and play my game.
I played really well.  The only hiccup I had, I had a complete mud ball on the second shot on the par 5 in the middle of the fairway and I ended up making a 6.  Besides that, I don't know how many greens I hit but it felt like a lot.  It was good.
Q. Does it feel good to be under the gun like that and get it done?
BRONSON BURGOON: Yeah, I love that.  Unfortunately I just don't put myself in that situation enough.  I play better when I've got a little bit of pressure on me.  I always have.  I just need to start playing better the first three rounds.
Q. Looked like over the summer, you had a good little three-week stretch to get yourself in the FedExCup, and you were struggling before?
BRONSON BURGOON: This year has been a struggle to say the least.  I broke a rib early and I battled through the Fall Series, and even worse on the West Coast.  I felt it start coming around right around Houston, Byron Nelson.  I was like, it's coming.
It wasn't out of nowhere for me.  I knew it was getting better.  Even when I missed the cut at the Travelers, I felt the game coming.  I'm playing well.  I'm looking forward to the next few weeks.
