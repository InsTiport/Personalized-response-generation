Q. How would you assess your round today?
BRONSON BURGOON:   It was good.  I started out playing really well, back nine was a little bit of an uphill battle for me, my swing kind of got a little loose.  I held it together nice though.
Q. Knowing that this is usually the toughest -- obviously there's only two courses this year and this is normally the toughest of the three -- do you feel good about the 4-under number you put up today?
BRONSON BURGOON:   Yeah, absolutely.  This is a tough golf course.  I mean, if you're not hitting it in the fairway you're going to struggle to make pars.  The greens have a ton of slope, they're really quick this year, probably the best I've ever seen them.  Yeah, absolutely completely satisfied with 4-under.
Q. Did you see any different hole locations tee boxes used this year that you hadn't seen in the past?
BRONSON BURGOON:   Not tee boxes as much as hole locations.  There was a couple different pin placements, which made it even tougher to make a few more birdies.
Q. Seeing some of the scores you've seen over at Pebble, weather is supposed to be a little bit different tomorrow, do you feel like you need to go out and put up a good one tomorrow?
BRONSON BURGOON:   Yeah, Pebble you can obviously get it.  It's in perfect condition, they don't have the rough up, so if you're putting good, hitting it in the fairway you're going to have a lot of looks.  So I'm just going to try to do what I'm doing and hopefully make a few birdies.
