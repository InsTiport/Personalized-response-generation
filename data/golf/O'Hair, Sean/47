  Q. Good position going into the weekend. Can you talk about it? Do you feel like you've positioned yourself well?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I finished the last two holes of my first round today, this morning, and I doubled my last to shoot even, so I felt like I needed a really good round.   
 I was shooting for 6, but I got 5, and I'll take it. It's definitely playing difficult, you've got to be hittin' fairways and greens out here, but if you're doing that, the greens are rolling nicely to where you can make birdies, so I feel good where I am going into the weekend.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like having that quick turn-around, I think it was under fifty minutes, helped? There was no stewing about that.   
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, definitely, absolutely. You kind of were already warmed up and ready to go and you had been on the course, so I think it definitely helped.   
  
  Q. All of the sudden you have the hottest teacher in the game, looking at the rumors. What is that like to see Shawn getting this attention?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: He deserves it. He's worked hard and I think he's the best at what he does, and he definitely deserves it, and I'm happy for him, not just him as my coach but as a friend, so it's nice to see.   
  
  Q. Thanks.   
 SEAN O'HAIR: Thank you.
