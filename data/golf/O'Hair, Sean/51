  Q. How about the round today. 1-under on the front, 4-under on the back; how were you able to have such success today?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I gave myself some good opportunities for birdie, made some nice putts. And I only had one bogey, so I kept the big numbers out of play.   
  
  Q. And birdies on 15, 16 and 17. Do you think you can keep that streak going into tomorrow?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I'd like to think so. You know, I'm hitting the ball well, and I'm putting it nicely, so if I can just stay away from the mental errors, you know, hopefully it'll be a good weekend for me.  
  
  Q. And as it stand right now, you're three back from Y.E. Yang. How do you feel going into the weekend about your chances?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: Good.  You know, like I said, I think I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and stay away from mental errors, and if I do that, I should be good.
