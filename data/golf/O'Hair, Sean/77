  Q. All in all, a good week?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: Putter was average, but I'm very, very pleased with the way I'm playing right now.   
  
  Q. And your thoughts about what Geoff was doing out there?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, sometimes you just catch on fire like that, and obviously a player of his stature, I mean, you get on fire like that and you win by six or seven.   
 So he obviously hit the ball great and probably putted well. I didn't watch any of the telecast or anything like that, but that's pretty impressive.   
  
  Q. So as far as a great way to start the year, do you come out here with a lot of momentum?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: I think so. Coming into this week I felt very good about my game and where I'm headed. I think this is proof that I'm headed in the right direction and I just have to feed it into next week.   
 You know, I need to obviously focus -- when I'm there next week, I need to focus on the tournament and not what I did this week.   
 You know, I feel like I'm working on the right things with my coach, and I feel like I'm a little bit smarter and a little more seasoned.
