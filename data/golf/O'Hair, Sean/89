 Q.  Wind is going to keep picking up this afternoon -- 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I don't know, I didn't really look at the weather today.  I heard it was supposed to keep going.  I heard it was supposed to be about 25 later on today, so that will help me out. 

 Q.  Did the rain yesterday and last night make the greens a little bit softer for the morning guys? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  You know, they have been kind of soft all week.  Today I hit some shots that finally started spinning back a little bit.  You know, I think the greens have been so soft that they just hit and stop, and today I think was the first day that I actually saw a few balls spin back. 
 So really, that's the only difference I saw today. 

 Q.  Did you get any surprises on putts or anything? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  You know, the greens were a lot, a lot quicker today than they have been, just, you know, overall.  And so I kind of felt that on the practice green and just kind of took a mental note of it and just rode with it. 
 These greens, I was pretty fortunate today to play early because the greens really were nice.  They rolled smoothly and they are just tricky.  Some putts look like they are going one way and the grain might take them the other way and you're just scratching your head, you know, how does that happen. 
 You know, the greens were a lot better today. 

 Q.  How did the first five holes on the front feel, were you in a little bit of a zone there? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I made a nice up-and-down on 1, and I birdied my -- 

 Q.  The back nine. 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Oh, yeah, that was great.  You know, I played really solid on the front, and missed a few easy putts.  Then 10, had a nice little wedge in there and made the putt and went from there. 
 I hit a beautiful second shot into 12 and made the putt for eagle, 5-wood.  And just kind of got me going a little bit. 

 Q.  What kind of lie did you have on 14, the second shot? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  14 was a good lie.  It was a pretty straightforward shot.  You know, the only tough thing about it was judging the speed, how firm was it going to land on the green and how fast was the chip going to be, because it was pretty much straight downgrain. 
 You know, it came -- I hit it a little bit thin from what I wanted, but I think it actually helped me out because the chip just rolled like a putt.  So it went right in the hole. 

 Q.  Not to be picky but what happened on the putt on 18? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Well, looks downhill and straight downgrain, and I didn't really think the wind was going to have much of a factor in it and it was a fairly slow putt.  I asked Montana in there and he said all of the guys were talking about how much slower 18 green is than the rest of them.  So that makes sense, because that putt should have been there.  I hit that putt many times, and that's a lightning-fast putt. 

 Q.  Did you get a read off Retief's? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I was looking at more of how -- he was a little bit different.  He was a little bit off the side a little bit, so his putt went completely different than me.  I asked him after we finished the hole if he hit that pretty firm and he said he gave it a pretty good hit. 

 Q.  Was this tournament on your schedule originally? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Yeah, this was original on my schedule. 

 Q.  You said you were a little tired on Thursday -- 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Well, I think a lot of media stuff Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and just things that I'm not used to, a lot of people coming up to you and you don't really get a whole lot of time to yourself and practice time where you're just able to go off and do your own thing, which is normally the case for me. 
 And so it took a little bit of adjusting to do.  So mentally, I think I was just a little bit drained.  Last week was a tough week and was just such a grind with the weather and the golf course.  I think I didn't take a day off.  I played in the Monday Pro-Am, played Tuesday, played in the Wednesday Pro-Am, so I really didn't have the chance to take a break mentally. 

 Q.  Did you feel different today when you woke up? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Yeah, I feel a lot more rested.  I feel a lot more rested.  I didn't practice yesterday and that helped me out today. 

 Q.  You did a lot of work Thursday after your morning round, you were out there until almost five, was there something this that practice session that clicked in today? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  No.  Just continue to work on what I'm working on.  I've been working hard, really all year, and I wasn't too happy with that round on Thursday, so I just felt like there was a little bit of some things to work on with the putting and on the range. 

 Q.  Can you take us inside the mind of a hot golfer, when you started to heat up between 12 and 14, what are you thinking between shots, or trying not to think? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Really not much.  Just trying to just continue to just keep doing what I'm doing.  I just felt like I was allowing it to happen.  You know, it's almost like you've got to stay out of your own way.  You can't think about what you're shooting.  You can't think about what you want to shoot.  You just have to take it one shot at a time, and I did a good job with that. 
 That finish is pretty difficult today.  I mean, 16 is a pretty difficult hole today, and 17 can get away from you, and 18 is all about the drive and not making a mental error with the second shot.  So I was very pleased with today, and I feel like I'm striking the ball nicely.
