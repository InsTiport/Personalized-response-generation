   SEAN O'HAIR: I think it played fairly easy today. The wind kind of died down at the end of the day. The greens were a little bit, you know, bumpy.   
 But I think if you hit it close, it's like throwing darts out there. If you hit it close, you know you're going to make some putts and make some birdies.  
  
  Q. Looks like you'll be about 5 back; what do you think of that going into Sunday?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I'd like it a little bit closer. I don't mind my spot. I think with a really good round tomorrow, it should be out there tomorrow whether the wind blows or not.   
 I think if the wind blows, the scores are going to be a little higher, if not, it's going to be a birdie fest out there.   
 But I'm playing well, hitting the ball really well, putting it great, so I've got what it takes. I've just got to go out and do it.  
  
  Q. Looks like the weather is going to be favorable tomorrow.   
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, it will be nice. I'm kind of getting tired of these nine- and ten-hour days where you show up and you've got a two or three-hour rain delay. So it will be nice to keep some momentum going.  
  
  Q. Can Chez hang on? He's got a guy that's never won before?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: I have no idea, nobody really knows except Chez. Chez is a great player. He's won some big titles as an amateur. I don't expect him to fall back at all. So, I think, you know, I think we've got to chase him.
