Q.   The eagle on 18, you couldn't hit a better putt and it not go in. 
SEAN O'HAIR:   Wasn't meant to be, but all I wanted to do was give it a chance.   I thought I made it.   It looked good the whole way.   One of those things, just wasn't meant to be.

Q.   Was this really a day of patience?   You par every hole on the front side and yet you're still in it and you play the back nine 3‑under starting with a birdie on 10. 
SEAN O'HAIR:   I wasn't really scoreboard watching at all, but coming around the 9th green, I saw the scoreboard and no one was really playing that great. 
I was expecting Stricker to make a run today and, you know, the leaders were falling off and I saw Harrison was playing nice and solid on the front. 
I figured just some good, solid patient golf and just play the proper shot and don't really force anything and I felt like my game was good enough to give it a run, and I did just that. 

Q.   You were so good out of the bunkers today, three for three. 
SEAN O'HAIR:   Yeah, I really have been working hard on some different parts of my game and that's one of the big things.   Last two years, bunker play has just been horrendous and that's always been kind of one of my strengths. 
So I'm just trying to get back to some things that I used to do.   Really been working hard on short game and the putting. 

Q.   11‑under, you should hang around. 
SEAN O'HAIR:   I don't know, 18 is to be had, but we'll see.   I'll hang around.   Hopefully there's a playoff.
