Q. Nice round of golf, you found five birdies and only one bogey out there.
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, it's funny, I didn't really feel that comfortable out there today.  Didn't really hit the driver that well, but I hit some nice iron shots.  I duck-hooked a tee shot into the water on 11 and made up-and-down for par somehow.  Hit it in the water on 3 on the par 5 and hit it on the green, and had a nice 2-putt par there.  So just little uneasy with the driver in my hand.
Q. Just looking at the numbers, you hit four of 14 fairways, but you hit 14 of 18 greens.
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to get away with that the next three days.  I think I was pretty fortunate to shoot what I did, hitting it where I did off the tee.  So I'm going to go work on it and see if I can't find a feel.
Q. Must be very comfortable on the greens, though?
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty good on the greens for awhile now.  Short game has been kind of the biggest thing I've tried to work on is just trying to get the scrambling a little bit better and I thought I did a good job with that.  That definitely helped out.
