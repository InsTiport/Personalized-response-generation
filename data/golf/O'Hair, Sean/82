 Q. 6-under par, very nice round. Took a little while, though, to complete that round. Tell me about your success in the first round. 
 SEAN O'HAIR: I hit the ball really well, hit it close, and I putted well. Put those two together, and you're going to shoot a good score.

 Q. This is your first time at Glen Abbey obviously?
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yes, it is.

 Q. What do you think of this golf course?
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I like it. There's some goofy greens, but all in all, it's a nice layout. I like the way the fairways shape and it's kind of a shot-maker's type golf course. I wish the conditions were a little bit drier, but they're doing a good job trying to get the golf course as best they can for us.

 Q. Talk to me about the chance on 18 there, near miss there. 
 SEAN O'HAIR: Just hit a good putt. I was just thinking good speed, and I would have taken a two-putt. It looked like it was going in there for a second and just kind of lipped out. I was happy to come out with a birdie there.

 Q. You've got to turn right back around now for round 2. Your thoughts on just getting out there and keeping the momentum. 
 SEAN O'HAIR: Just keep doing what I'm doing. I'm hitting the ball really nicely. I've got a good feel, and just do what I did today, for the first round.
