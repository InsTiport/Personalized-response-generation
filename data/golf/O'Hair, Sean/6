Q. First of all, welcome back to the TOUR Championship.  I know you're happy to get back to Atlanta for the first time since 2009.
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, it feels good.  Last couple weeks have been a little frustrating.  I would like to put myself in a better spot going into Atlanta, but just to even be a part of the field is just very special.
Q. Recap your whole season for us up to this point.
SEAN O'HAIR: It's been really close to being a really big year for me.  I'd play a solid, maybe three rounds of golf and I just don't put that fourth round together.  Ball striking is really good and I just don't take advantage with my putter.  It's right there, it just feels like it's right there.  I just got to be patient and all the tools feel good, I feel like they're there and it's just a matter of letting them come out.
