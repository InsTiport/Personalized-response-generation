   SEAN O'HAIR: Obviously I was pretty happy with the final result.  
  
  Q. You've had some success here. I mean, you played pretty well the last two years. Do you think you're in position now to capitalize even more?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I've just got to give myself more opportunities. You know, if I'm going to contend this week, I definitely need a big, big Saturday round. But you know, I can't really say, hey, I'm going to go out there and go low until I start giving myself more opportunities. I just haven't done that this week. I've done a really good job of just kind of keeping myself in it for making a lot of up-and-downs for pars, and I'm chipping the ball nicely this week.   
 I'm driving it nicely, I've just got to hit more greens, and when I do I've got to get closer to the hole so I can get more realistic birdie opportunities. You know, all that is is just maybe a couple good swings here and get some confidence, and then you go on a roll. You can definitely get on a roll on this golf course, that's for sure.   
  
  Q. Is today maybe a little bit more like the course was during the practice rounds?   
 SEAN O'HAIR: It was similar. Yeah, it was similar. The greens have been fairly receptive all week. They haven't ever been really firm. Green speeds have been pretty consistent. Like yesterday afternoon with the rain, they were getting a little sticky. But yeah, it's been a pretty consistent golf course all week. You know, I definitely can't complain about that.
