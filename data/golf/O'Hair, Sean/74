  Q. You just finished 3-under par today, but who was that little fan with you?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: That's my daughter. That was pretty cool to see her coming up on 18.   
  
  Q. She must be happy about daddy's round. How is daddy feeling about it?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: I played solid. I hit the ball really well. I putted nicely, too, didn't quite make a lot of putts, but my speed control was good and I left a couple in the throat a little bit at the end. But all in all, I felt like my round was pretty solid.  
  
  Q. A little scary when you think about what the round could have been. You had birdies at 2, 7, 12 and 17 and only a sole bogey at No. 8. Give us some insight into how the golf course was playing.   
 SEAN O'HAIR: Well, it's playing tough obviously because of the wind. You've got a lot of cross breezes and tee shots are tough. Obviously if you're in the rough all day, it's going to be a long day for you, so it's crucial to just hit fairways and hit a lot of greens and just try and give yourself as many chances at birdie because you're going to make bogeys out here, it's just trying to make it up with the birdies.  
 It was just a nice, solid day, and obviously I'm not going to play like that every single day, so I think if I struggle or have a tough day and I'm not hitting as many fairways and greens, you've just got to make it up with short game. But I felt pretty solid about today.
