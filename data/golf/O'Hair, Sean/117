Q. Has the novelty worn off?
SEAN O'HAIR: I think it is still impressive. You have to remember, she's 16-years-old, she's playing against men twice her age. That's not easy. The average age out here, if you're young, you're in your late 20s out here. Let's face it. I'm shocked that she's 16-years-old. I think we have to all remember that. She may know peak in her game until she is in her mid-20s, maybe even later than that. From what she's already proved, missed the cut a couple times by a shot at 15-years-old, that's pretty impressive.
Q. Does she have a chance to make the cut?
SEAN O'HAIR: If she doesn't, she will eventually. It's not a matter of if, just a matter of when. That's my opinion. If it's this week, who knows? I think she's playing well enough to do it. She could possibly do better than just making the cut. But I don't want to put any pressure on her. So, I think she's got a lot of stuff going on for her this week.
Q. She could make her first paycheck against the men this week.
SEAN O'HAIR: (Laughing) I told her, don't beat me too bad this week. She can do whatever she wants, as long as she is behind me.
Q. You got your invitation to the Masters. Any thoughts there?
SEAN O'HAIR: I've got a lot of things I want to do with my game. And I think they are possible if I work on the right things and have the right attitude. Try and peak. There is so much involved. Practice habits, how much you are playing, what you're eating. The whole nine yards to peak at the right time. I'm learning, I don't have the formula yet. I'd like to be competitive at that event. I think I can if I keep my head on.
