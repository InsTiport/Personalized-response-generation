Q. Strong performance just up the road there in Dallas; here you are again after a nice start at the Colonial.  What's been behind this resurgence?
SEAN O'HAIR: I'm just making some birdies and it's making it easy for me to score.  Short game has been a little bit tighter than it has been the last two months, and ball striking is there as well.
So I just feel like I'm playing well all around.
Q. Given your immense experience out here on tour, I would imagine any time you get to venues you've liked or done well in the past, it's like, Well, that's a week I can really turn it on.
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I always feel comfortable in Texas.  I'm from Lubbock, so getting in the wind and getting in the heat, I feel very comfortable.  It's obviously great food and great people here, so it's always a pleasure to come back to Texas and play.
Q. You've made a lovely start.  All the best over the rest of the tournament, and may you improve upon last week.
SEAN O'HAIR: Thanks, appreciate it.
