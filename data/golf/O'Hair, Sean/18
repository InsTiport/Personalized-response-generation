 Q.  Just talk about your round today and where you find yourself going into tomorrow.  SEAN O'HAIR: Played very well today.  Started off a little shaky, but kind of calmed down on the back nine.  I think I hit pretty much every green on the front nine, so that helps things.  Made a few putts.  Left a couple putts out there, but all in all was very happy with my round.   Q.  Does the crowded leaderboard do anything for your mindset on Sunday, make you focus a little more?  SEAN O'HAIR: No.  I mean, I watch the leaderboard.  I'm not going to say I don't watch the leaderboard.  But you know, I can't play someone else's game.  I feel like my game has been really solid and I just feel like just keep doing what I'm doing, and it paid off at the end of the round.   Q.  You last won in 2011.  Do you feel any added pressure being back in this position again?  SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I don't feel any pressure.  I actually feel like a weight is lifted off a little bit.  You know, I'm just happy to be in this situation again.  This definitely beats struggling, I can promise you know.  It's just fun.  It's a lot of fun.
