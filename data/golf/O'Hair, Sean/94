  Q.  How was your round?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Hitting the ball well.  I'm hitting the short-range putts, they are pretty good.  My speed on the greens on long putts are struggling right now.   
 But all in all, I think it was a decent start.   
  
  Q.  How hard is it in this heat?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  It's pretty tough.  I mean, it's important to obviously stay hydrated and eat something and stay energized.  So it makes it that much more difficult, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Worst heat you've ever played in?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  This and Baltusrol a couple of years ago was pretty bad from what I remember.   
 But this is a close second, if not first.   
  
  Q.  Will you hit balls now or do you call it a day?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  No, I'll probably do some short game work.  I might hit ten golf balls just to try and get a feel.  But I felt like overall I was hitting the ball fairly well.  And so I might do some putting afterwards but I'll pretty much take it easy.   
  
  Q.  How do you like the course?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I love the golf course.  I think it's a great golf course.  You know, you've got the slopey greens, you've got really small greens on some holes, and you know, every hole is different.  Every hole has got its characteristics, and I think this is one of the best golf courses I've ever played.   
  
  Q.  Birdies and bogeys?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I couldn't even go through the round.  I can't even remember to be honest with you.  I don't even know how many birdies and bogeys I had.   
  
  Q.  Did it play sort of like you thought it would during the practice rounds, or were there any differences?   
 SEAN O'HAIR:  You know, it's playing firm.  I think as the week goes on, it plays firmer and faster and the greens were a little quicker than they were yesterday I think.
