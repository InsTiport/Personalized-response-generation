   SEAN O'HAIR: I think it's awesome. You're going to be able to play for your country at the Olympic level, I would believe it's kind of The Ryder Cup, but added to, because you're playing against the whole world. 
 I think it's huge for the game. I think it's great for the Olympics. You know, I don't see any negatives to it. I think it's fantastic.

 Q. What would it mean, not necessarily knowing where you'll be in seven years, but to play for your country? 
 SEAN O'HAIR: Even with these things, you want to represent your country and I think that this is almost a little bit more fun than playing by yourself on TOUR. 
 So playing in the Olympics and having a chance to win the Gold Medal and be a part of kind of the Olympians that we watch, because I always watch the Olympics. I watch the Winter Olympics, the Summer Olympics. It's going to be a lot of fun to have that opportunity.
