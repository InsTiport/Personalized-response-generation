 Q.  If you make a little more money on this tour, you could buy this golf course and blow up the last couple of holes and not have to deal with them anymore. 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  The last couple of days were a struggle on those last few holes, but that's the name of the game. 

 Q.  You played great.  You've got to be really encouraged. 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  Yeah, I've been really working hard this last couple of weeks, just trying to kind of get where I want to.  Short game and putting was fantastic this week. 
 I felt like, you know, it could kind of ease up on -- I didn't have as much pressure on my ball-striking this week, and I guess it helped me a little bit today, especially, because I felt like, you know, hey, you're going to miss a lot of greens today and get up-and-down. 
 But, no, I felt like I played not great; I mean, I just kind of bunted it around today.  And unfortunately, I just didn't quite get it done at the end. 

 Q.  But in the wind, it was not a bad strategy and it was working? 
SEAN O'HAIR:  I think that's all you can do when the win is blowing as bad as it was is just kind of get it around and find a way to get the ball in the hole. 

 Q.  Are you going to play any more this year? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I'm playing in the last two.  So hopefully I can build some momentum from this event and kind of, you know, maybe do something the last couple of weeks.
