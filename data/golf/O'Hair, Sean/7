 Q.  You're a poster child for what can happen in the FedExCup Playoffs.  You were 108 and you're now forecast to be 16th; when did you realize something special was going on during this round?  
SEAN O'HAIR: Not until now really.  I made a putt on my first hole today for birdie, and I told my caddie after the round, I said, once I made that putt, I knew it was going to be a big day for me.  Yesterday I played really well.  But I didn't have that comfort level on the greens, and today I did.  So it just was nice to get a good round in, and obviously a lot of things are happening right now.  So it seems to be a big day.   
 Q.  Tied for second, look forward to next week at TPC Boston; what are your expectations and your goals now?  
SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I think just keep playing solid.  I feel good about my game.  It's all right there.  I've just got to put four rounds together.  I haven't won in a long time, so that's kind of my goal.  I'd like to win.
