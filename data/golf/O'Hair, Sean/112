SEAN O'HAIR:  You know, kind of a joy to be the defending champion, been kind of cool, so if anything it's actually helped me a little bit.  But you know, you can kind of sneak into that situation, but I just kind of    coming into this event, I expected that there was going to be some added pressure, so I just kind of said, let's enjoy it and have fun with it.
Q.  Greens a little harder out there or still pretty soft?
SEAN O'HAIR:  They're soft.  They're still soft.  They're not bad, they're just soft.
Q.  Tournament official was there a little bit, what was the discussion going on there?
SEAN O'HAIR:  No, we were just talking about something.  No big deal.
Q.  It wasn't anything scoring wise?
SEAN O'HAIR:  No, no.
