Q.   Sean O'Hair, 1-over 72 in the second round.   Decidedly different conditions.   Talk about your day.
SEAN O'HAIR:   You know, it was kind of a windy day on that front-9.   It was kind of sketchy, lot of crosswinds, and I felt like it was playing pretty tough. 
I felt like it was really hard to hit fairways and greens which is what I did really well yesterday.   But I did a really good job just kind of getting some up and downs and hung in there.   The wind kind of died down midway through the round and made some nice birdies on -- can't remember the holes but 15 -- 14 and 15 and had an unfortunate swing on 16 tee again, in the water, made double.   All in all, I'm happy with how I played.   Like I said, I didn't have my best stuff and I kind of did a good job of getting it in the hole today.

Q.   Do you like the layout of this course?
SEAN O'HAIR:   I love it.   You got to hit a lot of different types of tee shots and you can hit a variety of shots in the greens and, like I said yesterday, it's just really demanding.   It expects everything out of your game. 
This is a course that you can hit some really good shots and you get some bad breaks and, you know, being in the rough on -- around the greens and you got to have everything.   You got to have your short game and got to have a putter and that's what I love.   I love tough courses like this.   It brings out in the best in me, I think.

Q.   If you knew on Monday you'd be sitting in this position after two days, would you have taken it?
SEAN O'HAIR:   Absolutely.   You know, like I was telling these guys, I'm not going to let one bad swing ruin the day for me.   I fought well today and, like I said, I didn't have my best stuff.   I'm going to go on the range and try and fix it a little bit and hopefully have a good weekend.
