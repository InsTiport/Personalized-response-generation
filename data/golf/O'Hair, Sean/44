  Q. You got it to 7. Did you assess that you had to go full throttle?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I think when it's the first day, you just kind of -- you don't really read too much into it, you've just got to keep going. I think especially in this game out here with these guys, you've just got to kind of keep the foot on the gas, to be honest with you. You know, maybe with five holes to play on the back nine on Sunday, you kind of start thinking about it. But I was just trying to just keep going.   
  
  Q. How were you thinking walk off there? Are you happy with 5?  
 SEAN O'HAIR: No, I'm happy with 5. I wasn't too upset with the bogey on 17. I mean, that's just a difficult tee shot. And I felt like I hit a pretty solid second, and I actually executed the third the way I wanted to, just kind of misjudged it.   
 You know, the three-putt on I believe it was 15 was a little disappointing, but all in all, I was very pleased with how I played. So that's what I've got to take away from it.
