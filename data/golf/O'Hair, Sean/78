   SEAN O'HAIR: The last couple of days I've been doing a better job, taking advantage of some of the shorter holes and shorter par 5s and some of the par 5s. I really put myself in some nice positions with the driver and made me able to get my chips closer to the hole and make some putts. 
 All in all, I feel very happy with where I'm going. 

 Q. Your win last year in Tampa was one of the windier stops on the PGA TOUR; does that feel like an advantage?
 SEAN O'HAIR: It doesn't matter. If it blows or it doesn't, it doesn't matter. We are all going to have the same conditions, no matter what. 
 So the guy that's going to play the best is going to win. That's just my goal. 

 Q. Can you just comment on the day for us. 
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I didn't quite hit the ball as well as I did yesterday, but I kind of found it on the back nine. You know, I'm hitting it really nice. I've been hitting it nice all week and rolling the ball on the greens really nicely, and everything is right there. 
 I just need to get it in the hole. 

 Q. Comment on the next two days; Geoff's put a little bit of distance.
 SEAN O'HAIR: Geoff's playing good, but it's 36 more holes. I don't know what the weather is supposed to be, so I'm just taking it each day and see how we stand going into the back nine on Sunday.
