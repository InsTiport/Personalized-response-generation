Q. You've given yourself a jump towards East Lake?
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I think someone told me that I was pretty much guaranteed the BMW, which is huge.  Especially with the fact that I just wanted to just kind of survive this week, so very pleased.
Q. When you start 106 and you basically know it's go hard or go home, do you have a different mentality coming in?
SEAN O'HAIR: You know, it's funny, I always feel like I play my best when my back is up against the wall for some reason.  I don't know what that means.  I don't know what I do differently.  I just seem to play a little bit better.  Obviously you know showing up, you can't play average.  You've got to play well and that's what I did.  So I was pretty proud of myself for that.
Q. You're not going anywhere right now where you sit.
SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I'd love to have an opportunity to, I don't wish any ill will on anybody, but I would love an opportunity to win the thing.  That would be fantastic.  See what happens.
Q. At what point were you thinking about position, and at what point were you thinking about winning today?
SEAN O'HAIR: I only was thinking about winning today.  When I made the putt on 1, I knew I had something.
Yesterday, I hit the ball really well yesterday and I just got nothing out of it because I putted just awful and was really tentative on the greens.  Got out here today, spent a lot more time on the greens, which I normally don't do.  When I made that putt, I just kind of felt something.
So it was nice to birdie the next and kind of made a nice up-and-down on 3.  I kind of just rolled with it.
