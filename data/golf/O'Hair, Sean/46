   SEAN O'HAIR: I think I've been playing a lot of golf this year, and I felt like I hurt it Thursday when I was working out. I had some tight hamstrings the last few days, and I think that hasn't really helped. It's been pulling on my back a little bit. My trainer thinks I've got a bulging disk, so hopefully it's not too bad.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: It's disappointing, but it's not the end of the world. I mean, it would be nice to play really well in front of everybody, but at the end of the week it's just another golf tournament. I'd love to play well at this golf course, but I can't control my back. I'm just going to do my best, and who knows, it might actually take the pressure off and help me play even better. I'm just going to take it in baby steps.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: No, actually I felt like my distances were fairly on, spot on, so I don't think it affected my distances or anything like that. It was a little bit -- I was trying to be a little careful at the beginning of the day. Like I said, I was a little surprised how well it went. It's just a little bit sore right now.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: I'm not sure, just I've got a lot of friends and family out there, which is always fun. This golf course, I think, is probably one of the best golf courses that we've played all year. It's in the best condition I've seen all year. And being in front of a home crowd and sleeping in your own bed is fun, so hopefully we'll have a good week.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, it really kind of depends. This is the start of a four-in-a-row for me, and I don't like to play four in a row, especially the fact that my back is hurting. I'm kind of questioning that decision a little bit. But I'm just going to try and tough it out a little bit.   
 You know, I think even if this place wasn't in my home I'd still want to play on it because it's such a great golf course. I don't know if that answers your question.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: You know, I missed only two greens today. I hit 16 greens. I think I only missed three or four fairways. I putted really nicely. I was all over the hole all day, and I shot 1-over. I don't think the score represented how well I played today. I didn't play great, but I played solid.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I don't think it hurts. I don't think it hurts at all. I think the only thing, playing at your home course and playing in front of the home crowd, I think the only thing you can do in a negative way is just put too much pressure on yourself, but I don't think I've done that. You know, and I'm not feeling great, so my expectations have come down quite a bit. Like I said, that actually might help.
