 Q. That was a pro comeback. 
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, that just was a strange way to start off the back, double, double. I hit the ball great for 27 holes, you know, and all of a sudden I started hitting it sideways, and it was kind of like, where did this come from? 
 I asked my caddie after the second double, I said, "What do you think is going on?" He said, "I just think you're hitting a lot of crappy shots back-to-back." 

 Q. Did it make you laugh when he said that?
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, a little bit. So I just decided to kind of hang in there, and it was nice to make those birdies coming in.

 Q. Three birdies in a row, did that kind of make you say, okay, I'm fine?
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, our goal was to make four birdies coming in. I made those three back-to-back, and then the par-3, 7th is a pretty difficult hole today. I had a great putt on 8 that looked like it was going in the hole and left it short, and then 9 I had a really good chance and that kind of upset me a little bit that I didn't make that.
 But it was a nice comeback, and I think I've got a lot of good things going for me over the weekend.

 Q. You make three birdies in a row and you give yourself birdie opportunities coming in, so you know going into the weekend that you're hitting the ball well?
 SEAN O'HAIR: Yeah, I hit the ball well basically for two straight rounds. I mean, great. And there was just two weird holes. I've just got to get rid of the weird holes and I'll be okay.
