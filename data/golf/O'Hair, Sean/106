 Q.  Just talk about your round a little bit today.  Obviously playing in the afternoon the winds tend to pick up here, but it seems like it hasn't been whipping like it might traditionally.  Did you notice any difference between the morning round yesterday and the afternoon today? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  You know, the wind both days has been tough to read, especially when you get out in the trees.  But I've been happy with that.  Like you said, it's not crazy as far as how the wind can get here in the past. 
 Today was definitely playable.  I left quite a few shots out there, but I felt like if you just positioned your ball properly and make a few putts here and there, you can post a pretty good round. 

 Q.  135 through two rounds, you sit five shots behind one of the best players in the world.  You said earlier you don't really expect him to fall back.  Obviously you're not thinking of a number at this point, but what are you going to have to do differently to drop a 62, 63 out there? 
 SEAN O'HAIR:  I think -- like I missed a few short putts where I hit good putts where I hit them a little too firm and had those lip-outs.  And then I hit a few bad clubs here and there and maybe got aggressive on a few shots. 
 Like today I kind of left I'd say at least three or four shots out there, and I think keeping up with Ernie this weekend, it's kind of one of those things where today I've got to turn my 6-under -- excuse me, my 5-under round into a 7-, 8-under round. 
 You know, I think for me, game-plan-wise, keep giving myself opportunities for birdie because I think these greens are so small, if you have opportunities for birdie, you have a legitimate birdie chance.  That's just my game plan, and hopefully the putts fall.  Obviously you can't force it out here, but just giving myself as many opportunities and hopefully something happens.
