Q.  What was the course look today?
BOB ACKERMAN:  It was nice.  The wind died down and it made it play a lot    it's never easy, but it was a lot easier than with the high winds.  And they had the tees up on 9 and 18, so that helped a lot too.  The greens were smooth, the fairways were great, it was just ideal scores conditions for this course, so it was good.
Q.  How was the advantage playing this morning?
BOB ACKERMAN:  When you tee off first you got perfect greens.  7:30, first tee time.  Plus I like getting up early and playing early.  And then having a nice lunch, which is what I'm on my way to do now, but, yeah, the greens are perfect.  So that's always, for me, a good time for me to play.  So I lucked out, I got two good tee times, 7:30 and 12:30.
