Q.
How did practice go for you today?
BOB ACKERMAN:  It was great.  I wanted to get out here    I'm teeing off here tomorrow at 7:30 on the 10th tee.  And I wanted to get out here and tee off at 7:30, but I overslept, so I ended up teeing off about nine.

The winds, it was different today than it has been the last three days, so it really made the course play a lot different.  So I learned a lot about playing this course from a different wind direction.  So that was very helpful.  The more you play here, the more you get comfortable with the type of grass and the wind and the way the golf course plays and what clubs to hit.  So, yeah, it went really well.
Q.  Feeling confident about tomorrow?
BOB ACKERMAN:  Yeah, I do.  I worked hard to get my game ready for this tournament.  So I feel like I'm competitive and I'm ready to play, I'm ready to compete.  I'm tired of practice rounds.  I enjoy them, but they don't pay you to practice.  So I'm ready for the gun to go off and test my skills.

And I think pretty much my all around game, as long as I can stay concentrated and focused, I think I can do really well here.  I like the course, it sets up really good for my game.
