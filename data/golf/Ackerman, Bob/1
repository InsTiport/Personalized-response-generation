Q.  Played pretty consistent today and yesterday, so can you tell us about your round at all?
BOB ACKERMAN:  Yeah, I hit the ball really well and I just had a bad putting day today.  So I shot 3 over par.

Geez, I think I 3 putted one, two, I think I 3 putted three times on the back nine.  And then I missed, I only missed one green in regulation on the back nine, you know.  And I shot 3 over.  So I just had one of those days when I just was, I missed a couple short putts early and then I the that kind of shakes your confidence.
Q.  Was the wind a factor at all?
BOB ACKERMAN:  It was hard to stay still over the putts.  That was a factor.  And then I, you know, I hit the ball really well, I just didn't score.  And I did make a nice, I made about a six footer on 16 and I made a nice par save on the first hole from about eight feet.  I figured I worked on my putting the night before and I thought I had it down pretty good.  But I just am tentative.  Tentative with my putting and so I just, you know, I just had one ever those days.  I'll do a lot better with it tomorrow.
Q.  Do you feel confident about tomorrow?
BOB ACKERMAN:  Yeah, I'm hitting the ball.  When you're hitting the ball, you know, it opens up a lot of possibilities.  So I hit a lot of greens, had a lot of birdie chances and so if I can just figure out my putting I can drop my score considerably so and the greens are nice.  There's no excuse for not knocking them in.
