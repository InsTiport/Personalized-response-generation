 Q. Your impressions of the course?
 BOB RALSTON: It's a good golf course. I played well. It's a great golf course. 

 Q. The changing winds play much of a factor?
 BOB RALSTON: It shifted around and it would be against the wind and by the time you hit it it would be downwind. 

 Q. So club selection is tough?
 BOB RALSTON: Really tough. I hit some really good shots and come up short or hit a really good shot and have it go too far. I'm really impressed with the golf course though. It's really good.
