 Q.  Today wasn't the day you wanted, but I imagine there's probably a lot of good to take away from the week.  
AUSTIN COOK: Definitely, it's only my seventh event, so to be able to come in, have a lead on Saturday night and be able to keep myself in contention -- that's two or three times now.  So it wasn't -- ball striking just kind of disappeared today and I think everything just didn't go my way today.  But that's how golf happens and look forward to a week off and coming back at the Waste Management.
