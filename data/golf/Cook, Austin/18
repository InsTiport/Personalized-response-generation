 Q.   Just a recap, obviously incredible position heading into the weekend.  
AUSTIN COOK:   Oh, man.   It was unbelievable.   It was great.   Started out, birdieing my first hole.   Got the juices going a little bit, but bogeyed the next one.   Settle me down.   Little wake-up call, let's go.   And just kind of real steady from then on out.   I'm really, really comfortable with my swing and my game right now, and it's kind of showing.  
   
 Q.   Little bit of history.   Have you played here?  
AUSTIN COOK:   I played here once, came down for -- we had a little small tournament one -- one-day tournament in college, and when we had some bad weather.   We came down and played, and that was my sophomore year.   So probably about four, five years ago.   But I've been out here.   I was actually out here practicing six months ago or something like that, whenever I was playing some Adams events and somebody was out here.   I've seen it, but it's been awhile since I played it.  
   
 Q.   My last question, how does your mindset change prior to two rounds ago, you're in the tournament, you know, I don't know what your goals, expectations were.   Now here you are pretty much at the top of the leaderboard, heading into the weekend.  
AUSTIN COOK:   Mindset is not going to change.   Had a pretty good mindset the last couple days.   Just staying focused.   One shot at a time.   Really not trying to worry about anything else and just stick to my game and play the best I can play.
