  Q. Had such a great week, a great day.  How would you assess everything that went on today?
 AUSTIN COOK:   You know, overall this is the best finish in three years since the win.  Game is on the right track.  It's kind of an emotional day.  It's been such a grind to get back here.  Just being back in the moment, I loved it, and I can't wait to do it again.
 Q. How do you take this and springboard into better things?
 AUSTIN COOK:   Yeah, no, I haven't -- gosh, I don't know if I've broken four or five under in two years.  I just can't make that next step.  I did it multiple times this week and it's been huge mentally for me, and be able to take this into the next coming weeks.
