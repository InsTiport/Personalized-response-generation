 Q.   What a great day for you to play in the final group on Saturday at the Shell Houston Open.   Get to play with Phil Mickelson and have the lowest score in the group.   Like I said, this has to be just a great day, Austin.  
AUSTIN COOK:   It was a great day.   Overall an incredible day.   Lot of fun to get to play with Phil in front of that crowd.   Hadn't played in front of that kind of crowd before, and it was a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   If you had to pick someone to play with, Phil is great because he has so much experience and yet so talkative.   I know he made you feel at ease out there.  
AUSTIN COOK:   He did.   Thinking about playing with him, he's a pretty big name in the sport of golf, but it was a lot of fun, and like you said, he was very comforting and easy to talk to and it was a joy to play with him.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about that birdie at 17, because that is just stealing.  
AUSTIN COOK:   That was a steal.   It was aiming at the middle of the green and the wind kind of pushed my hybrid at the right a little bit.   I had about 10 feet and able to make it.  
   
 Q.   You led the tournament for a good portion of the day.   Were you a leaderboard watcher?  
AUSTIN COOK:   It's hard not to notice it.   I was not trying to not look at them because they're everywhere and pretty big.   You'll notice your name up there.  
   
 Q.   Great job and you got a chance going into the final round.  
AUSTIN COOK:   Thank you.   I appreciate it.
