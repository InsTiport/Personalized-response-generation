  Q. Austin, I hope you're happy your with your performance.  You hit so many good putts and played so aggressively down the stretch to give yourself a chance to win this tournament.
 AUSTIN COOK:   Yeah, overall it was a great week.  No matter what happens.  It's been a long time coming.  We've really, worked really, really hard on the game, so I'm happy to see some results from it.
 Q. Of course everyone out here has a sad story to tell, but you hit so many putts that tickled the edge, including here at 18 on the 72nd hole.
 AUSTIN COOK:   Yeah, you know, that's one thing I been working with my mental coach.  You do what you plan to do and execute what you want, and then the result you just kind of push it aside no matter what happens.
 I hit the putt like I wanted.  An ounce more speed would've been great, but it is what it is.  I keep hitting /H-G good putts, so we'll just continue doing that.
 Q. Is there any hole, any shot that you wish you could replay?  Maybe the 16th hole?
 AUSTIN COOK:   Yeah, there were a few holes probably, few short putts.
 But in the end I'm happy with what I did.  Happy with where my game is right now.  You know, we got put on the clock there an 16 and just kind of rushed a few shots and a few putts.
 That's all that it is.  It's a good building block for the next tournament.
