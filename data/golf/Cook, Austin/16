 Q.   Austin, just overall a tremendous success on the week.   Obviously not ideal finish today, but you got to be pleased with yourself and how well-composed and everything the week went.  
AUSTIN COOK:   Overall it was a great week.   Right now I'm tied 11th.   I would have liked a Top-10 for the tournament.   Overall it was an incredible week.   Couldn't be happier with how I played.   Last few holes are long for me.   I hit 3-wood in on both 18 and 17.   Nothing you can do about it.  
   
 Q.   What do you take away from it as far as taking your game to the next level?  
AUSTIN COOK:   Confidence knowing I can play with these guys.   Once I get out here, I'm going to have a bright future ahead of me.  
   
 Q.   What are your plans scheduled from here?  
AUSTIN COOK:   I don't know yet.   It was -- probably do more Mondays trying to get some sponsor exemptions, Web events so I can get into those and get on the Web as soon as I can.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a tournament that is lined up next?  
AUSTIN COOK:   An Adams one in a couple weeks.   Probably not going there anymore.  
   
 Q.   Do you try to go Web or try to go Tour route?  
AUSTIN COOK:   I don't know.   I'm going to have to do some talking to some people.   I'm not sure the logistics of everything with being able to get in the finals with not being a PGA member.   I'm not sure.   I'll be going -- it will be mostly Web Mondays and doing a lot of PGA Mondays also.
