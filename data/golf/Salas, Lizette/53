 Q.  Talk me through your round.  LIZETTE SALAS: Well, I started off pretty good.  I started off par par eagle, and holed out from 65 yards. Then on the next hole, I just made things interesting, had a double and just kind of stayed steady on the back nine and really had some really good up-and-downs.  I wasn't hitting the ball as well as yesterday, but just kept it steady.  Focused on the shot that I had and had a really good up-and-down on 18.  Pretty proud of how I finished today.   Q.  How is the crowd atmosphere?  LIZETTE SALAS: It's amazing.  Just the amount of people that are out supporting us this week is great.  We have big range from little kids to the elderly coming out and cheering us on.  So it's a really good crowd.   Q.  Did the course live up to your practice round?  LIZETTE SALAS: Pretty much, yeah.  From what we practiced, it's what we're playing today.  The weather is holding up really great.  The course is in great condition
