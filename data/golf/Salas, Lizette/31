Q. A wonderful round of 67.  I hate to tell you this.  This is the last event on the Asian Swing.
LIZETTE SALAS: I mean, it's got to come to an end somehow, and I'm just really fortunate that I had this Asia Swing and really excited to go back to the States and play the final event.
Q. You've been playing brilliantly.  At the beginning of the year at the Australian Open, you talked about the number 58.  Tell us about that?
LIZETTE SALAS: I finished 58 on the Money List last year and it was worse than I played as a rookie, so I really was not very happy with that.  It really got the fire going in me and I really made a lot of changes.  You know, put on my big girl pants and went to work this entire year.  Solheim made it that much more exciting, and after I got on the team, that confidence just built up inside of me.  But also it's been a team effort.  My parents, my coaches, my caddies, we've all come together for one goal, and just very fortunate to have all the support and love playing the sport again.
Q. What has been the difference?  Everybody wants to work harder.  Everybody wants to get better.  What has really made the difference in 2017?
LIZETTE SALAS: Well, I think it's different when people tell you that you're a great putter and to now believe that you're a good putter, and to know that you can make clutch putts and win Solheim, make that clutch putt for your country and make all these 20-footers.  It's just different experiences give you that sort of confidence, and so with the Asia Swing, I really got that.  Now I believe I can make anything.  I think that's really what makes the difference.
Q. You've come into it with a great deal of confidence.  We look forward to you playing well this week.  Keep holing those putts.
LIZETTE SALAS: I'm trying to.  It's difficult but I know I can do it.
