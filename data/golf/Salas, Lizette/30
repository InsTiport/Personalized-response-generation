Q. Probably not the finish you wanted today but still in line for your sixth straight Top-15 finish.  How is that feeling and what's your motivation like?
LIZETTE SALAS: I mean, conditions were really tough this weekend.  I have to think really positive.  There's one more event, and I get to go home.  There's a lot of positives to go into next week.  You know, finishing Top-10, four out of the five Asia tournaments, so pretty pleased.
My body is holding up, which I'm really shocked at this point.  But overall, lots of positives.  I think overall, mentally, I'm getting stronger.  I'm really close and you've just got to keep working hard, and, yeah, just keep working.
Q. Aside from Shanshan, you've been the one throughout this whole Asia Swing that's been right up near the top of the leaderboard every week.  What has it been that's been clicking?
LIZETTE SALAS: It's been nice.  It's been definitely a confidence booster.  It definitely showed me that if I want something and work hard at it, I can get it.
It's been a team effort.  Jason has been amazing these last five weeks, really helping me get stronger mentally and not be such a Debbie Downer.  So it's definitely been a team effort and now I know I can fix my swing by myself.
