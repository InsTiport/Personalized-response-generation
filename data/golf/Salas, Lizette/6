 Q.  What are the emotions like walking off 18 having secured a point for the U.S.A.?  
LIZETTE SALAS: It feels amazing to go out there, play the game that I know how to play, and to go up against Anne Van Dam, who is one of the most powerful players out here on Tour.   
She played a great match today, kept me on my toes. But we stuck to our game plan, and I had a lot of confidence despite not -- only having one point this week. All I had to do was do my job, play the game I know how to play and it worked out in the end.   
 Q.  You've got great experience in Solheim Cups previously. Does it get any easier? Are you able to control the nerves through the tough situations any better?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Well, you know the last time I was in Europe, we came back from the biggest deficit in Solheim Cup history. So that experience really helped me to stay in the moment and to be patient and to really just -- par was our friend. And, yeah, it definitely helped with my match today.
