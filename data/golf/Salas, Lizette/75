Q.   Great job with the birdie on 18 to finish.   Capped off a great day.   Tell us what happened. 
LIZETTE SALAS:   I just really stayed patient today, really just stayed focused on each shot.   Really tried to make the best swing that I can on that shot. 
And I made bogey on my second hole, which was not part of my game plan, but I stayed patient. 
I had a lot of opportunities for birdie.   And when I minute missed the green, I tried to get up‑and‑down as easy as I can.   We try to visualize a lot more.   It worked out today.   Really I just stayed patient.   I knew the par‑5s were going to be scorable today.   I almost reached 8 in two, so that gave me a chip and one‑putt for birdie.   Just tried to dial in anything under 130, trying to dial them. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
LIZETTE SALAS:   Yeah.

Q.   Obviously it's working well again?
LIZETTE SALAS:   I just knew during the practice rounds, we try to study where is a good place to miss in case we missed it, just trying to use the backdrops and know where also all the false fronts are and where can we get up‑and‑down the easiest in case we miss the greens. 
I have been doing a couple of swing changes that have been really working for me last week and the week before.   And you know, I switched putters to the Tank and I feel like it was a good switch for me. 
I'm feeling a lot more confident, being able to visualize a lot more and really use my imagination, which I like to do.   I think the better‑‑ the more experience, more players tend to do that in these types of conditions.
