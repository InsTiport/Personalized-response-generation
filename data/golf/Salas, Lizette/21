LIZETTE SALAS: ...more weight lifting, actual weight lifting?
Q. Like free weights?
LIZETTE SALAS: Back squats, lunges.
Q. And that got you some extra distance?
LIZETTE SALAS: I think so, I think so.  My legs aren't as tired as they used to be.  Yeah, focusing on my health more.  Yeah, here you can definitely see the difference.
Q. This is where you can be really exposed...
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.
Q. ...if you're not fit enough.
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.
Q. You're just a few shots off the pace now.
LIZETTE SALAS: Just one, one or two.
Q. You're 10-under.
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.
Q. Okay.  How is your dad?
LIZETTE SALAS: He's good, thank you.  All the family is good.  They're growing.  They'll be at the west cost swing for sure.  Team Salas will be ready.
Q. Big year.  Solheim Cup.
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.
Q. Is it on your radar?
LIZETTE SALAS: Of course.  It's always on my radar.
Q. I bet.  You can't have a Solheim Cup without you.
LIZETTE SALAS: I don't know what it's called then.  (Laughing.)  Just kidding.
Q. Well played in this heat as well.  You're looking fitter and stronger in 2019.
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.  That's been one of my goals for sure during the off-season.  We went a little heavy on the weights with my trainer.  Coming here you can definitely see the endurance and how you need to be focused both mentally and physically.
I think with my score you can definitely see that.  My team has been awesome.  Been working really hard.  It's going to be a long year, so it's my eighth season.  I'm not a rookie anymore, I'm a vet, so it's time to play like one.
Q. You can't be a vet.  How old are you?
LIZETTE SALAS: Oh, you're going to ask me that?  29.
Q. I never heard of a vet at 29.  Talking about the weights, you're doing free weights, bench pressing?   What are you doing?
LIZETTE SALAS: I mean, we're doing a bit of everything.  Speed, mobility, back squats.  I mean, anything my trainer can think of he's making me do, which is great.  Not great at the moment because I'm like complaining most of the time.
The benefits are much greater and I'm getting used to being sore all the time, which is good.  Means the body is working.  You know, you have to be an athlete, so that's what I've been doing.
Q. You certainly do to compete with the very best on this Tour.  Obviously getting longer in 2019, which has to help, being that bit further down the fairway, less club in with the second shot.
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, definitely.  And also I can be more aggressive with drives.  My driving game has been solid most of the years, but now having that confidence and now more speed has definitely got me that extra yardage that I have been wanting.
It's helped with shorter clubs, which is definitely needed here.  Everything has kind of been coming along, so just got to make more birdies.
