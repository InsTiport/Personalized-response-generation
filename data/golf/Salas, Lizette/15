 Q.  Bogey-free round.  What went well for you?  
LIZETTE SALAS: I drove the ball really well.  I've been working on like trying to move around the tee box depending on the wind, trying to ride it instead of playing against it.  I think that really helped me today.   
I hit a lot more greens today so my ball-striking obviously is a little better and I think just overall my attitude has been really good the entire week, just trying to change my expectations, how I react to them.   
You can get so caught up being a Major and everything.  So, you know, I'm just trying to have fun and really just focus on what I can control and not having any freak-outs.  I think that's what really is helping out.   
 Q.  Looking forward to tomorrow, the weather is not going to be great.  How will the momentum help you?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Well, I played in it on Thursday.  It was really miserable that day.  The fact that I was able to grind and to practically save par from everywhere on the front-9, I think that's really going to give me the confidence for tomorrow.   
Yeah.  You just have to take it for what it is.  Everyone is going to have to play in these conditions and I think it's more of like mental toughness more than anything and just keep it one shot at a time.   
 Q.  No one has been able to go get Hannah the first three days.  What is it going to take for you or someone to do it?  
LIZETTE SALAS: There's a combo of things that have to happen.  Obviously you can't control what other players are doing.  All I can control is -- are my thoughts and shot process at hand.  I've been playing solid all year.  Just confidence is going to get me that little extra, extra boost and, you know, it's a Major.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Obviously the weather is going to be a big factor.  So, we'll take it for what it is.
