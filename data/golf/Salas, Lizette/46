 Q.  Got to feel good about the way we you bounced back.  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, definitely.  I just erased the round from yesterday.  We knew the problem was I wasn't getting close, so I really wanted to be aggressive whenever I had a short iron.   
Just read some putts really well; stayed out of trouble.  Made it interesting on 9 when I missed the green, but I got up and down.   
So really feel good.  Really feel good off the tee.  I can see my shots and visualize a lot better and I'm staying patient out there, which was much needed today.  This whole week.  This wind is gnarly.   
 Q.  Wind a little bit calmer compared to yesterday?  
LIZETTE SALAS: It was calmer today.  Some of the pins were accessible.  You could stay a little more aggressive.  They had some pins where there was a backstop so we could really use those backstops to our advantage.   
We did that today and got some birdies out of it.   
 Q.  Going into the final round a few years ago, do those memories come back to you?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, I was thinking that on 8.  Like, huh, I only shot 4 shots better last time but I had an eagle and couple more birdies.   
Just try to know that I can pull those shots off and I can play good golf here.  Just having those good vibes and memories.  My mom flew in last night so I had to play good for her or she wouldn't have been happy.
