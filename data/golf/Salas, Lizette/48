 Q.  How far was that hole-in-one?  
LIZETTE SALAS: 92 yards, 52 wedge.  I knew it was going to spin off from the front part of the green.  So I hit it a little past and right on line, and it was a good shot and then it just went in.  It was awesome.   
 Q.  As cool as that is, it's not the car hole.  
LIZETTE SALAS: No, it's too short to be a car hole but a hole one is a hole-in-one and it's my second one on Tour.   
 Q.  When is the last one?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Pretty excited.  It definitely helped my double on the first hole.  So I was pretty excited about that.  My first one was in Thailand, my second year on Tour.   
 Q.  Do you remember what day?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Not in Thailand.  It was Malaysia, the first round.   
 Q.  First round, your second year on Tour?  
LIZETTE SALAS: I think.  No, first year on Tour, sorry.  I don't even remember.  First year on Tour, Malaysia, and I think it was either 15 or 14, something like that.   
 Q.  Did you make many before your pro career?  
LIZETTE SALAS: I had two before.  One on my 16th birthday and then just one just messing around on an executive course.  On my 16th birthday, I didn't see it but my dad saw it.  It was pretty cool.
