 Q.  Here with Lizette Salas on day two of the Kia Classic.  69, 67 here to start the week.  How are you feeling about your start here?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Very pleased.  Made some changes early in the week with my swing coach, and just really -- I really like this golf course.  I really like the environment.  My family gets to come out.  So much confidence at the beginning of the week, and definitely showed the first two days.   
Just got to keep doing the same thing.   
 Q.  Tell me about those changes and what you're working on?  
LIZETTE SALAS: I don't know the specifics, but I know it's working.  It's just a certain position at the top of my swing.  I told my coach that I want my Solheim Cup swing back, and that's what we're working on.  We're pretty close to that.   
Just got to keep it simple during the week, and we'll get some good scores.  I'm close.   
 Q.  What's the game plan now the rest of the week?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Just the same plan.  Probably head to the gym later this afternoon.  My parents came down this morning, so spend time with them.   
Just get ready for the rest of the Salas family to come down this weekend.  I just want to perform well for them.  We'll just see what happens.
