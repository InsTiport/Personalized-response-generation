LIZETTE SALAS: This is the type of golf I've been waiting to play all year.  I finally feel comfortable over the ball on the putting green.  That's something that I've been struggling with for a while.   
You know, I felt confident on the first tee.  Like I knew I could play well today.  Actually this whole week.  I have a great friend on the bag who helped me get on tour back five years ago.   
So just having a good team and just feeling confident and comfortable, I think this was my goal coming in.   
Last week I swung great in Mexico and just couldn't find the hole; today I found a lot more holes.   
 Q.  Does this course redesign suit your game?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, the redesign I thought is a lot better.  You know, I got screwed on the last hole.  That new bunker came into play.   
Other than that, this golf course, the greens are phenomenal, really so pure.  What you see is what you get.   
You know, it makes the course a lot more fun.   
 Q.  18 you hit it --  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, hit it in the pop bunker.  I didn't think I could get there, but had a good bounce and just trickled in.
