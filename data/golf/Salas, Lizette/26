Q. You played in front of a lot of friends and family.  You must be proud of how you performed?
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, I'm really pleased.  You know, things just went Eun Hee's way today.  I kept fighting and I woke up a little late, started making birdies on the back nine.
Overall I putted a lot better than I did yesterday.  Didn't miss any short ones.  Four rounds in the 60s I think is a pretty good thing for me.
Bogey-free on a Sunday?  I couldn't ask for anything better.
Q. Did you feel any self-imposed pressure because you were playing in front of friends?
LIZETTE SALAS: No.  I mean, if anything they lifted me when I was down.  I was just happy to play in front of them, and performed pretty darn good.
You know, onto the next one.
Q. Had you played that much with her before?
LIZETTE SALAS: Played with Eun Hee?
Q. Eun Hee.
LIZETTE SALAS: Um, I've played with her several times.  I mean, we all know she's capable of playing some amazing golf, and she played phenomenal today.
I called her hole in one.  It was in the air and I said, Dunk and it went in.  So she's welcome.  (Laughter.)
Q. One of two cars today.
LIZETTE SALAS: I know.  Good for her.
Q. That's cool to see for anyone in that situation, whether they're in the lead or on the lead.  It's one thing if it happens early on the back nine on a Sunday, but to be in the lead, it's impressive, right?
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah.  It was pretty cool to watch.  I just stuck to my game plan.  Took advantage of the shots that I needed to.  I played some good golf this whole week.
I'm just proud of myself, my team, my family that came out.  Just overall very pleased.
Q. Interesting that the deficit ended up being two.  If she pars that instead of makes an ace...
LIZETTE SALAS: I know.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of things could have happened today.  She bogeyed couple holes down the stretch.  Things could have shifted my way if I would've made that putt on 14.
I had so many good looks at birdie.  Just burning the edges.  What can you do?
Q. Have you played with many players on the LPGA who have made a hole in one in your group?
LIZETTE SALAS: I don't even remember, but this is a highlight for sure.  I mean, I hope I don't play with a lot of people that make hole in ones on me.  That would kind of suck.
Q. How many do you have on tour?
LIZETTE SALAS: I have one.  Thanks for reminding me.  (Laughter.)
Q. On a Thursday?
LIZETTE SALAS: I think it was on a Thursday in Malaysia.  Got a little trophy like this.
Q. Not a car?
LIZETTE SALAS: No, no car hole.
Q. How about the fact she gets two cars?
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, hopefully she gives one to her caddie.  Did a good job today.
Q. What was the yardage there?
LIZETTE SALAS: Where?
Q. 14.
LIZETTE SALAS: 152 hole.
Q. She hit 7?
LIZETTE SALAS: We both hit 7.
