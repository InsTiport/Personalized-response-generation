Q. Tell me a little bit about your play today and how you feel about it.
LIZETTE SALAS:   Well, I had a very poor warmup, which it happens.  I think that's why they call it warmup.  But after about second hole I just got really comfortable and started visualizing better and hit really good shots.
My speed was so much better today, and I knew with bigger greens on Cypress that was going to be key.  I worked on something yesterday and it worked.
So I knew par isn't going to hurt me and playing smart was going to be key today, so that's what I did.
Q. 36 holes.  How did the courses differ?
LIZETTE SALAS:   Wow, I mean, the size in greens obviously are a big thing.  It wasn't as windy today as yesterday.  I think we got lucky being on Cypress on that side.
I think Jackrabbit, the greens are a little more like slopey.  I don't know if that's even the word for it.  More undulating.  I felt like Cypress was very playable and just lucky I played well today.
Q. Cypress two more times Saturday and Sunday.
LIZETTE SALAS:   Yeah.
Q. How do you prepare for it?
LIZETTE SALAS:   Again, working on speed and just trusting my lines off the tee.  For me, once I get the driver going I get really confident, and I just -- and then sometimes playing to the center of the green is always a smart play.
And just being confident in the game plan I think is my go-to thing for the weekend.
