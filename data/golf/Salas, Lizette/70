Q.   Another good round. 
LIZETTE SALAS:   Yeah.

Q.   What was working out there?
LIZETTE SALAS:   You know, just trying to keep it simple, just keep fairways and greens and just giving myself opportunities for birdie.   I'm stroking it well and hitting my lines, just some of these greens are tricky, and being in the morning it can be a little deceiving, but I'm just trying to stay patient.   I'm kind of‑‑ I rested last week, so I'm pumped and eager to come out again.   I felt great at Solheim, so I'm just kind of going off that momentum.   Even though I missed a couple birdie opportunities, still, ‑4 today is a good round.

Q.   You were a rookie this year on the Solheim Cup team.   What was that experience like?
LIZETTE SALAS:   It was amazing, just playing with these gals that I've watched on TV for a while, and to finally be a member of the team was an awesome experience.   My partners were awesome.   The entire week was awesome.   The outcome wasn't what we wanted, but I made some lifelong friends.

Q.   Speaking of role models, how cool is it to look up in the stands and see Nancy Lopez?
LIZETTE SALAS:   Geez, it is great to have her in the stands cheering us on, cheering me on.   She came up to me during the 45‑minute delay, and you could see just the emotion in her eyes and how supportive she is of Team USA.   It was just awesome.   She's always texting me, calling me, so I know she's watching.

Q.   What all did she tell you on that delay, anything?
LIZETTE SALAS:   She said to just give it your all and just no regrets and to just show them what we're made of, and that's what I did.
