 Q.   After having a little emotional moment there in the scoring tent, Lizette, you've come close to many times.   What was the difference this week?  
LIZETTE SALAS:   I was patient, I was happy, and I was ready most importantly.   I took a different approach this week of not thinking so much and trying to be perfect.  
You know, I made a putter switch last week when I was home, and it was‑‑ I felt so ready.   There are so many emotions going on right now that I'm just trying to breathe.  
   
 Q.   Nancy Lopez once gave you advice that you need to look at the scoreboard when you're in contention.   Did you look at it, and when did you realize you had a pretty large margin?  
LIZETTE SALAS:   I looked at it probably every chance I got.   I knew after 11 I had a three‑shot lead.  
With those holes coming in, Yani was coming in really strong.   Once I got to 17 we had a nice little cushion, so I enjoyed the walk up 18.  
   
 Q.   What were the nerves like?  
LIZETTE SALAS:   There were there, definitely there.   The knees were shaking a little bit.   
But after being in the Solheim Cup I learned how to control them and just knew where it hit it and just really stayed patient.  
   
 Q.   You speak of a different approach this week.   Part of the approach was your parents aren't here with you; they normally are.   This isn't just a win for you, it's a win for your whole team, most notably them.   What do you want to tell them right now?  
LIZETTE SALAS:   That I love them and that I wish they were here.   Dad, this one is for you.   You did a lot for me.   Te quiero mucho, papi.   Mom, I miss you guys, and I'll be home tomorrow so we can celebrate.   
   
 Q.   Great job.   
LIZETTE SALAS:   Thank you.
