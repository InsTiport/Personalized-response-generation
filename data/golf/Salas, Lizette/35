Q. Tough match.  Just seemed like when you guys did something today they were right there?
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, I mean, you kind of have to expect that from players like Anna and Jodi.  We played well today.  It's just we didn't capitalize on a couple of putts that we wish we could have.
But they played great.  And Angel stayed in it.  Her drives were really great today.  And we just -- we weren't as hot as we were yesterday.  But we still have tomorrow.  And our teammates are having our backs.  And so we'll bounce back from this.
Q. Given the way things have gone the first two days, how excited are you for tomorrow?
LIZETTE SALAS: I'm pretty excited.  I feel like I've been playing really well.  And as much red that's on the board is obviously better.  And I just feel like tomorrow we have to play like we're behind.  So everything will go well.
