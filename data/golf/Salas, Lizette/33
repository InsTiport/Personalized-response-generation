Q. Smiling, she has tears of joy, the point that secures the Solheim Cup for Team USA.  How incredible does it sound?
LIZETTE SALAS: It sounds amazing.  This is what I work for all year.  And today's probably the best golf I've played all year.  And to do that in front of my home crowd and to wear the red, white and blue is such an honor.
And the fact that I made the last putt to secure it is undescribable.  I'm still shaking, and just glad I got it done for Team USA.
Q. Describe the nerves and the pressure standing on that 18 green.
LIZETTE SALAS: You know, my hands were shaking a little bit.  But I was pretty confident knowing how I was putting all day.  And Jodi played awesome.  She kept fighting and that's what we expected Europe to do.  And I'm just glad I had a few more putts that dropped.
Q. How more special is this given the journey for you to the LPGA and the journey to this year's Solheim Cup team?
LIZETTE SALAS: It was all worth it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I have the best parents in the world, and we're just glad to be here.  And we're proud Americans, and this is really special.
Q. The sense of (indiscernible), the bond and the togetherness with your captain and your teammates, how incredible has that been this week?
LIZETTE SALAS: Amazing, from start to finish.  We knew the kind of team we had.  We knew the kind of players we had.  And we were so confident in each other.
And our captains had all the faith in the world in us.  And we can't thank them enough.  Juli has been -- she's top-notch from start to finish.  These past four years, I know, have been kind of brutal on her, just being captain and all.  But it's times like these where it's all worth it.  And this is a memory that I will cherish forever.
