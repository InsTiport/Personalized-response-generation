 Q.  So overall a pretty good round for you today.  Good way to kick it off in Hawaii?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, pretty solid.  Played the par-5s pretty well.  Couple unlucky bounces, but the first day, playing in the wind, can't complain.  You're in Hawaii.   
 Q.  Tell us about the wind, because it's definitely picked up since we got here earlier this week.  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, you definitely have to expect it.  You have to be prepared.  You can't fight it.  You just have to play with it.   
I enjoy playing in the wind.  It makes me create different shots and really just use any imagination.  So I really enjoy it.   
I think it went well today.   
 Q.  The challenge made it more fun at times?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Well, I mean, it's a pretty challenge being out here.  Seven years coming out here, I have to expect to play in these kind of winds.   
Like I said, I enjoy it.  I think some holes are easier than others.  Par-5s were definitely holes you need to take advantage of, and that's what I did today.   
 Q.  I think was it 3-under today.  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, 3.   
 Q.  When it's blowing like this, you happy with that?  
LIZETTE SALAS: Yeah, really good start.  I was 4-under coming into my last hole.  You got to take the bumps and take what you can get.   
Just got to hit more fairways tomorrow.
