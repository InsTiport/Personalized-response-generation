   TIM PETROVIC:  Difference today was where I hit the ball in the fairway.  I had to scramble most of the day and I had a lot of 1-putts that add up to 21 putts.  That's what I needed to do today. 
 I didn't drive it well.  It seemed like I was two steps off the fairway or one step off.  It wasn't like I was hitting terrible shots.  I pulled a lot of shots today.  I'm going to go to the range and try to iron it out. 

 Q.  You're playing in a tournament where people are really grinding to make pars and let's shoot 64 and see who wins this thing. 
 TIM PETROVIC:  Speak for yourself.  I didn't hit many greens today.  I think I was off the green by one, two steps.  I was off the fairway for one, two steps.  I don't think the 7th green is as bad as it looks.  You definitely want to be on the greens many times, 15 or 16 times would be nice. 
 I just didn't give myself enough opportunities.  The opportunities are there.  Conditions are perfect.  The greens were better today.  I expect some low scores. 

 Q.  Going to be a little cooler tomorrow.  Does that change the game, not quite as much distance on the ball? 
 TIM PETROVIC:  I'm an old fart.  I don't get that much anyway.  I don't have to worry about it. 

 Q.  Tim, what do you think it's going to take tomorrow to win? 
 TIM PETROVIC:  Looks like, you know, it's going to be 17 or 18 ending today, so going to have to go at least 20, looks like.  That's what we were talking about yesterday.
