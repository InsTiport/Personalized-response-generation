Q.  Assess your day ?
TIM  PETROVIC:  Well,I wasn't as sharp today as I was on Thursday or Friday.  I hit some marginal tee shots, marginal -- wasn't really, my speed was off on the greens.  Maybe they were a little quicker today, I'm not sure, but I had a couple three-putts on the front.  Every time I made a birdie, I made a bogey.  I think I had two pars on the front.  Four birdies, three bogeys, two pars.  I felt bad for my standard bearer, he had to keep change numbers.  But we got it going on the back.  I had a nice up-and-down on 10 to keep me going.  Then I got on a roll made a couple birdies.  Made par on 14, which is like a birdie.  I'll take three there. 

Q.  You're four off the lead right now, what do you think it's going to take tomorrow?
TIM PETROVIC: You never know.  I mean, I made nine birdies today, I just made too many bogeys.  So I was going to say, if I play like I did on back nine, if I have -- if I put two nine's together, tomorrow I think I have a good chance to win.

Q.  That was an important putt there on 18 to get that one back and get some momentum for tomorrow to get that birdie?
TIM  PETROVIC:  Yeah.  The heat got me on 17.  I made a terrible swing off the tee and just played for bogey there.  And then I was just about to drop coming up 18. 

Q.  What are the greens like today?
TIM PETROVIC:  They were a little quicker.  But they were soft.  You could just fire right at the pin.  That's why the scores are so low.

Q.  Do you expect similar conditions to this tomorrow?
TIM  PETROVIC:  Yeah the greens will probably be the same.  I'm not sure what the weather is going to be.  But it will probably be the exactly same. 

Q.  Thank you.  Congratulations.
