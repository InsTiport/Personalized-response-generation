  JAAKKO MAKITALO:   I'm really happy obviously.   Going around that course with no bogeys, I didn't see happening, happen today.   Just really good pars on the front nine. 

Q.   It's actually been a good couple of days prior to this, hasn't it, when you've got the round going and perhaps a couple of bogeys in there. 
JAAKKO MAKITALO:   Yeah, well, yesterday I was playing in the last group, and my eyes are not great and it was getting a little dark.   Of course, I wanted to finish, so I don't have to finish in the morning.   Made a couple of kind of stupid bogeys in the end, but still, happy to make it would the weekend, and, well, today was great.

Q.   Put it into context, how well have you been playing. 
JAAKKO MAKITALO:   Today must have been one of the best rounds of the year.   Like I said, I could have made a couple more putts but overall I've been putting so good this week that I can't really blame the body.

Q.   You probably need to every week, but here in particular the way the greens have been quick. 
JAAKKO MAKITALO:   They are super fast, and I guess it suits my game, because I'm usually pretty good with the short putts, and now every putt is pretty short, because you don't have to hit it too far. 

Q.   I'm sure the aim is to be relaxed into the final round, but what are your thoughts about Sunday?
JAAKKO MAKITALO:   Well, just try to do what I'm doing, and hopefully you will be doing this same thing tomorrow.
