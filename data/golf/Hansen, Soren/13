  Q. Your thoughts on a round with four birdies and one bogey?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: I played really, really solid today. I said that yesterday, as well, so I was very pleased. The bogey was a bit of an upset. I hit the green and made 3-putt from no distance, really, 3-putted.   
 All in all, very, very happy. There's not much going in the hole today putting-wise, but I played solid, as solid as ever really, and I enjoyed it.   
  
  Q. Give us a sense of conditions. Slightly different than yesterday morning?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: Yeah, but I didn't think it was that bad really because you have some holes into the wind where you obviously had to be a little careful. But the stretch down the last few holes of the back nine is playing downbreeze, 16, 17, and 18 is playing downwind. I hit a 3-wood and a wedge, and so I thought it was tougher coming down those three holes than yesterday, that's for sure but I think all in all, not too bad. I think we are seeing Loch Lomond's formidable side.  
  
  Q. We about your three Top-10s in a row, how close to top form are you?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: I think I'm playing as well as ever really. I'm playing really good and I feel confident, even though I haven't rolled that many in this week, I'm still 7-under and not far away, and I felt good about my game.  
  
  Q. 53rd in the World Rankings at the moment, how big of a goal is it to get back in the Top-50, so important, isn't it?   
 SÃREN HANSEN: It is, in a way, I'm in sort of those big events coming up now. I'm in them anyway. You want to be there; definitely at the end of the year you want to be well inside the Top-50, before Christmas, and it is an important thing, especially with big tournaments after Christmas and at the end of the year, as well.
