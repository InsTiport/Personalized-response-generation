 Q.   How good was that and how good have two days been?  
SÃREN HANSEN:   I've played extremely solid the last two days.   Today I took a little advantage of the good greens this morning, teed off nice and early, 6.40 it was.   One of the earliest ones I can remember, but yeah, prayed well again.  
   
 Q.   Which means a four o'clock alarm call.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   It was four o'clock, I don't believe it.   With the jet‑lag, it didn't feel like I slept a lot, so I'm pretty pleased with my performance the last two days.  
   
 Q.   Get here in the dark and hit balls into nothingness?  
SÃREN HANSEN:   Well, actually it gets light here pretty quickly and pretty early, so it's not a problem, and the sun is shining and it's warm.   
   
 Q.   Have you noticed a difference playing in the morning compared to the afternoon?   You mentioned the greens.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   Definitely.   I mean, the greens are obviously completely pure throughout the day but in the morning when nobody has been on it, they are the best I've ever seen really.   Remind me a lot of Augusta to be honest, that good, really.   
And the wind picks up around 11.00 every day and starts to swirl around in the trees here so it gets hard to pick the right club and you have to back off a few shot.   So stop/start a little bit, because if you get on the wrong side of pins here, you've had it, really.   
So it's a lot trickier playing in the afternoon when the wind is blowing.   But then again it's hard to make a charge regardless.   It's hard to make a good score.   It's hard to run away on this course.   
   
 Q.   Charge might not be the right word but you've made an impression on the board.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   I'm happy, but a lot of the guys will play this afternoon, so just keep in my own little track and see what happens this weekend.  
   
 Q.   You played well in Portugal and you're keeping it going this week, so lovely progress.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   It's a nice feeling to have a little progress, especially the end of the year, yes.   So it's been good.   It's been a long, tiring summer but it's all smiles down under in Australia.  
   
 Q.   Given your position on the Money List, you can actually do with a little bit of relaxation, because you're exempt for next year.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   Correct.   There's a category nine, I think it's called, something to do with career earnings.   So obviously relaxes a little bit and I feel for the guys who are playing for their privilege to play on The European Tour.   
I played with Oliver Fisher and he's played really, really got last two days, shot level par, but should probably have been a lot better really.   I feel for him and hope he can have a good week.
