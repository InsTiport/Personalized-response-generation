   SOREN HANSEN: Yes,  Nick played some fantastic shots on the back nine. He slapped me right in the face. He hit the stick at the 14th and a really nice iron shot at the 15th  Not the sort of thing you want to see against you. He produced some great stuff all day. I knew he could do it. He's a fantastic player. Overall, the week has been fantastic experience for something bigger.
