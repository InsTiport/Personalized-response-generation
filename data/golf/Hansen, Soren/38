SOREN HANSEN: I started really well and finished well. I holed a 15 footer on eight and same length on the ninth. Nice way to finish my round. I played with Ruud Gullit. It was great playing with him. He is a very positive person and it rubbed off on me. I could see in him what made a great footballer. Very positive. He hit a few bad ones and didn't like it and came back strongly. I could see how determined and I could see what made him great. He had a great technique as a footballer and it isn't bad at golf either. He plays off five, I think and we did well to be ten under.
 

I am very happy with my score. I think that's the first time I've broken par on the Old Course and that was nice. I also made my first par at the 17th kept it right and two putts. The best way to play it. That's the thing about St Andrews, you have to learn how to steer your way round. It's a learning process and maybe I am getting there at last.
