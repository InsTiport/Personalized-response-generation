 Q.   Good start to the tournament?   
SÃREN HANSEN:   Yeah, it was a good day today.   Was a little nervous when I started this morning for some reason.   The crowd was gone but for some reason I felt some nerves on the first tee.   Played nice and solid all day, so was pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Normally it's the other way around, you're nervous when there's people around.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   Yeah, but I thought‑‑ it's a good thing to be nervous on the first tee times, you settle down after a few holes and sort of get into it.   So, yeah, nerves can be a good thing and today I managed it well.   
   
 Q.   A lot of low scores, especially in the morning today; any regrets that you had a late tee time?  
SÃREN HANSEN:   Not at all.   I had a good round today, playing well, and I'll get the benefit hopefully tomorrow morning.   This is a course where you've got to, even though the scores are good, it can get you if you don't think well around it.   There are some slick greens and they get firmer and firmer every day.  
   
 Q.   You seem to kind of like this course anyway.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   I do.   I've played a few years now and I used to come here and practise during the winter, as well, and always enjoy being here, the clubhouse, the facilities are fantastic.   
   
 Q.   If you could compare the front nine to the back nine, so many low scores on the back nine and a lot of people that are on top of the leaderboard started on the back nine.   
SÃREN HANSEN:   There are three par 5s on the back nine and they are all sort of reachable and some tricky holes on the front nine, 5, 6, 7, 8.
