  Q. SÃ¸ren, a round with it's share of up-and-downs, how do you feel about 1-under?   
 SÃREN HANSEN: I'm take it. I mean, the last four holes, I didn't hit many good shots really. So I'll take it. It could have been a few bogeys coming in I think, but I think around the turn I had a lot of good chances, I didn't take them and sort of frustrated me a bit and eventually you know, the game caught up with me.   
 But I'll take 1-under. It looks like it's two behind, but that's okay for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Fair to say these conditions make any mistakes you make exaggerated?   
 SÃREN HANSEN: Exactly, they are tight fairways and they are wet, and the wind is quite strong and just slightly off line with the ball.   
  
  Q. 10th, third, second here in the last three years; what is it about this course?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: I don't know. I like it. It suits my eye off the tee. I like the way the holes sit. Hopefully I can do a little bit better tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What sort of conditions would you like to see in the final round, as you say, you're a couple behind at the moment?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: I think if you could lose just one piece of clothing and the same sort of wind would be fantastic and we would have a good finish to the Johnnie Walker.  
  
  Q. Too long since your last win, hasn't it?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: A couple of years, yeah, obviously it would be nice.
