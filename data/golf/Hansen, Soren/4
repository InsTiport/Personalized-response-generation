Q.   Your thoughts on 5‑under? 
SÃREN HANSEN:   Well, it was one of those days, I started off a little bit scruffy.   I was hitting a few bad shots to begin with.   I was actually 2‑over after six holes and manage to turn that around to 5‑under, which was quite good golf.

Q.   That's terrific recovery, isn't it? 
SÃREN HANSEN:   It's a very good score, very pleased with that obviously.   Haven't played that well as of late but it was nice to get back and have a good round to start with.

Q.   There's moments when it seemed like a good score was coming over the last few months and not quite materialised?
SÃREN HANSEN:   I know it's been like three rounds put together and one really bad round, and don't really know when it's coming sort of thing.   It's been like that all year really.   I feel like the last part of the year here, it's a little bit better, but then still a few things that are not quite right but I'm working hard on it and today it paid off.

Q.   I guess it's hard to remain positive in that kind of situation, isn't it. 
SÃREN HANSEN:   It sort of is, because you know, when I used to play great golf, day‑in, day‑out and when that's not right there, it gets a little bit to you and that's the way the game is.   I think everybody back home can sort of relate to that sort of problem, but we are professionals, we are trying, and I am doing it with a smile, although I haven't done all year, but this part, the end of the year, I'm sort of looking a little bit more positive at it and I'm starting so see a few results coming so that's nice.

Q.   You're able to stay relaxed with that?
SÃREN HANSEN:   Sort of.   I'm a relaxed sort of dude really.
