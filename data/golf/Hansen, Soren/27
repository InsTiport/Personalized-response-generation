 Q. First thing's first, you told us yesterday your wrist was feeling sore; did you get it all fixed up?
 SÃREN HANSEN: Yeah, it feels pretty good, the guy in the physio truck sorted it out a bit and feels all right today. It actually one of my better striking rounds today. I played really, really, really good. 

 Q. In the circumstances are you particularly proud of the way you've performed this whole week?
 SÃREN HANSEN: Yeah, I'm happy. I've got through the first day making the cut, and I did that in fine form and I played really, really well today, and so I'm very pleased. And now it's all good Johnnie Walker instead of all that Ryder Cup, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

 Q. How significant a step in your career do you think The Ryder Cup could be; you look almost certain to make it now. 
 SÃREN HANSEN: Well, you hear many stories, and you just want to do it and it's a boy's dream. I think it's a step up, and I'm really looking forward to experiencing it. I feel like I play good enough golf to be there and to compete with the boys and make a run for it, and that's what it's all about at the end of the day. I think after The Ryder Cup, I'll come out a better player.

 Q. Obviously all about a win tomorrow; how do you feel about your chances there?
 SÃREN HANSEN: I feel really good. If the putts drop today, I'll be leading this tournament. I didn't hole anything. I shot 68, so you know, I feel confident. If I can play well tomorrow I'll be right up there and it's always down to the last few holes. Every year it's all about the last four holes so hopefully I'll be there tomorrow.
