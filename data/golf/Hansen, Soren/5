  Q. SÃ¸ren, are you a player that likes pressure?   
 SÃREN HANSEN: At the moment, I felt a bit. The last few months have been mind blowing really, and today was a nice walk in the park in Portugal so I'm very pleased with my round.  
  
  Q. How did you turn pressure into a walk in the park, because that's the trick?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: It is. Today the secret was probably stayed really, really patient. I've hit the ball well for a long, long time. But you know, not really holding anything, and I think the key was today, I started holing out a few to start with, and all of a sudden I felt a little bit of confidence, I let the driver go a little bit and I was down the fairways, and going at pins all of a sudden, you know, and it felt like a little bit more enjoyable, really.   
  
  Q. Was it just one of those sort of accidental clashes with fate that you putted better or did you change something?  
 SÃREN HANSEN: Changed drastically. I'm on the long stick. So I'm pleased with that. It's working really well. In Holland I tried it out. Wasn't happy with it. But I didn't put much pressure and had last week off. Putted like a maniac all week really and so I'm very happy.  
  
  Q. What's easy about using the long putter?   
 SÃREN HANSEN: I think it makes me set up the same way. I've all been like -- with the short putter's been struggling if it was left-to-right, I was a little too open or right-to-left putts I was too close and never could get it right but this one for some reason just sits perfectly all the time and that means you hit the lines a little bit more often and if you feel, that the speed comes more easily and yeah it's worked today and hopefully last week, and hopefully it will be Happy Hansen for the rest of the year.
