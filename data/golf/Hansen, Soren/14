   SÃREN HANSEN: I played solid and I played really well and sort of continued the form from last week this week. I'm really pleased with the round. I didn't really hole that many putts, and all of a sudden I missed a few greens and then some long ones at the end for par and I managed to hole them which is fantastic.  
 But it was all in all a solid round without any bogeys. I must admit I holed two long ones for par on last few holes.  
  
  Q. So could have been better.   
 SÃREN HANSEN: Could have been 2-under and I wouldn't have talked to you or could have been a great round, being 4-under is a nice solid start to this tournament. I think I took advantage of the good conditions this morning.
