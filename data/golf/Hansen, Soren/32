   PETER HANSON:  It was a good game all the way and Olly and Simon played really well and we had loads of birdies coming in with Soren making the final putt to get the win at the last. 
 SOREN HANSEN:  It was about 30 feet. We were looking at the line together and I said to Peter: 'Don't worry, I've got the line' and I knew I hit a good putt and it was a nice feeling. I played well for two days but didn't get any points out of it so I am very happy with the show Peter and I put on today. He's a great partner and made it easy for me. We've taken care of each other all day long. 
 PETER HANSON: It was a fantastic match. We pretty much birdied all the way round and we managed to hang in when Simon made a crucial putt on the 16th. 
 SOREN HANSEN: The scoring was great around the turn. We gave ourselves in a lot of opportunities. Simon knocked in a few good ones to tease us a little bit but we managed to get the win at the last. I think Peter drove the ball really well and I hit good iron shots and we were on top of our game all day. It was a good day.
