  Q. What do you think about Mr. Jackson?   
 DANNY GREEN: I saw he got it to 5-under today, 65, I just saw he was playing pretty good.   
  
  Q. You played with him much recently?   
 DANNY GREEN: We're playing Monday together in a practice round for the State Am, and I was supposed to play with him in the semifinal last week, but he got upset, he got beat by a kid from Knoxville in the quarterfinals.   
 So -- I don't know that I played with him yet this year but I played a lot of golf with him over the years.   
  
  Q. Is this something you would expect out of him, to come out of nowhere?   
 DANNY GREEN: I wouldn't say it out of nowhere, Tim's a good player, you better look at his resume.   
  
  Q. Mid-Am.   
 DANNY GREEN: I wouldn't expect him to be 11-under and be leading, but I expected him, just like I did my first two years, I was low amateur last year and the year before and I knew Tim was the man to beat this year.   
  
  Q. Do you know if you guys will be on the men's state team together?   
 DANNY GREEN: That will be decided after next week, our state Am, and I'm sure Tim will be on the team, and we don't have a whole lot to choose from besides kids, and I think I'll have a good chance. I was player of the year the last two years, and I assume I will be on the team, but you never know what happens on committee meetings and so forth.
