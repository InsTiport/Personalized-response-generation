  STUART MANLEY:   I'm pretty pleased to be honest.   Obviously disappointed to lose in a playoff with a poor shot but for Miguel to make birdie is pretty special.   It was pretty special to make three myself to get into a playoff.   So I can take a lot from the week.  
   
 Q.   Those celebrations when you did chip‑in‑‑  
STUART MANLEY:   I was pretty pumped to be honest.   Not very often you have a chance to do that.   Said to my caddie, we could do something special here.   It was a great chip and I think I started celebrating before it went in, you know what I mean, but I was pretty pumped.  
   
 Q.   I presume you're pretty proud of yourself because it's been a great effort across the week.   
STUART MANLEY:   Yeah, my seventh week in a row and I'm pretty tired.   It's my first playoff on The European Tour and I've played well this week.   I feel pretty chuffed.  
   
 Q.   This final round had just about everything, a few up‑and‑downs; your third round did but the final round.   
STUART MANLEY:   It did.   A lot of birdies, a lot of bogeys, not that much consistency, but I'll take it.   
   
 Q.   And presumably, considering this is 2014 and the start of The European Tour season, it bodes well; it's a good start.   
STUART MANLEY:   Yeah, definitely.   It will give me a lot of confidence.   It's money on the board for the Order of Merit, so, yeah, everything's positive.   
   
 Q.   What's next?  
STUART MANLEY:   What's next?   I'm going to go to Durban next week and hopefully play well there.  
   
 Q.   So you do have a flight tonight?  
STUART MANLEY:   I do have a late night tonight, a long one, to Joburg but I'll be pretty pleased and excited with my result, so I'll look forward to next week.
