 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 TIM SIMPSON:  We kind of caught it sleeping this morning.  I think I'm not whining, I mean it was a tough afternoon for everybody.  But I think we got the worst of the worst starting off the back as well.  We had nine straight holes into the wind.  We had 14 to 18 and 1 through 4.  And when we came to 18, or 17, I hit a good 4-iron with the pin was like 178, I think, 138 front, 140 back.  And I didn't get there.  So I hit a 4-iron 136 yards, my normal 4-iron is 195.  That's 50 yards of wind. 
 But I played really, really solid today.  I had a lot of opportunities.  There was 13 holes to make birdies.  I was 3-under for the day and could have been 7-under just as easy.  But I played real solid and I had a disappointing 3-putt on 12.  It was silly after two good shots.  And then I came back with a birdie at -- I actually bogeyed 14 I think it was. 
 And came back with a birdie at 15. 
 Miss a five footer for at 16. 
 Then 3-putted 17. 
 So it's kind of a little sour taste to throw away a great round.  But anything under par here is good. 

 Q.  After playing two rounds what are you looking forward tomorrow? 
 TIM SIMPSON:  Just continue playing solid.  I'm striking it real well, I'm driving the ball extremely well.  I think I think I only missed one fairway in two days.  So that's a great start.  If I continue to hit the ball solid and swing it well, and my health stays fine, I'll be okay.  I have a rib problem in my back.  It's been bothering me the last few days.
