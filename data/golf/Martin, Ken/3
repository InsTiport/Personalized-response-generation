  Q. Give me your thoughts on the course today, first of all.   
 KEN MARTIN: Oh, it's a fantastic golf course. Obviously it's quite a challenge because it was so wet. And then to have to stop, that always, to me it was, it was the ultimate test. I was fortunate enough to do, to be qualified to be able to play here. So to me it was everything I wanted. You can't throw enough at me this week, I'm kind of just here to be in a Major Championship and experience it all and it was tough.   
 It was definitely tough just because it was so wet and then the wind blew and it switched a little and so it was a great challenge.  
  
  Q. Talk about your game today. A review of your day.   
 KEN MARTIN: Actually it was real solid. I probably miscued on about three or four swings and I paid dearly for each one with penalty shots. And other than that, I was real pleased with the, I made a lot of great choices, I made a lot of great executions, so I stuck with the process and it came out okay. I'm pretty satisfied.   
  
  Q. Long day?  
 KEN MARTIN: Long day. And I got to watch some great golf. Kirk Hanefeld played just wonderfully. So we had a little bit of a back and forth birdie thing going, which was great and then he kind of got going again when would he made the turn to No. 1. And he birdied that one and actually only slipped once on the 8th hole, his 17th. So he played a real solid round of golf. So that was fun also.
