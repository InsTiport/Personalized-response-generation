  Q. Talk about your play today.   
 KEN MARTIN: Well, I had it out of position all day, so therefore I wasn't able to score. You can't recover. So it was a rough day from the beginning.   
  
  Q. How is your experience been so far?  
 KEN MARTIN: Well, it's fabulous to be here. Absolutely fabulous to make the cut and I made that right on the number, so that was pretty cool.   
 First Major Championship. I'm playing the weekend. Disappointed that I hit it out of position, but I'm just thrilled to be here. Absolutely.   
  
  Q. How was the course playing today? Is it still a little wet?  
 KEN MARTIN: No, I would say I was impressed right from the get go that we didn't have any, nothing plugged, the mud was minimal on the golf ball, I didn't have any affect at all from -- we didn't have any run out, but I thought that -- I was amazed at how well this was drying out so tomorrow it will be even better.
