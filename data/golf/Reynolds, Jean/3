   JEAN REYNOLDS: Today was pretty solid as well, 30 putts and nine fairways, 11 greens. Made a bogey on my 17th hole, which was the eighth hole, but other than that, I'm pleased with the round and looking forward to tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How much scoreboard watching did you do today, Jean?  
 JEAN REYNOLDS: Every chance I got. It's kind of hard to miss. They're huge and they're everywhere, so I mean, it seemed like every time I was getting up to a green, there was a scoreboard right there, so I'd glance over and kind of see what was going on, and I had fun with it.   
  
  Q. You looked fairly comfortable playing out there. Was that true? Were you suppressing anxiety at all?  
 JEAN REYNOLDS: The first couple holes I was really nervous. Probably on about 4 I really settled down. I bogeyed 3, and I kind of started walking a little faster and feeling not really pressing, but then my buddy Pauly over there, my hometown boy, he kind of brought me back to reality and just said "chill out."   
 And from then on it was kind of like, let's go play golf and that's what we did.   
  
  Q. What hole did he say "chill out?"   
 JEAN REYNOLDS: 13.  
  
  Q. Was it those words?  
 JEAN REYNOLDS: It was "chill out."  
  
  Q. It didn't get any worse than that?   
 JEAN REYNOLDS: No.
