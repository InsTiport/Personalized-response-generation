Q. Bogey-free 66, excellent playing. If we can get some comments on your day.
NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played very steady. Very pleased. I played the first nine yesterday in 5-over, so I'm thrilled to be 3-under for the tournament. I'm looking forward to the weekend.
Q. You came into the week with three straight missed cuts. What is it sort of that you've found this week?
NICK WATNEY: You know, I did have three straight missed cuts, but there was a lot of positive things going on. I was trending well in a lot of areas. Just a few kind of weird things happening in those events. Just kind of came here, I knew it was going to be a battle every day. This place is very difficult. You know, it's tough sometimes when you are missing cuts but you feel like your game is good. But hopefully this is the start of a really good stretch.
Q. Never missed the cut, eight starts at this event. What is it about the Honda Classic that you like so much?
NICK WATNEY: Well, I think you definitely have to control your ball around here. The wind makes it very difficult. I didn't know that actually, but yeah, I do like the challenge.
