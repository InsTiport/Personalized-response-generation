  Q.  Nice rally there towards the end to bring it back.  Just a couple comments on the day.   
 NICK WATNEY:  Yeah, it was definitely a little tentative start, didn't putt as well as I did yesterday, but made a couple nice birdies, so in good shape for the weekend.   
  
  Q.  Scoring averages were obviously a lot lower today.  Is it obviously the wind?   
 NICK WATNEY:  Yeah, I think the wind was down, no rain obviously, so that helped.  I definitely feel like I might have let a few get away, but under par is good and we'll see what happens on the weekend.   
  
  Q.  Did you change your mindset at all from yesterday going into today, anything that you might tweak going into tomorrow?   
 NICK WATNEY:  You know, not on purpose.  I think maybe I got squirrelly early and I didn't putt as well because I was so tentative.  But I think I'm just going to go in with the mindset of these are the best players in the world, I'm going to have to play two good rounds.  There's no reason to protect anything.   
  
  Q.  What are you up to tonight?  Going to see the Bonnie Raitt concert?   
 NICK WATNEY:  I think so.  My mom was really excited about that, so I think we're going to head over there and check it out for a while.
