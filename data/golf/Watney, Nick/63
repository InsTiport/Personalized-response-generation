Q. Talk about the round today, two bogeys, you're still at the top of the leaderboard heading into the weekend. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I'm excited.   It's been a little while since I've been in this position, and it feels good to be back, and I'm really excited for the weekend. 

Q.   Have you begun to think about the possibility of winning this tournament? 
NICK WATNEY:   Not really.   We're only halfway done.   So much can happen so quickly out here.   It's very difficult. 
It may start to creep in tomorrow a little bit, but as of right now, I have not.

Q.   Can you talk about that shot on 13 that started the birdie run? 
NICK WATNEY:   I made a putt there, probably a 12‑footer, but it was downhill, a big break.   I just bogeyed the 12th.   It was nice to get on a run there after a mistake. 

Q.   You said the course was playing easier or as easy as you guys were going to see it.   Do you think that still holds true?   How was it today?
NICK WATNEY:   No, it definitely toughened up.   The greens are getting much, much firmer and very crusty and fast.   Yeah, I think the really low scores‑‑ there may be some in the morning, but afternoon, the golf course is playing very difficult. 

Q.   People are surprised how successful consistently you were last year and how 2012 has gone for you.   How would you best explain why? 
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I think there's a lot of reasons, putting probably the biggest.   I haven't putted as well as I did last year.   It's definitely a frustrating season.   But it can all turn around this week, and if I can make a little run here, it can turn into a great year. 
I'm excited for the weekend and these Playoffs coming up.

Q.   2011 you made your first team competition, and you're not in the conversation, I guess there's like six guys playing for four spots officially.   Are you surprised or saddened that you're not in the conversation right now, and is it in the front of your mind that if you win here you'll get their attention?
NICK WATNEY:   I'm not saddened that I'm not in the conversation only because I haven't done anything to deserve that, really.   Someone mentioned that to me yesterday about if you win here and play good next week, Davis is going to do what he's going to do.   Obviously Keegan was hot at the end of last year and didn't get picked.   It's very clichÃ©, but I really can't control it, and I have so much work to do this weekend that if by some chance I would be in that conversation Sunday night, then great.   But as of right now, it isn't really an issue.
