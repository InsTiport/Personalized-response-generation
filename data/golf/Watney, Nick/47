  NICK WATNEY:   Trying to put as much pressure as I can on him.   I don't know what that will be.   But I guess we're going to go till dark tonight and see what we've got tomorrow morning.  
   
 Q.   You had a good stretch late on the front nine.   
    NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I was kind of just treading water at the start, and then hit a nice little spurt thinking I had something going.   
    Unfortunately, not, but nothing to feel bad about, because we've got to turn around and go right back out.  
   
 Q.   Lot of golf left, obviously.   
    NICK WATNEY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Do you watch the leaderboard at this point, or you know what's going on?   
    NICK WATNEY:   Probably not.   Not unless you get to 5‑ or 6‑under par, I think.   That's never happened before, but anything's possible, I guess.
