 Q.   Obviously a solid week for you.   How did this course play for you, and did you notice kind of differences between Thursday and today?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, the course was very difficult.   I don't think it was quite as firm today as Thursday.   Thursday was probably the most difficult.   
But considering the storm, overall it played really good, very difficult, and pretty good week.  
   
 Q.   What do you like about the play you played, especially yesterday and today?  
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I had a lot of chances out there.   Today I got off to a really nice start.   I hit a big of I snag in the middle of my round.   But overall I'm pleased, feel like I'm headed in the right direction, and looking forward to the rest of the year.
