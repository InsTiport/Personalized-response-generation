Q.   Coming off a food week last week at Torrey Pines.   6â€‘under par.   Talk about the momentum you're building here. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I think that things are kind of rounding into form and the game's a lot of fun right now, so I just want to keep going. 

Q.   You live in California, went to Fresno State, how fun is it to play in your part of the California area here?
NICK WATNEY:   It's great.   This is kind of a home coming for me.   I have a lot of family and friends out.   I love coming here and now we got, we finally got the weather that has the potential to be so great.   I think it's going to be a great week.

Q.   How fun was it playing with Buster Posey today from the San Francisco Giants?
NICK WATNEY:   I was on cloud nine.   I saw the parings and I'm a huge fan of his and he's a really, really great guy.   He's a better guy than he is baseball player.   Which is saying a lot.   So it was a fun day.
