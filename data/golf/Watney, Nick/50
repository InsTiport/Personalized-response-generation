Q.   Great way to close out the first round, just get your comments on the day as a whole. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, it's always a bonus to make a putt like that.   I'm very happy with 4‑under.   I was 2‑over after four, so it's kind of‑‑ kind of viewing this as a full day, so marathon's half over and I guess when you're playing well, you want to keep going, and today we get to keep going.

Q.   Any weather issues out there for you with the wind?
NICK WATNEY:   None yet.   It makes those one and two thirds, definitely pay attention, but no issues yet.
