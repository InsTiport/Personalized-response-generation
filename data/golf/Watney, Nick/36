  NICK WATNEY:   You know, it was actually fairly similar in terms of wind from the end of yesterday, but a little different direction, and the greens felt like they picked up a little speed.   It was a tricky day, and happy to finish it off.

Q.   You had on a lot of layers.   Was it cold out there this morning?
NICK WATNEY:   This morning it was cold.   Well, it was definitely the coldest we've felt in a while.   Yeah, it's kind of weird.   Tuesday was in the 90s and today was 50s.   It was a challenge packing this week.

Q.   What is it about this golf course that there's Jim Furyk going out there and shooting the grass off it and you're playing with a guy that made a ton of birdies today, that that can happen and it could go the other way, as well?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I don't know.   Out of 70 guys, there's kind of‑‑ there's a big gap between guys playing really well, like you said, and guys struggling.   I think maybe if you're on, it's something you can go out and get, and if you're off, it's pretty penalizing, I guess.   There's no in between, really.
