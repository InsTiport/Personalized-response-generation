  Q. What's your mindset and how do you change it?  
 NICK WATNEY: I don't have to change my mindset, I just have to play well.  
    
  Q. Different holes that gave you trouble?  
 NICK WATNEY: 13 I hit a really bad tee shot and ended up making a double, which just was kind of stealing them from myself.  
 If I can get going fairly low tomorrow, I have chances to hopefully make more birdies.  
    
  Q. You did save a couple of pars. Is that as small a victory as you might take into tomorrow?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yes. I'll take those.
