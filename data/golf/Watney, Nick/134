  Q. Nick, have you had a chance to watch Tiger's conference this morning, I'm interested in what your thoughts might be?  
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I thought it was very heartfelt. I'm sure it was tough.   
 I agree with a lot of the guys that were out here, just more concerned about when he's going to get back on the golf course, not necessarily everything in his personal life.
