Q.   How is the course? 
NICK WATNEY:   Pretty tricky I thought.   The wind was up‑and‑down.   Definitely not easy out there, I bogeyed three holes in a row, but made three birdies coming in, and one on the last.

Q.   Is it extra special, I know you play all over the nation, but when you're relatively close to home? 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, definitely.   This is as close as I get.   I have a lot of friends and family here. 

Q.   Thoughts on Sunday? 
NICK WATNEY:   Well, pretty far back.   I just have to play as good as I can.
