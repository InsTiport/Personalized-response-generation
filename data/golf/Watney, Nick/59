 Q.   5‑under 66 today, obviously coming off a huge week last week.   It obviously didn't distract you too much.   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I got off to a bit of a slow start.   I don't know if it was just‑‑ I don't know what it was, but I played very nicely today.   Probably not going to win this week, but still in line for a decent finish.  
   
 Q.   You said you're probably not going to win this week.   I won't go as far as saying that yet, but I've got to ask, how much is the Ryder Cup in mind when you put up a round like that coming off a week like you had last week?  
NICK WATNEY:   Honestly not too much.   It's out of my control, and from where I was starting the Playoffs, it's good that I'm even in the conversation, if I am.   I've still got a whole 'nother round tomorrow.   Hopefully that goes well, and we'll sit and wait.
