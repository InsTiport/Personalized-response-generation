  Q. You're in good position 10-under par. How do you feel after the first two rounds and how do you feel heading forward?  
 NICK WATNEY: I feel good. I mean I stayed pretty steady today. Didn't make a whole lot of putts today, so I'm happy with 10-under, and looking forward to the weekend.  
  
  Q. Is it tough for you to kind of muster up some energy given how many tournaments you've played and the mental, physical side of the PLAYOFFS?  
 NICK WATNEY: You know, I think, if anything, it might be good. I was getting into kind of having a lot of expectations there at the end of the season, and really just going out there and taking it pretty easy. And you know, this course is one that you gotta make some birdies, so it might be a good thing to just not have that much expectation. I'm in pretty good position headed to the weekend, so looking forward to it.  
  
  Q. Have these first couple of rounds been a lot more fun, a lot more stress free?  
 NICK WATNEY: Definitely. This is kind of icing on the cake. I'm staying at home, just relaxing all week. Yeah. So far pretty stress free.   
  
  Q. Some really low numbers this morning, and it seemed like the conditions were there again today. Was there any reason some guys didn't take it quite as deep this afternoon?  
 NICK WATNEY: Well, for me, I just didn't make any putts.   
 You know, Jonathan Byrd, I think he shot -- what did he shoot? He might have shot 6-under.  
  
  Q. 5-under?  
 NICK WATNEY: Right. And it looked pretty easy. I think it's still out there. I'm not sure why we haven't taken advantage of it this afternoon.   
  
  Q. Any birdies that stand out today on your card?  
 NICK WATNEY: I birdied 18. That was nice. But other than that, pretty uneventful afternoon.
