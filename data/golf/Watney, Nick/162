   NELSON SILVERIO: Nick Watney, thanks for coming in and spending a few minutes with us today. Vegas resident, why don't you get us started. 63 today. Talk about the conditions out there.  
 NICK WATNEY: Conditions are great. I mean, no wind, good greens, and seems to be quite a few wedge shots in the greens. So perfect scoring conditions.  
 NELSON SILVERIO: Tell us about that finish. You eagled 16 and birdied 18.   
 NICK WATNEY: I actually hit a -- not the greatest tee shot on 16 and got a good break. It was sitting up in the rough, and hit a good shot in there.   
 And then 18 I hit a sand wedge about eight feet, so it was a nice way to finish.  
 NELSON SILVERIO: Questions.  
  
  Q. First of all, can you clarify where in Las Vegas do you live, and when did you move here? You're from Fresno, aren't you?   
 NICK WATNEY: I went to school in Fresno.  
  
  Q. Fresno State, right?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So is this a tax situation move? Is this between you and your accountant?  
 NICK WATNEY: It's a bit of a tax move. Travel is easy out of here and I work with Butch Harmon, so he's right down the street. It's a good thing to be close to him.  
  
  Q. Do you live in Seven Hills?  
 NICK WATNEY: I live right near there, yeah.   
  
  Q. In Las Vegas near Seven Hills?  
 NICK WATNEY: My address is in Henderson.   
  
  Q. I saw that you were working with Butch on the range here this week. Were you working on something specific, or just a tune up getting ready to play here?  
 NICK WATNEY: I actually hadn't seen Butch for about two months, so we had a nice little session on the range trying to get my backswing wider. Actually, wider on the backswing and the through-swing. It really kind of clicked yesterday.   
 And then we worked really hard on my putting, also. It's been by far the weakest fart of my game this year. Butch took a look at that. I putted great today, but I need to keep working on that for sure.  
  
  Q. When the conditions are like this, is it easier to go attack flags?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah. I mean, I think you have to. And also the golf course kind of lends itself to that with reachable par-5s and some shorter par-4s. So I think you have a lot of chances to be aggressive.  
  
  Q. Take the driver out of the bag a little bit more then?   
 NICK WATNEY: I mean, I didn't hit a ton of drivers, but the golf course is playing pretty fast. It's not playing as long as it maybe would if it was soft.   
  
  Q. You had an early bogey in your round, I believe at 4.   
 NICK WATNEY: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. How did you settle down after that and kind of get yourself rolling?   
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I mean, I think everybody is going to make mistakes. I definitely hit a few bad shots on that hole, but I knew there was a lot of time left.   
 The low scores, you know, you know that you have to shoot low, but at the same time you know that there's probably going to be a lot of opportunity to make some birdies.   
 So I wasn't too concerned with it at that time.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised at how well you putted today? Usually in the afternoon with all the footprints being left around it can sometimes play havoc with a guy.   
 NICK WATNEY: Right. I wouldn't say surprised. I was pleased with the way I putted. I've been working on it, so I wouldn't say surprised.  
  
  Q. When did you move here?  
 NICK WATNEY: Last August.   
  
  Q. How do you like it here?   
 NICK WATNEY: I like it. Yeah, I like it.   
 NELSON SILVERIO: Okay. Nick Watney, thanks.   
 NICK WATNEY: Thanks.
