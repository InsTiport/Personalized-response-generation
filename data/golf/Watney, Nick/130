 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: It's a totally opposite wind from yesterday and also with the rain it made it a little bit longer. Definitely a few tougher pins out there. So I think scores will go up a touch. 

 Q. Is there a difference between making the cut and missing the cut by a couple shots, beside shooting lower scores than anybody else that you can, what's the difference between making the cut today? Is there a hole that can turn around a round one way or the other?
 NICK WATNEY: I think that it's kind of the entire back nine. There's some tough flags and the wind, depending upon which gust you get, the par-5s are reachable or not. 
 So I guess it would be starting at, well, 11 through 16 would be a really important stretch.

 Q. Did you have a certain number you were looking for today to make sure you made the cut? You were starting in such a good place today. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I wasn't really too concerned with making the cut. I was trying to improve my position. 
 It's always nice to make the cut at the Masters, I guess.
