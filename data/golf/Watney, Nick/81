 Q.   If you could go through kind of what the questions were about with the ruling and how you came to a conclusion.   
NICK WATNEY:   Well, the question was if Chad, my caddie, was testing the surface or testing for grain, which, I mean, I didn't think that he would do that.   But we looked at the tape, and you could see his hand was just above the grass.   So it was deemed no penalty.  
   
 Q.   And after looking at the tape you were pretty clear and the rules officials were all pretty clear that that was the case, that there was no penalty?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, that's what we came up with.   I would be shocked if he actually put his hand on the surface.   We asked him, and he said he didn't, so there you go.
