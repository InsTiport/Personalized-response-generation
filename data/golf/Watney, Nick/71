 Q.   Nick, tough finish there on the last.   Just comment on the day as a whole.   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I feel pretty good.   Hung in there, wasn't quite as sharp as I was the first two days, which is hard to follow up a good score, but I've still got a chance, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How tough is it finishing the way you did today?   You'd like to get some momentum going from one day to the other.   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, it's never fun, obviously.   It was a tough tee shot, especially with the wind off the left and kind of overcorrected there.   But it is what it is.   It was one hole, and it's a long tournament.   Tomorrow is a new day.   
Like I said, I've still got a chance, and I'm real excited.  
   
 Q.   How interesting was it for you and Webb to be paired together?   Did you guys talk about that overnight as you were getting ready to come in here?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, we did.   It was great.   If we could have drew it up, that's where we wanted to be.   Webb is a good friend, and it was fun out there.   
   
 Q.   Who takes out the trash tonight?  
NICK WATNEY:   That's my job.   I shot the high score.
