  NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, it rolled over the lip and I thought it might catch it but it didn't.  
   
 Q.   I hate to make you talk about the 18th hole again but can you talk a little bit about what happened there?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah.   I mean I knew what was at stake and I pushed it a little bit.   I thought -- I thought it was into play, to be honest with you, kind of snuck up on me over there.   
Extremely disappointed.   If you said at any point you birdie last hole you're in a playoff, you would take it.   Yeah, that was really a bad shot at a really bad time.  
   
 Q.   But you got next week, you're playing well, you've got to feel good about that.  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah.   I mean lot of positives from these last four events and you know, it's kind of -- it's hard to think about that right now but when I go home, you know, a lot of good stuff like you said and who knows, hot at the right time you can go far.   That's the goal.  
   
 Q.   Go hug that baby.  
NICK WATNEY:   All right.
