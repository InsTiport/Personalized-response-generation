 Q.  Overall assessment?  I think I followed you the last 13 holes.  Pleasure to watch today.  
NICK WATNEY: Thanks.  Yeah, played pretty nice.  Didn't feel -- yesterday I played really, really -- yesterday was pretty easy, today maybe didn't feel quite as good, but very pleased with the score and I look forward to the next couple days.   
 Q.  You said yesterday was easy, but you did that on the toughest course in the trio, and this course being the easiest course, I mean does that set up, like you think, oh, okay, well did I that on Stadium, now tomorrow I get to go to La Quinta, which is statistically is the easiest of the three courses.  
NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I mean it's a double-edged sword though because you start off you make a few pars and you think you're losing ground and, Jon Rahm shot 10-under here and I'm even through three or whatever.  So it's good and bad, because you know that you can play a nice round, but if you make four pars in a row, you kind of start pressing.  So I think you just got to -- it is definitely the easiest course, but some OB creeps in out there and I mean it's not blowing that hard, but there are a few wind-affected shots, so you definitely need to pay attention.  It's not as visually intimidating as the Stadium, but you still got to keep it in between the trees and all that stuff, so pleased with the day and you know you never quite know where you stand until you play all three and everybody has a shot at all of them.  So I'm happy to be where I'm at and go try to do the same tomorrow.
