  Q. Just talk about your match, obviously you played well yesterday afternoon, and then one of the early singles matches, you came out and beat a guy who has played great this week in K.J. Choi.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played with K.J. this year in Philly and he just keeps coming. He's a great competitor. He's been playing just awesome all week. So I knew it was going to be a really tough match, and I think I'm just very, very happy to contribute and they have been making a run at us, so hopefully we can squeak it out here.   
  
  Q. That 3-iron, is that as good as you can hit it? You got pretty close to the hole considering the hole location and K.J. was in a little trouble. Just talk about that shot.   
 NICK WATNEY: I have not struck the ball as well as I would like all week and so I've been a little bit off. To hit that shot on this stage, it's something I'll remember for a long time. I mean, it was exactly where I wanted it, and very happy.   
  
  Q. Compare your nerves on a shot like that compared to an AT&T National, another event you've won.   
 NICK WATNEY: It's different. I've heard guys say it's different, but I didn't know what they were talking about. And it is different to play in a team environment, and then in match play, 2-up, three to go, you should win, so there's that element of it.   
 It's just that it's very different from what we do week-to-week. I feel like I really bonded with these guys and just very, very happy to contribute.
