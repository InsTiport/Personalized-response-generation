 Q.  7-under 65, bogey-free, perfect conditions.  How important is it for you to get a good round here at the Stadium Course?  
NICK WATNEY: I think it's nice.  It's probably the most penal of the three, so you never quite know until Saturday night how everything's playing, because I think historically this would probably be the toughest of the three, but you just don't know until everybody's played them all.  So real happy to get a good round in and go back at it tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're a veteran out here, this is a tournament that has multiple golf course, what sort of approach do you take to prepare for this week?  
NICK WATNEY: I think it's good to see just how the greens are reacting and whatnot, but at this point we played it a few times, there shouldn't be too many surprises, so pretty basic in terms of you want to be prepared, the grasses are all pretty similar, so there's no surprises, but always nice to get a good round under your belt.   
 Q.  You've been battling back from some injuries, it's been a slow process, what has been the key for you trying to get to this point where you can go out and play well?  
NICK WATNEY: I think just getting, playing a bunch and talking to my wife about it and Butch, I mean you stand on the range all you want, but until you hit it when it counts, that's where you really learn what you need to work on and maybe what your weaknesses are, stuff like that.  So it's definitely taking a little longer than I would have liked, but hopefully I can get some good momentum and get back to playing well.
