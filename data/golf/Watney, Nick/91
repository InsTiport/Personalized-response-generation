 Q. Are you happy with your round?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played pretty well. I would have liked to have got a few more under, but overall I think the scores will be pretty low this afternoon.

 Q. Talk about 18, the eagle that you had. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I saw Matt was definitely right behind me and he hit a 4-iron. He was a few yards behind me, so I figured it was a perfect club, and I was finally able to make a putt. It was about the longest one I made all day. Yeah, it was a good hole for me for sure. 

 Q. If you were to win, is there any way you'd be the most famous Watney in this town?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I don't think there's any chance of that around here. Yesterday in the pro-am I heard her name probably 100 times. I think she's got that title pretty much sewn up. 

 Q. Talk about coming out of the bunker on 4 and making birdie. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I was a little bit nervous on that shot. There's definitely a lot of trouble there. The green drops off, and it's a pretty deep bunker. That was very sweet to get out of there with a birdie.
