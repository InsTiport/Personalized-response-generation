 Q. Was it what you thought it would be?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it was awesome. I mean, I'm very, very happy to have played well. But at the same time I'm kind of bummed that the week is over. 
 But I think I get to come back next year, so I'm very excited.

 Q. Talk about your eagle on 14. 
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I've seen that hole on TV and played a few practice rounds, and I knew the ball was going to come down to the right. Jeev actually hit right before me and his ball released to the right. I just threw it out there to the left and got lucky.

 Q. What did you hit in?
 NICK WATNEY: I had 119 to the hole and I hit a sand wedge. 

 Q. What was the wind like out there?
 NICK WATNEY: It was pretty tricky. It's gusting up and down, and then obviously knows Amen Corner is off the left, off the right. It's pretty tricky. Anything that adds to these greens definitely makes it tougher. So obviously it was pretty tricky out there.

 Q. Is how good is your score, considering all the wind?
 NICK WATNEY: Well, if you would have told me starting the day 71, I would have taken it. Sunday at The Masters, anything under par is pretty good. 

 Q. What was the highlight for the week, one or two things?
 NICK WATNEY: It's tough to pick out one or two. Obviously the first tee shot and just being here, the atmosphere is amazing. 
 I would say coming down the stretch, able to hit some shots, very encouraging. I mean, this is the biggest stage in golf. So I'm excited, and hopefully I can build on it.

 Q. What does it mean to you that you get to come back next year? 
 NICK WATNEY: You know, it was definitely a goal starting the weekend. I didn't want to get too far ahead of myself. This is pretty much -- if you can pencil this in on the schedule, it's definitely a bonus, so I'm very, very excited about that.
