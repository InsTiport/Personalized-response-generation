 Q. Obviously a pretty tough day, you birdied the first, but the double bogey at 6 kind of derailed you, and it was hard to get on track I guess.
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I didn't have my best stuff today. I had quite a few, you know, 6-, 7-, 8-footers for par that I missed. It was a bit of a disappointing day, but it's only Saturday, and hopefully I'm sure the golf course will stay difficult and a good round will go a long way tomorrow.
 
 Q. Sounds like the greens are getting pretty firm.
 NICK WATNEY: Firm and fast. Yeah, it's tough out there. There's no easy 2-putt really. From six feet, you definitely have the next one in your mind.
 Yeah, it's tough out there.
 
 Q. Does that make it difficult for you to adjust your game when the greens have firmed up and it's different from a couple of days ago?
 NICK WATNEY: No, I think it's -- by this time, you kind of realize it. The greens were getting brown; even Tuesday, they had a little bit of brown to them, and now they are pretty baked out.
 You could tell it was coming.
