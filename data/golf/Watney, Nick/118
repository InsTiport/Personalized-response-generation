   NICK WATNEY: The greens are soft, but they're still smooth. I mean there were some really low scores today. 
 You know, the tough pins are getting a lot easier once the ball is going to stop where it hits. Hopefully if the rain holds off and they can get a little firmer, hopefully they'll play easier.

 Q. I'd love to see you play well on the weekend, but you're eight days away from a really big day in your life. You're getting married in Cozumel. Congratulations. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, thanks. We're excited about it.
