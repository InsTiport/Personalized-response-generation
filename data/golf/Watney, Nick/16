 Q.  Talk about the conditions out there today in the final round.  NICK WATNEY: Well, it was probably the windiest day that we have had, so pretty tough.  It was kind of -- well the rough's brutal and the greens are firm and add a little bit of wind, it makes it tough.   Q.  You had to be happy on your finish this week, getting back into contention and doing well this week.  NICK WATNEY: Yeah, right now I have a bit of a sour taste, I feel like I left a few out there, with the putter especially. But, yeah, it's nice to be upset with 7th and on to the next one.
