 Q.   Nick, nice round.   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, you know, I believe that the course is playing fairly easy.   The putting is going to be really big on the weekend.   Ryan played great the first two days, so I'll being chasing this weekend.  
   
 Q.   Is it fun to be almost in a putting contest?  
NICK WATNEY:   It is if you're making 'em; it can be a little frustrating if you're not.   
It can all change rather quickly, so I'm looking forward to the next few days.  
   
 Q.   Talk about going into the weekend with a little momentum, being right there in the hunt?  
NICK WATNEY:   It's fun.   It's nice to play well at home.   I got a lot of friends and family out, so I'm looking forward to trying to put together a nice weekend.  
   
 Q.   Vegas will be cheering for you.  
NICK WATNEY:   Thank you.
