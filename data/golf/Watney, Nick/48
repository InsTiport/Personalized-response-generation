Q.   Long day today? 
    NICK WATNEY:   It was a bit of a marathon.   I played two tournaments this year.   You know, I got 36 at Kapalua and 26 here.   So it's been a bit odd, but, overall, not a bad day. 
    I'm not sure how far back I am, but all we can do tomorrow is go out and try to make him think about it a little bit and see what happens.

Q.   You're 6â€‘back currently.   Is there any sort of strategy change?   How do you feel you'll go about your final 11 holes? 
    NICK WATNEY:   All I can do is I'm going to try to make as many birdies as I can.   I've got 11 and 12 that are tough, and hopefully, maybe he can help me out a little bit, I don't know.   But I can't just hand it to him, as a competitor.   So we'll come out and see how close we can get.

Q.   One more thing.   You're a California boy.   Tell me how the greens dealt with all of the rain and moisture today?   Because you made some fantastic par saves the last few holes. 
    NICK WATNEY:   Thank you, yeah.   They held up pretty well.   These greens are kind of a topic of a lot of conversation, usually.   But coming in, they were firm, so they held up pretty well until all of the moisture.
