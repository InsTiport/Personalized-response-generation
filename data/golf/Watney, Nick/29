Q. Nice finish, 2-under par 69, especially the birdie at 18?NICK WATNEY: Yeah, thanks.  I played for the most part, I played really nice today.  I missed a few shorties and obviously doubled the first, never fun.  But played great and looking forward to watching this soccer match and kind of relaxing this afternoon.
Q. How tough is the course playing out there?NICK WATNEY: Hard.  I think -- I was telling my caddie, we were wearing out 5- and 6-irons, 4-, 5-, and 6-irons on par 4s which we normally don't see. Luckily I hit some fairways today, but you know, you can be hitting those clubs from the rough.  So it was playing pretty difficult.  I think that shows in the scores.  Just got to get them when you can.
Q. So at least today you liked the tough course?NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I did.  With the wind up like this, and lucky I guess we got a little bit of rain, but the golf course is playing very difficult.  I think over the weekend, it should be a lot tougher.
Q. How about the wind, seemed like it was changing club choice?NICK WATNEY: It's tricky out there and as long as the course is playing with the wind, it made it even more difficult.  If it stays like that, it will be really tough.
Q. What did you do really well today?NICK WATNEY: I made a lot of birdies, which you don't really expect to do around here.  I made a few mistakes early and just kind of hung in there and made a few putts.  I'll definitely take 2-under par around this course.
Q. Are you watching the World Cup game?NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I want to see what happens, I hope they get through.
