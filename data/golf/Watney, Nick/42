Q.   How do you think you played out there today? 
NICK WATNEY:   I played pretty well.   The conditions were pretty tough this morning.   Pretty chilly and windy, so I'll definitely take any round in the 60s.

Q.   Does a ‑8 score by a player kind of surprise you a little bit today, Nick? 
NICK WATNEY:   That's pretty good.   I would take that any day.   But today was, like I said, it was a pretty tough starting out, so 8‑under is some good golf.

Q.   Do you like the course the way it is today as opposed to the way it normally is?   Which one do you prefer? 
NICK WATNEY:   I guess whatever day I'm shooting the lowest score.   As a player, you kind of take what you get, and with all of the rain we got, we knew we'd be a little bit soft this morning. 
But it drained pretty well from yesterday to today.   I'm assuming by the weekend the greens will be getting a little more firm like we're used to.

Q.   You think people teeing off in the afternoon might get some better rolls? 
NICK WATNEY:   Well, if the wind dies, they'll definitely have a bit of an advantage just because it was blowing decent clip this morning.   So I heard it's supposed to die down for them, which will be making it a little easier, because I'm sure it will stay fairly soft.   But it's just the way things go.   I'm happy with my round, so I'll go home and watch the boys have at it.

Q.   Most people don't know that today is your birthday.   How are you going to spend the rest of the day? 
NICK WATNEY:   Well, waking up at 5:00 in the morning, I'll probably be pretty tame tonight, but, yeah, it's always good to celebrate a birthday and to shoot a decent round makes it even better.
