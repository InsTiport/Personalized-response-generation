Q.   Pretty tough rain today.   How much longer did the course play today with the rain? 
    NICK WATNEY:   It played a little bit.   I don't know how much it rained last night, but it definitely softened up the place.   But I think we got a pretty good end of the draw being on the North today.

Q.   How was it teeing off with Tiger today and the energy seemed like an old gallery? 
    NICK WATNEY:   Well, it's always fun to play with Tiger.   Rickie played great too, so (Indiscernible).

Q.   How did you play your round today? 
    NICK WATNEY:   I played pretty good.   I didn't do anything too special, but I got around with 4‑under.

Q.   Going into the weekend, are you happy with how you're going into the weekend? 
    NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I think I'm 4‑back right now.   Who knows what that will be, but, yeah, we're heading over to the South for the weekend.   So 4‑back is not a bad place to be.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
    NICK WATNEY:   I played all right.   Yeah, I finished in the top ten a couple of times.   Just if you make some putts around the South, you're not going to hit it too close because the course is so difficult, so it comes down to putting, really.
