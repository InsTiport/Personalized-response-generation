  Q. I know that's not the way you wanted the round to end but you played really solid golf all day?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, right now, it's still pretty fresh. Overall, pleased with the day, and look forward to tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You made a lot of birdies on the back nine to get to the No. 14. It seemed like you were really hitting the ball in the fairway and taking care of business out there.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, that's what makes the finish so frustrating.  
  
  Q. Did you just hang onto it a little bit there? The wind was blowing left-to-right?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I'm not sure what happened. I hit a bad shot, and I kind of hit it on the heel. When I first hit it, I thought maybe since I did hit it on the heel, it would fade back. But stayed straight, so, oh, well.
