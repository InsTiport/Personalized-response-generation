Q.   Solid out there today, finally got it all done.   Just talk about the round as a whole. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, there was definitely some sloppy points for both of us, but I'm very happy to get a win.   I have a ton of respect for DT, and it's nice to‑‑ it's always nice to get a win at this tournament.   It's a world golf event, and you can't win them all if you don't win the first one, so I'm happy with the way everything went.

Q.   You go from one veteran U.S. guy to another, you beat one, now you've got Stricker.   Talk about that. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, Strick is really tough.   He's never out of a hole.   He's such a great putter, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for him, too.   I know it's going to be tough, and I'm excited.

Q.   Just this course and kind of the defense seems to be around the greens.   Just talk about your game and how it fits out here. 
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I was thinking about that on the drive in, actually, and in past years I've struck the ball really well here for some reason, and I did today for the most part.   But probably what saved me today was my short game, so I'm real excited about that, just because that's been where I've been loose a little bit at times.   If I can keep that sharp and hit the ball a little cleaner, then things could be good.

Q.   And how crazy was yesterday for you, the last 24 hours? 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, that was incredible.   I mean, I've only seen a snow out one other time, and that was in college in Provo, Utah.   You expect it a little more out there than here.   But as a golfer, you wouldn't rather be anywhere else.   You just kind of watch a movie and get ready for your match.
