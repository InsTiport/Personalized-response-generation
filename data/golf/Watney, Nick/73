Q.   Just a couple general comments on your round today.   I guess your T 11?
NICK WATNEY:   I played very well, finished with a 5 to put a damper on it a little bit.   Overall I'm pleased.   I think I'm three shots back.

Q.   Yeah, exactly. 
NICK WATNEY:   Not much more you can ask for in the first major of the year.   I'm looking forward to the weekend.

Q.   Did you bogey 18?
NICK WATNEY:   I did, yeah.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
NICK WATNEY:   I hit it to the right and kind of hit a tree and kicked out.   I had a really long way to go.   Hit it short of the green and wasn't able to get up‑and‑down. 

Q.   Take advantage of the par 5s?
NICK WATNEY:   Not really.   I am playing very well.   I made a few more putts today, which is nice.   Still just a little sloppy, so if I can tighten it up on the weekend, maybe I can make some noise. 

Q.   A lot better than you did at this time last year?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, yeah.
