 Q. How many bogeys have you had this week?
 NICK WATNEY: I've had zero bogeys.

 Q. How important is that going into a weekend knowing that your card is clean; your confidence must be through the roof. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I think it's important to have never gone backwards, so I'm just trying to keep doing what I'm doing, keep going on and play. I'm putting very well. Hopefully I can keep that up and just see where I end up.

 Q. Do you sense that momentum that you are not losing shots and only gaining ground?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I was talking with my caddie today, it's been -- I don't I don't want to jinx anything. It's been fairly easy. I've been hitting driver well and making a lot of shot putts. Yeah, definitely I would have some momentum, having not made any bogeys.
