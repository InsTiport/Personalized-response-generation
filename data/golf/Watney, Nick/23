  NICK WATNEY:   I feel pretty good.   First few days were great.   Today didn't have my best stuff.
But I think I'm on a good path.   Looking forward to next week.

Q.   What takes you to the next level now?
NICK WATNEY:   Just have to make more putts.   Hit it decent enough.   I just didn't make anything.
So I think that's what separating me right now.

Q.   What did you think of Geoff's day?
NICK WATNEY:   I thought he played great.   He got off to a nice start and then obviously the eagle on, what was it, 14 or 13?   Whatever it was, 13, I think.   That was obviously huge for him.
So I'm happy for him.   Good guy.   Very well deserved.

Q.   And Montreux?
NICK WATNEY:   Montreux is great.   As good as I remember it.   You know, they hold a great event.
