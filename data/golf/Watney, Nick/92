  Q. Nick, all things considered, 7-under is the score of the day, but did you expect scores to be this low the way the course has been playing?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I mean, it's fairly short. So I think if you drive it in the fairway, you'll have a lot of opportunities.   
  
  Q. The fact that you had to start and then stop, how did the course play differently after the rain?  
 NICK WATNEY: It was a bit different. Obviously a bit softer with the rain. But overall, I think it held up pretty well, and hopefully we can get in before the hurricane comes.   
  
  Q. If you were making the call, what would you decide, knowing that you're going to get slammed on Sunday, what would you decide?  
 NICK WATNEY: I would try to get it in on Saturday. Seems like the most logical thing to do, as opposed to staying until Tuesday or whatever it may be. But that may be a little bit too easy, I'm not sure.  
  
  Q. Obviously you have to do what you're told, so you're prepared for either/or?  
 NICK WATNEY: It would be great to play if we could play two rounds on Saturday. Like you said, powers that be will make that decision, so prepared to stay as long as we need to stay.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about your position, 4-under, three behind the leader right now?   
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I feel pretty good. I was a little sloppy at times. So if I can tighten that up, I should have a decent chance.   
  
  Q. But the score overall?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, pretty happy with it.
