 Q.   Not your best week.   I think you're somewhere between 45th and 50th, but there's a good chance depending on what everybody else does this will still be top 5 heading into the TOUR Championship.   Ultimately you have a chance to win the entire thing in two weeks if you play well.   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I just ran out of gas this week.   It was my sixth in a row, and I just‑‑ I was just very flat and just ran out of gas.   
But if I stay in the top 5, that would be great.   If not, that's too bad.   But Bill showed last year that there's always a chance.   I think just going there and trying to take care of business, hopefully I can control my own destiny, but if I go there and win, FedExCup hopefully will take care of itself.   
   
 Q.   So it's probably the right time to have a week off for you in terms of resting for a couple days, getting back home?   
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, this is the first time I've played six straight in a while, and throw the win in there, and it's been a long month and a half.   All good things, and I'm definitely looking forward to Atlanta.   But before that I'm going to get some rest.   
   
 Q.   And after having played Wyndham and going into the Barclays, you probably will take this position in second?  
NICK WATNEY:   Absolutely.  
   
 Q.   Not having the best of years and then getting a win at the Barclays and getting a chance at $10 million and winning the TOUR Championship?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I'm very excited for the end of this playoff session.   Yeah, after this year, I couldn't ask for a better place to be.
