  Q. Nice playing out there. Comment on a good day and a wild week.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, we were talking out there coming down the stretch there, it feels like we've been here for two weeks.   
 But overall I'm very, very happy. Right about now I'm kind of thinking back to a few of the shots that I gave away. A little bittersweet right now, but overall excited for the rest of the year.   
  
  Q. Building on what you did last week?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, Sunday was obviously one of those days where I did a lot of things right. Thursday was a little frustrating just because I felt like I was playing well and didn't get much out of it. But the rest of the days, the rest of the rounds I played very well.   
 First and foremost I'm looking forward to going to sleep. But after that, I'm really looking to Pebble Beach.   
  
  Q. If nobody actually gets done tonight are you going to come back out tomorrow morning?   
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I'm at 15. I doubt that I'll have to stick around. I mean, obviously if that were the case, I would love to. But I don't think that I have a chance.  
  
  Q. Would they make you stay?  
 NICK WATNEY: No, I think if I miss the playoff that's on me. But like I said, I don't anticipate 15 being in a playoff.
