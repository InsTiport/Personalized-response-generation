  THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Nick Watney.   Great start to the 2014 Barracuda Championship.   Nine birdies, no bogeys.   Top of the leaderboard.   You're making your first start back here, I think, since 2008.   Obviously haven't lost your touch around MontrÃªux here.   And with that said, just a few comments from you.  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I'm very pleased with the way I played today, and this is pretty close to home.   So it's nice to see a lot of friends and family.   And I'm enjoying myself so far.   And hope it continues like this.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   Conditions this morning were really, really good, a lot of good scores.   Were you concerned at all as you looked at the weather, whether it would hold up and stay nice?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, well, it always‑‑ it seems to be pretty calm in the mornings around here and then the wind kicks up, and it's just another factor combined with the elevation and the uphills and downhills.   Definitely gets your attention.   
And we were very happy to get the round in with no rain because if we had to come back tomorrow and play extra holes, this is one of the toughest walks we have.   So it's nice to get it in and definitely sleep well tonight.  
   
 Q.   You came into the week, I think, 124th in FedExCup standings, maybe a little bit too close for comfort.   I know you want to be inside that top 125.   How much of a motivating factor are the playoffs and what you're doing?  
NICK WATNEY:   Well, you know, you definitely don't want to miss tournaments and not qualify for tournaments.   
So it's definitely a factor.   But we can't really, if you tee off thinking about that, you probably won't play as well as you should.   So it's a motivating factor.   
I like to play as long as I can, but at the same time, you know, I gotta just take care of my job out there.   The better I do doing that, the better my scores will be and the less I'll have to worry about the FedExCup.  
   
 Q.   You strung together several, 8, 9, 10, 13 through 15, all birdies.   Not a lot of long putts.   You must have been really pleased with your iron play.   
NICK WATNEY:   I was.   I played really well today.   When I did miss a couple of greens, I missed a few greens early and chipped to within tap‑ins and hit some really nice wedges.   But that was the result of good driving.  
So I played really well.   I feel like this has been kind of building for a while, and the thing that's been missing is the putting, and I putted great today.   So I'm very happy and looking forward to the next three days.  
   
 Q.   Everybody says the greens get very bumpy after the morning round.   Did you find that, or were they pretty good?  
NICK WATNEY:   They were pretty good.   I think with the some of the greens being a little bit soft, they're going to get a little bumpy with all the traffic.   But hopefully hit it close enough that and roll it well enough that it won't affect it too much.   So the course was great, and no complaints from me.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
