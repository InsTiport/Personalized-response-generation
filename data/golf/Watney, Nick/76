Q.   Kind of right off the bat on No. 11, you got down.   And Lee obviously played well.   Just talk a little about the match?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, you know, it's definitely no surprise that he played well.   He's a top‑‑ I don't know what exactly, but the top three players in the world.   I think the real turning point for me was 7, 8 and 9.   I had a putt to win 7 and I didn't make it.   And then I lost 8 and 9 and 10.   To lose those two holes, I was 4‑down after 10. 
And he played really, really well.   Really steady after that.   I'm disappointed I didn't give him a better match.   But still a lot of highs for me this week. 

Q.   You mentioned yesterday, the last two years after beating Lee, you may have had a bit of a letdown.   Any of that today after beating Tiger?
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I didn't play that poorly.   I mean this is such a strange event because you can shoot even par and win and I think I was a couple under today, maybe.   But obviously I got trounced.   Hats off to him, he played great.   I think he's going to be tough to beat from what I saw.

Q.   There was one hole where he made you putt about a foot and a half putt.   Was there a lot of that going on, a lot of gamesmanship out there?   I saw you smile at him after you made it?
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I mean, you know, you've got to make them in stroke play, too.   I try not to take it personally.   We were definitely very civil out there.   He just beat me.
