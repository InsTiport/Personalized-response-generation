 Q. Nick, 4-under for your round today, 68, 10-under for the tournament. Your thoughts on the week? 
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I mean, it was a successful week overall. I'd really like to have Thursday back on the North. But you know, I played better every day, and I'm excited for the rest of the West Coast.

 Q. Coming in as the defending champ, did you feel any extra pressure? Were things a little different for you this week? And now that you're done with it, what was it like? 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I mean, it was a little different, but in a good way. It was just nice to be back here, and now that it's over, I'm a little down that I didn't repeat or whatever. But I'm excited about my play the last couple of days, and like I said, just want to keep improving and looking forward to the rest of the West Coast. 

 Q. So your schedule, you're booked here for the next few weeks?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I'm planning on playing the next four, so hopefully this will carry over to the next week.
