  Q. A fine 67, are you pleased with your performance at the Scottish Open?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yes, I'm encouraged. Just wanted to come over and get acclimated to the conditions and the time, and did I that, and also had a really good week. So excited for next week.   
  
  Q. Was it beneficial to you playing on an American-style course at Loch Lomond in your preparations for both acclimatising and just getting ready for The Open?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, you know, I didn't come here -- I would have come to the Scottish Open had it been at a links golf course, but yeah, the course was great. The weather is, from what I'm told, the best we could have hoped for. It was a great week.  
  
  Q. What are the plans now the next couple of days with regard to getting really ready for Turnberry and getting into peak conditions?   
 NICK WATNEY: Just going to go and see the golf course. I've heard only great things about it and just kind of see it and see what shots I need to prepare for at the golf course, and then just keep practicing, try to tune up, little things and the little things add up throughout the course of a week. So just try to tighten up the game a little bit and hopefully have a good result.
