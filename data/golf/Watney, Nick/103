  Q. Only one blemish out there.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I made a double and a bogey, so there's room for improvement. But overall I felt very much in control. I wish I could have kept going really.  
  
  Q. Could you just talk about how much confidence on this course is important and momentum? Do you agree with that? Is it a momentum kind of course?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I think golf in general is really momentum. I mean, I made the double, and it was big for me because last week I was pretty much the opposite of Lucas last week in Charlotte. But just to not panic and make a few more birdies after that. It was nice to play a good round even with a mistake.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible)?  
 NICK WATNEY: I'm not really sure, to be honest. Everything was a little bit off. I just never hit a run really. I'm not really sure what happened, to be honest.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible)?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, in a year. So I was definitely disappointed, but I figured there were two ways to react, you either sulk about it or come here.   
 Flew here on Saturday, and did a little bit of work on Sunday, which I would have liked to have been playing, obviously. But just figured I'd get on with it and use it as motivation.  
  
  Q. Or you could start growing a beard?  
 NICK WATNEY: Or you could grow a beard, yeah.  
  
  Q. When you start getting going like that, is it the putter that really keeps you going and you get confident on the greens in terms of the roll and the speed? You don't worry about anything but trying to make it?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I mean, I think whenever I've shot a low round like that, you always make a few 15- or 20-footers that you don't make every day. The putter is just a great way to keep momentum if you happen to hit a loose shot or gain it with the birdie putts.
