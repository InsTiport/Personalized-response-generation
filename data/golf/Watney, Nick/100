  Q. Nick, I've got to give you mad props, because only a dude from the desert is going to wear black when it's supposed to be 95 out there today. You're not even sweatin' a little bit?  
 NICK WATNEY: I figured today would be the coolest day, since I'm teeing off early, so I had to give the hat away sometime.   
  
  Q. Smart move. Tell me about today, up and down on No. 9, great putt on that one-half the chip came out a little soft.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played pretty solid, a few loose shots but that's to be expected I guess in the wind.   
 Overall I'm pleased and I got a chance on the weekend.   
  
  Q. How much different did the course play today as compared to yesterday?   
 NICK WATNEY: Well, it's just a little trickier with the wind. It's shifting out there so you can look silly if you catch the wrong gust. But I think they set up the course accordingly, so actually it was fair.   
  
  Q. The wind was gusty and seems to be getting stronger. How much of an adjustment did you have to make? Did the wind back you up a couple of times?   
 NICK WATNEY: It did, yeah. It was a 2 to 4-club wind, maybe even more with some of those gusts. It will be tricky out here for the boys this afternoon, that's for sure.   
  
  Q. I like that little smile you said that with, I'm done, have fun, boys!   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah. It will be good to relax and watch them this afternoon.   
  
  Q. Two-under par, that's a great way to go into the weekend, thanks, Nick.   
 NICK WATNEY: You bet.
