 Q.   Maybe a couple comments about the first two days.   
NICK WATNEY:   Well, overall pretty good.   I missed a few six‑ or eight‑footers for par today.   I made a lot of bogeys, but I made a lot of birdies, too, and to get in a bad position out there is really tough.   I'm looking forward to the weekend.   
   
 Q.   If you're around even par going into the weekend, you're going to be in contention, no question, because nobody is going to get too far ahead of anybody else probably, right?  
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, a good round goes a long way.   You move up really fast.   Yeah, definitely even par, I'll take it, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
