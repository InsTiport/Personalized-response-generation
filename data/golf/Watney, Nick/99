 Q. Nice comeback on those last four holes there. ?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes today. I made bogey with some wedgies, and 8-iron the last hole, so it was --

 Q. (No microphone.)
 NICK WATNEY: It was just left to right. 

 Q. Talk about 15. 
 NICK WATNEY: It was a debacle; there's just not much to say. I hit a bad second, it was just bad all the way around. 

 Q. But the wind is one small mistake and it costs you a hole like that? 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, definitely makes it tricky to get the ball close, the whole way around. It was a tough day. 

 Q. I think there was one birdie all day there?
 NICK WATNEY: Was there? I believe it. 

 Q. The wind, the scores, seems like the guys are still playing pretty good despite the conditions. 
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I don't know how many times at a major the leader group comes back toward the pack on a Saturday. 
 So these guys are good, they're going to play well but I think the course won today. 

 Q. Kind of has that feel, like when the leaders are coming back, like a major almost?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it's definitely playing difficult.

 Q. Any momentum from your play today that you can take --
 NICK WATNEY: None, no, none right now. 

 Q. None? 
 NICK WATNEY: No. I mean, I just bogeyed the last hole so I don't have much going right now. 

 Q. Good luck tomorrow. 
 NICK WATNEY: Thanks.
