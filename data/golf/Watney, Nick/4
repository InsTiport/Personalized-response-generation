NICK WATNEY: Do a lot of good things.  The pieces of my game are some days really good and just trying to get everything to come together.  But I fell like I'm close to playing really well and been pretty consistent thus far.  So, just looking for some good results.   
 Q.  Has that consistency been the hardest part for you to get to that point?  
NICK WATNEY: You know, I feel like my results haven't quite caught up to the way I'm playing.  I feel like I'm playing pretty well.  Maybe I need -- I got some breaks today, drove it in the trees on the 6th, I had a shot, holed a bunker shot.  Maybe I need to steal a few shots here and there and get some good things going.   
 Q.  Look ahead to tomorrow, going off early, what are you going to take from today to go towards the 2nd Round?  
NICK WATNEY: You know, I was able to keep the ball in play most of the day today which, if there's a way to make this place play a little bit easier, that would be the way to do it.  Hopefully try to drive it in the fairway off the 1st and go from there.
