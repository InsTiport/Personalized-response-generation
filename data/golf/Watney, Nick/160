  Q. Nick, a solid round today. You dodged a lot of weather, a lot of implements. Tell me about it.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I really feel like today was all about survival. The wind was switching around, and it was raining on and off. All in all, 1-under I'm very pleased with.  
  
  Q. Were you paying any attention to the John Rollins show going on behind you?  
 NICK WATNEY: Not really. I saw he was playing well, but I can't really control any of that. The golf course was playing tough enough that you definitely need to focus on what you're doing out there.  
  
  Q. Tough holes on 11 and 12, but then that bounce-back birdie on 13. That was a nice shot you hit on the green from the right side.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I got a good break over there. I was on the cart path and was able to drop into a decent lie and was able to hit it on the green. I'll take the good breaks when they come.  
  
  Q. Are you going to work on anything this evening?  
 NICK WATNEY: Maybe hit a few putts, just try to get the speed, or try to keep the speed, and just get some rest.   
  
  Q. What do you have to do tomorrow to get yourself in position?  
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I think I just need to stay patient and keep doing what I'm doing. They've distanced themselves out there a little bit, so it's my job to go get them, and obviously I'm going to need to play a good round. I can't make it up in the first hole, so I've just got to stay patient and do my best.   
  
  Q. What's been the worst factor with the weather out there?   
 NICK WATNEY: The worst factor? I guess with the rain it makes the greens soft and they get pretty bumpy. But overall it's better than what we thought it was going to be. I'll take a day like this for sure.
