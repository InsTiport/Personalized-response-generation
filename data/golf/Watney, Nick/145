  Q. Talk a little bit about your round today. Great birdie on the last hole.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played very well. It was really nice. I was kind of leading up to this all week. Yesterday I played well. But I made one big mistake. Thursday I played well. Friday wasn't so good. It's nice when your best day is on Sunday.   
 It's always nice to birdie the last hole. I guess from what I saw, it got me out of a tie with a few guys. Yeah, I was definitely excited.   
  
  Q. I know you're still hoping for Presidents Cup. Days like this have to impress.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I'm excited I still have a chance. Unfortunately, I didn't make it through points. Got a couple weeks here to try to show 'em something. You know, I'm happy with this week and looking forward to next week.   
  
  Q. Do you feel maybe freer now? I know you wanted to make it, but...   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, you know, I was probably forcing things a little bit there at the end. But it's a learning experience, you know. Definitely very, very important to me. So I was probably pressing a little bit.   
 Like I said, I'm excited to have a chance. Hopefully I can make some more noise next week.
