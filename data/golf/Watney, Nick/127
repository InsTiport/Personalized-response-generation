 Q. Talk about the conditions of the course. 
 NICK WATNEY: The golf course is perfect out there, and I played very, very steady. Was never really in much trouble, a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, a lot of opportunities, so definitely very pleased and looking forward to the rest of the week. 

 Q. How did the course set up for you? We've had a lot of players say it's in perfect shape but it can be brutal in spots. 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, well, there are some interesting pin placements out there, right next to the edges and stuff like that. You've got to be smart out there. Short-sided is very difficult, greens are fast, and you can get to a spot where 15 or 20 feet is a good chip shot. Yeah, you have to definitely think your way around. They didn't ease into it with pin placements today. They were pretty nasty. 

 Q. Do you think it'll get more difficult as it dries out?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I assume it will. Tough to get the ball close sometimes, but this is the first time we've been here, so I guess it depends on the flags, too. Like I said, there were some pretty dicey ones today, so I guess it depends on how difficult they want to make it.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I played very well. Like I said, I was never really in too bad of trouble. The few greens I missed, I chipped or putted them up close. It was a really steady round. I wish they were all like this. Yeah, like I said, looking forward to the rest of the week.
