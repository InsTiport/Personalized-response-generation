Q.   Talk about your match today and the highlights of it.
NICK WATNEY:   Well, I played very well.   Darren didn't have his best day.   I just had to play the best I could and I'm very happy to move on.

Q.   What are you expecting tomorrow?   Are you feeling good about your game? 
NICK WATNEY:   I feel good.   I think I started off the year with a pretty bad attitude, just very wound up and a very short fuse. 
So I feel good if I can go out and have a good time and not be so caught up on every single shot.   I think I would be able to hopefully play well again.   And whoever that may be, it should be a good match.

Q.   Did you start off today with a positive attitude?
NICK WATNEY:   I did.   That's been my goal for this week.   I've played four events now and just been really wound up so tight, you know?   And this game is a very imperfect game.   So I'm just trying to go out and enjoy myself with my caddie and see what happens.

Q.   Have you gotten some advice from somebody recently to kind of help you along?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I talked to my wife and Butch Harmon and my caddie, Chad, and Dr. Morris Pickens, my sports psychologist, I guess you would call him.   And they all pretty much have the same message, like you're out there, and every shot is life and death.   It's very hard to play that way, because you're going to hit bad shots in this game, unfortunately.   So that's been the goal this week, and so far so good. 

Q.   What brought this on, do you think?   You've been playing off the last few years?   Are you putting too much pressure on yourself?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I think it's expectations.   I really want to do well.   And I love to play.   But I think I was just losing sight of it's an imperfect game, and just take the good with the bad and roll with it.
