 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: I feel for him. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: I will say this, I will say that Dustin was adamant, real adamant that about he did ground his club. A guy trying to win his first major, get into a playoff, it's really unfortunate. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it was, yeah, not the start that I had hoped for. At this point I'm very disappointed. That having been said, I was leading by three shots coming into Sunday of a major, so I think that for me to play with a chance to win like that and I definitely got way ahead of myself and I just didn't finish it off. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: No, I made a birdie on No. 6 which kind of, I was tied for the lead at that point. 
 No. 7, a guy was moving in the back swing, I hit it to the right, it was pretty much over after that.

 Q. What did you hit on 7?
 NICK WATNEY: I hit a 6-iron.

 Q. How did you feel before teeing off on No. 1? Were you okay? Were you nervous?
 NICK WATNEY: I was definitely nervous but I was very excited. I mean I was looking forward to the day. I knew it was going to be a tough day, I knew that it would be a challenge, so I was really looking forward to getting out there and it didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: I don't know. I think that's a really tough call. They told us they would be treated as bunkers, so I guess that's probably less -- they should probably hold a me meeting, but guys probably wouldn't go to that, so, they told us, it was right on the sheet that -- I said if a guy is finishing 40th, it's not that big of a deal. But since it was a playoff, you know. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I take some consolation from that. I was pretty out of it at that point. I was going sideways there for a while and then on 17, you know, it was strange like that. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 NICK WATNEY: My caddie did a great job. He was talking to me the whole day. And it's a major and you definitely want to do your best and so that's how it is.
