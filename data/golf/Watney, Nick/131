  Q. Couple general comments about your round today.  
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I'm very pleased. I think if you would have told me starting the day a 67 I would have gladly taken it. So a little disappointed with the blunder on 17, but at the same time I'm pleased with the score.  
  
  Q. How about your birdies on 15 and 16?  
 NICK WATNEY: 15 I actually had to lay up and hit a really nice shot in there about four feet.  
 16, the pin was in a pretty accessible position and I hit a nice 9-iron to about four feet as well.  
  
  Q. Is this the toughest you've seen it conditions wise?  
 NICK WATNEY: It was right up there, although the greens were, if the greens were firmer it would have been, we would have seen the full golf course.  
 With the greens being a touch soft, and even with the wind being up it was very difficult, as tough as it really can get, I think.  
  
  Q. Later in the day when the wind came up how tough was it?  
 NICK WATNEY: It was pretty tricky out there, I thought. I think that we played 14 downwind and then we turned around and played 15 downwind. So it was shifting all over the place.  
  
  Q. Everything got harder as the day went on?  
 NICK WATNEY: I'm not sure, to be honest, I didn't come out until about an hour before my time. But I heard that the morning was a little bit calmer.  
  
  Q. Are you a scoreboard watcher at all? Did you know where you stood?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it's too early. They're not going to remember, usually you don't remember, although with Tom Watson being the leader, I'll probably remember that, but they don't remember the first round leader too often.
