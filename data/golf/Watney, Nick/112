 Q. You played in the worst of the wind this week here at Doral. The Blue Monster really showing its teeth, and eased up a little in the afternoon, but is the key to this golf course still putting the ball in the fairway?
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it just makes it so much easier to control coming into the greens. Today there were a few pins, the 3rd, for example, very difficult out of the rough. Playable from the fairway. 
 So driving the ball is a huge key. Especially getting it close. You're able to get it on to the green from the rough. But getting close, huge key is being in the fairway.

 Q. What's the best part of your game right now this week?
 NICK WATNEY: I think putting. I'm making all of the putts I should and a few that, you know, a few bonuses, so I think that's the key thus far. 

 Q. You and Adam Scott and Vijay Singh seem to be pulling off each other's momentum in round one. Did that continue in round two? 
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, a bit. We struggled to get going there for a while, but came back on the back nine pretty well. So yeah, I enjoyed playing with them.

 Q. 7-under par going into the weekend, any idea what it's going to take in these conditions?
 NICK WATNEY: I think it just depends on the wind. Obviously the leaderboard is stacked. So it's going to take some good play. I think the wind will dictate how low the scores will go.
