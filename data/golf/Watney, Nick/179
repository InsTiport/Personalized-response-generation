Q.
Just talk about playing in front of such a big crowd.  Obviously a little bit bigger than yesterday, and talk about the little collapse she had there and the crowd you had following it.
NICK WATNEY:  Well, I mean, the crowds were great all week.  It was pretty impressive to get that kind of a draw.

The collapse, I mean, I don't know what to say.  It's unfortunate.  She played very well.  I'm sure she'll learn from it and do better next time.
Q.  Is there something you can take from playing in front of a crowd that big?  Are there a lot of learning experiences for you this weekend?
NICK WATNEY:  A little bit.  It's important to stay focused and stuff like that.  I've played in front of people before, so it wasn't entirely new.  Yeah, I mean, I definitely learned a lot.
Q.  You talked about it a little bit yesterday, too, but could you maybe rate her overall performance today and how you think she played?
NICK WATNEY:  Well, I've never played with her obviously and watched her a little bit on TV.  I mean, I think she played very well.  It was unfortunate what happened, but I'm sure she'll come back better the next time.
