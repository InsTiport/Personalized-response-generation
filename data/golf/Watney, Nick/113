  Q. Obviously not the way you wanted it to end, but you pushed it until the end and then even beyond. Just a couple of comments on the match.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I mean, he played great, putted great. And I gave it everything I had, but today he was one better.  
  
  Q. You're feeling good, though, about your game still? We talked to you yesterday?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I played well. I think I made 8 birdies today, so I guess what are you going to do?
