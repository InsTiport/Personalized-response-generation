  Q. You like a lot of players started well and had some tough stretches?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, overall, it was a decent day. Luke was in my group, and he played well, so it can be done. But yeah, very difficult.   
  
  Q. Take us through 18?  
 NICK WATNEY: I hit 3-wood just in the water, dropped, hit a very poor 5-iron that I pushed and never really had a chance. From there, I was dropping five, and two putts later.   
  
  Q. Taking iron off the tee -- did you think about that?   
 NICK WATNEY: I mean, hitting an iron off the tee will leave you close to a wood in.   
 I think it's just a tough hole. You've got to hit a good shot. The misses -- you can lay up from there.   
  
  Q. Hard finish, given the way you started?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it was tough. 14, I was still 2-under par, so I was feeling good, so make a mistake like, that or a couple of mistakes, was tough, but only the first round, so we've got a long way to go.
