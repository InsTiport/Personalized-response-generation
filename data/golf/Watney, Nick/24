Q.   Nick, four birdies, two bogeys.   Just get your comments on the day as a whole. 
NICK WATNEY:   A little bit disappointed, to be honest.   Missed my share of putts.   But I've got a chance tomorrow.   So I would have taken that at the beginning of the week.

Q.   Comment a little bit about the conditions out there today.   Was the course there to be had?
NICK WATNEY:   It was.   It was, but at the same time it was tricky and the greens were getting a little baked out. 
So probably the most difficult that I've seen it this week so far.   But at the same time Geoff played really well and there were some out there.

Q.   I heard 27 consecutive fairways you hit in regulation.   Really hitting the ball well.   So if you can just get the putts to fall?
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I didn't realize that.   Yeah, I'm hitting the ball great.   If I can putt, I got a real chance.
