  Q. Nick, congratulations, won a victory over Lee Westwood, but it wasn't easy, was it?  
 NICK WATNEY: No, it wasn't. I played really well to start. But I knew he's not No. 1 for nothing. So I knew he was going to make a run.   
 Got a little messy there at the end.   
  
  Q. What were you thinking there at 17 when he hit a birdie putt and next thing you know he walked off the green halving the hole?  
 NICK WATNEY: That was definitely unexpected. But I guess that's this game. It's crazy that way.   
  
  Q. You shot some great rounds this year. How does that translate to match play?  
 NICK WATNEY: Well, I think just, you know, you figure if you shoot 4, 5, 6-under, it's pretty tough to beat. I think I was 5-under today, so definitely playing well.   
  
  Q. Well done, congratulations.
