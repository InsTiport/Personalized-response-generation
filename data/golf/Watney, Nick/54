Q.   Good couple of days, actually.   Seems like you've been scoring pretty well. 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, I was a bit rusty here on Thursday, but I seem to be finding some form here as we get a little more acclimated to Asia.

Q.   How's that going so far?   How are you liking the area? 
NICK WATNEY:   It's nice.   I mean, the first few days we didn't make it out very far just because of the jet lag and whatnot, but walking around a little bit now, and it's a cool city.

Q.   Low scores today, with the conditions with the rains and just the ability to go at some of the pins, expect you guys to shoot pretty well tomorrow? 
NICK WATNEY:   Yeah, definitely.   We'll see how far back we are, but we're in position where we really need to shoot low scores. So that's the goal, and we'll see what happens.
