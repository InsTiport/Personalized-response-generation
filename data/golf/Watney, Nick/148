  Q. Good position you're in.   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, played well so far. Today I was not quite as sharp ball-striking, but maybe did a little bit better scoring-wise. So kind of two different rounds and only one shot separating.  
  
  Q. Your thoughts on your position in the tournament, you're fairly well up there?  
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, I'm excited, happy to be here and playing well, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.  
  
  Q. This is your first trip here to Loch Lomond?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, first trip here.   
  
  Q. What's your thoughts on the course?  
 NICK WATNEY: It's beautiful. From what I hear we have lucked out with the weather so far but I really like it. Really enjoy it.  
  
  Q. Good season for you back home in the States, you've done well with a couple of wins, what do you put that down to? What's been particularly good for you this year.  
 NICK WATNEY: I think my putting has improved a lot from last year. That's been my main focus in the off-season and it's continued so far. Just going to try to continue to just keep working on that and hopefully they keep dropping on the weekend.  
  
  Q. Nice to see a few of your fellow countrymen here?   
 NICK WATNEY: Yeah, it's great to be over here. We have it so good in the States, but there's also a great tour over here. I really like it.
