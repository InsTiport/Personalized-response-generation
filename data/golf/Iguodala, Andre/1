ANDRE IGUODALA: I hung in there.  Most importantly, had fun.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ANDRE IGUODALA: First time I played in front of the crowd and they showed on my initial tee shot.  Recovered from that.   
 Q.  What was that like to have so many Warrior fans here supporting and cheering you on?  
ANDRE IGUODALA: That just shows how great our fan base just all around the Bay Area.  It was good to see them out there supporting.   
 Q.  How did the golf course played today?  Was it tricky out of the rough?  
ANDRE IGUODALA: I'm in the rough a lot so I'm used to it.  No problems there.   
 Q.  (Question regarding Stephen Curry.)  
ANDRE IGUODALA: I'm tired of giving him compliments while we're playing golf.  I guess he just has it.  I don't know what it is, but I'm trying to figure out a way to give it to my son.   
Hopefully heal give my son some lessons.   
 Q.  When did you start picking of golf?  
ANDRE IGUODALA: Always enjoy watching Tiger and those guys, but really got the bug about two years ago.  Playing about a year and a half serious.  Got my handicap, cut it in half.  Still got some work to do.
