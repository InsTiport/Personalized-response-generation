  Q. Back in 2006 you made the cut for this tournament. Is that a big expectation for you coming in?   
 JON FIEDLER: At Oak Tree? Yeah, it was that year. It was may first cut in a Major. So it kind of helped me out for the rest of the year.   
 I think I made the cut in the U.S. Open there. And in 2007 I wound up qualifying for the Champions Tour.   
  
  Q. 2-over today, that was one of the better scores among the club pros, one of better scores of the afternoon?  
 JON FIEDLER: Well we didn't play very good today then, did we?   
 (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. The afternoon golfers were talking about the hard greens. Did that throw you off?  
 JON FIEDLER: The first couple holes, maybe, yeah.   
  
  Q. You had birdies at 8 and 11? Did you feel like you were in a groove there?  
 JON FIEDLER: Yeah, I made one on 8 and then I 2-putted from, I didn't hit it very well but I 2-putted from 30, 40 feet and I made birdie there. Yeah. It was fine.
