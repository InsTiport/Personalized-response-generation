  Q. The course is wet today, how did you play?  
 JON FIEDLER: I hit my driver pretty well the first 12 holes and then the hardest shots were actually the 120 to 160 yard shots off the wet fairway.   
  
  Q. How did the delay affect your game?  
 JON FIEDLER: Nothing. It just made me a little bit tired the last couple of holes.  
  
  Q. How did the course hold up?  
 JON FIEDLER: Well, I know on the first couple holes after the rain after the delay I thought the fairways were actually dryer, so it was fine.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your chances the rest of the tournament?  
 JON FIEDLER: Good. I feel good. I'll do my best tomorrow and see what happens.
