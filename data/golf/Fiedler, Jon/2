  Q. Comments on your two rounds this week.   
 JON FIEDLER: Actually hit it pretty good, but did not play the par-5s very well, because of the wind. Had some bad breaks and you can't have bad breaks out here.   
  
  Q. What type impact did the wind have on you today, on your round today?  
 JON FIEDLER: The front side here at Colorado Golf Club is a lot harder than the back side. And we had the wind out there on 3, 4, and 5, and it was brutal out there into your face.   
 Then the last couple holes we couldn't hold the greens. No matter what we did coming in. They were just dried out.   
  
  Q. Overall just your experience at the Senior PGA Championship.   
 JON FIEDLER: I played in about, this is my fourth one since I was 50 and this venue, I don't know, it's always nice to be able to qualify and play.   
  
  Q. Highlight of the weekend?  
 JON FIEDLER: I had my wife here to watch. Even though the scores weren't that good.
