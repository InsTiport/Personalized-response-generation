 Q. This is your fourth time playing in the Senior PGA Championship, how was it? How was the week?
 JON FIEDLER: It was fun to play in an event like this. Couldn't particularly deal with the golf course, but that's the way it goes. But it was fun. The people are really nice around here.

 Q. You came all the way up from California, how is it like represents your hope town and your club?
 JON FIEDLER: I think I got a little air time on Thursday or Friday, so it was nice to be able to do that for my home club and hopefully that got back there. That would be kind of nice and appreciated.

 Q. Was there like a certain shot or maybe like a certain experience throughout the week that kind of stuck out?
 JON FIEDLER: Yeah, birdieing the ninth hole, my last hole on Friday to make the cut. Actually I made it with one. But. 

 Q. What do you think you'll take away from this experience? Is there anything that?
 JON FIEDLER: A sprained ankle.

 Q. How did that happen?
 JON FIEDLER: I don't know. It's just all wrapped up and I'll get ready for next week.

 Q. Do you have any more tournaments lined up?
 JON FIEDLER: I'm actually going to Iowa tonight and then doing that for Tuesday qualifying for the Iowa tournament and then back home. 

 Q. Do you think that playing this week will kind of help you prepare for that?
 JON FIEDLER: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. We'll see what happens.
