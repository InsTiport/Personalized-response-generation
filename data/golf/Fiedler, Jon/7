  Q.  It's a difficult golf course.  That score is respectable, right?   
 JON FIEDLER:  I doubled 10 and tripled 17.  That's five shots right there.  It didn't feel too good.   
  
  Q.  How did it compare to yesterday?  Was the wind stronger or --   
 JON FIEDLER:  Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice.  I think we got the brunt end of the deal.  But that's the way it goes.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it will be better if you played later on today?   
 JON FIEDLER:  The wind could be stronger, but I don't know.  Who knows.   
  
  Q.  What do you think the cut is going to be?   
 JON FIEDLER:  I think the cut's going to be at 8, possibly 9.  So I missed it by one.  Maybe two.
