 Q. What did you think of Jesper's pants?
 
 BYRON NELSON: I'd need more protection for my eyes than that.  
 
Q. Was it one of the most exciting Nelsons you've seen?
 
 BYRON NELSON: It is the most exciting that I've seen. I've seen every one of them. It
is definitely the most exciting. The play was so good. We had a little bad wind one day
and a little bit the other day, but then the weather cooperated so great Saturday and
Sunday. And the condition of the golf course, everybody said was just perfect. And so the
net result was that the improvements we made on the golf course, the scores and plus the
little wind were lower than usual -- I mean, higher than usual, the winning score. But the
field as a whole were very close together all the time. It didn't seem like anybody wanted
to get out in front until the -- at one time this afternoon, there was seven people that
could have won the tournament with just making another birdie or two. 
 
Q. Do you think that your being here inspired a lot of these guys to, if nothing else,
come out and play in your tournament?
 
 BYRON NELSON: I think that has a very, very small part to it, because I see these
players -- I go to about eight or nine tournaments a year where they see me. And on
occasion where I see one of the players that's played a good round or played in a good
tournament, I'll drop them a note and congratulate them on it. But the things that is
drawing the players is the fact that the golf course is getting better, the rest of the
facilities are perfect, and you know, an extra million dollars in the last two years, you
know, that gets their attention. They say that money speaks, and I think it did here this
year. But we've been getting a good field now for quite some time, even though we did have
a great one this year.
