BOB ROYAK: Had a two-hour break in between.   
 Q.  You think that was a little bit of an advantage?  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, absolutely. With these temperatures the less holes you have to play, I think that's good.   
 Q.  You obviously knew you were going to be in for a tough one.  
BOB ROYAK: Great player.   
 Q.  Defending champion.  
BOB ROYAK: Great player. He wasn't on his A Game. He gave me a couple putts here and there where he could have made.   
But I didn't gift him anything either. I was pretty steady.   
 Q.  I guess you made a nice putt on 16 from what I hear, right, for par?  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah. I made a good putt.   
 Q.  How far was it? About eight feet?  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, about eight feet. Yeah. But biggest one was on 18. I got it up and down on to the bunker. That could have been maybe a four out of ten getting that up and down.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
BOB ROYAK: And then he drove it on 1. Nobody hit that green in two this week maybe except for him and he knocked it on there in two, and I knew I had to make 4. I hit it in there like four and a half feet.   
 Q.  How far did you have?  
BOB ROYAK: I ad 90 yards. I had as good as I could hit a 60-yard -- my sand wedge.   
 Q.  It what's the sand wedge degree, 58?  
BOB ROYAK: 60. So it was more than I could hit it.   
 Q.  Close shot.  
BOB ROYAK: I knew I had to hit it full. I was in the rough actually. Game me a little bit of a jump.   
 Q.  What happened on the third playoff hole? He made a bogey obviously.  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, third playoff we both -- he drove it too far, to be honest. I hit it to maybe 70, 60 yards. I had a perfect yardage, 82. I hit it about eight feet and I thought I made the putt.   
But he hit it down on the downslope and chunked it down into the bunker and hit a really hard bunker shot.he hit it out to about six, seven feet and just missed the putt.   
 Q.  Into the finals for the first time. There are a lot of exemptions that come with that. Senior Open.  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, Senior Open.   
 Q.  Mid-Am, next month's Mid-Am and the U.S. Amateur?  
BOB ROYAK: I missed the Mid-Am by a shot two weeks ago. I told my wife, I said, If I play good I can get in the Mid-Am.   
 Q.  Also in next year's U.S. Am as well.  
BOB ROYAK: That's great. I don't even know where it is.   
 Q.  Bandon Dunes.

 Q.  Did you play in the fourball this year?

 Q.  If you win you get the cool pairing with Steve Stricker.
