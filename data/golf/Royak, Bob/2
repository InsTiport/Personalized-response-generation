 Q.  You jumped on him really quick today winning the first five holes.  
BOB ROYAK: Yep. Got off to a great start. He had a couple bad breaks starting out, but I think I birdied the first couple holes.   
 Q.  And what were you doing well that you got off to --  
BOB ROYAK: Drove it good. Got to drive it in the fairway out here. If you hit in the rough it's almost 50/50 you can even get it close to the green.   
So I drove it good. I think one poor shot on 7, the par-3. I hit a little heavy 5-iron just short of the green and didn't get up and down. That's really the only bad shot I hit.   
 Q.  Coming into the week did you have high expectations? Was your game there?  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, think I can -- I've been playing decent on the year long. I just needed to put everything together. I had a bad day on Saturday for whatever reason. Didn't drive it great and didn't have a good day, but I've hit it good every other day.   
 Q.  Just a couple notes on how you birdied the 1st hole, the par-5.  
BOB ROYAK: Yeah, I just hit driver, 3-wood, and a wedge to about six feet.   
 Q.  And then on 3?  
BOB ROYAK: Hit a drive and a sand wedge to maybe seven feet and made the putt.   
 Q.  And when you went 6-up on the Par 5, 11?  
BOB ROYAK: 11 I hit it -- gosh, I hit driver, 3-wood; I hit gap wedge. What did we have, 123 on 11? I hit it in there about six feet.
