 Q.   So how did it go out there today?   
GARY PORTEOUS:   I had a slow start.   The back nine was better than the front.   It was a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   When did you finally regain your bearings?   You bogeyed maybe your first three holes.   When did you finally settle down?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   I think after the birdie on No. 4.   I got into a rhythm on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   You had that birdie on 15, did that get you going?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   Yeah, definitely it was encouraging.   
You have to put the ball in the right spots and hit it good off the tee.   I had a few errant drives today which kind of cost me.  
   
 Q.   How tough were the greens?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   On the back nine the greens were starting to firm up and just that sheen on them.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything you'll work on post round before tomorrow?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   I'll just hit a few putts.   Just relax, really, get ready for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What kind of went wrong those first three holes?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   I mean the tee shot that pulled into the trees.   The same with the second.   
   
 Q.   Did you learn anything from Jose Maria?  
GARY PORTEOUS:   Yeah, he's a nice guy.
