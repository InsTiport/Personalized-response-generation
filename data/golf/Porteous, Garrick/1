Q.   How did you find it out there?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   A bit tough.   Didn't really hit the ball all that well today.   But had a lot of swings.   I enjoyed my experience.

Q.   Did it live up to the Masters experience?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   It was great, yeah.   Down Amen Corner, you can't really beat that.   Birdie on 12.   Birdie on the last. 

Q.   Birdied the last, what did you hit in there?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   9‑iron.

Q.   How close were you?   Real close. 
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   Yeah.   It was great fun.   It's the Masters, I guess.

Q.   What are you going to do for the rest of the weekend?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   Oh, take a little time off.   Going out to Malaysia on Monday‑‑ Sunday night.

Q.   Turning pro after this?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   Yeah. 

Q.   Going to stick around for the weekend?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   I'll be here.

Q.   Watch some golf?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   Yeah.   It will be good.

Q.   Was there a favorite hole that you had during the tournament that you've been watching or a hole that surprised you that you really liked?
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   I really liked‑‑ I really enjoy 18, I guess, the last hole.   And 12, as well.   I think 12 is fantastic golf.   I wish it wasn't as narrow as it was. 

Q.   It's narrow. 
GARRICK PORTEOUS:   Yeah.
