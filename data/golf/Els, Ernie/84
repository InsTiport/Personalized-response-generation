Q.   Not a lot of birdies today, but you made one when it counts.   Talk us through that second shot to the last.   That was special. 
ERNIE ELS:   Thank you.   I was aggressive off the tee.   I felt like carrying the right bunker.   Didn't quite get the kick down like I did yesterday, but the yardage was absolutely perfect.   It was a perfect 52 degrees and for once I hit it spot on and dribbled that little two footer in there.

Q.   You'd be the first to admit that you haven't played particularly well these three days.   What's the mindset when you're not playing well, but you need to get a result somehow?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I think I make it tough for the other guy.   The other guy feels like he should put me away, but I'm just hanging on. 
Yesterday against Justin I made some pretty cool par saving putts and he made some mistakes.   Every match has been like that, you know.   I've been playing a little C golf and hanging in there.   At the end I'm hitting good shots when it counts.

Q.   Jordan Spieth tomorrow.   He's been a tremendous opponent.   Nine birdies today.   You're going to have up your game, aren't you?
ERNIE ELS:   Maybe I can drag him down, I don't know.   There's got to be a good round in me.   I'm not hitting it that badly.   I have got the equipment, so to trust it under the gun is the big thing for me.   You know, hopefully he's off and I I'm on tomorrow.
