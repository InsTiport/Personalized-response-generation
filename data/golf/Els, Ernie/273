 Q. How did it play out there?
 ERNIE ELS: It was nice. I hit a lot of greens and really found my rhythm after the first couple of holes. I came up with a good score.

 Q. In this golf course the wind is important, how tough was it out there today?
 ERNIE ELS: It was really tough. I was looking at the blimp, normally the blimp has its nose into the wind and on the ground it was going the exact opposite way. 
 It was difficult getting the second shots to the flag.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah. I'm grinding away, trying to get my game where I think it should be.

 Q. Did you make any drastic changes from last week?
 ERNIE ELS: I'm just trying to get my putting stroke. I made some good putts today, but I missed a lot so I'm still trying to find it.

 Q. You love this golf course, it's one of your top courses as far as how your eye fits it?
 ERNIE ELS: Yes, it's a great course. With the wind swirling all over the place the second shot is real difficult to find the right yardage. 
 But it's a wonderful place, very relaxing.
