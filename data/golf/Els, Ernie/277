   ERNIE ELS: I hit some lovely shots early on but let him back into the match with some missed putts. Then played lovely on the back nine and made three birdies in a row on 13, 14 and 15 and that sealed the deal for me so it was very nice to get through

 Q. Great record in the world match play at Wentworth but your record here is not hat good - any reason for that?
 ERNIE ELS: First of all at Wentworth I sleep at home. And it is 36 holes match play rather then 18 holes here so more of a sprint here as we know. If you get off to a bad start it is hard to get back into it. Also the golf course, Wentworth is one of my favourite courses and I know it very well.

 Q. Yesterday you said you were looking at old tapes of putting strokes - was that helpful today?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah. I got Callaway to make me a nice putter, very similar to the one I used to use in the 90s which sounds a long time ago now. I looked at on old tape of my old technique and I am trying to get that feel back. Not quite there yet but that was the way I putted my best with a certain technique and I am trying to get back to that.

 Q. Important to get that first round under your belt?
 ERNIE ELS: Soren is a quality player, like everyone here and you can't take anything for granted. I had a nice start, let him back a bit but then had those birdies on the back nine. My game feels good so glad to get through.

 Q. Talk of a niggling wrist problem - anything to worry about?
 ERNIE ELS: I have changed my swing a little and have been practising quite a bit. I think I jammed it and it has gone into my wrist. But I have Vern the physio working on it and it feels a lot better.
