 Q.   63, I imagine you're delighted with that?   
    ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it's a very nice scoring.   I obviously had a good start and all of that.   But I wish I can always play like that.   
   
 Q.   You've had a great career, but 8â€‘under through 12, are you thinking, really, really low?  
    ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, exactly.   That number was crossing my mind.   You know, I just didn't quite make the putts coming in.   15 was quite a big hole.   A bit of a wait on the tee and I didn't hit a good tee shot but that was definitely a hole to maybe eagle even.   So the number definitely crossed our minds, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You shot 63, Louis shot 63; can people keep shooting these low numbers on the weekend?   
    ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it's amazing.   He's playing great obviously and other guys are playing well.   But there's trouble out there, if you get a little wayward, you can pay the penalty.   We've seen that.   
    The big holdup today was on 15, some guys were missing shots.   So if you're not missing shots, it's a different story, but playing great.   
   
 Q.   All in all, happy with your game?  
    ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I mean, I'm just glad to be here; after going down on the tennis court two weeks ago to stand here and shoot 63 is quite a bonus.  
   
 Q.   So the injury is not hurting you too much?  
    ERNIE ELS:   No, we're still here.   
   
 Q.   Just elaborate on, that how is it?  
    ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I feel it, but Vern, my trainer, is here and he's working on me.   He's got me around.   I feel it, but it's all right.     You know, what do they say, be aware of the injured golfer (smiling).
