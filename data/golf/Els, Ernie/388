Q.  You got yourself into the playoff; you felt all week you could do it if you had a good last round.  You said 65; that would have won it.
ERNIE ELS:  Exactly.  I just missed    the putt on 13, I missed a 5 footer there for birdie and missed a few other ones. That was the biggest one.

But it was a big putt I made to get in the playoff, that was good.
Q.  How far?
ERNIE ELS:  50 feet, then six coming back.
Q.  Did you just turn it over too much on the last in the play-off?
ERNIE ELS:  The drive. Yeah, I didn't do what I was supposed to do.  That was my favourite  tee shot of the whole tournament, 5 under on that hole for the week, an eagle and three birdies. But there you go.

I cannot complain.  After all the hassle I had with the leg, to come back, this was strongest field in the world this year, biggest week and to almost win it, is fine.
Q.  Healing process is complete now, is it?
ERNIE ELS:  Getting there.  Getting there.  It's really good.
Q.  Did you have memories of the shot you played a few years ago, the 4 iron on to the green?
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, exactly, that was the shot I was trying to hit again.

I had 4 iron again and I was trying to    I was 198 front, 210 yards. I had to hit it perfect but I had half a decent lie, and it almost worked. A yard or two out. So, one of those things.
