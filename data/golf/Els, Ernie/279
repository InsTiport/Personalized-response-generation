  Q. Just a couple comments, you've obviously had tremendous success here. How does it feel to be back?  
 ERNIE ELS: It's obviously great to be back. You know, the great thing here is the kids have a great time, and we stay on the golf course, here so it feels really relaxed.   
  
  Q. What is it about this course that obviously suits your game so well?   
 ERNIE ELS: You know, before I came here, I used to watch it on television a little bit, so I had a little bit of an idea to play it. The greens, I really like the greens here, they are really fast. They are quicker than they are at Kapalua.   
 It's a golf course where you've got to be patient. You can't go out there and hit the ball as hard as you can and go for everything, and you've got to play proper golf.  
  
  Q. You're coming off a good week, so you probably feel pretty good coming into this week.   
 ERNIE ELS: Yes, I am. I had a really tough putting round on that Saturday. I had some help from my boys and I played a couple of holes yesterday and feel good about it. Yeah, I just want to keep rolling.
