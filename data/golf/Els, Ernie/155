 Q.   I was talking to Phil today and he said, "Man, could have got something out there today.   The course was playing as easy as it could play."   This is a tough golf course.   
ERNIE ELS:   Absolutely, this is as easy as you're going to see it, and you know I had a difficult start this morning.   I hit it off of 10 in the water, and at 11 just to make bogey there was great.   It was a bit of a battle, but I had a lot of chances out there; it could have been better.   It is what it is.   
   
 Q.   Being up there it's hard to read these greens.   You think they give you opportunities but you guys missed a lot of putts by 4, 5, 6 inches, all of you.   
ERNIE ELS:   They have these flags right on the edges, you know, and you've got to be spot on.   They've got it on the fault lines, and if you're off you're not going to make it.   The greens are perfect, the course is perfect, can't complain about anything.   
I don't think we played good enough.   
   
 Q.   You looked like you hit a lot of good shots.   It's just tough to score out there because you know you have the afternoon tomorrow, and if the forecast is right you're going to be in for a little bit of a battle.   
ERNIE ELS:   Exactly.   Hopefully it picks up a little bit this afternoon so we aren't so far behind the eightâ€‘ball.   We had opportunities, we didn't capitalize, you know?   Nobody is out of the tournament; you've just got to play better the next three days.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Ernie Els.
