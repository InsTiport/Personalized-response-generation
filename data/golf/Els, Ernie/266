  Q. Played a good round.   
 ERNIE ELS: My putting has gone cold again, unfortunately. But the positive is I'm really swinging well, hitting the ball really well. And yesterday, unfortunately, I made, 6 or 8, which is a par 3 and I 3-putted the next hole. Other than that, I played pretty good golf.   
 With the scoring today, were the conditions getting tricky out there?  
 ERNIE ELS: Getting really tricky. The last half an hour they started setting up, the wind. So it's going to be tricky for the guys. Some of the greens are soft and some are firm. It's a bit inconsistent. It's going to be tricky for the guys.
