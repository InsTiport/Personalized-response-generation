Q. Talk about, 71 first time competitively on the golf course.  How did it feel?
ERNIE ELS:  It was good.  You know, you had to really play your ball today.  A couple of holes were really tough.  Off the fairway you're going to have a tough time making par.  I missed a lot of fairways, a couple of greens.  I'll take 71.  Looking forward to the rest of the week.
Q.  Does this help for a U.S. Open, this kind of golf course?
ERNIE ELS:  Oh, absolutely.  This is right up there with a U.S. Open.  You can mostly play it here right now.  This is a great test of golf, they let the rough up, the greens are fast, so it's a great golf course.
Q.  We're going to see some changes weather wise in the next three days.  This might be the best day to score.
ERNIE ELS:  Well, the tougher it is, the better you're going to play.  I'd like to play well this week.
Q.  Talk about how you feel health wise coming back from the knee surgery.  Are you 100 percent yet?
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I'm getting there.  I think I'm very close.  I've done a lot of work on my swing.  Because of the injury I've worked hard on that.  I've got to be patient, but I feel really close right now.
Q.  Give me some impressions of Charlotte.
ERNIE ELS:  I haven't been out much.  I'm suffering from jet lag, just coming over from England.  Right now I'm a little tired, but I'll have the weekend to check it out.
