  Q. 2-under par, just a couple comments.   
 ERNIE ELS: Two bad mistakes, on 1 and on 10. I three-putted 1 from nowhere this morning, my first hole. And on 10 I made double from nowhere. I hit it just in the left rough, laid it up, hit my hand iron over the green, chipped it up to about six feet, missed it. So those two mistakes really cost me.   
 I made a really nice putt on 18. I'm hitting the ball really nice, so feeling good.   
  
  Q. Conditions of the course out there?   
 ERNIE ELS: Great. They did a hell of a job. I think the greens keepers and the rules officials are really doing a hell of a job. The course is in really playable shape. The greens are obviously really soft so you're going to see a lot of birdies.  
  
  Q. 36 holes tomorrow, your thoughts on that?  
 ERNIE ELS: We haven't done that for a while. It's going to be a tough walk for the caddies. We'll be fine, but it's a long walk for those guys.
