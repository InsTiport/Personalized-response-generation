  Q. How was it out there today?   
 ERNIE ELS: It was pretty hot. Beautiful day. Perfect conditions. Course is perfect. Not a lot of wind.   
 If you get out of the position on some of the holes on the back nine you're going to have some issues, but overall nice scoring conditions.   
  
  Q. What's it like playing with Jeff Knox?  
 ERNIE ELS: It was nice.   
  
  Q. Could you have taken a marker or gone by yourself?  
 ERNIE ELS: I don't know. I got on the tee and Jeff was there and we went.   
 (Laughter.)  
 I didn't ask any questions.   
  
  Q. Do you know what he shot?  
 ERNIE ELS: Well he shot about the same as I did. He played really well.   
  
  Q. Did you know he had a 61 here?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, he told me. Pretty impressive for any tees. Anywhere, I don't care if you playoff the ladies tees, that's pretty impressive. So we'll probably see him tomorrow again.   
  
  Q. Are you happy with the way the Presidents Cup has come out?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I think so. I think everybody is pretty relieved now.
