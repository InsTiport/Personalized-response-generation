 Q. Ernie, 4-under 68 in your final round. Couple of bogies. Other than that you played really fell.
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I really enjoyed it, actually. The back-9 I was trying to get something out of it because I needed a good start in the front-9 and I didn't do that. 
 I bogeyed the 1st hole, bogeyed the 4th hole and missed a lot of putts on the front-9. Basically wasn't quite in it but tried to finish strong which I did, so, yeah, sweet feeling I guess but it's been a good week.

 Q. Like you said, good week, kind of tinkering with the swing. You were in the hunt all week long. How do you feel right now?
 ERNIE ELS: I tinkered with my swing last week and if I didn't think it worked I wouldn't be here today. I got to thank myself for that so I think I had a good week. You know, I worked through it, felt like I hit the ball pretty solidly most of the week. I could have made a couple more putts here and there but it's fine. I had a good week. Tough finish. Really I would have taken it before the week started.

 Q. Thoughts on the golf course. You thought it was going to be a tough test. 14-under is pretty good. Do you think the conditions and the way they had it set-up --
 ERNIE ELS: The conditions helped us out. If we had conditions like we did in the practice round earlier, it would have been tough. But the conditions played its part. I think the golf course, the golf course started growing on me as the week went on. I really got a nice plan for the golf course to play it. 
 It's really a lot of penalties around the greens so you got to be very accurate but I think it's a great championship golf course. I think you're going to see some really good names coming through here in here's to come.

 Q. Thanks for your time. Good shooting this weekend.
