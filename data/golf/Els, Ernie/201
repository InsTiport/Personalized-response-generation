 Q. That was a bit of a battle for you today, Ernie?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, yeah, I thought I was really on formula. I did a lot of practicing and did a lot of good work coming into the week. But obviously tournament golf is a different matter, and kind of exposed me a little bit today. He drives the ball really very well. I didn't quite make enough putts. But I just hung in there, kind of used my experience a little bit just to hang in there.
 Geoff wasn't a hundred percent on his game, either. There was a lot of mistakes being made out there, but it was an exciting day.

 Q. 3-down after 3 holes, what were you thinking?
 ERNIE ELS: I was just trying to get through it, trying to go as long as I can. And, you know, I won the 5th hole and then I gave the 6th away again. Then I won five in a row. And then I couldn't close him out. 
 And then he came back and he made an unbelievable putt on 18 under the pressure. A nice birdie putt, just came up short and didn't feel very good going into the 19th hole, because my record in extra holes is not very good. So I kind of had that against me. But again he made a mistake on his second shot and that led me through. 

 Q. Your neck problem, was that giving you any grief today?
 ERNIE ELS: No, not at all. My neck is a hundred percent. Just wasn't quite there, and hopefully I can play better. I think I need to play better tomorrow. I think this course suits J.B. Holmes to a tee, so I'm going to have to have to be much better tomorrow.
