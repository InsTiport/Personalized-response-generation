Q.  Sum up the week for us.
ERNIE ELS:   I believe it was a solid week, put it that way.  There were three holes, 6, 7, 8; I played those holes 3-over par for the week.  I think that's just a problem.  The rest of it was pretty good.  I felt that I hit the ball quite nice.  Though I didn't make anything today, I felt my stroke was okay.  They just weren't going in.  I had a fairly solid week.  A little disappointing.  I feel good enough to win but yesterday, Trevor shot 64 and today Ignacio has shot 65, so those two players obviously excelled over the weekend.
I'm playing solid.  I'd like to win some more tournaments, especially here. 

Q.  Wouldn't it be difficult to come straight back and win after three weeks off? 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I know what you're saying.  I thought so at the start of the week, especially the first day; I didn't play well at all.  From Friday until now, I felt I played the way I normally play.  Definitely I've got to work on my short game.  My short game let me down.  That's probably from the lay-off.  But all credit to them. 

Q.  Will you be where you hope to be at the U.S. Open? 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it's about three weeks away.  Next week, I'd like to play well there, I like that tournament.  Then I have a week off and then the U.S. Open.  I've just got to get my short game going, keep the swing where it is now and I might have a good chance. 

Q.  Have you gone to Olympia Fields? 
ERNIE ELS:   No.  I might go Sunday evening and play Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. 

Q.  What do you know about it? 
ERNIE ELS:   Nothing.  I just read the magazines you guys write.  (Laughter.)
