ERNIE ELS: Obviously I was hoping that conditions wouldn't be that difficult, but I was wrong; it was very difficult.  But I was trying to get to even par at the end of the round there.  You can save your round by playing the last four really well.  So I tried to do that.  It didn't quite happen.  But 1-over isn't going to be that far away.  So I'm still in it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I mean I'm 6'5", so the wind is going to get me.  And I felt very -- like the wind was blowing me around.  And I missed a couple of short ones.  But I feel comfortable with the putter.  It's just one of those things, I've always found it difficult to putt in the wind at The Open Championship.  But I'm feeling good with the putter.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ERNIE ELS: Well, yes, I mean, yeah.  I mean, I'm playing the weekend.  As I say, I didn't have my best today.  I'm still in it.  I think 5-under might be leading with the conditions out there.  So I don't think anybody is really going to go away.  And even if they go away, I'm in the weekend and anything can happen.  I can play a little better than I did today, so I'm aiming for that.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ERNIE ELS: Well, yeah, hopefully I am bunched because I don't quite do what I needed to do today.  But hopefully it is bunched, and then hopefully we can play a good Saturday and maybe get out of the bunched group.  Hey, if you have a chance to win on Sunday with 30 players or three players, you take that and go with your chances.
