 Q.   On the first round, a lot of the guys early today posted up some good scores and then the weather changes.   Talk about your day in general.   
ERNIE ELS:   I thought there was still a score this afternoon.   I battled on the greens a little bit.   On my short putts I wasn't really comfortable with.   Didn't have a good start either, so I had my back to it a little bit.   
But I battled hard.   You know, I tried to get out of the round as much as I could.   But there was a good score out there.   You know, you could get going low.   I mean, there are a lot of great scores.
