   ERNIE ELS:  Hit as couple of shots I don't normally hit and they were costly. I will put that down to early season. 

 Q.  Bit of ground to make up over the leaders? 
 ERNIE ELS:  Retief is 11-under at the moment so I am seven behind and need some good numbers/. I need to play well and make some birdies, see how it goes. Seven behind is a long way behind. 

 Q.  And rust was the only problem as you made plenty of birdies? 
 ERNIE ELS:  I played decent. Then on my third hole, the 12th, I made double from nowhere. Then I had a good stretch. I didn't birdie anything around the turn and then I was pushing a little. I wasn't play poor golf. I made birdie on the fifth, then coming in on the seventh, I can't remember when I last hit a shot like that. I had 97 yards to the pin and hit it 120 yards. I made bogey there and then on nine I hit it in the water with my second. A couple of loose shots but I am feeling I am striking it well.
