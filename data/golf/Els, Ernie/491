ERNIE ELS: I felt I missed a good opportunity. When you play this course when it is as calm as this, you have to do better. My ball striking is still there but I have to work on my short game again. Carnoustie was in great shape today. I hope to do a little better over the next two days, but playing with my dad is such a thrill and playing with a relaxed Nick was great. At least he, out of the four of us, played well.
