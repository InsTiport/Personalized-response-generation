 Q. So the weather out here a little chill year than you expected?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, a little chilly, but clear and beautiful, so can't complain about the weather.

 Q. You kind of complained a little bit about your first round. You didn't feel you were playing that well. How did you do the second round? How did you fare? Were you striking the ball a little bit better?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I think when you shoot 6-under, you're playing all right, so yeah, playing okay. Looking forward to the next couple of days.

 Q. And your putting, is that coming around?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, no, I'm doing okay, thanks. I'm doing all right. I'm starting to feel comfortable, and obviously it'll be a good test over the weekend but I'm feeling good.

 Q. What are you going to do between now and your afternoon tee time?
 ERNIE ELS: I'm going to probably eat something. I haven't had breakfast yet, so eat something, relax, and get ready for the third round.
