  Q. A couple comments, a little bit of a roller coaster ride for you out there today.   
 ERNIE ELS: Just with the putter. I missed a 2-footer on 12, and a 2-footer on 8, and quite a few, never really made the putts I made yesterday. If I made some putts, I could have had a low one, and I knew today was the day to get a low one.   
 You know, I'm there, but I feel like I could be a lot better. But it's fine. It's the first week of the year, and I guess I've just got to be patient.   
  
  Q. And you're there in a place that you love and where you've had success. Talk a little about the next two days.   
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I mean, I don't know, the wind has switched now, so maybe we get different conditions tomorrow again. Today was perfect, as I say, so maybe tomorrow we will get a southwest wind blowing, and we will see.   
  
  Q. Where you are, do you feel anything can happen out here?   
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, there's plenty to go still. As I said, the conditions could be different. The wind could blow, and I see Sunday we might get rain. There's plenty of golf left.   
 I just want to score the way I'm playing. That's my whole deal. I feel like I'm two, three shots -- at least two or three shots out there every day.
