 Q.   Ernie, just comment on the day for us.  
ERNIE ELS:   I played good, you know.   The whole week I played good and just not getting it in the hole quick enough.   I played nicely.   The golf course is playing really great.   Picking up a little bit of mud on the tee balls, but played quite solidly.  
   
 Q.   When you go into Sunday, you're not that far back.   You can put yourself in position.  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah.   Pretty well I needed to get to maybe 10, 11-under to really have a really good shot, but, you know, if I get going tomorrow, get those putts going, I need a 62, 63, or something like that, it's tough to do on a Sunday, but, you know, you might as well give it a go.   I need to go low tomorrow to have any kind of chance.  
   
 Q.   With everything that's on the line tomorrow, is that where you're maybe more aggressive than you normally are, just with the chance to maybe get to the leaderboard and get a victory here?  
ERNIE ELS:   I just got to stick to what I'm doing.   As I say, I'm playing really well.   I'm glad all the hard work I've done is starting to pay off a little bit.   Obviously, I would love to get a win.   I'd like to play a solid round of golf tomorrow.   If it really gets going, that will be really a plus.
