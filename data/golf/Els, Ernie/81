Q.   3‑up through seven holes.   Ended up losing at the last leg.   Give you your thoughts on that one. 
ERNIE ELS:   It's tough to take.   I mean, I didn't play that nice coming in.   I missed quite a few makeable putts and had some bad irons shots.
17, my favorite club is my 8‑iron and I pulled it way left.   I had a chance there. 
Then I hit a very poor second shot on 18.   So tough finish. 
But, Victor, give him credit, he made quite a few birdie in the middle there.   He was in a lot of trouble and he deserved to win.

Q.   You told us last night you were feeling it a little bit.   44 years old and you played 91 holes.   How much did you feel it today?
ERNIE ELS:   I don't think I feel any more tired than anybody else.   Just been fighting a couple of little things in my swing all week.   Obviously you can't hit an 8‑iron 40 left and have a chance. 
Then I hit a 6‑iron heavy on 18, so I got to work on that. 
I think my fitness is fine.   It's just one of those things.

Q.   What do you take out of this week so far in term of positives?
ERNIE ELS:   A lot, you know.   I'm playing with brand new equipment with Adams, my fourth event.   I had a chance to actually get to the finals.   So I'm looking forward to the rest of the year.   Just a little bit of tweaking with a few of the clubs, but I'm really excited about things.

Q.   You've still got the consolation match to go out there and play this afternoon.   Money and ranking points there.   How do you get yourself up for that?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, we'll get a little bit of lunch and get going again and hopefully play well.
