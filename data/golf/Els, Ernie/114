Q.   The 4‑iron on 17.   Run us through that shot?
ERNIE ELS:   I saw that, actually, I was on the range.   I hit a very nice shot.   Yeah, I was just trying to get as much out of my round as I could. 
Unfortunately bogeyed 18.   But some really nice shots, started playing the course the way it should be played.

Q.   It was 32 years getting The Open back to Merion, do you want to see it back here?
ERNIE ELS:   Absolutely.   It's been an unbelievable venue this week.   The course definitely held up.   Started the week with people saying there could be record scores.   I totally disagreed with that.   It was a great setup.   The rough was tough.   Yeah, everything about it was just wonderful.
And the fans were unbelievable.   It definitely shouldn't way another 32 years.

Q.   Can you compare the difficulty today with the last round of Congressional and Oakmont when you won?
ERNIE ELS:   The breeze has died down, but there was a lot of breeze.   And all along, par‑4s were all into the wind.   They were almost virtually par‑5s.   I'm talking about No. 5, No. 6.   No. 3, going into the wind was 263.   I thought it was a very strong test.

Q.   You said at the beginning early at the practice stages that you expected a bunched up‑‑
ERNIE ELS:   I didn't say that.   Let's get this straight.   Somebody else said it.   And I didn't agree with it.   So let's just get the stuff straight here.

Q.   You said a bunch of guys would be bunched up right at the end?
ERNIE ELS:   Am I wrong or right?   I'm out of here.
