 Q. Your thoughts on the round?
 ERNIE ELS: Well, I thought we had it quite difficult. The greens were very firm, quite bumpy again. A lot of wind. We had to deal with quite a bit. I felt like I didn't get a lot of momentum in my round. I felt like I was fighting to save par today. I've got an outside shot.

 Q. What about going into tomorrow, being right there, Dustin is obviously having a great round of golf out there today. He's the guy to catch. But your thoughts going into tomorrow?
 ERNIE ELS: Thoughts going into tomorrow? I need to play a good round of golf. I need to play a steady round of golf. I need to make some birdies early on and try to have a good finish. I think the finish is going to be tough for the leaders tomorrow, for anybody. 
 But I think that's where you could maybe make up some ground and obviously the first couple of holes where you have a few birdie opportunities.

 Q. What was in your day today that you'd really like to see improve tomorrow?
 ERNIE ELS: Well, I haven't really holed out all week. I putted quite nicely yesterday, shot under par. I made two good putts on 15 and 16, but other than that I haven't really made anything. I'd like to have a better touch on the greens.

 Q. Phil felt all week that the championship will be determined under par. He says I now feel it will be under par. Do you agree with that? Does that put you in a position where you --
 ERNIE ELS: Well, Dustin Johnson is quite a way under par so you would think he's not going to shoot a very high round. So I think under par is going to be the winning score, absolutely.

 Q. Does that put pressure on you to try to attack?
 ERNIE ELS: I think I need to start off with a couple of birdies, and try to see what they're doing on the back nine.
