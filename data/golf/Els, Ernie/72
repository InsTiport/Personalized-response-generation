 Q.   How much fun was that out there today?   
ERNIE ELS:   It was a lot of fun.   I played with Rickie, nice young crowd.   I made a really good‑‑ (Inaudible.) I missed quite a few greens, got the ball up‑and‑down.   The putter was really the key.   It was really nice.   It was really exciting to make a nice putt on 18.   
I only had like a 65‑yard shot.   With this rough, if it's downgrain‑‑ I pulled it slightly and‑‑ (Inaudible.) Got up there, beautiful line and perfect distance.   
Things I've been working on, I needed to get down to technique.
