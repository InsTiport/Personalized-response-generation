 Q.  Tough day out there, wasn't it. 
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, it was difficult.  I've just got to work on my short game.  The rest of my game is pretty good.  I missed a lot of putts and I didn't get the ball up-and-down. 

 Q.  Can you give us a flavour of how difficult the conditions were? 
 ERNIE ELS:  Oh, it was difficult.  It's dying down now, so the guys this afternoon, looks like they are going to get a break, but it was difficult. 

 Q.  Swirling? 
 ERNIE ELS:  It wasn't swirling, but it was gusting.  It was really bad.  It was a tough day this morning.
