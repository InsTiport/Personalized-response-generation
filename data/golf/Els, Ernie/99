 Q.   Solid round today.   How are you feeling after the second day?  
ERNIE ELS:   Feeling good.  
   
 Q.   On 2 you had a great putt, what was that shot like when you were standing over it?   It was a little intimidating putt, I would think.  
ERNIE ELS:   On the second hole?   I thought I could make that one.  
   
 Q.   You feel good about where you are right now?  
ERNIE ELS:   Well, just got some good swing thoughts going.   I really feel solid over the ball.   If I could make some putts, I would be really up the scoreboard.   I feel solid and it's two good days.  
   
 Q.   You had a little work to do coming in, Ernie, and you've done that through two rounds.   Comment on that?  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, thanks.   Obviously it's a big week for me to move ahead, so I need to‑‑ I knew I needed to have my game.   So that's why I worked over the weekend at home with Claude.   
And coming out I felt good.   I like the course, it's playing soft, I feel like every hole is almost a birdie hole if you can hit the right shot.   I'm trying to push ahead, but like I said, my putter is holding me back a little bit, but I'm hitting it nicely.
