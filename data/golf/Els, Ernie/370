ERNIE ELS:  My driving pleased me the last two days. My iron play could be a bit better. If I get that sorted out I might be okay. My putting is fine. I was getting a bit steep on the backswing and a bit closed. You want your hands closer to your body and I've been working on getting it into a better position and keeping the same angle throughout the shot and consequently I am hitting better shots.

I have a goal for the next two years. Jos and I are back together, and we have a plan to play quicker and get a better momentum going and getting the swing into a better position will help me achieve that and get a bit more mentally focussed.

Carnoustie? Right now I'd love to play in this weather. It's obviously the toughest course of the three and might give me the chance to make up some shots on the field. It would be nice to be windy and make it a little more challenging.
