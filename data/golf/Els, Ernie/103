Q.  Talk about the conditions.
ERNIE ELSE:  I don't need to be here.  Ask your question.
Q.  Always love to know your feelings on the condition?
ERNIE ELS:  Why?
Q.  The conditions.
ERNIE ELS:  It is what it is.
Q.  Your state of play?
ERNIE ELS:  I'm getting nothing out of it.  I'm very
frustrated.  I just made two bogeys from the middle of the bloody
fairway.  I'm hitting it nicely, I'm hitting it solidly.  I'm
trying to do the right thing.  It's quite difficult out there.
Q.  Talk about the unpredictability of the golf course.  One
bounce one day, and one bounce the other day.
ERNIE ELS:  It's a links golf course.  It's what you're
gonna get.  It's firm.  It's brown.  It's bouncing all over the
place.  It's firm.  It's tough to control your ball.  It's a
pretty tough battle out there.
Q.  What's the difference between yesterday and today for you
condition-wise?
ERNIE ELS:  Pretty similar.  I think there are two greens
that's really getting -- can I say it?  It's not very playable.
But the rest is tough but fair.  Really tough challenge.  But I
think two of the greens are getting out of hand.
Q.  Which two, Ernie?
ERNIE ELS:  15 and I still want to say No. 14.  14 and
15.
Q.  Are you ever in your comfort zone out there at all?
ERNIE ELS:  No.  I mean, I love links golf.  And I'm
trying to be as positive as I can.  But as I say, I'm just -- for
some reason, I guess I got all my breaks last year, I'm not
getting anything.  And it's very frustrating, trying to get myself
back in the tournament.  And it's just not going my way.
Hopefully I'll make my cut.  You're never out of a Major playing
on the weekend.
Q.  You said the greens are unplayable?
ERNIE ELS:  I never said that.  Where did I say it was
unplayable?
Q.  15 and 14.
ERNIE ELS:  I said it's borderline.  Please.  I never
used the word "unplayable."
Q.  I apologize.  Can the organization do anything to make
them better?
ERNIE ELS:  Yes.  Yes, they can.
Q.  What would you like to see them do?
ERNIE ELS:  Water.  And you don't have to cut 14 and 15.
Thank you.
