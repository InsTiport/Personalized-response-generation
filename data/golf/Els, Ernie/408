ERNIE ELS:  It was really cold this morning.  Yeah, I played a lot better obviously than yesterday.  Couldn't make any putts until maybe last couple of holes.  So I've got to be pleased with that.
Q.  Course looked like it held up pretty well, all things considered.
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  I didn't think we were going to start on time this morning because it rained last night.  The greens staff has done wonderful things and the course is in good shape.
Q.  Looks like three days in a row waking up at the crack of dawn.
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, if I knew this, maybe would I have taken the week off.  Yeah, it's going to be an early one.

I think the weather is going to get better.  At least we're going to have fresh greens, so that's a positive.  Yeah it's going to be tough to get up early again.
Q.  Could you talk about fighting back and saving a round where you were 2-over through 13 and not real happy, hit the ball in the water?
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, when I 3-putted 12 -- it's a par 5.  Any time we make even a par, you know, you're disappointed to make a par on a par 5.  To make a 6 was not good.

But after that, I hit every green except for 18, and I gave myself a lot of chances and I started making some putts.  So the round started turning after that.
Q.  What did you figure out?
ERNIE ELS:  Just pace.  The last couple of weeks we've been playing on very quick greens, and with the weather, they haven't been cutting the greens short.  So my pace has been way off but it got better on the end there.
