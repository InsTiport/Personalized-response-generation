 Q.   That little topple‑in on that last hole will make lunch feel better I'm sure.   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, especially after missing a three‑footer on 8.   I kind of fought hard all day.   I had a couple of really bad holes in the middle of my round.   But I tried to stick in there, and obviously that one on my 18th will bring us back.  
   
 Q.   Talk about yesterday and you're so patient in your approach to the golf course.   Did the conditions change much today?   
ERNIE ELS:   Little bit more breeze, little bit different direction breeze.   Every now and then it picks up a little bit, so you have to be careful.   But, yeah, I'm just trying to stick in there, you know.   
I like the course.   I obviously played well here last year, and I'm just trying to set that same game plan and really wait for the course to come to me.  
   
 Q.   You played well at Augusta National T‑13.   Do you feel some form coming into Louisiana?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I really put a lot of work in.   Like everybody, we put so much work into a major, so your game should be sharp.   Obviously, at Hilton Head mentally I was not there, but really I feel my physical game is there.   As you said, I just need to feel like I'm giving myself chances and staying patient.
