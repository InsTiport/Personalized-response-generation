 Q.   Very disappointed, Ernie Els; what happened after that drive on the 18th hole?  
ERNIE ELS:   What happened?   Well, I pulled my second left and I chipped it up there.   Didn't have a great lie on my third shot and I pulled my putt.   
   
 Q.   Did you have the confidence to make that putt before there?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I guess so.   I just pulled it a bit.   
   
 Q.   Great job through the first 14 holes, let's talk about those putts that did go in early on.   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, played good golf today.   I just hit one bad shot.   That was on 17.   It was a bit of a wait there and lost my rhythm and hit a bad shot there.   Then obviously missed a short putt on 18.  
   
 Q.   You got a great break on the ball on 17, it actually gave you somewhat of a lie, somewhat of a shot, even though you were short‑sided?  
ERNIE ELS:   No, I had no shot.   I was in the tent or whatever it was.   I had no shot.   
   
 Q.   On 18, you made a birdie early in the green, it's a diabolical green, isn't it.   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it's a difficult green.   You know, I pulled my second left, as I said to Steve, and chipped it up to three or four feet.   You know, I was trying to just jam it in there and I pulled it.   
   
 Q.   I know you're really disappointed but what great ball‑striking, you have to take something good away from this.   
ERNIE ELS:   It's going to be tough.   I'm pretty hot now, and it's difficult to talk with a straight head here.   Yeah, if I take stock, I think I'm playing good golf, and I've got to head into the next couple of weeks trying to get a win.
