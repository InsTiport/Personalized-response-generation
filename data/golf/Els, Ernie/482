ERNIE ELS:  That's a great round of golf.  Good weather for it, but still, you got to hit the shots.  And that's what he did today.  He shot 61 with a 3-putt.  And he missed the one on 17.  But great playing.


Q.   Made a bogey on 8 and then missed an 8-footer on 17 and came close on 18.  Did you go up and shake him and say, Let's go.  Snap out of it"?

ERNIE ELS:  No, the way he was playing, he just kept hitting it in the fairway, kept hitting it on the green.  And his 3-putt on 8, he had such a nice putt and then he 3-putted it and lost a bit of momentum.  But that just kick-started him.  He made eagle on 9 and he made, I think, four or five birdies on the back nine in a row.  So he's a great player.  He's got a hell of a future ahead of him.  So, well done.
