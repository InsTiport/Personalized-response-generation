   ERNIE ELS:  I don't know quite what happened out there today.  I felt good on the range but I made a bogey on 7 and that got me angry.  I doubled the 10th and then dropped one at the 11th.  Basically my day was over after that.  I managed to salvage something by getting a birdie in the last five holes, and I need to get my focus back for the weekend.   
 I believe I could still catch the leaders, but I can't afford to go wandering about mentally as I did today.  If I can keep my focus, I know I can shoot 64 here.
