ERNIE ELS:   I played good the front nine, but then the back nine I just missed some putts are missed some shots.  From five feet and in, I felt a little uncomfortable on these greens today. 
My putting cost me.  I 3-putted on 12.  And then didn't make a birdie on 17, I had a short iron there.  I'm a little disappointed.

Q.  What club did you have on the second hole? 
ERNIE ELS:   Pitching wedge.
