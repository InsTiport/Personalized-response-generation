ERNIE ELS:  I played good. It was tough. The golf course really played tough over the weekend. The pin placements were a little easier today but it was really difficult to play the same way we played the first two days. The golf course was completely different. 

But saying that I only made one mistake today on the 12th. I had 175 to the hole into the wind and it was just in the first cut. I hit this seven iron and just hit it long and it flew. It flew 200 yards and I had no shot from there. No shot. So I made double there. But then I played solid coming in. I did what I wanted to do. 18 just gave me nothing. I couldn't hit two better shots than that. I hit three iron second shot. I had 215 to the hole and hit a beautiful three iron. If it stayed on the shorter stuff I had a better shot but in the long stuff, you hit it too hard and you hit it in the water. I didn't hit a very good chip to say the least but I was concerned it was going to run away with me. All in all I played good.

17 the putt didn't turn, misread it I suppose. But what are you going to do. One guy comes out of the pack and beats you. He played well so it is one of those things.

A week off and then Florida so will go to London and spend the week with my kids.
