ERNIE ELS:  It was all right today. I played okay. Made a couple of soft bogeys but feel like everything's okay. I've got a nice driver - a new one and I'm hitting it nice and low and it's going to go good next week.

Yesterday when I got here, the Titleist truck was still here. They said before the U.S. Open that they were going to give me a new driver so I got it and hit some balls with it and started out with it this morning. It's a 905 but a bit bigger. Bigger head - a 406 - as big as they come. I think they said 406, whatever that means, but it's the biggest head you can get. It wasn't going that far today because the ball doesn't roll - but it will next week, that's for sure! Coming out low and fast.

I putted better today but they were not going in. However the strike is better. I haven't putted very well recently. I didn't putt well at the U.S. Open. The greens were fine today but you can see they are going to get bumpy in the afternoon. Bit of poa annua in them and they can get tricky in the afternoons. But this is such a lovely place.

When I was in Ireland, both days I didn't think I was going to come but on Tuesday, the second day of the JP McManus Pro-Am, I felt my game was coming. It's such as an easy week, staying on site and relaxing, I am happy to play here and work on my game on-site.
