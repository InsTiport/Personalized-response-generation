Q.   What you've seen of Tiger ‑‑ inaudible. 
ERNIE ELS:   I saw him on television at Doral and didn't look good there.   Today he was on and today was the same as I saw at the Honda, very on, on 10 he got lucky and got out‑of‑bounds but other than that he was good. 

Q.   Do you think that even though he has not won at Augusta since 2005, is he still do you think considered to be one of the favorites? 
ERNIE ELS:   Definitely, with experience he's maybe not as long as he was back in the day, but he's still plenty long enough and he's got the most trajectory for the second shots.   Definitely would be a favorite. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
ERNIE ELS:   You could see it, maybe he's looking for his game again coming into this week. 
But then you get familiar with shots that you need to hit, and around here, you can put the ball in play with 3‑woods and 5‑woods, which helps the longer hitters.   But your iron play is on and you're putting well, you can score well. 

Q.   You played pretty well today yourself. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, not as good as yesterday.   Yesterday I thought I was a little better, but today, I'm okay.   I think I can make a run on the weekend.   I've definitely got my putting shoes back.   So I'm really excited. 

Q.   Especially from long distance, you were getting within one or two feet. 
ERNIE ELS:   Exactly.
