   ERNIE ELS: I would take everything other than the finish, Double bogey, it's not how you want to finish. It was a difficult day. The wind was stronger and I wasn't on my game as I was yesterday. Scrambled quite well here and there but just let it go at the end there.  
  
  Q. What aspects - tee shots?  
 ERNIE ELS: Everything really. Wasn't quite as sharp as yesterday. Might be I was a little tired being up since 4:30 a.m. this morning and maybe got to me a little bit. We will readdress it and try and get back into it again.  
  
  Q. This stop start is tough?  
 ERNIE ELS: It is a little but difficult. You just can't get into a rhythm. That's how I felt. I couldn't get into a rhythm as I was yesterday and then you start pushing, miss a couple of putts and it wears on you a bit.   
  
  Q. And unsure about what will happen tomorrow in terms of finishing?  
 ERNIE ELS: Exactly. We had it quite difficult out there today and it would be a little unfair if these guys don't play this afternoon if a weather system comes in and they get a quiet day tomorrow, then a lot of guys will lap us.  
  
  Q. But you are not out of it?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, it's just a pity about that last hole. But I am two under, eight under is leading and I need a good weekend.
