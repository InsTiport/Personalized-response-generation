   ERNIE ELS:  I made 8 birdies but also had 3 bogeys. It was a bit scrappy at point to be honest. However, I managed to find my way around the golf course and this was as good a day as you will get at Carnoustie. There was no wind and I am a bit surprised that no one has shot really low.   
 I suppose the main reason for my score was my putting. I putted really well, holing 30-footers on both the second and 4th holes.
