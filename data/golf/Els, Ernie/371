Q.  Well, good start to the week.
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, that was what I wanted, obviously, a couple of weeks off, watched a little bit of Ryder Cup.

The course is in great shape.
Q.  How much have you gotten up here to play?
ERNIE ELS:  I just came twice.  I'm just 30 minutes away in good traffic.  Came up twice.

As I say, when I played, the wind was howling, and then it's difficult, because then the rough comes in play and today it was pretty easy.
Q.  And you've had more or less a couple weeks off.  Been working on anything in particular?
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, actually, I worked a lot on my swing.  I've been working on a couple of technical bits on my swing, and today it felt great.  Hit the ball solidly, hit it quite far, hit a lot of greens, it was good.
Q.  You've had some really good rounds this year.  Is it a matter of putting three or four really good ones together?
ERNIE ELS:  Exactly.  I think that's what I've got to do.

It's a very important week for me.  I'd like to win obviously, but I'd like to finish with a good week here and see what happens.
Q.  Being from South Africa, did you watch the Ryder Cup and does that interest you at all?
ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I live here, so it's a pretty big deal.  I love watching it.  I watch it every year.  I watched a lot on Saturday.  Didn't watch the match Friday and Sunday, but yeah, I like watching.
