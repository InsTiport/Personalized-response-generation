  Third Round 71 (-8) 208 Total.

 ERNIE ELS: I made some mental mistakes, I missed three from the wrong places which cost me bogeys and double-bogeys. 
 Other than that, I played as good as I did yesterday. I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and the putts didn't quite drop. A little disappointed with the score. But I'm playing nicely. 

 Q. And after the double, one hell of a recovery, wasn't it?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, it was very back on track until -- I didn't birdie the par 5 14 out of the green-side bunker, and I 3-putted 15. But I left a few shots out there.
 So a day with a lot of might-have-beens. Disappointing. 

 Q. Depending what the last group has done, you're in the mix, catching distance. 
 ERNIE ELS: I was hoping to get to 10-under. After my debacle on the first couple of holes I was trying to get back to 10-under, and I was on track. I'm a little bit far behind but I'll try and push tomorrow.
