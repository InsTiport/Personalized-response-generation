 Q. Is 69 a fair reflection of your play today? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I played nicely today. I felt like I missed a couple out there again. But tee-to-green, I was good. A lot better than I was a couple of weeks ago at the U.S. Open, so I worked on that. Really felt good ball-striking. 
 Just got to make those putts. 

 Q. What have you tweaked since the U.S. Open? 
 ERNIE ELS: Well, I was getting the club so far inside on the way down, I was either going to block it or flip it. I wasn't in the right position coming down. So I worked on getting my position at my top of my backswing, a better position, and then I can get the club in front of me and really get some speed. 
 I hit the driver really great today and my irons were pretty good, so that's what I worked on. 

 Q. Your record at Loch Lomond is quite simply, incredible; why, what is it about this place?
 ERNIE ELS: I just love it. I can't really put my finger on it. The first time I played it, I loved it. I played well. I think I finished second to Tom Lehman that first time, and just love it. They made me a member here, so I feel at home, staying on the Loch down there, bring the family, it's a wonderful place. 

 Q. Did you get another look at Turnberry?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I was there Monday, Tuesday. Had a really good look. I've done my work. I guess it will get firmer. It was soft when I was there, a lot of rough, so it can be difficult if the wind is up, but very fair, very fair setup.

 Q. Are you looking forward to holing a few putts on these fresh greens tomorrow morning?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I would love to have a good round tomorrow and really have a chance over the weekend.
