 Q. Did you go into today thinking it was a very important day? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, definitely. I felt it today. I felt a little tingle there. I wanted to get off to a good start for the team. 
 But yeah, the guys, we were talking about that all week, just try to get some points on the board and don't fall behind. Hopefully it works out. 

 Q. Can I just ask you about your partnership with Ryo today, did you feel -- how do you feel he coped with the situation? 
 ERNIE ELS: I thought he did well. He had a perfect start to the round. We were 2-up. Then they just made some great putts on us. That was basically the change. Bubba made some good shots and he came up with a good putt on 12 which was probably the change in the match.

 Q. Did you really feel the crowd support? It was amazing on the first tee leading off. 
 ERNIE ELS: It was great. The crowd was wonderful. We just have to keep the crowd going and making birdies. We tried to do that and every time we made some birdies, the crowd was there for us. So far, so good. 

 Q. And your game today, how would you sum it up? 
 ERNIE ELS: I played well. We both played pretty well. Maybe a couple of holes where we didn't hit good iron shots, and most matches you really have a good game but they really played well.
