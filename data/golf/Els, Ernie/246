  Q. Comments on the rounds?   
 ERNIE ELS: I'm just pleased we got it done. The weather is changing a lot. We played the last three holes very fast to get done. But, yeah, I'm in pretty good shape. I'm playing okay. So halfway there, and you know, just got to keep it up.   
  
  Q. Talk about how important it was to hold it together through like 3, 4, 5 and 6 with the weather?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, it was a little bit of an iffy period in my round there. I missed the green on 3. Got it up and down. Stood on the fourth tee and the wind was blowing out of the south before I played my shot and went total opposite way, came out of the normal and the temperature dropped.   
 A little bit of a change there. Had to, you know, get ready and hit the shot, which I did and made a good par, and you know, I finished okay.   
  
  Q. Any positive MoJo from when you won here a few years ago?  
 ERNIE ELS: That was 2002. Eight-shot lead, I shot lights-out the first three days and I basically just hung in there. Tiger came at me pretty hard, and you know, just hung in there to make a couple of pars on the last.
