Q. You don't expect too many low scores because of conditions today, but you managed to conquer that, what was your key?ERNIE ELS: Well, I wouldn't call a 72 a low score.  But I played better than my score.  I made some really silly errors.  But the course is playing really well.  You've got to play well to score well.  And I think that's fair.
Q. What about the rest of the afternoon?  Is it going to toughen up for the people behind you?ERNIE ELS: I think so.  In the afternoon the greens get a little firmer.  There's really good pin placements.  I think it's a really good test.  You have to play away from some flags, and they give you opportunity for other ones.  It's a great setup.
Q. What opportunities are there?  What sort of ground do you want to make up Sunday and how much can you make up?ERNIE ELS: Today was my day and I let it slip.  I made some really bad errors. On 5, I made a 6, and on No. 16 I made a 6.  That's a four-shot swing there.  If you take away those four shots, I'm at a better shot.  But now I'm just playing for position.
