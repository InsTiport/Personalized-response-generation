ERNIE ELS:   I kept it together until the 17th. That was a disaster. I made seven there. It was a tough day. The wind kept getting stronger and stronger and I thought I kept it together quite well, just  a pity about the finish. I am still there. Obviously six shots is a lot to make up over the next two days but we'll give it a shot. It's a case of keeping patience. The wind wasn't a factor yesterday but today it showed its teeth and it was a tough course today. Patience was really the big factor and I did it for three quarters of the way. The cut has gone up three shots and that doesn't happen very often. The greens got firmer and it was a totally different day. It was a real mental challenge. To score anything under par today was a good score.

I knew the wind was getting up but it got stronger and stronger and a lot of cross winds. I thought yesterday was perfect for scoring but today it wasn't. It will end up evening itself out at the end of the week. The 17th was a big mistake but that's the way it goes. I would like it to be like this for the next two days because now we known what it's like when the wind picks up.
