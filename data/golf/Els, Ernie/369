71 (Ev)  Carnoustie (-8)
ERNIE ELS:  I'm satisfied with that. That was a difficult day. We asked for it yesterday but chose the wrong golf course to play in the wind. This is a real brute in calm conditions and you take a bit of breeze and it is a tough day.
Q.  What is the most difficult aspect of the game in this wind?
ERNIE ELS: Because I am 6ft 4, I find it tough to putt. I was bragging about my putting yesterday, but today you are moving around on those short ones. Then obviously club selection.
Q.  Good test for the swing changes?
ERNIE ELS:  It was the perfect test for them. I really had to stay committed on a lot of shots. I hit some really good shots into the wind. Downwind I hit a couple of loose shots. There was not much rough so you can go for the pins from the rough.
Q.  A number in mind for tomorrow?
ERNIE ELS:  Bradley is playing great and think it needs a 65 or something., I have the number in mind but I have to be patient with it. You don't have to make seven birdies in the first seven holes although that would be nice, Just have to play all 18 holes as well as you can.
