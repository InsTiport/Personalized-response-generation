 Q.   I guess you feel frustrated.  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, that wasn't the score I was looking for.   I didn't feel I played all that badly, just my second shots didn't quite get it on the right lines, and a couple of bounces here and there.   So didn't quite play as good as I wanted to.  
   
 Q.   You threatened to get going, and then you kept coming back?  
ERNIE ELS:   Exactly.   I made a birdie here and there and then I had a 3‑putt early on on 4.   I birdied 6, bogeyed 7‑‑ it was one of those up‑and‑down roads.   I need to get it going tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Your bogey on 15, did that kind of sum up your day in terms of loose play?   
ERNIE ELS:   Exactly.   I didn't think that second shot was all that bad.   Obviously right of the flag is not the best option, but I was trying to be aggressive.   I got a bit of an awkward bounce.   Yeah, the chip shot and the putt wasn't all that good, so, yeah, it was a bit loose.  
   
 Q.   What are the challenges here, given that it's a generous course, at least looking out from the tee.   
ERNIE ELS:   Well, it just showed today, if you're just a little bit off, this course will bite you.   The guys keep saying it's so easy; I didn't find it that easy.   So I don't know if they are playing a different course than I.   
But I love it, it's a great setup, it's what I wanted to come and do, play some links.   So hopefully I can get it going tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Your frustration apart, how is The Open Champion feeling with a week to go for next week?   
ERNIE ELS:   I'm feeling great.   You know, that's why I'm here, trying to get a bit of practice going, get a bit of links golf under my belt.   I've been to Muirfield quite a few times now, so I know what the course is like.   I'm just trying to work on a couple of things on my game.
