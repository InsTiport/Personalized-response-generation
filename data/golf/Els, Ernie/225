 Q. Ernie Els. Welcome back to the Memorial. You're having a great season. Does that give you a lot of good feelings coming into this event? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, yeah, I've got to get used to these greens. This is even quicker than Augusta. It was nice playing today. Obviously, great playing with Jack today. 
 But, yeah, I've had a nice season. I'm looking forward to coming in here. 

 Q. And your memories of this course give you the good feelings knowing you can play well enough? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, absolutely. You've got to hit the shots. I've done it before. You've have got to try to get the memory bank going and make the shots. The course is just in unbelievable shape. It's amazing how good they get it. 
 So if you play properly, you're going to score well. 

 Q. How about this event? This is fun for you, but Phil gets all the skins. 
 ERNIE ELS: He gets them all. He just killed us. He played unbelievably. Made the eagles, made the birdies. He just did what he had to do.
