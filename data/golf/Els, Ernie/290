 Q. Thoughts on your round today?
 ERNIE ELS: Conditions were really tough, breeze was blowing, the fairways were very firm and it was really tough to keep the ball in play on the fairways, and obviously the greens were really firm as well, and some really tough pin placements, too. 
 It was a real beast today. It was a tough golf course under very difficult circumstances. 

 Q. All of that considered, how rewarding is it to finish the way you did on 17 and 18? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, obviously the one out there on 18, to try to get to even, I've got to be pretty happy with that. 
 I made a big blunder today on 14. I made double-bogey there. You never really want to make a double-bogey in a major, especially after the rain delay going back and making such a big mistake. It wasn't pleasing, but at least I'm still in it. I had a very good finish. 

 Q. Your first hole after the rain delay?
 ERNIE ELS: My second hole.

 Q. What did you do? 
 ERNIE ELS: I drove it just right, maybe four yards off the fairway, difficult lie, laid it up, I hit a 3-degree and hit a very poor shot coming back. 

 Q. The save on 16? 
 ERNIE ELS: Good save on 16. Yeah, as I said, I thought my ball was right in the middle of the fairway. It must have really bounced very hard. It went through the fairway again, just a couple of feet off the fairway, almost no shot. 
 So it's getting really difficult out there. 

 Q. There was such talk about the graduated rough at the U.S. Open which we don't have here --
 ERNIE ELS: I think this week, a good example, playing with Freddie on the same hole, he hit it a bit further right than me and he had a shot. So if you're going to miss it, you might as well miss it a long way. I mean, you can miss it by just a couple yards and you've got no shot out of that rough.
