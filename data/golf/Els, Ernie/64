  ERNIE ELS:   I had 240 to the hole, I flagged the back, I thought I'd take it on.   I did push it a little bit, but I had enough club and it got over the creek and ran up there.  
I had a really good look at eagle.   I didn't quite read it right.  
15 was a little downwind for us today and I hit a really solid drive.   204 front, 212, and I hit a really good 6‑iron down the hill.   And I got the wind just right again, and about five, six feet.   
So making a putt made the shot even more valuable of the so it was a couple of good par 5s here today.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations on a great round.   (Inaudible.)  
ERNIE ELS:   No, I don't think I've ever shot under 70 in an opening round.   So, yeah, on my first tee shot it was near the media center.   So it wasn't a great start.   
And I scrambled to four.   And I made two good birdies on 2 and 3.   And that got me in the right flow.   And I really felt comfortable over the putter and the driver.   The game felt solid today.  
There's a lot of golf to be played, but it's a really nice start.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ERNIE ELS:   Gordon knows what we're working on, and we've been working on a lot of things ‑‑ not too many things, but we've been working hard on the game to get it into a better shape.   It takes a bit more self belief, and I think it's coming through with rounds like this.   We'll keep grinding.   
   
 Q.   Is this good momentum going on?  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, this is wonderful.   To get something under par, under 70, hitting it solidly.   Plenty of golf to be played.   You can't even be dreaming about Sunday yet.   We've got a lot of work yet.   I just want to keep grinding.   There's some improvements I still can make.   I still missed a couple of iron shots here and there, but for the most part just got to stay patient.
