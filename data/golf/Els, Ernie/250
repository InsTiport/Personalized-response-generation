   ERNIE ELS: I mean, Steve Stricker, he played unbelievable. 65 today, that's really good golf. Breaking par is tough today. He played well.

 Q. You said yourself 18 is playing pretty much like a par-5. You were playing with Jerry Kelly. He almost didn't get it to the fairway on 18. 
 ERNIE ELS: Exactly. There's a couple out there. 11 is a par-5 with a ditch in the middle and I think a lot of players can't get it over there. 18 is another one where just to get it to the fairway takes a pretty good hit. It's one of those things. 

 Q. You went without an umbrella, but there's a good reason why. Tell everybody. 
 ERNIE ELS: I don't know, there's not really a reason. I just thought come what may, you're going to get wet. I've got a good rain suit, and I eventually brought it out on the back nine.

 Q. Talk about what you did with your hat when you were out there. 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, water drips off your visor, or the brim, so I threw my cap to Dan every now and again, every time I hit a shot, not to get the dripping going. We've got enough things to worry about.
