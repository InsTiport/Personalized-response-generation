Q. Ernie, your fellow countryman, Branden Grace, has really put himself in position to maybe win tomorrow, just shot up the leaderboard.  What about his game makes it possible for him to win tomorrow?ERNIE ELS: We played a couple of practice rounds together earlier in the week and I said from the start, of the South Africans he has the best chance, because he hits the ball really low with his driver.  He doesn't put any shape on it, so it's dead straight when he's on.  So he gets good length, he's a really good iron player and he's been working on his putting. He's got the all-around game for this place.
