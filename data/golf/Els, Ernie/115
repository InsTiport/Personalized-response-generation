Q.   (No Microphone.)
ERNIE ELS:   16 I only had a 9‑iron and 15, I kind of misclubbed myself.   So those two bogeys sting a little bit.   It would have been great to get it into the red.   But I got to be fortunate, I mean, happy with 1‑over.   Especially 17 and 18 are just virtually impossible. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
ERNIE ELS:   It's tough to say.   You got to go back in the book, I think. 

Q.   It's pretty difficult, isn't it?
ERNIE ELS:   It's very difficult.   I mean, I was actually fortunate a couple of times, I didn't hit too many fairways, but I did get reasonable lies. 
On 14 I hit it down the right and I could only advance the ball 20 yards into the rough.   And then I had 120 to the front edge.   So it was very difficult to get the ball out of there. 

Q.   Is it just last few holes or is it the whole course?
ERNIE ELS:   I think it's just morning, isn't it.   We have got that northwest wind blowing.   It was really blowing a bit this morning.   So probably a two‑club wind.   And it's dead into you on 14, 15, 17.   And then 18 is downwind.   And it was raining a bit. 
So it was really more British Open, Open Championship stuff, should I say, so it was really difficult.   You throw the rough in there, then the length of some of the holes, it's a tough finish. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, right here.   I've had it for awhile.   It's a little swelling. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
ERNIE ELS:   I don't think from this week, but if I go in there now I really feel it.   But, yeah, if you hit it wrong, if you get it into the grain, when it's thick like this, you get it into the grain, the club doesn't go through. 

Q.   Don't hit it there. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, that's the plan.   That's the plan. 
(Laughter.)
