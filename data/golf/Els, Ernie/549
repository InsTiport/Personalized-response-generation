Q.  Could you just give us a couple of quotes on your round today? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I didn't play well.  Really, just try to hang in there, really.  I didn't play very well.  I had my problems off the tee, and that's not good around here.  But I worked on that, definitely.  The rest of my game is okay.  My irons are nice, and my putting is quite nice and just never gave myself a lot of chances, so it I really didn't play very well. 
 
Q.  When did you get back?
 
ERNIE ELS:   I got back Thursday morning and I played yesterday and started so the preparation hasn't been great, but I know what I've got to work on.  It's very obvious.  
 
Q.  It's obviously a course you know very well? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   Oh, yeah.  I've love to play better, that's all.  I've love to have a chance Monday. 
 
Q.  Some low scores out there, Cabrera's 63 being one of them.  What do you make of that?  A bit of ground to make up the next three rounds?
 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I've got to play really well.  I think the greens will get firmer.  I think it will get more difficult, yeah.  It was a good day for scoring this morning.
