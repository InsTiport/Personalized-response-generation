Q.  A nice finish? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   A little better.  I'm still not playing the par 5's very well, but I played better shots today; and still not where I want to be, but it's getting there. 
 
Q.  Getting closer? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   It's getting better.  Putted really nice today.  A couple good iron shots, but still got to work on the driver. 
 
Q.  Is that the only problem today is the driving? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah.  
 
Q.  Anything in particular? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   It's not -- the swing, really, it's just that I'm not that in sync with my arms and my body.  So I'll work on that this evening and tomorrow, and hopefully get better. 
 
Q.  What was it like out there in terms of conditions? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   Really nice.  A little breeze, but nothing serious.  Good scoring conditions.  Shouldn't be any problems for the guys.  Pin positions are fair, and if you play well, you'll score.  
 
Q.  Where are you playing the next few weeks running up to the U.S. Open?
 
ERNIE ELS:   I'm playing next week at the Memorial, and then I've got a week off, and then we've got the U.S. Open.  I play the tournament after the U.S. Open (Westchester) and then come back to Europe.  
 
Q.  The Irish? 
 
ERNIE ELS:   No, I'm going to play Loch Lomond.
