Q.   How hard is it out there with these conditions?
ERNIE ELS:   It's difficult.   There's a gusty breeze.   It moves around, almost like Augusta a little bit, high trees.   Tough to get club selection and it's pretty cold.

Q.   For the folks back home in the U.S., how much does this place mean to you and what does it mean to you to play well here?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, a lot.   I mean, we lived here for a long time.   We've still got a house here.   Both my kids were born here.   Got the experience to reâ€‘design the golf course, which was wonderful.   Won a lot of golf tournaments around here. 
So out of South Africa, this was a second home to me for a long time and it means a lot to myself and the family.

Q.   You've played in all sorts of weather but how is it over these two days in this muck?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it feels like October.   It's good preparation for The Open Championship, I can tell you that.   So it's not a lot of fun, but you know, we try and grind it out, and it's a tough golf course.

Q.   Does local knowledge actually help in these circumstances? 
ERNIE ELS:   A little bit, yes.   You know, especially the new greens, we laid the new greens so I've got half an idea where it goes.   Yeah, it's still the same corporation.   You've got to try to keep it in front of you and out of these bunkers.   These bunkers are penal.

Q.   What are your thoughts on your position on that board?
ERNIE ELS:   I'm happy.   I'm happy I made that birdie on 18 and I've got a good chance now.   I played with Francesco; he's playing great, but I'm in there with a shot.
