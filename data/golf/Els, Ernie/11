Q. 4-1 after day one. How would you sum up the way your guys performed?
ERNIE ELS: A little different from previous Presidents Cups. It's a great start against an unbelievable team. The golf course is very tough. The golf was excellent. A lot of birdies going out. There were chances for the guys, but then I was really proud of my team making those big putts on 17 and finishing with some very tight pins.
Preparation, it's the old clich√©, always be prepared and have a good plan, and just try to instill that in the team for now. We've got a long way to go, but this is an unbelievable start. We haven't had a start like this for many years. We'll celebrate this little session victory and then we've got a couple more to go.
