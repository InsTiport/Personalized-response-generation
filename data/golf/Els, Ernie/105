Q.   Your verdict, sir?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I just didn't get the bounces.   I thought I played quite good today.   Had no idea on these greens, so I'm glad I'm leaving and I can get onto some other greens.   It was a nice time while being here. 
Hopefully I brought something to the tournament.   Not always nice to leave halfway through but hopefully we brought something.

Q.   Looked like there were chances out there, shouldn't be disgruntled about your game, because there were opportunities. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I had many opportunities, but just didn't quite get the run of the course.   It was kind of against me I felt.   I got a lot of awkward bounces out there but I'm playing nicely.   I feel like I'm swinging nicely, and gave myself quite a few opportunities, so you know, we'll just head onto Muirfield now. 
Obviously missing the cut is not great, but we've been having a great time here.   We're up at Skibo and having a good time.   I was a late entry into the tournament, so as I say, I hope we brought something, a couple more fans through the gates and I was a good playing partner for my guys.   They did pretty well. 

Q.   What's your plan now? 
ERNIE ELS:   Head back and keep the game sharp.   Work on a couple of things, but yeah, I'm just looking forward to next week.

Q.   Will you stay at Skibo or go up to Muirfield early? 
ERNIE ELS:   I'll stay at Skibo, go to Muirfield a couple of times.   Probably go down Sunday night as planned.
