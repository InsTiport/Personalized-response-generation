ERNIE ELS: I just love it here.  Ever since I played here in '93, I just kind of started enjoying the place, and it fits my eye, so to speak.  I know we use it a lot, but I just love it here.  The course is always in great shape, and yeah, a little hook here works.
Q. A lot of holes that favour a draw, and that obviously is what you prefer.
ERNIE ELS: Exactly.  I've always been a right-to-left player.  That's my favourite way to play, and there's a lot of holes like that.  Just got to figure out that 18th hole, but other than that, I'm okay.
Q. What happened with your second shot?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I just got stuck.  I've been struggling with this rib injury this week, and you know, on the longer shots, when you have to stay wide, I really find it tough.  The rib kind of catches there and throws the club inside and that's what happened there.  Only 250, so I had to go for it.  Wasn't a good swing, and wasn't a good result.
Q. The positives, a lot of great stuff out there.  Tell us how you felt?
ERNIE ELS: I felt good, man.  I love the greens now.  Starting to fall in love there again; this is a good thing.  A lot of quality shots.  A lot of good iron shots, a bit of breeze, kind of fell off now, but I feel good about this week.  I want to get a good one in in the morning and see what we can do this weekend.
Q. You still retain a tremendous passion and enthusiasm to get back out there in the winner's circle again.  That's fantastic to see.  Why is that; how is that?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, thanks, I just love the game.  I went through a very tough spell there, especially last year, beginning of the year, I think everybody saw that.  And kind of starting to rekindle my love for putting again, and the rest of the game has always kind of been there.  So I feel like I can still do something.
