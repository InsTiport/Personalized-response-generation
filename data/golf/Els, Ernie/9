Q. A lot of business to attend to as far as tomorrow, but what momentum do you take into the weekend?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, it's perspective, isn't it. I've got to look at where we are. It's easy to just look at where we could have been, because it was looking really unbelievable.
But we're in a very good position.
Q. What will your message be?
ERNIE ELS: This is the best. Sometimes it bites you. Put a spear in it and bite back.
Q. How much are you relishing this role to perhaps get this done?
ERNIE ELS: You know, the big picture is what it is. I'm just looking at my guys and I want my guys to play as good as they can and get as good a result as they can. They have put a lot of work into this and it's been quite a week already. This was probably good for them, showing what can happen the last couple holes.
Saying that, we're in the lead. The Americans played wonderfully on the 18th hole and all credit to them. They stuck to it and they grinded it. My guys learnt a lot from this afternoon. We won't make this happen again.
But saying that, they played great birdies, great shots, and that's why they are champions.
