 Q. Your thoughts on the day?
 ERNIE ELS: Just fighting my swing all day and I basically got fed up with it. Pulled it on 7 into the woods for a lot of ball and then on -- sorry, 6, and then 7 I hit in the Loch for my second shot. Just been fighting my swing and it's probably better for me to get out of here I think. 

 Q. Focus on next week?
 ERNIE ELS: Get to St. Andrews, exactly and work on it. 
 Yeah, it's not what I wanted to do, believe me, but you know, just kind of got fed up with fighting my swing all day. 

 Q. One too many, do you think? 
 ERNIE ELS: I've got no chance. I think the cut is probably going to be even or 1-over. It's not that I wanted to miss the cut but things happen like that. Maybe it's a good thing. 

 Q. Have you turned up at Opens before with your swing not in great shape? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, you know, I was a late entry into this tournament. I came here because I love it here. Loch Lomond is a beautiful place, and always had a good time here. This is probably the worst round I've ever played here. 
 But as I say, my swing is not quite there, and I've got a couple of days now to get it fixed and be ready for St. Andrews. 

 Q. How was it coming in?
 ERNIE ELS: I was a bit rusty. I had two weeks off, and I did a bit of work, but, I don't know, something went wrong. Just not quite there. 

 Q. Think you can find something and contend next week?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, it's just a feel thing with me and I'll get something going and hopefully be ready by Thursday. I've got five, six days to get ready.
