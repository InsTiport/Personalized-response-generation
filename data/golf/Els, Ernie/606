Q.   General comments on the round.

ERNIE ELS:  I played well.  I hit the ball nicely.  I hit most of the fairways, most of the greens, and that is the most important thing, I think.  I had a couple of good putts.  Could have been a little bigger, but I am satisfied with the first round.  I hit it nicely.


Q.   How many holes in one have you had?

ERNIE ELS:  One.  One at the European Open this year; 4-iron into the hole.  This one was looking great; I mean, it was right over the flag.  It came back a little bit.


Q.   Back to number 4, please, would you describe that.  What could it have been?

ERNIE ELS:  It could have been anything.  Could have been bogey, I mean, I was just -- I had a little gap through the trees.  I went for the shot.  I came off.  You know, I could have made 6th easily, maybe a two shot swing there.


Q.   What are your plans next year as far as playing in the U.S.?

ERNIE ELS:  Hopefully I can play maybe 8 tournaments over there.  I am playing in the 3 Majors after I can get a couple of invites.  I will just play -- I will play the tournaments I will get in.  I will play around the Majors.


Q.   You don't know which ones exactly?

ERNIE ELS:  No, don't know yet.  We are working on that.


Q.   Trouble with the heat at all?

ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, it was very hot today.  I played last week in Durban in South Africa, and we also had pretty humid conditions there, so I think I had a good warm-up last week for this kind of weather.  It was very hot out there today.


Q.   What was the temperature last week in Durban?

ERNIE ELS:  Last week, same as this.  I don't know, what is it?  About 30 --


Q.   32.

ERNIE ELS:  32 degrees with humidity.  I had to drink water on every hole.
