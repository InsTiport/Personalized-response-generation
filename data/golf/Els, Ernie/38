Q. (No Microphone.)
ERNIE ELS: You got U.S. Open, Open Championship, everything. You play in wind, you play tough pin placements, really fast greens, and a great golf course. So, put it all together you have an unbelievable place.

Q. I'm sure you would have liked to finish better, but the board's coming back to you. 
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, that's kind of the disappointing thing. I did all the hard work, hanging in there all day, and then bogeying 17 and 18 is a little soft. 
But I'm around for the weekend and I think that ‑‑ I'm not sure what's going to happen. If the wind stays up, I don't think more than 3‑under can lead. It's really difficult.
