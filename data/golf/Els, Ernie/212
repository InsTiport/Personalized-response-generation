 Q. 5-under, looks like you handled the course pretty well. How were the conditions for you?
 ERNIE ELS: It was pretty tough early on. There was a lot of rain this morning and a little bit of breeze. The course played very long. It was pretty tough, but I felt okay today. I putted quite well for most of the day. You know, I'm satisfied with anything under 70. 

 Q. Did the weather maybe settle the conditions down at all today, maybe make the greens --
 ERNIE ELS: Well, the greens have been very similar all week. You know, they haven't been the best -- they've never been out here, but they've made the best of a bad situation. Yeah, the greens were affected. The flag positions -- it was tough to get to some of the flags. The bunkers are so deep so a lot of the guys are playing away from the flags. 

 Q. How conscious are you of what you need to do to get back into the top 5?
 ERNIE ELS: I know what I've got to do. I've got to play better, which I'm starting to do now, and I'm trying to get into the top 5 by the end of this tournament heading into the TOUR Championship, and that's actually my goal. I'd like to play a really good round tomorrow, maybe hopefully be in contention, and hope for the best, really. 

 Q. Did you feel like your form dipped after Pebble Beach?
 ERNIE ELS: What do you think? Absolutely, yeah. My form did have a bit of a slide. I'm not sure what it was. Maybe it was just too much golf in Europe maybe. I played the BMW tournament in Germany, then I played the Scottish Open and the British Open. I probably played a bit too much and kind of didn't have it. It's been quite a battle to get it back.

 Q. What clicked today? 
 ERNIE ELS: Just the constant work I've been putting in. You know, sometimes it just takes a bit more time than you think on technical little changes that I've been making in my swing, so it's starting to come through now.
