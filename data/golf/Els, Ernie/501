 Q.  5-under, in the hunt.  I know you've got to be happy with that here?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I am.  You know, I shot a 5-under par today and kind of got me back in there.  The guys played really well this morning.  I a lot of things can happen over the weekend, and obviously I just want to try and have a chance by Sunday afternoon. 

Q.  You played well here in the past.  I know you you've come so close to winning and I know this is you probably really want. 
ERNIE ELS:   Whenever you play, you really want to try and play where you can compete.  I've done well here in the past, but one year I was leading during the final round and I kind of blew it with a 74.  You know, I've had my up-and-downs on the golf course and it's a great place, like I said yesterday.  Just like to have a chance on Sunday afternoon.

Q.  After the first round, do you feel this is the best you've played here in a while?
ERNIE ELS:   You know, I've shot better scores, but it's nice to hit the ball where you're actually looking and to make a couple of putts.  You know, I shot 2-under yesterday and that was not a bad start, but to get back into it, you know, I had to make something happen. 

Q.  Outside a major, why do players love coming here so much? 
ERNIE ELS:   Well, first of all, I think the golf course is really unique.  It's very narrow and really makes you work on your game when you play this golf course.  I think a lot of the players want to play it because it really fits your ability.  Obviously, the history they have got is pretty strong.
