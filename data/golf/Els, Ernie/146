 Q.   Thoughts on the round?  
ERNIE ELS:   Like I said yesterday, a lot of rust out there.   I actually played well.   The shots that I missed on 12, my second shot went through the bunker and almost an unplayable lie from a marginal shot, not a really poor shot, and I made bogey.   
15, again I missed the fairway just left, maybe two yards, and just very, very difficult.   Couldn't even get it out.   Made double there.   
Then 6, I was doing some bunker practise there for The Open.   
So, yeah, other than, that I thought it was nice, seven birdies, putting was okay.   So I've just got to keep that going.  
   
 Q.   A case of rust on the first few holes?   
ERNIE ELS:   A little bit.   
   
 Q.   Given your reputation, have you ever taken four to get out‑‑  
ERNIE ELS:   I was slightly embarrassed there.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever?   
ERNIE ELS:   I must have somewhere, some links golf course must have gotten me.   
The first lie was really horrendous.   It was lying down and I was just trying to hit it out to the left and the sand was heavy and I didn't hit it hard enough.   Then it was just a case of digging a grave there.   Hopefully that's out of the way and I can play some good golf.  
   
 Q.   What happened with Andy McFee‑‑  
ERNIE ELS:   No, some viewer called in that thought I did something which I didn't do‑‑  
   
 Q.   At that hole?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   In the bunker?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I don't know, maybe thought I was kicking and screaming‑‑ no penalty.   
   
 Q.   Was it reviewed?  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, he did review it.   
   
 Q.   Not the sort of thing‑‑  
ERNIE ELS:   That would have been a world record, next to the green, ten feet from the hole, add two and I make nine.   Seven is bad enough.
