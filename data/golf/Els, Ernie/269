   JOHN BUSH: Ernie, some comments on the round if you could, please. 
 ERNIE ELS: I played good. Just hit one off on 15. It's almost like a par 4. I made seven, giving three shots back. Other than that, I played solid. Had a lot of chances and played well. 

 Q. What did you do at 15? 
 ERNIE ELS: I hit it right. Just tried to get it out. I thought I did, but I didn't. Came up short of the second fairway. Then I hit a really good shot. Just chipped it short. Just a lot of errors. 

 Q. Considering that? 
 ERNIE ELS: Been through that, you know. One shot out of the lead or two shots out of the lead. I'm playing well. I still haven't really got a run going with birdies. Hopefully I can get a run going on tomorrow. 

 Q. You don't have to really go crazy low. You're only four back. 
 ERNIE ELS: If I get a run going, I can go low. I'm hitting it so well. The greens are on this golf course are great. They'll have tougher flags tomorrow, but it's probably in my favor. 
 You don't have to go crazy. Just got to play sensible then and make some putts. 

 Q. Do you think the experience here is in your favor? 
 ERNIE ELS: I think the leaders might try and play more conservative. As I say, you hit the right shots and you make the putts, you can make a move. Again, you don't have to go full barrel. You can get it done here with a 66 maybe tomorrow. 

 Q. Pretty straight rounds now, pretty consistent, score-wise? 
 ERNIE ELS: Today was consistent, you know. Hit it well. Played well. You know, just one hole sticks in my mind. It's going to burn me. It's probably cost me the tournament. Hopefully not. Hopefully, I can shoot a good one tomorrow.
