Q. Ernie, based on how you played today and what you saw, do you think it's going to be possible for the leaders to attack the golf course today?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, the flags are on Sunday positions, but there's no wind, very humid. So it means the greens are soft, very receptive. Yeah, I think it's going to be a nice shootout. I think the leader can shoot a 6, 7 under par round today if he plays properly.
Q. And speaking of playing properly, for the guy that wins, what is it going to take?
ERNIE ELS: You've got to get off to a decent start. 1st hole is a decent start, so you can get off with a par. 2nd hole, you've got to birdie. It's a very reachable par 5. 3 and 4, you want to get pars. 5 is a very birdieable hole. 6 is birdieable. Even 7. 8's a tough one. 10 is a tough one. 11 is tough.
Then you've got to just putt accordingly. There's some good flags out there, but it's very scorable.
