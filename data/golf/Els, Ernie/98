Q.   How aware were you of your position as you made your way around the golf course today?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I kind of knew I was right on the line.   I didn't know exactly what the limitations would be.   But there's so many players to play, and so many little twists and turns that could come.   But I really felt I needed to get to 14‑under to be safe.   I didn't quite do that.   Right now it feels like I've just missed the cut.

Q.   We know we're going to see you ‑‑ we talked to Nick Price a little bit earlier ‑‑ in a couple of weeks at the Presidents Cup.   How important is it for you to get one more week in here on the PGA Tour before the FedExCup playoffs?
ERNIE ELS:   Obviously that was the goal to week was to try to finish something like top‑20.   It was to play a decent week.   I've had a bit of a tough summer.   I really felt my game was coming around this week.   I missed a bunch of putts, but I made some good putts.
I'm looking forward to a nice break.   There's still a lot of golf to be played in Europe, So be it if I don't play in Chicago, and some International events.
