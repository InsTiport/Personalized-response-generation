  Q. Thoughts on the round?   
 ERNIE ELS: I must credit Ricci today. He kept my calm when I was swinging not the way I wanted to. We kept plugging away and eventually found -- I think sometimes you have to do stuff ugly. You have to get the ball around the golf course, and I think I did that the front nine, and then something clicked.   
 So hopefully I can get on and push on from this.   
  
  Q. You mentioned it's been a tough week for all of you players who played in the Tavistock, but for the caddies, as well, because it's literally a brand new course?  
 ERNIE ELS: Exactly. Ricci did do some work here after one of the rounds at Tavistock so he got a good sense. Some of the greens are a lot different than in the past, bunkering is a lot different. The rest of the course is really the same. All of the same doglegs. I've had good lines off the tees and done a good job there, so I feel comfortable on the golf course.  
  
  Q. And a really good feeling for you now, after your win a few weeks ago, to start here, keep it going, no flash in the pan; you're back?  
 ERNIE ELS: I feel good. As I say, I want to keep working at it. I don't want to feel like I'm totally back, you know, because I know I've still got a lot of work to do and got a couple of weeks to go, and I'm playing next week, as well. So I want to keep at it and keep practicing and see where it takes me.
