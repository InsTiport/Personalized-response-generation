Q.   Good day for you?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I mean, what was it, 2‑under?   2‑under was not a bad start.   Conditions were beautiful, but they were quite tough.   Greens were quite firm.   But good start. 

Q.   This is always a place you've enjoyed, and your game‑‑ you're playing well right now.   Is it fun to come to a place and enjoy playing the way you're playing?
ERNIE ELS:   Absolutely.   You've got to have a little bit of game here at Muirfield Village.   It's a great setup, especially when it's firm and fast like it is this year.   Today there wasn't too much wind, but you have to be on your game.   It tests your whole game, and the greens are unbelievable.   The greens are as pure as you're ever going to find it.   So it's really a pleasure to play here.

Q.   Kind of interesting, usually on the first day we're waterlogged and the place is slow, but to have it play the way Jack intended it to play has to be fun?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think he's been trying to get it like this for a while now.   I remember we played it a bit earlier back in the '90s.   It is a couple weeks later now, so that helps.   The perfect time of the year is obviously August‑September here.   But yeah, it looks like it's going to be firm and fast all week, so it should be a good test. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ERNIE ELS:   I'm sure.   You know, that's the way it is.   Cell phones are allowed out here, and most of the people know they need to put it on silent or not take pictures, but you're always going to have the minority not listening.   That's always going to be the case.
