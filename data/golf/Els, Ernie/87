 Q.   You certainly got it turned around there, two down, three to play.   Worked out to your advantage in the extra hole?  
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, exactly.   I think obviously Stephen was trying to close me out, and he just couldn't do that.   You know, he missed some putts.   I just, you know, made pars, you know.   And he made a couple of mistakes.   
I think the putt on 18 really bothered him, because he hit a good putt.   How that stayed out, I don't know.   
Going down 19, you know, obviously the tide turned on my side.   I feel for him because he definitely should have closed me out.
