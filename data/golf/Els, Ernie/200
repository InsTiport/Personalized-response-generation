  Q. Just obviously incredible putt there at the end, couldn't have missed -- been any closer. Just a couple of comments about the match.   
 ERNIE ELS: I had my chances. I played a lot better than I did yesterday. But, you know, I'm 20 percent with my putter. My putter is 20 percent. So that's what I've got to work on. It was good coming out and just getting through yesterday.
