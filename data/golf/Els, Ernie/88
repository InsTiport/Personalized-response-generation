Q.   Talk us through the last shot. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, that was really nice.   I thought I couldn't quite get to the green.   I had 270 from the fairway, and was just trying to get it in the bunker.   I saw the flag was in the front.   But I didn't expect it to go in, so that was a real nice bonus.

Q.   14 new clubs in the bag, Rory McIlroy did that and was much criticized; you must know what you're doing.   Tell us. 
ERNIE ELS:   I love the equipment (chuckles).   Just everything about Adams.   I haven't had a lot of time, my contract started the first of January, so that's maybe why I didn't play Durban and Abu Dhabi.   I felt like I wasn't quite going to be ready.   So I played in South Africa some social golf, and started really feeling comfortable.   And it really feels great.   I mean, I even feel like the driver is nice, I'm hitting it a little further I think.   I was hitting it with the young boys today.   The hybrids are nice, and you know, let get that putter warm, I think we're going to have a nice year.
So I'm really excited.   It's like a man with new toys.   I'm quite excited about the year.

Q.   You mentioned the driver.   I joined you on the 7th and you seemed to rip it 300 yards down the middle. 
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I've been struggling with the driver the last couple of years, so to find one that goes and I can move it right‑to‑left, at will, and I don't really have to work hard to move it right‑to‑left, I can hit the whole shot.   I don't want to say too much if it's a nice round with new equipment but I'm really looking forward to the next couple of rounds.
