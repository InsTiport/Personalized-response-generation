How do you feel about your golf going into tomorrow?
ERNIE ELS:  I'm playing okay.  Good to get in a low round here.  Everything feels okay.  My putting has improved.  I made some really soft bogeys, like on 16 with a little wedge, hit it left, made bogey there.  Another bogey was a 3 putt on 11.  That's really soft or silly or whatever you want to call it.

You know, I feel like I'm playing good.  I love this course.  The greens are really coming back.  They are really getting firm and fast.  If I can put it all together with the same rhythm here, I can shoot 65, and that's what I need tomorrow.

I don't know what the weather is going to do.  If it really blows, everything changes.  If it stays like this, the way I'm hitting it, the way I'm swinging, I'm going to shoot low and that's what I'm going to do and try to stay away from those silly little mistakes.

16, I'm looking at birdie and I walk away with a 5 ten yards from the hole.  That's my strong point with the wedge.  All in all, I'm not sad, I'm only two shots behind.
