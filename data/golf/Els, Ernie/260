   ERNIE ELS: I played well but I'm not making any putts. 68 is really a good score but 72 is way off the pace. 
 I finished 3rd in the open here (Carnoustie) a couple of years ago and shot 65, but at the moment I'm not putting well and I'm not hitting it well. But if you don't putt well you're not going to score well. 
 What I would say, is that the course is in unbelievable shape. I've got to get going, got to get under par and make some birdies. 72 is not good enough but I'm not totally out of it, I've just got to make up some ground. I've got to get hot, make some putts and play some proper golf.
