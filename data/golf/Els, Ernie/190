  Q. 68 today, happy with that?   
 ERNIE ELS: Yes, I've got to be happy with that. It was blowing quite a bit on the front nine and the back nine was a bit more scoring opportunity, but I didn't take advantage of that. But 4-under is a good start.  
  
  Q. You came back in 32.   
 ERNIE ELS: I came -- I went out in 33 and yeah, I guess I shot 1-under on the back nine, so you know, 68, and a little bit behind, but got to be happy with that. I kept it out of a lot of trouble today.  
  
  Q. How challenging is the course?  
 ERNIE ELS: You know, when it's not blowing, you can really score. But as I say, our front nine, it was really blowing. So I was happy with, that to be under par. It's such a great design, they have done a great job. If you keep the ball in play, you can really get yourself to go after the course.   
 But the greens are quite tricky. They look very flat but they have got some movement.  
  
  Q. A nice addition to the championship circuit?  
 ERNIE ELS: I think so, yeah. Loch Lomond is obviously a lot of people's favourite course, but this is more links-type play that we have here. Obviously going into The Open Championship, playing in Scotland, The Scottish Open, we all feel it should probably be played on a links and I think this is a great new links golf course.   
 So it's a nice change.   
  
  Q. How do you fancy a hat track of Scottish Open wins?  
 ERNIE ELS: Love to. I love playing up here in Scotland. I've had a pretty tough year so I'd love to start changing it around.
