  Q.  You must feel really good about battling back the way you did and finishing it off?   
 ERNIE ELS:  I was in deep trouble, the front nine.  Playing Lucas, I knew it was going to be tough, the four-ball matches.  He made a ton of birdies, and I got off to a bit of a slow start and somehow battled my way back into the game, and you know, made some birdies on the back nine.  I hit some beautiful shots and that helped.   
  
  Q.  As the day wore on, were you aware of what was going on around the course with the other matches?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Absolutely.  As we said yesterday, we needed to get off to a good start.  Rory in front of me, I was watching him.  He looked like he had it, not in the bag, but he was in control, and Scott made a beautiful putt on 16 and 17.   
 But yeah, you know, you are aware, and we need to get everything out of this match, we need a miracle in the bag and hopefully it can still happen.
