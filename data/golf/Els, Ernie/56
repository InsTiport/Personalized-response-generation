 Q.  Ernie didn't even think he would tee it up today.  Yesterday you pulled out of the Pro-Am.  You actually went to the hospital.  You thought you had a kidney stone.   What was the diagnose?  ERNIE ELS: Nothing.  I got an L-10.  That's my normal problem.  And normally the pain shoots into my left side and the pain was kind of on the -- on my back and went to the right.  I thought maybe it's a kidney stone.  Pretty sure.  I guess I'm just a wuss. They say kidney stones are really, really painful.  Luckily nothing wrong.  Tom in the fitness trailer is working on me.  A muscle spasm.   Q.  You swung beautifully out there today.  You shoot a 64.  That's the lowest number you shot on the PGA TOUR this season.  What does a round like this do for your confidence?  ERNIE ELS: Yeah.  I haven't played with a lot of confidence.  You can't play this game without, I think, confidence.  I didn't have the most perfect warmup into the week.  I felt good this morning and my putter felt great.  I kind of like the course.  Just a little bit of patience and experience.  Played quite nicely.   Q.  Congratulations on a great day.  Be aware of the injured golfer.  ERNIE ELS: Thank you
