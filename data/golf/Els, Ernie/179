  Q. How bad do you feel?  
     ERNIE ELS: I know. A little disappointed because I feel I played good enough to maybe be in the playoff. I thought I hit some good putts. 9 was, I thought, quite a crucial one. I lipped out and then I missed a short one on 10.   
     So I think we've made some progress, but came up short, but it was a good week all in all and I'm glad Dr. (Inaudible) told me to come because definitely the wheels are starting to turn now, and I had a great time. The fans are great. The course is in great shape. So I can't complain. I'm just a little disappointed coming up short.  
  
  Q. And you think the putting you think was why you came up short?  
     ERNIE ELS: Yeah. I mean don't get me wrong. I made a lot of good putts throughout the week, but I just feel if I want to get to that next level I want to get to, I gotta start making those putts, you know, when I need it. And I did that when I won. So I know what to do.  
  
  Q. At what point did you sense that you were kind of out of it?  
     ERNIE ELS: No, no. I always thought -- even on 17 I thought, you know, I still had a chance, but then Briny chipped it in for eagle, and that was that. And I thought maybe if I could sneak an eagle there, birdie at the 18th, maybe I could get into a playoff. But you kind of never give up until the end. But when he made eagle, it was done.  
  
  Q. Right. You're pretty good friends with him, huh?  
     ERNIE ELS: Yeah. I'm really rooting for him. You know, he's such a good guy. We play and practice together down at his club. You know, he's a star guy. He's worked his ass off to be here. He's had some putting problems, so I'd like to see him.  
  
  Q. What would it mean to him, do you think, to make this playoff?  
     ERNIE ELS: It'll make his career.
