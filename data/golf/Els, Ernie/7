ERNIE ELS: Joaquin Niemann.

TIGER WOODS: Matt Kuchar, Tony Finau.   
JOHN MUTCH: United States Team has selected Matt Kuchar and Tony Finau.   
The United States Team will have the honor on the first tee. The weather forecast is mostly cloudy, ten percent chance of rain, very cool and southwest winds ten to 20. The first tee time will depend on when this last match ends, as Adam Scott is in the last match. So we will announce the tee times when this match ends.   
 Q.  How long will they have?  
JOHN MUTCH: They will have more like 35 to 40 minutes at the conclusion of the match. They will have time to finish the match and get to the cabin and then we'll announce.   
Thank you, gentlemen.   
CHRIS REIMER: Captains remain for a couple quick comments, and then we'll get you back out on the golf course.   
 Q.  As someone who has --  
TIGER WOODS: Yeah.   
 Q.  As someone who it playing well this week on a team that's trailing by at least four points, why aren't you playing this afternoon?  
TIGER WOODS: You have to do what's best for the team, and I'm getting ready for the singles tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did your assistants agree with your decision, or did they try to talk you out of it?  
TIGER WOODS: Well, I tried to talk myself out of it, too. But you know, it is what it is, and we're going to go out there and try and get some points today and be ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Could you describe the strategy of playing Adam in the first group while he's still out on the course?  
ERNIE ELS: It's our strategy. The way they put their pairing out, they felt that that was the best pairing to play the American side.   
I just spoke with the official and he said he's going to have enough time to get ready for this afternoon, so he can have lunch and relax for 40 minutes.   
 Q.  Tiger, are you injured? I'm sorry, are you injured?  
TIGER WOODS: No.   
 Q.  It's always easy to, you know, in retrospect, but Patrick and Webb, weren't able to get any points for you, can you just speak to their difficulties and any second-guessing of yourself at this point?  
TIGER WOODS: No, they just ran into some guys that played well, made crucial putts at certain times.   
Today, they just didn't play well, and that happens. But the last two matches, it just comes to a crucial putt here and there.   
 Q.  Adam Hadwin, have you spoken to him? How is he feeling, and was he prepared to play this afternoon?  
ERNIE ELS: Yes, I spoke to him. He picked up a little bit of a bug last night. But you know, wasn't in the lineup this afternoon, so he's going to get ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're concentrating on your team, but now that you see these pairings, are you surprised that Tiger is not playing this afternoon?  
ERNIE ELS: Yes, especially the way he's been playing with J.T. But J.T. has been a rock-solid on their side, and looks like he's teaming well with Rickie.   
But yeah, I thought Tiger would play this afternoon.   
CHRIS REIMER: Thank you, captains, good luck this afternoon.
