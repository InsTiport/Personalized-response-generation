 Q.   Closing 67 for the tournament, 8‑under, how do you reflect on your week?  
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I finally found something, obviously I played really nice the back nine.   I actually started playing a little bit better yesterday late afternoon, but found something in my swing and my putting and so forth, so it was nice to finally start playing some decent golf.   
   
 Q.   Who better than you to tell us how the back nine is playing, what the leaders are facing, what sort of score would be acceptable if you're heading into the back nine?  
ERNIE ELS:   It's going to test you, but I think if you're on your game, you should past the test.   If you're going to miss some shots, you're going to get penalised.   The tee shots, the bunkers are so deep now, they are almost links‑type bunkers, so it's going to be at least a shot, half‑a‑shot penalty.   You're going to have to check your distance control.   
There's some good flags coming in.   But if you play proper golf; the tee is up on 17, there's a birdie, eagle chance there and 18 is up.   So if you play good golf, you should be fine.   But for the guy that's doubting himself, it's a test.   
   
 Q.   The damage I suppose was on the front nine yesterday?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I was nowhere yesterday for some reason.   I thought I played okay Friday and then yesterday was just mentally, physically, everything wasn't there, so, I don't know.   
Today was a little bit better, and it's unfortunate that it came on Sunday but at least it did come on Sunday and not Monday.   So at least we can get some good form going into these next couple of weeks.  
   
 Q.   Going forward, what are the plans leading up to Merion and thoughts on Merion, as well?   
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I needed something like this, didn't I.   This is a test now.
