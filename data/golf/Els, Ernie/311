 Q.  A good finish? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yes thanks. Just that one hole yesterday and it could have been a little bit different but it was a tough day for me today, a tough day for scoring and I find it very difficult scoring on this golf course. There was a little bit of a breeze today so it was difficult into the northwesterly. 

 Q.  Is it difficult being a bit behind that you want to push on here, but can't? 
 ERNIE ELS: It is difficult, you're right. I was three over par and just trying to get it back to even today and give me a chance and then I bogey my very first hole, a par five, so I'm four over and right onto the back foot. But I started hitting the ball really well midway through my round. I missed a couple of fairways like the 13th which cost me a bogey but I really played well coming in. I was just trying to get it back to even, I'm one over now so I'll just try and get something going in the morning. If I can somehow get to something like six under, I might have a chance on Sunday. But it is such a great golf course because if you are off here, you are going to find out about it. I like that kind of golf. I haven't been too patient so far but hopefully I can be a bit more patient over the weekend. 

 Q.  Both days you have got off to a poor start, maybe a good start is the key tomorrow to get some momentum? 
 ERNIE ELS: Yes true, but I don't want to push too hard. Today I was okay but tomorrow I want to play on a better level.
