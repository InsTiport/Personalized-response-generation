ERNIE ELS: Yes, it was really frustrating this week. I felt I played really well at times and I just made some very silly errors and missed a lot of putts all week. But I feel that it's been a pretty decent week -- it's just a pity I didn't put it together yesterday on the back nine -- that kind of put me out of it. I got it going today a little bit but just didn't make enough putts again.
Q. You made a good run of birdies on the back nine, you must have felt you had it back again and that must make you feel good about the weeks ahead?
ERNIE ELS: Yes, it does. I've got a bit of work left. I've got to work on my iron play because it wasn't that sharp. I think I stayed focussed all week even though I was really frustrated at times but it's not a bad week if it's an off week if you want to put it like that. I think the golf course is in great shape and this is a great event.
Q. And I have to mention it one last time. As things stand, you beat the boy, Tiger Woods.
ERNIE ELS: Well, again, you're making a bit of a joke of it now but it's fine. I had a good week as I say. It was frustrating that I just didn't get it all together.
