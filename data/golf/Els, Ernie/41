Q. (Inaudible)  any flashes from today?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, exactly.  When I hit it well, it was almost perfect, and then I missed four shots and it cost me basically five shots.  You know, four shots.  So second shot on 11 and tee shot on 6 and the third shot on 16 and so forth.  But there is some good stuff there.  Putted nicely, and looking forward to a good weekend.
Q. What are you going to work on specifically or are you generally happy?
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, just a couple of mistakes, couple of mental errors on the shots.  Got to stay aggressive on the shots.  You can't just come out of the shots.  So I've just got to stay aggressive and see where it goes.
Q. (Inaudible).
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, exactly, but today was benign.  I mean, we had it perfect.  A bit of breeze going out.  Coming back, there was just a tiny little bit of air.  But the most perfect conditions you could ever ask for.  So Phil took beautiful advantage of that.  As I said, if it wasn't for those four missed shots, I would have had a pretty decent score.  So let's see what the weekend does weather-wise and see what happens.  I'm not out of it, but I've got to get going.
Q. You've seen a lot of really good rounds (inaudible).
ERNIE ELS: You know, it was beautiful.  He managed himself so beautifully, you know.  He made a lot of nice putts.  But the way he played out there today, it's amazing he's only won one Open Championship.  It was beautifully played.  He was in total control of the ball.  He didn't miss too many, and just managed himself so well.  Just a pity he didn't -- I don't know how that putt didn't go in on 18.  That would have been something.  That was a great, great round.
