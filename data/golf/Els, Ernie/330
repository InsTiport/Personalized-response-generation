  Q.  How about the finish?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, that's my fourth eagle for the week.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever done that?   
 ERNIE ELS:  In recent times, no.  I don't think I've done that.  Those 3s have kept me in it, I guess.   
  
  Q.  Just changed your whole outlook, you were trudging through those last three holes and all of a sudden a jolt like that can really get you going?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I didn't really miss a shot on the back nine.  I hit the ball where you're supposed to hit it.  I'm just either misreading the putts or they are just not going in.  That's when it's frustrating.   
 But it was really nice to finish that way, and gives me half a chance for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  You've talked the last few days about being close; do you feel like you're really close now?   
 ERNIE ELS:  I'm playing well.  I just had it going a little bit there the front nine, and then just around the turn, I didn't make too many.  I mustn't get too far ahead of myself or down on myself, I'm playing okay.
