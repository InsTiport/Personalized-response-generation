 Q.   Now that we know you're playing with him, anything you know about him?   Any kind of‑‑  
ERNIE ELS:   Well, we are managed by the same agent.   So I've seen him around and met him in South Africa at Sun City, when we played the Million Dollar.   I haven't played with him.   I hear he's been a great amateur.   He's been kind of a star rising on the European Tour and in France.   And I think he won the British Amateur or he was close to the British Amateur, so he knows how to play match play, obviously.   Looking forward to it.   Another young guy.
