 Q. Heard you weren't too well yesterday, how are you feeling today?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I don't know. I left the house, my wife and daughter, they are back in Florida and they have got some kind of a stomach bug, and I think I just got a little bit of a whiff of it. Not as bad as they have had it and I was just a little bit down yesterday, but I feel a lot better today. 
 So, ready to play. 

 Q. How do you feel about an opening round of 2-under par?
 ERNIE ELS: I left a lot of shots out there. I felt I played quite nicely. You know, missed quite a few short putts. But felt like I played very solidly on a beautiful day. So I felt like today was probably a good day to go low. But I'm playing nicely. 

 Q. You're out there with Darren Clarke, Chubby, your manager, and your father; lots of banter flying about?
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, we were a little bit quiet. I think the first round, you all kind of just want to settle in and try and enjoy it. 
 Yeah, it was lovely to play with Chubby. I've been with Chubby for quite a few years now, and Darren, I've known for most of my professional career, and obviously my dad. We had a nice time out there. We had it going there for a little while, but I think a little disappointed they didn't quite take it to the house. 

 Q. He is what the challenge of playing three courses over three days? 
 ERNIE ELS: Well, the weather can change. Today we had a breeze we've never played before out of the south. So it all depends on the weather conditions but three really great golf courses in their own right. This is the newer one of the lot, and maybe like 200 years younger than St. Andrews, but it's a good course. St. Andrews is great. They are just three great golf courses.

 Q. If I asked you to pick a favourite, which one would it be? 
 ERNIE ELS: Well, it's tough -- well, actually it's not tough. St. Andrews.
