Q.   Ernie, first competitive round here, 66.   A great debut.
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah.   It was a tough day, you know, you had to be on your game.   You know, the front-9 is not that easy, especially the first five or so holes.   Good start and just kept, kept at it.   Felt like I played solidly, you know.   So, good start, you know.

Q.   Do you think it could have been a lot better because I know you missed two putts like on 12 and 13 by like six inches, maybe.
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah.   I mean, you know, you always look at some putts you missed, you know.   I missed, you know, one on my 2nd hole from about eight feet and one on 8 from about 12 feet. 
So, I mean I missed a couple but I mean listen, I'm just happy, you know, to shoot anything under 70, I would have taken, you know, this afternoon.   Conditions weren't that easy.   Scoring is good but there's a lot of, lot of hazards out there, you know, so you got to play with your head a little bit.

Q.   Was the par save on 15 a key part of the round?
ERNIE ELS:   I think so.   I think that was a big part, you know.   I came up short on my second shot, quite surprising but, yeah, that was a big putt.   Those are the kinds of things I haven't been doing and, you know, it's nice to make those and to make that putt on 18 even was a good feeling.
