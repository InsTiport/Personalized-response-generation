  Q. If someone looked at the card in this format and saw so many birdies, do you think that's the key?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I was a little off today. The golf course played a little different also today. It was a little firmer in spots.   
 I had a couple of, I would say, unlucky bounces, but, yeah, I didn't make the birdies like I did the first couple of days.   
 And Stewart didn't make any mistakes either. So I couldn't play off that either.  
  
  Q. As far as where your game is right now, how close are you to where you want to be?  
 ERNIE ELS: I'm very close. I'm really happy with my progress, especially this week.   
 I just want to keep getting better. We have got another quite a few weeks left before the first Major, obviously. But I would love to get, keep going in this direction.   
 Putting was a little better. Really striking the ball nicely, so, yeah, we're getting there.
