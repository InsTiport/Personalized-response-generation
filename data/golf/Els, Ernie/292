 Q. Fun to watch you today because you hit some great iron shots. You have to be pleased about your swinging. 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I am. I just unfortunately -- I don't quite remember putting a round like that before. I had so many opportunities. You know, it seems like when I missed the little one on I think No. 6 for par, that kind of got all the demons back, so to speak, and I missed a lot of short ones.
 But yeah, I have to take the positive out of it. I hit a lot of really good iron shots, so the work with Butch is starting to work now.

 Q. We saw that third shot at 16 out of the rough. That was pretty sweet. 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I drove it right there and then laid up a bit left. I had a very good lie in the rough. But to hit a wedge from there to the flag was, four, five feet, I was pleased with that.

 Q. You've got to be happy with where you are. 
 ERNIE ELS: Exactly. If I can get that putter going and keep hitting good shots, you know, this golf course is going to give you some and going to take a lot away. Just keep shooting in the 60s this week and I think we'll go close.
