 Q.  Reaction? 
 ERNIE ELS:  A little disappointing. 

 Q.  What were you thinking on the last? 
 ERNIE ELS:  What happened before that, I mean, I played really good the front nine.  I finished 2-under on the front nine but it could have been 4- or 5-under. 
 And then that unfortunate break on 10, hit it into the bank and I thought it wasn't plugged but it was plugged because I chipped it at least with a topspin and I made five. 
 11, hit it just through the green and got it out to about four feet and missed that.  That was a big miss.  Then I missed 12, my 5-iron to the right.  I hit a great shot from there and missed another 5-footer.  
 So those two putts really cost me the tournament in the end, yeah, because I played really solid coming in. 
 The second shot on 18, it was right where I had it, but I could see the gust got it in the air and it didn't have much of a chance in the end there.  But was really right at it.  You know, that's it. 

 Q.  3-wood on the last? 
 ERNIE ELS:  I had 240 to the last.  I mean, it's very in my range.  But the gust, as I said, there's a gust that came up and caught it.
