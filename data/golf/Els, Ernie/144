  ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I shot 70.   Around the back nine I really could have been a little better.   I think it was all the rain.   And it didn't just quite roll the same for me as yesterday.   The surfaces were a little bit different.   But in any case, I missed quite a few putts but I played nicely.

Q.   How good were the scoring conditions today?
ERNIE ELS:   It was perfect.   The last two rounds was just absolutely perfect.   You can't ask for better weather.   So I guess I was also trying to push, trying to get some birdies going.   And especially early on my second nine, three‑putted 10 and I missed a short birdie on 11.   If I made those two, maybe it could have been a little different.   But it was absolutely perfect out there today.

Q.   Have you seen what Scott and Snedeker have done so far?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I think obviously they're making putts.   I think there's‑‑ myself, especially, if I could have made a couple more putts maybe I could be near there.   But that's great playing.

Q.   It looked like you were really putting well, especially on the front nine.   Just some bad luck on the greens?
ERNIE ELS:   Well, I played better on the back nine.   The front nine I made bogey on 6 which I chopped it around there a little bit and made a bad bogey on 5.   So I wasn't too pleased with my front nine.   The back nine I hit it really nice.   I could have made some birdies if I could have been a little closer.
