 Q.  With four-time major champion, Ernie Els.  In years past here at TPC Summerlin, you've given up a lot of ground.  Today you're making up a lot of ground.  Does it almost feel like a 67, 68 with that number?  
ERNIE ELS: I'm glad I played well today.  I missed quite a few putts out there, but putting well.  I knew it was going to be difficult.  My position on day (indiscernible) so I was trying to get to 6-, 7-under par.  But I played good.  But in answer to your question, yeah (indiscernible).
