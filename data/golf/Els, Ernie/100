 Q.   Ernie, in the morning, it looked like conditions were optimum.   Even though the wind didn't kick up, what made it so difficult on this golf course in the afternoon?   
ERNIE ELS:   It's Poa Annua, you know?   The course is in unbelievable shape, but the Poa Annua will dry up a little bit in the afternoon, and the ball gets a little more fiery, and subsequently you get the ball close to the hole, it gets a bit more difficult.   With a little bit of breeze, I took some long clubs here and there, but there's not a lot to complain about.   The course is in unbelievable shape.  
   
 Q.   Overall, for you, the birdies on 14 and 16 and also on 18 to get you back in this, what was the importance of that closing stretch?   
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, got a little out of hand there on the back nine.   I bogeyed 11 from the middle of the fairway and then bogeyed 12 and then birdied 13.   So I was 2â€‘over with four or five to go.   So I had a good finish to get myself into red numbers.   
Hopefully that sets me up for a better round tomorrow.   I feel like I'm hitting it nicely.   I got a little cob webs out of my system over the two days, so hopefully tomorrow we can play all systems go.
