 Q. Never down in the match. 
 ERNIE ELS: We made a lot of birdies, no bogeys. Both of us were in the game all the way. It was good. 

 Q. Nice to come back after this morning to win? 
 MIKE WEIR: It was important I got off to a good start, and I just rode Ernie the whole way. I didn't do much, but Ernie did fantastic. 
 We played great. I got off to a nice start, got us going and got a couple up and I rode the big fella and he made that bunker shot, and made some beautiful putts after that. 

 Q. What was it like playing with Ernie, is he the captain of this team? 
 MIKE WEIR: He makes it look easy, kind of like Freddie Couples, both those two guys when you watch them swing, it bleeds into your own game just watching those guys.
