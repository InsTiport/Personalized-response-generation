  Q.  Thoughts on your round today?   
 ERNIE ELS:  It was a solid start.  You know, on the front nine, unfortunately I hit a terrible tee shot on 6, I hit it left and in the water and made a double-bogey there.   
 But you know I kept the ball in play for most of the day and made some good putts here and there.  All in all, 1-under par, the golf course played quite tough.  So got to be happy with it.   
  
  Q.  Made a little change in the putting, I hear?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I've been tinkering with Scottie and the Odyssey putter.  Just before I went out, I went to the Odyssey.  Yeah, the ball just comes off a little slower off that putter blade.   
 And I putted well today.  I made some -- I made a couple three or four over 30 feet, which I don't normally make, so that was nice.   
  
  Q.  Tee-to-green how far are you from being at your best?   
 ERNIE ELS:  I'm very close.  These new clubs, I'm really hitting it to the numbers.  I missed a couple of shot today, like on 6, the tee shot and 16 just to the right, found the left rough which cost me a shot.  A couple of shots, but I've got to be happy.  Feeling excited about it.   
  
  Q.  Is that rough as tough as people make it out to be?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, you can get lucky, if you have a half a lie, you can probably hit it 150, 160 yards.  But the lie I had on 16, you're just trying to get it out 120 yards.  So it can get really difficult.   
 The golf course will take it's toll as the week goes on I'm sure.   
  
  Q.  After day one, your game plan now for the rest of the week?   
 ERNIE ELS:  I've got a tee time tomorrow morning, soft confidence, hopefully it doesn't rain too much tonight.  I've got to get going.  I've got to shoot something like the guys did this morning, 65.
