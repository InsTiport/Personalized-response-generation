  Q.  A really thrilling day for you, did you enjoy yourself out there?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I did.  The front nine I was a little scrappy again.  The two birdies on 7 and 8 really helped me out, and a really good par save on 9.   
 Then the back nine I really paid nicely.  I hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens.  Yeah, it was really enjoyable.   
  
  Q.  Ewen in commentary when he was watching the back nine said the great players know what it's about on the back nine on Sunday even when they are behind and obviously you are one of them.  Is that something you dig deep for in these situations?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, you can't ever give up.  You've always got to -- golf is a crazy game as we know.  You might chip it in, you might hole a second shot.  Something crazy might happen so you always try to keep your options open and keep trying to give yourself a chance for a birdie or an eagle.   
 That's what I try to do.  The 14th hole, I can't believe that putt missed.  I feel like I can still make a playoff or something.   
  
  Q.  Have you had a look through the leaderboard to assess the possibilities?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Well, Retief's back on 12, Nick O'Hern 13, you would think -- I always thought 14 was the number I needed to get to, so hopefully I'm wrong.  As I say, hopefully I can get into a playoff.
