   ERNIE ELS:  It is definitely warm but we play in hot conditions a lot of the time. I think this is a bit extreme. I don't think it's affecting the guys too much.   
 It's nice to see John (Daly) up there. It's amazing. This golf course doesn't suit his golf game at all and it's nice to see him up there at the top of the leaderboard. Amazing. Anything under par is a good score.   
 The set up is perfect. If you miss a shot in the rough you have a 50 per cent chance to get a par and in the same breath there isa chance to make a double. The ball stops on the green and if you play proper golf you can score well.
