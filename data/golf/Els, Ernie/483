Q.   Talk about your round today.

ERNIE ELS:   I had a bit of a slow start.  I was struggling a little bit with my game.  But the back nine I started getting my swing together.  I made a couple of good putts, 2-putted on 13 for birdie to get back to even. 

Made a good one on 14, about 20 feet. 

15 I made about a similar putt. 

16, 18, I missed shortish putts.  But I got to be happy with my round, after the way I played.


Q.   Is there any different strategy when you go into a third or fourth round and there's so many people on the leaderboard like this, as opposed to maybe chasing two to three people?  Is there a different strategy when it's jam packed at the top?

ERNIE ELS:   On this golf course you got to be very, very patient.  They're putting the flags so tough.  That's why the scores are together.  I don't think you're going to get a run away guy, just because of the golf course being so tough.  No, you just got to keep playing, keep plugging, and hopefully you're there at the end of the day.
