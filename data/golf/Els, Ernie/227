 Q. Bogey-free till the 18th hole and the 18th got up and bit you. How do you feel? 
 ERNIE ELS: Not very good right now. 

 Q. What went through your mind over that second shot? Did you feel any pressure that you must for it; that I must go for it, I've designed this thing?
 ERNIE ELS: The design -- I've been hitting the ball so good this morning, and it was a perfect little 5-wood. I just dragged it. I had so much room to the right but I didn't make a good swing.

 Q. First competitive over the course that you've remodelled. How do you think overall it played?
 ERNIE ELS: I think it played very fair, very well, probably better than I thought. I really thought the course was in great shape. I think the way it was set up was very good, too. I think it gave people an opportunity to make birdies if you played it properly. 
 And that's really what we had in mind. We were hoping that the tournament committee would set it up the way we really wanted the shot values to play, and I think they have done that. They did a great job and I think you'll see a lot of good scoring today. It's perfect weather. The greens came out beautiful.
 So I'm really pleased. Obviously right now a little disappointed. Just finished 18. But I think as a whole, the course played great.

 Q. What sort of reaction have you had from the other players?
 ERNIE ELS: I haven't spoken to too many but what I've heard has been pretty positive. Obviously some of the players, you know, they need to say something, something negative, but I think overall, I think the players like it. 
 You know, they understand what we are trying to get in mind here, trying to toughen it up, give them a bit more room off the tee shots and really make them play second shots and iron play. You know, really get the shot-makers to have a good time, and I think the players understand that.
