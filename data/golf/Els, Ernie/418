ERNIE ELS:  Could have been 60 today, I promise you.  I don't know, man, got to get my rhythm.
Q.  Do you feel you could have putted better left-handed?
ERNIE ELS:  I don't know what it is.  Just don't have it at the moment on the greens.
Q.  Looks like it came and went for you.  The last putt on 13?
ERNIE ELS:  That was the only one.  That was the only one over five feet I made.

So, you know, I'm going to sound like the old tart, professional tart that I am; could have been so much better.  But I'm happy with the way I'm hitting it.  I've just got to find a way.  I know these greens well.  I just have to find my rhythm.
Q.  So given the way that you hit it close --
ERNIE ELS:  I've got a chance.  If it stays like this, maybe blows even harder and if I can bring my game up, I'll have a chance.
