 Q. Ernie, let's talk about today. Tough conditions, and I thought you played really well out there.
 ERNIE ELS: Thank you. Yeah. I really started feeling it the last four or five holes, started hitting some better shots. I kind of kept it together, you know, in the morning stuff, just a little rainy, a little cold, and the ball wasn't going anywhere. So it was nice to just kind of hang around and I had a nice finish.

 Q. Putting stroke looks good. Do you like that belly putter?
 ERNIE ELS: I'm starting to like it, yeah. I've really been working hard on it, obviously. I'm just trying to get comfortable. 
 I'm tall like you, so getting into the same position every time has been difficult, and I'm starting to feel it now.

 Q. How long does it take to get used to that thing, because I fooled around with it last week, and it's tough.
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah. I didn't think it was going to take this long. I really thought I had it after the first couple of weeks, but obviously under tournament play, you know, you kind of move around in position, as I say, and you gotta keep it the same all the time and you gotta be really patient with it. So it's starting to work.
