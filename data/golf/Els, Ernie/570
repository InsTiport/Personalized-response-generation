 Q. How big of a disappointment was this for you today to let this one get away?
 
 ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I played terrible. I don't know what to say. Played so well the whole
week, and I had a pretty decent front nine, and then I don't know what happened. I just
lost it, didn't make the shots when I needed to. And you know, just what can you do? 
 
Q. Just one of those things? 
 
 ERNIE ELS: Mental, physical, I don't know. You know, I don't know what it was. I think
the bogey on 8 kind of got to me a little bit, because I got it up-and-down on 7; I made
birdie on 6. And then 8 was just right of the green. I chipped it up there, bad chip, and
missed the putt. And I think that got to me a little bit, and I started looking at the
scoreboards.  
 
Q. You used the new putter this week or last week?
 
 ERNIE ELS: This week. It's the same model I've always used, Ping; and it's got a little
different feel to it, but I cannot give the blame to the putter. I couldn't make the
putts. What can you do? I just had a bad day.
