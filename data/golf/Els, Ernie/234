   ERNIE ELS: I shot 68, so happy to get done. It was a long day today. We started this morning at 7.00 and it's now 6.00, so long day.   
  
  Q. What's your plan tomorrow, tomorrow's plan?   
 ERNIE ELS: I don't know, it all depends on the weather. If there's lots of wind, you have to have a different game plan. If there's no wind like now, you can really attack the golf course, so all depends on the weather.   
  
  Q. How is your condition -- how is the condition of the greens?   
 ERNIE ELS: I think the whole golf course is good. It's very early in the season, so the greens are quite slow, but the surface is very good, so -- but I mean, I can't complain about the course. The course is in very good shape.   
 Good start today. Could have been a little better, but not a bad start, so looking forward to it.
