ERNIE ELS:  I never made a bogey, hit the ball solid, very solid.  Missed four putts inside
Q.  That's the story of the day.  A day of low scoring, looking at what Goosen has done and Richard Green.
ERNIE ELS:  If I made those putts, I would have shot 64 myself.  Struggling with the putter at the moment.
Q.  Thought to changing putters?
ERNIE ELS:  Maybe.
Q.  You haven't done any great damage at this stage, still in the ballpark, isn't it?
ERNIE ELS:  Not at all, yeah.
