  Q.  Just a bit of everything on the card today, was it, Ernie?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Well, I played well. Had two double bogeys on easy holes. If it wasn't for that I would have had a pretty good round. On 16 (he started from 10), I pulled my tee shot left into the bunker and tried to get cute and hit a tree and made double bogey there. 16 is a birdie hole. On the seventh, hit a five iron right and had a bad lie and made double. A couple of mistakes here and there but I felt like I played well. I hit it nice and drove it nice. Made six birdies.   
  
  Q.  Leader is in at 7-under, are you able to come back?   
 ERNIE ELS:  There is a lot of golf left. Obviously this is not the way you want to start but I made six birdies today and had my troubles. I like to start playing good over the weekend. Obviously need a really low one somewhere along the lines. Hopefully we can do it tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  How do you find the course?   
 ERNIE ELS:  Course is in really good shape. If you hit it on the fairways, you'll have a good time. The rough is really up and it can be difficult.
