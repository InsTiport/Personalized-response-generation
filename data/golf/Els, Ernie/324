 Q.  Overall, what do you think was the difference? 
 ERNIE ELS:  Well, we've got to work on our pairings.  We've got to figure out how to play foursomes. 
 You know, unfortunately we only got a half a point out of 11, and that's why we're six points behind right now, seven points behind.  I think the guys showed really a lot of heart today and came out strong and hopefully we can at least win this session in the singles.
