  Q. Tough day out there?  
 ERNIE ELS: Well I played some good stuff and some bad stuff.  
  
  Q. Was it the rust you were talking about in the early stages?  
 ERNIE ELS: I hit a bad shot on the fourth and made double there and then bogeyed the fifth as well and then I played really well all the way round and I lipped out for a birdie on the 15th to get me to two under and I pulled my tee shot left on the 16th and didn't get up and down so I made five there and I hit a bad shot on the 18th. So I probably could have finished two under but it was tough.  
  
  Q. Does that give you some encouragement in the fact that you could have shot two under?  
 ERNIE ELS: Not right now. I shouldn't even play tomorrow the way I am feeling right now.  
  
  Q. How is that new young caddie shaping up, does he have a future?  
 ERNIE ELS: Yes he's good!
