Q.   Your second shot on No. 5 into like 16 inches.
ERNIE ELS:   That one?   That was like a pitching wedge.

Q.   Okay.
ERNIE ELS:   Only frickin' birdie I made all day.   Glad you saw that.

Q.   You were putting yourself in position to.
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I think the one that I really got a little angry with is the parâ€‘5 up the hill there.   My chip shot, I mean, was just a little bit soft and didn't go down the hill and I made five.
If I think if I made four there it could have been a little bit different momentum.   I felt I needed to get something going.   When that didn't go I was a little angry at myself.   But I gave myself good opportunities, and then I missed some greens again.
All in all, I'll take 71.   It's not the best start, but it's not the worst start.   I can get into the 60s the next three rounds.
