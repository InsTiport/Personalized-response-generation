ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, thanks.   I just said to the guys, I think that our final four holes kind of saved my tournament a little bit.
I eagled 15, chipping in from the top, and then birdieing 18.   So, you know, 1‑over, I don't think it's going to be too awful at the end of the day.   I think conditions are getting tougher.


ERNIE ELS:   I hope so.   I haven't quite hit my stride, but I'm here for the weekend, which is good.
I haven't had a great year, so it's nice to try and find it at Augusta.   It's a tough place to do that.   It's coming around.
I felt conditions kept changing this morning, so I really think that that is going to make it more difficult.


ERNIE ELS:   We are now, I guess.   Yeah.   We have both had many, many years out here and it's kind of a blessing just to be able to play for the next four years.
So I'll keep enjoying it and who knows, you know, I might have a hot weekend and see what happens.   But, yeah, we are getting on to the other side of the road now.


ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it's going to ‑‑ you'll see some fun and games there today.   They have the flag on a more difficult spot, the wind's into us, and then guys are going to, the aggressive guys are still going to try and go for it.   But I think that you're going to see some numbers there today, because the wind's gusting into us.   So it's a difficult second shot.


ERNIE ELS:   Well, the conditions didn't help me.   So it was difficult just to play a normal round of golf.   You had to manufacture shots, you had to adapt to conditions, so it was a difficult day, so we'll still have to address that.


ERNIE ELS:   No, anybody, over the weekend, you still have a chance.   There's a good score out there.   Conditions should get better for the weekend, the course will get tougher, but there's good rounds out there, so I'm not out of it.


ERNIE ELS:   I haven't really seen who is leading.


ERNIE ELS:   No, he's a regular.
(Laughter.)
