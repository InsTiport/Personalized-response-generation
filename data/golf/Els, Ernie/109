 Q.   How do you feel it went out there today?   
ERNIE ELS:   A little tricky on the greens.   I lost my putting a little, I felt the greens weren't quite the same pace and I kept hitting them past and missed the short ones, especially on the front nine, so I felt very uncomfortable but I hit the ball great.  
I made a little adjustment.   I felt my weight wasn't far enough on my left side, was hanging on the right and just hitting the ball on the up.   I started hitting the ball just a little bit more down and into the center of the putter and started making some putts.  
   
 Q.   How proud are you with shooting under par as you did today when for a while there, it was tough, and you were falling a little behind.   What can you take from that into tomorrow?   
ERNIE ELS:   Well, you know, everything's not going to go your way.   We would love to play every round exactly according to plan, but sometimes things happen and I'm glad that I could make an adjustment.   Hopefully tomorrow is a bit more clean sailing.   It will be always tough in the fourth round but think I'm ready for the fight.
