Q. Disappointing way to finish?
ERNIE ELS: Yes I thought I had hit a good shot on the 18th but I must have just chosen the wrong club and I came up short. You can't do that there and I went into the water and made double bogey. Other than that I played well.

Q. Your dad baled you out on the last for Team Els, he should be here for tomorrow?
ERNIE ELS: Yes, it was great. He made a great five on the 17th with a shot and then made a great par at the last so I am really pleased for him. It is the third time he has played here and the third time he has made it, so he is having a great time.

Q. Just the four shots behind going into the last day?
ERNIE ELS: I have got to go and cool off a little bit now and try and get set for tomorrow after that finish. But we will see what happens tomorrow. I am still in there, obviously I would have loved to have finished better but I have still got an outside chance although I will have to play better tomorrow.
