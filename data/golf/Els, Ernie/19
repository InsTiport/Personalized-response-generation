 Q.  Ernie, just your thoughts on the opening round.  
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, I mean, I'm pleased with that.  It was kind of a showery day, showers all over.  71 for me, the way my last four months has been, is pretty good.  I started hitting a bit better, which is nice.   
But playing with JB, he made it look easy.  My one mistake today was playing the par-5s poorly.  I was 1-over on the par-5s.  I've got to sharpen that up.   
All in all I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  A couple of dropped shots.  
ERNIE ELS: Yeah, out of the blue I hit a long club on 4 and it went out of bounds, so I made a double there on 4.  And then my other mistake was I just trickled into the bunker on 12, the par 5, on my drive, and ended up making bogey there.  Those two holes really hurt.   
But other than that I played solid, so I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  How is the body feeling after withdrawing from last week?  
ERNIE ELS: It's there, but it's better.  I wouldn't want to miss this tournament for the world.  But it's getting better.  It's just lower right, L4-L5.  But nothing structurally.  It's just tendon and muscle and so on.  But getting better.
