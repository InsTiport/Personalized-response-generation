Q.   Ernie, talk about an eventful week, let's talk first of all about your golf today, you had a few problems early on but give us your overall assessment of the round?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, it was a pity starting out, I don't know where my mind was but it wasn't on the game.   I found myself 3‑over through the first five, and as you said, to try and pedal back‑‑ I got it to even par but would have loved to have got to a decent start and get something going. 

Q.   You talked about not knowing where your mind was, but clearly there was a lot on your mind after yesterday's outburst the.   How off‑putting was that for your golf today?
ERNIE ELS:   Yeah, I'm sorry about that.   I should choose my words a little before carefully next time, expressing myself. 
But I have so much passion for this event and for this golf course, I just feel that things weren't quite the way they should be.   But I should have behaved a little bit more properly.   I felt for you reading my whole transcript yesterday, so I apologise for everybody and the kids and everybody. 
I feel a lot for this golf tournament, and I thought today was brilliant. 

Q.   I think it does show how passionate you are about this event and this course; and will you be tweaking things going forward?   Are there other changes you would like to make going forward?
ERNIE ELS:   I looked at some of the holes this week, and might be a bunker here and there.   I thought the weather was unbelievable.   Obviously very tough Friday and Saturday.   I think everybody learnt a lot, again, about this week.   I think we are almost there with the final product.
