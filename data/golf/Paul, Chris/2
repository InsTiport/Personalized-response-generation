Q. You've played with Tiger before if I'm not mistaken.
CHRIS PAUL: Yeah, we hit some balls and stuff like that before at his foundation event that he has out in Vegas called the Tiger Jam. Never had an opportunity to play 18 holes with him.

Q. Okay. How are you feeling? Are you a little nervous?
CHRIS PAUL: I'm a lot nervous. I'm always nervous when I come and play in the Wyndham anyway. Definitely a lot of added pressure playing with the great one.

Q. People might be surprised, you're an NBA star, you're an international name, and you're nervous.
CHRIS PAUL: I've been playing basketball for a long time, since I was four, five years old, just right here. Once in a lifetime opportunity to play with the best ever to do it. It's nerve-wracking. I'd much rather shoot a free throw than hit a 70-yard chip shot any day.

Q. How is your golf game?
CHRIS PAUL: Needs a lot of work. Me and my brother and my dad, it's what we do now together. Growing up we played basketball. Now we talk junk and play golf. Don't expect anything out there today.
