 Q. Comment on the ups and downs of your round. 
 NICK PRICE: Well if I had to say one word it's putting. And I'm really disappointed with the way I putted this week. I made a really nice putt on 17, but outside of that, I putted so poorly on the weekend. 
 I'm looking and seeing 7-under is leading and I don't know, you know, I don't know how many putts I lipped out yesterday, I know I had three 3-putts yesterday, two today. I'm just throwing away all my opportunities on the greens. And the only way I'm going to start winning now is if my putting gets better. Because my tee to green game is about as good as it can be, but my putting is just not strong enough to win.

 Q. Overall what did you think of the golf course and the conditions?
 NICK PRICE: I'll be happy to not have any wind next week. But the golf course is great. It was nice and warm. It could have been very cold this week. But the wind really I think we're all sick of the wind now. We'll be happy to go back to Florida where it's kind of hot and humid.
