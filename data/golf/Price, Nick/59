 Q. Your thoughts on how you played today?
 NICK PRICE: Not very well. I drove the ball poorly today. Especially the front nine. And actually I did quite well to stay at even par and then I doubled number 18 here which another poor drive, and then I started playing a little better. 
 And I had a couple of chances and then I 3-putted I guess three times on the back nine, which -- or twice on the back nine, three times, maybe, yeah, three times. So just frustrating. 
 These greens, I've never been a big fan of poa annua and I never really putted them that well. It's a grass that you get up north here and if you have a look at my track record, it's never been very good on poa annua. But tomorrow the greens will be good, we'll have the best of the greens tomorrow morning, so I'll try and make the most of it.

 Q. So you think the key here this week is going to be hitting fairways and staying out of the rough?
 NICK PRICE: Yeah, you know what, I sort of struggled around here nicely, making pars and that, after hitting some poor tee shots, but it's a kind of golf course that you really got to drive the ball in the fairway. And then obviously leave the ball in the right spot on the green. Otherwise you are going to be faced with some really tough 2-putts. 
 But it's a good golf course. Anyone can win out here. A long hitter, short hitter, doesn't really matter, as long as you hit it straight.
