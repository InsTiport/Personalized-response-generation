NICK PRICE:  I wore out my 3-iron.  I hit it about nine times today.  I played a little scruffy in the morning.  I really played good in the afternoon.

Q.  Are you ready to go another 9?  Are you worn out?

NICK PRICE:  No, I'm ready to go another 9. It's a long, long course, but very fair.  I really like it.
 

TIGER WOODS:  It's a congested leaderboard. I need to turn it around for the weekend.  I'm in good shape.  36 holes is no trick.  I'm in very good shape.  I workout a lot.  But ask the caddies.  It's a hard golf course for everybody.  It's not easy.  The rough is four to five inches long.  I need to make a move somehow over the weekend.  When asked about being paired with Sergio, he said:  It's Friday. Sergio is a pleasant gentleman. There was not a lot of talk on the course.  I was focused on my game.  I was trying to work some things out on the golf course.
