Q.   What positives do you take from this day so far? 
NICK PRICE:   This morning was hard.   I think the guys played really well.   The U.S. Team just played a little bit better.   I'm surprised.   I think everyone is a little tired.   They probably obviously have had enough of the rain.   The U.S. has made some great putts. 
It's hard to actually put your finger on, but we had some chances this morning, and it went the U.S.'s way and it could have gone our way.   But we are only halfway through this competition.   We still have another 17 points left.   That's what I've been telling the guys, trying to get their spirits up.   They are obviously down after what happened this morning. 
These guys have got a lot of push, a lot of determination, and even though it may not show this morning, we may show this afternoon.
