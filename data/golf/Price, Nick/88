NICK PRICE:  They had an eagle on 5, we came right back and birdied the next hole and basically  that turned things around  -- obviously came down to who was going to play the last three holes well, and they birdied 16 and we birdied 17 and 18.  So just like Ernie and Adam's match, 17 and 18 was very good for the International Team. 

8 and 10, we made a couple of bonus putts, but you have to do that to stay in match-play.  They were both playing well and you can't afford too many mistakes.  I hit some good iron shots today and Mike hit some beautiful iron shots today, as well, but the hardest thing is they have a little bit of an advantage on the par 5s.  Mike and I are pretty much the same length off the tee.
