   NICK PRICE: Good day today. I played really solid, never made a bogey, which was good. Left probably -- like everyone else, left some shots out there. Probably felt like I could have been or should have been a couple better anyway. 
 But you know, I was hoping to get a little closer to Olin, but he's playing awfully well, and with that logjam up there, tomorrow someone is going to have to shoot something really low. But all in all, I'm happy with the way I played, particularly after the way I played last week.

 Q. A lot of low scores out there today. Anything in particular that made the course easier today?
 NICK PRICE: The greens are still receptive, and I think that's why you're seeing the scores the way they are. I mean, it played a little longer today than probably the previous two days because they moved some of the tees back. But the greens are still receptive, and I think that's the big difference. You know, they've got a little more speed to them today, but nothing like they could be. 
 But tomorrow, I think tomorrow afternoon with this heat, you know, they should dry out a little more and they'll probably be a little more -- a little quicker, maybe a little firmer.
