Q. You've got to be disappointed, this wasn't the kind of start you wanted.  You guys got the format you wanted to start the matches and you find yourself behind 4-1.
NICK PRICE: It was a tough day.  The Americans, the US team played really well today.  We struggled, a couple of our pairings struggled.  Hideki didn't putt very well today.  But it's a live-and-learn thing when you've got a new, fresh team like we have.  We have so many rookies and that.  We're going to go have a team meeting now and figure out what our strategy is for tomorrow.
Q. So what do you tell the guys?  They have to be a little disappointed.  What do you say to them?
NICK PRICE: Well, we've got 25 points left.  We can't get down now.  We've got a lot of golf left.  We can turn it around tomorrow just as quickly as they did today.  Golf is a fickle game, especially 18-hole match play.  I've got to go out there and go talk to them now and just say, hey, keep your chins up and let's play golf again tomorrow.
