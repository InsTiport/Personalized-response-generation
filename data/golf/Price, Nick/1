 Q.  Can you just talk about your team and how proud you are of today's effort, given the way we started behind the 8-ball?  
NICK PRICE: Well, I think the guys today -- we all knew today was going to be a better day than the others.  These guys got out and put their hearts and souls into today.   
It looks like we're going to win this session, which I think it's going to leave a much better taste in our mouth than what was happening yesterday.   
 Q.  Have you been inspired by anyone in particular today?  
NICK PRICE: Well, I think Si-Woo.  Si-Woo, even though he lost his match today, what an incredible talent he is.  And he was a wonderful team member, too.   
Hideki played phenomenally well; Jhonattan Vegas.  So we've got a lot of young guys coming into the fray now I think.  Obviously with Emiliano, I think he's got a little bit to go, learn a little bit more about, but he was a great team member, as well.   
All in all, things are looking pretty good for us I think in the future.
