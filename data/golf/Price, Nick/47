  Q. Pretty solid round today.   
 NICK PRICE: Yeah, I shot 73 yesterday and I played better than I did today. And I had six mud balls, so if anything I didn't putt very well today. I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in. But I think yesterday it really hurt me a lot because I played good yesterday to shoot 73 was very disappointing.   
  
  Q. Did you do any scoreboard watching today?  
 NICK PRICE: Oh, yeah. I played solid all day. I just couldn't make a putt. And I hit a lot of good iron shots today, I drove the ball pretty good, and I didn't make too many mistakes, but anyway, that's the way it goes. Like I say, yesterday that ruling that we had yesterday playing the ball down might be one of the worst decisions I think I ever played under in my life.
