 Q.  Good smile on your face.  What did you make of the way your boys played out there today?  
NICK PRICE: They played the way they did on Tuesday which is exactly what I wanted them to do. I said to them last night, don't get caught up in this moment.  Just go out there and play golf.  Put the ball in the fairway off the tee, put it on the green, play golf.   
I'm so happy for Moon and for Danny the way they played.  They brought it back really well.  They were so nervous on the first tee this morning and I think they calmed each other down.  Thongchai and Charl, they just played solid all day.  Adam and Jason, they had a real battle today and I think that was a phenomenal outcome for a phenomenal match.   
You know, all in all, I don't know, I'm just so proud of those guys.  My nerves are shot already.  I mean, it's Friday and we've still got three rounds of golf to go.  It's very nerve-wracking just being back there and being powerless.
