 Q.  I just heard the comment you saying we had fun this week.  Talk about the week overall. 
 NICK PRICE:  Well, I tell you, it was just -- apart from the strength of the wind the first two days, it was great.  And I'm really happy. 
 For a long time probably the last two years I haven't been able to see any light at the end of the tunnel.  And now there's a nice bright glow there.  And I'm really pleased with the way I played this week and I didn't back off.  I had a couple of poor shots at the end of the back nine or the front nine this morning, when we made the turn. 
 But other than that, I kept going.  And I'm happy.  I could have won if I hadn't made any mistake, but Denis, my hat's off to him, he played pretty much flawlessly. 

 Q.  How good is this for your old friend? 
 NICK PRICE:  It's good.  He's been in the depths, he's had some tough times.  And he played really well back in the early '80's and kind of lost it.  So I hope he grabs on to it with both hands now and doesn't let go. 

 Q.  Tough to watch though a guy like Romero on 14.  What happened out there? 
 NICK PRICE:  You know, he played beautifully.  He hit 2 bad shots in the 36 holes I played with him.  And that one on 14 was very penal. 
 And he nearly made four.  But that's what happens on this golf course.  When you miss a green or a fairway, you can be penalized very severely.
