  Q. Comments on your round today?  
 NICK PRICE: A little up-and-down. I made a lot of birdies. I think I made five birdies and four bogeys. And just the nature of this golf course with the way the wind is, I hit a lot of good shots and ended up making bogeys from them, which frustrated me a lot.   
 But I feel like I should be around like 6-, maybe 7-under with the quality -- maybe more -- with the quality of the way I played. And I'm not. And I'm a little frustrated with that. And I'm not really sure whether I played maybe a little aggressively today or at times maybe a little cautiously, I just didn't feel really comfortable out there. I did feel comfortable, but I just hit shots that sort of finished in places that, pretty good shots that finished in places where it made it very difficult to get it up-and-down or 2-putt from.   
 So, it's hard. This is a Major Championship and it's hard. It's hard to get the ball close to the hole and there's going to be some tough, some tough breaks out there. But some of the elevation changes that we have, coupled with the wind, makes club selection very, very difficult.   
  
  Q. Thoughts for round three?  
 NICK PRICE: I just got to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully make fewer mistakes. I think if I can make fewer mistakes tomorrow then I'll post a lower score, which I need to do tomorrow to give myself a chance for Sunday.
