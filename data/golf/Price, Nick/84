NICK PRICE:  Today I hit one bad shot.  I hit a drive 50 yards right of the 4th fairway and made double, but other than that I played okay.  I three-putted 1.  At least I finished strong.  I birdied two out of the last four, so that was a good way to finish, otherwise it would have really been a brain-dead round.
Q.  It looked like you really had things rolling on your first nine.  Talk about the three-putt there on 1.  Did that come as a result of you being -- not hitting the putt you wanted and having it come back --
NICK PRICE:  No, actually my second putt I hit left off the hole and it kind of stayed left, actually moved a little left.  I didn't hit a bad putt, but I made 5 there and then didn't make birdie on the next hole, and then bogeyed No. 3.

And I got on the 4th tee, and I don't know what I was thinking, but I hit probably the worst drive I've hit all week.  You know, there's signs there, I've just got to play a little more.

As I said earlier in the week, when you don't play a lot, things like that happen.
Q.  I don't know if you could see from down in the fairway, I believe, on 6, but your approach shot looked like it needed one extra hop and it would have rolled right to the pin there.
NICK PRICE:  When you get things going for you, they go for you, and when they don't go for you, they don't work, and I kind of had both today.
