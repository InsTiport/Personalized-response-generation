  Q. First off, let's start with today.   
 NICK PRICE: A little frustrated because I didn't finish very well, but the finish was tough today. You know, 13, 14 were tough holes, and I bogeyed one of them. But then I bogeyed the 16th hole which was also playing tough today. It was long.   
 But, you know, I guess the course is playing probably its hardest today and I broke par so I'm happy about that. But I had my chances, you know.  
  
  Q. Was it harder because of the way it was set-up or the wind?   
 NICK PRICE: I think it was set-up a little tougher, and also it was a little bit of the wind and that was unsettling with the clubs. And the wind kept shifting. It was shifting through about 40 degrees today, and that's what made it hard to pull a club.  
  
  Q. Thoughts on the tournament?   
 NICK PRICE: Oh, I loved it. I had a great time. Obviously, the scores are low because the rain that we had on Tuesday and Wednesday, but I think it's a great tournament. I think they're going to have a wonderful champion, and hopefully I'll be able to come back here one more time before I hang my clubs up.  
  
  Q. Any other thoughts?   
 NICK PRICE: I'm happy because I played a lot better than I did last week. So my game hasn't been really good, and last week I played awful over in the British Senior Open. This week was a lot better, so I think I'm going to stick to the warm weather. I do better in warm weather.
