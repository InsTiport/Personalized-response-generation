  NICK PRICE: This is a great format and the course is in such great shape. I played well enough recently to be in the top 30 of the US PGA Tour money list so therefore I was able to come here and not worry, in fact I've only played one tournament in the last eight in the States. My son has had 12 weeks off this summer and we have been holidaying in Mexico. It has just been more important to be with my family recently but it was great to get an invite from Johann Rupert and I hit the ball really well today. Carnoustie is special and my chip on 16 was the shot of the day. I am looking forward to Kingsbarns where I practiced on Tuesday but up here, playing links golf, you have to look to the weather and hope it stays kind.
