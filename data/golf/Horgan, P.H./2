 Q.   Talk about the conditions out here today just for the first round.   How are you doing coming off?  
P.H. HORGAN:   Well, coming into the tournament the course itself is just a beast of a golf course and now put maybe 25 mile an hour winds on it, fast greens, tough pin positions, it's one of the most difficult tests of golf that I've had in a long time.   
And I was playing well.   I played really solidly.   I made a double bogey on 15, the par‑5, otherwise I would have been under par.   I shot 1‑over today.   But I'm comfortable with my scoring.   
I'm glad I'm done though.   It was miserable.   There's a lot of tough shots to be played out there right now.  
   
 Q.   What's the goal then for tomorrow?   You got to hope for the best with the weather and get ready?  
P.H. HORGAN:   The goal‑‑ you have to assume that it's going to be really hard all week.   So really I'm just going to keep grinding, trying to ‑‑ you know you're going to need to make a lot of pars on this course, you got to make pars and avoid making doubles.   
There's trouble everywhere.   Just try to play safe, play smart, get your birdies when you can, but it's not going to be super low this week at all.   With the wind, it may play somewhat easier in the morning, but we'll see.
