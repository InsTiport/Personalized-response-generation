PAUL ROVNAK:  Kristi, thanks for coming in.  67, 5‑under, you're the clubhouse leader right now.  It's always good to post a good score on Thursday.  Give us your thoughts and then we'll take questions.
KRISTI ALBERS:  I wasn't playing all that well, just struggling a little bit.  And then on 17, my 8th hole, I made a hole‑in‑one and all of a sudden I'm 2‑under, and I just played a little better after that.
Q.  What were you struggling with?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Not struggling, but not hitting greens, not giving myself any birdie putts.  I had a couple, but they were 30Ã  feet.
Q.  What was the best part of your game today?
KRISTI ALBERS:  My 9‑iron.
Q.  I assume that's what you hit in?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Yes.
Q.  How far?
KRISTI ALBERS:  135.
Q.  Give us a play‑by‑play.  What happened?  Did it land in front and roll in?
KRISTI ALBERS:  I hit it thin and I was saying, get up, get up, and it hit on the front of the green and it rolled.  It was dead on the hole and it just disappeared.  I said to my playing partners, please don't tell people how I just hit that shot.  It was a good miss.
Q.  That seems maybe to be the most or one of the most intimidating holes out here.  Is it for the pros or is it just you hit it over water all the time?
KRISTI ALBERS: Three out of the four par 3s out here are over water, I think.  It is a little bit, because the green is not real wide, so if you hit it on the green, you're going to be happy.
Q.  When you got the ace, did you think maybe my luck has turned around.  I hit a bad shot and end up making eagle out of that, maybe I'm dialed in and didn't even know it?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Sometimes things just turn around and it's amazing how that happens.  I hadn't given myself too many birdie putts.  I had to get up and down a few times to save par and then all of a sudden I do that.  I mean, I hit a shot on 13, I hit it about 2Ã  feet.
Q.  How had you been playing coming in here?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Honestly, not great and not terrible.  I mean, I felt like at any time I could play well.
Q.  When you look in the media guide, it seems you'll get two or three Top‑10 finishes in a year.  I know it's early, but might this not only turn your day into something but turn your week?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Sometimes people say it was just my week.  I had some good misses today that worked out well.  A lot of times your misses don't work out as well.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Tell us about the birdies and bogeys.  Let's start with what happened on 10.
KRISTI ALBERS:  10, I hit a good drive and I just pulled my second shot a little bit and hit it over the green, didn't hit a good chip shot and left it on the fringe.  I actually had to make a five‑footer for bogey.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What did you hit with your second shot?
KRISTI ALBERS: 8‑iron.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And 13, what club did you hit in.
KRISTI ALBERS:  I hit a pitching wedge about 2Ã  feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Birdie on 2?
KRISTI ALBERS:  I hit a sand wedge to about 8Ã  feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Birdie on 5?
KRISTI ALBERS:  That was a good one.  I hit my second shot over the green and I chipped it in, about a 40‑foot chip shot.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What did you hit over the green?
KRISTI ALBERS:  6‑iron.
Q.  Were you completely in the rough or were you on the fringe?
KRISTI ALBERS:  I was in the rough, over the green.  It wasn't that hard.  I had to get it up and get it going and it went in.
Q.  Was it a downhill runner there?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And then the birdie on 9, the par 5.
KRISTI ALBERS:  9, I hit a decent drive and hit a 3‑wood a little bit right and hit a chip shot to then about 3Ã  feet.
Q.  The greens must be holding somewhat.
KRISTI ALBERS:  I teed off first, too.  For the most part, yes, they are holding.  There are a couple of greens that are a little firmer, but for the most part they held pretty well today.
Q.  How much of after of an advantage do you think you got by teeing off early?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Not that much.  I mean, the greens were nice for nine holes, but I didn't make too many birdies on my back nine.
Q.  You played here the last twoÃ  years.  How is the course playing?  The first year was really hard, really fast.  Last year was the opposite of that.  What's this year been like through 18 holes?
KRISTI ALBERS:  This year it's right in between.  It's definitely not playing fast, and it's not soaked.
Q.  Were you hitting longer clubs than you hit in twoÃ  years ago?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Like 18, because they moved the tees back, definitely.  I hit 5‑iron in there today, and I remember hitting 9‑irons in there?
Q.  How far back is that tee box?  Do they have the tee boxes all the way back?  Are you playing the tips?
KRISTI ALBERS:  I think we're one from the back.  I think they moved it 20Ã  yards back.
Q.  You don't seem to be all that excited about going 5‑under, are you?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Yes.
Q.  Do you feel like you are playing better now?
KRISTI ALBERS:  You just never know.  It's such a goofy game.  Today I got some good breaks.  You just never know.  I'm very happy to have shot 5‑under.
Q.  I read in the media guide where you're married to a TV sports caster.  I wonder what kind of coverage you get in El Paso?
KRISTI ALBERS:  None lately.  None lately.
Q.  What about tonight?
KRISTI ALBERS:  He is working tonight, so we'll see.
Q.  He is working tonight?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Yes.
Q.  How did that happen, that you two met?  Are you both from El Paso?
KRISTI ALBERS:  He's from St. Louis.
Q.  How did you meet?
KRISTI ALBERS:  He was working in El Paso and I was playing in our city golf tournament and he came out to work and he was following me.  And then the next day we were on a plane flight going to Denver, so we sat and talked for a while.
Q.  How long after you met did you guys get married?
KRISTI ALBERS:  Two and a half years.  I was still in college.
Q.  How did it happen that you were both on the same plane to Denver?
KRISTI ALBERS:  I don't know.  I was going to play in an amateur tournament and he was going fishing with his brother.
Q.  So it was fate, in other words?
KRISTI ALBERS:  And we have a 3‑year‑old little boy.
Q.  Does the boy go with you?
KRISTI ALBERS:  He's with me
