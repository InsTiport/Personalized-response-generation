   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Young, thanks for coming in and joining us. Great round out there. You shot a 4-under par, 67. You're the leader in the clubhouse. 
 You just got your first win last year at the LPGA Corning Classic. After two rounds, kind of looks like you might be doing that again.
 YOUNG KIM: Hopefully, yes.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Talk about the golf course and how you played and what your thoughts are.
 YOUNG KIM: Okay. I think this course is windy, especially like England. Windy and tight fairway and so many mogul. I mean, greens is so many mogul and small greens. 
 So I have two shots straight and come -- I need straight shot, I mean.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: So you're hitting straight shots and that's part of what's working well for you? 
 YOUNG KIM: Yeah. And good up and down and good par save and I made a lot of putter. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. Let's go over your scorecard. Can you tell us about what club you used on the first hole for birdie? 
 YOUNG KIM: Unfortunately I cannot remember all because it was too windy. Okay, first hole I had tee shot with driver. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You can just tell us what your approach shot was and how close to the green if you want. 
 YOUNG KIM: It's about ten foot putt from right to left. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. What club did you use to hit the green? 
 YOUNG KIM: I think 7-iron.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. 
 YOUNG KIM: Yes, 7-iron. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How about the birdie on 6. What club and how close? 
 YOUNG KIM: 6, Par 5. Hit driver. I made two on with my 4-iron. It was behind me so I hit 4-iron second shot, and it was eagle putt about ten foot. But I just missed that and I made short putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. Bogey on 10? 
 YOUNG KIM: Driver shot went to bunker because wind was left/right too much. I hit well, but still in bunker. Then hit pitching wedge a little bit short of the green.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. 
 YOUNG KIM: Chip out about 30 yards, and I miss putt about twenty; two-putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Two-putt. Okay. And birdie on 11? 
 YOUNG KIM: Birdie on 11, Par 5. Hit driver and 5-iron for the layup, and then 8-iron. I made a long putt, about ten yards.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: About 30 feet? 
 YOUNG KIM: Yes.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Very nice. How about the birdie on 12? 
 YOUNG KIM: 12, Par 4. Tee shot with driver, and then second shot with pitching wedge. I make about 15-foot putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. What happened on the bogey on 14? 
 YOUNG KIM: 14, it's Par 4. Hit driver, then 7-iron shot, then 3-putt. About twenty-yard putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 60 feet? 
 YOUNG KIM: Uh-huh.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. And birdie on 15? 
 YOUNG KIM: Hit 7-wood just past the pin. It's about ten yards for birdie putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How many yards? 
 YOUNG KIM: Ten feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Ten feet? Okay. And the last birdie on 18? 
 YOUNG KIM: Driver, 7-iron, then 9-iron. Then it was about ten-feet putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. Questions.
 YOUNG KIM: And ask simple.

 Q. Just talk about what's been the key to your game the last couple days, and what do you have to do the next couple days to win? 
 YOUNG KIM: Well, last two days was windy and I played with amateurs, so I think I need good concentrate. But I meet nice amateurs. They make me relax and comfortable and they respect me a lot, so I played well with them. 
 Tomorrow we paired with --
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Tomorrow with your amateur again. 
 YOUNG KIM: Again?
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sorry, tomorrow is just the top 20 teams. So, yeah, you'll be with your amateur. 
 YOUNG KIM: So I play with same amateur? 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Uh-huh.
 YOUNG KIM: I see. Okay. Anyway, I check forecast past two days like same wind tomorrow. So I need keep the fairway with my driver then keep the straight iron. Well, fortunately this course is short. So I think straight driver. 
 Anyway, I read well today and I putt well. I think if I have same mindset will be good. 

 Q. Which of the two courses did you prefer? The one you played yesterday or the one you played today?
 YOUNG KIM: Well, I play -- day one I play the Miller Course first. I think it's a little bit longer than Soffer, because many Par 4 and Par 3s had wind, so some of the Par 4 I hit driver and 3-wood, and some of the Par 3 I hit 5-wood, 3-wood. 
 But Soffer is better like better direction for the wind. I think Miller is a little more difficult than Soffer. 

 Q. Does it benefit you that you played Soffer today and then you'll play, of course, tomorrow and Sunday on that one, instead of having played it yesterday and then skipping a day?
 YOUNG KIM: Well, I think so, but I think many players same thing, so... 
 Just a little bit.

 Q. Can you talk about your penchant, you know, wearing hats, different looking hats?
 YOUNG KIM: Anyway, I like this bucket hat because good for the strong sun. Still, I don't want to change my hat. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Is it a certain brand of hat? 
 YOUNG KIM: Same brand, Bogner. They sponsor me, so I like this hat. 

 Q. Was it difficult to get used to swinging in a hat like that? Because it's different for golf. 
 YOUNG KIM: Yeah. Some of my friends wanted this hat because good protect from the sun. But when they wear these hats, too hot. 
 Then when backswing or finish it touch, so it's a little bit bother them. Fortunately, my swing didn't bother anything. I'm not hot with this hat because I wear long pants and long shirt. I'm not hot people. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 YOUNG KIM: My planning was wear shorts, but 85 it's okay to wear long pants. 

 Q. Can you talk a little bit more about your amateur partner? Does he talk a lot? What is he like? Does he help you in anyway?
 YOUNG KIM: Yeah, I play and Bill Marshall, and other player was Mike Snyder. They are really nice guys. When we are play slow, they just quit for us. 
 Well, they helped a lot, and they make us really comfortable and relax. Lots of talk with them. Actually, I couldn't because cannot speak well, but they talk a lot to me. And, well, always smiling, so perfect amateur team. 

 Q. Talk just a little bit about what their backgrounds are, what they do for a living? 
 YOUNG KIM: Well, I know they work for ADT, right? 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: I can look into that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 YOUNG KIM: Yeah, so they try to change (indiscernible) for ADT and ask about that, and I couldn't say anything. But Lindsey say something.
 Well, we talk a lot, but I cannot remember well because too windy.
