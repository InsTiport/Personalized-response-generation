   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thanks for joining us today.  You had another great round out there.  You're 200 for three rounds and you are tied in a three-way for first place.  How do you feel?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I just think stay three, but I'm in the top, so I really feel good and hopefully tomorrow do well.   
  
  Q.  Can we go over your scorecard, birdies?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I had 5 birdie today, and 1 bogey.  First birdie was on the No. 2.  So I have to explain?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Yeah, the club and how far to the pin.   
 YOUNG KIM:  Hit driver with my 9-iron, and it's about 10 yards for the putt, birdie.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How about on No.4?   
 YOUNG KIM:  No.4, okay, hit driver.  My shot was (indiscernible) trying to roll on the green, then I made about 7 yard.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club did you use to get on the green?   
 YOUNG KIM:  6.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  6-iron?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I mean it was 105 yards, so I use 6.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  No. 8?   
 YOUNG KIM:  No. 8, I hit driver and hit 9-iron.  It was 6 feet, birdie putt.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  How about No. 9?   
 YOUNG KIM:  No. 9, hit 7 tee shot.  Second shot 9-iron, and it's about past 7 yards.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How about No. 12?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Hit driver and 3-wood and my wedge, and about 5 yards downhill putt.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Pitching wedge to 5 yards?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Yes.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And how about the bogey on 13?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I hit well.  It was almost thick rough so I trying to get out and then chipping a little bit short and I just make about a 5-foot putt.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  2-putted there?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Yeah.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  So pitching wedge to 5 feet?   
 YOUNG KIM:  58 degrees.  I mean driver, then 8-iron, then chipping with my 58 degree, then 2-putt.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Perfect.  Questions for Young Kim?   
  
  Q.  Things are set up for a very exciting final round.  How do you feel about going into tomorrow's rounds in a three-way tie and you're playing with the other two players you're tied with?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Tomorrow's threesomes?   
  
  Q.  Yes.   
 YOUNG KIM:  So I'm going to play with Beth and Creamer?  Wow, exciting.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Going to be split tee, too.   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I just will having fun, then I will try my best then.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever led or shared a lead going into the final round of a tournament before?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I was -- not sure.  Just it was last -- two years ago, last year?  The Open then, yes, and last year Annika beat me.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You shared the lead with Annika going into the last round?   
 YOUNG KIM:  No, I was leading by 1 or 2 strokes.   
  
  Q.  And how did you do the last day?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I did well, but Annika did too much well.  That's why I lose.   
  
  Q.  Of the threesomes going out tomorrow, Paula is the one that's won on the tour here before.  Do you think that might play to her advantage, or do you think at this point you know how you could close out a tournament and win it?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I think tomorrow Paula and Beth had a good fan because they are Americans.   
 So I'm not going to think of any crowd and I just keep going my game, then hopefully everything well.   
  
  Q.  You're one of three Kims on the leaderboard.  Do you have any particular rivalry between the three of you, a friendly competition, or does that matter at all?  You're showing me it doesn't matter.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  There are three people with the last name Kim on the leaderboard.  Do you guys -- does that make you compete even more?   
 YOUNG KIM:  No.   
  
  Q.  You said the last time you were in this position and you lost to Annika going into the final round, did you feel pressure going into that final round then?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Actually, yes, too much pressure to me because it was my first, going to first to win.  But now, no, too many times.   
  
  Q.  So this time around is it a little bit easier in that you're not alone in the lead and there isn't -- and Annika isn't there either.  You share the lead.  Is it a little easier this time around going in?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I want to say yes, and I want to play challenger, like confidently tomorrow.  Hopefully everything will go well.   
  
  Q.  Since you're going to be teamed up with everybody on top of the leaderboard, how do you approach it?  Do you play the same way you've been playing or try to get a little bit more aggressive?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Little more aggressive because I think this course is good score course.  So I think it's even -- other players can play 9 or 10-under par, so I think it's a little more aggressive play tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Now, if you see any mistakes from your playing partners, do you change up what you do?  Do you base it on what you want to do or what you maybe see your playing partners doing?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, actually, I don't think about my partner or even scoreboard.  I don't want to watch scoreboard.  Just keep my game.  So it doesn't matter.   
  
  Q.  Are you having a good time this week?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Yeah, too much.   
  
  Q.  Has the course, the conditions of the course, changed at all from Thursday's opening round to today?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Not much.  Almost same to me.  I cannot see anything.  Just a little cooler today.   
  
  Q.  Do you like the cooler weather?  Some players say they like it hot and sticky.  How do you feel?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Today is much better, because normally I wear aware long pants and long shirts.  It's much better today.   
  
  Q.  If it rains tomorrow, how does that suit your game?  How do you play in rain?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I didn't think of it yet.  Well, if rain, everything same thing.  If rain everything is same to everybody, so I think it's just keep my game.   
  
  Q.  Were you at all disappointed when you made your first bogey on No. 13?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Yes.  Before that I didn't have any bogey, so I tried to make par.  But after bogey I really disappoint my game, but it's okay.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Just for a note, she was 48 holes without a bogey going into that unlucky 13.
