  Q.  So what do you do to play your best, do you have to focus a lot?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I think first thing is make a lot of birdies and then chip middle of the fairway and then, yeah, it's risky, hit the middle of the fairways because it's too long here and too tight.   
  
  Q.  What was working well for you today?   
 YOUNG KIM:  Well, I really think everything was not too bad.  I think everything is normal.   
  
  Q.  So what do you think of match play?  Do you like match play or stroke play better?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I leak both.  I like every play.   
  
  Q.  What kind of player is In-Kyung Kim to play against?   
 YOUNG KIM:  I think she's very good player, driver every time, middle of the fairway, make a putt on.  She had a couple of good putts today.  She's a nice player.
