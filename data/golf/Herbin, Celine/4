Q. Just about today, is that the round of your life?
CELINE HERBIN: It's a bit too much to say, but I still had a bogey.  But it's my best on Tour.  Like my record was minus seven a few times, so now I beat it by one, so minus eight and I'm happy with that.  So it's my best professional score.
Q. Why did you play so well today?
CELINE HERBIN: I was playing well all week.  It's a special week because you come from America.  I struggled a lot with the jet-lag the first days.  Today, just clicked very well with the putting.  I begin very well the round and focus is good.  I just stayed in the present.  That was the key, and to be patient.
Q. And 17 was a great eagle.  You drove the green?
CELINE HERBIN: Correct.  Eight feet or nine feet for eagle.
Q. What was going through your mind going to the last?
CELINE HERBIN: Stay in the present, it was the key, really.  It's what I told myself.  I was not very watching at all the leaderboard.  Just trying to do my best on every shot.
Q. Who with you as your caddie this week?
CELINE HERBIN: It's my putting coach, so it's Stephane Barras.  He's from caddieplayer.com.  I've been working with him since July and it's been a big, big improvement.
