Playoff
Q. Great golf, one off the course record but in the end, I suppose disappointing?
CELINE HERBIN: Not really, I mean, it was really a bonus for me to in this playoff today.  It was an awesome one for me, my personal best, minus eight and I had nine birdies.  I enjoyed a lot today.
I played very well, really, but so I spent a little bit too much time without playing.  I finished earlier and I lost a little bit of rhythm, I am say.  I could feel it on the drive and even the 7-iron on the lay up.  The sand wedge went out of the clubface.
But today is a very nice day for me.  It's nice to finish ahead of this tournament, one of the biggest of the LET and very happy.  The last two weeks have been very important for me.  I regained my LPGA card last week, which was a very, very nice moment for me, and now third in Dubai, so it's very, very nice.
