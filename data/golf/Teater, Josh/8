Q.   You were grinding come home, really beautiful bunker saves on the last two holes. 
JOSH TEATER:   Yeah, I got myself in gear on the back nine.   Didn't play very good at all.   I don't know where it stands, what it looks like, but I know I don't deserve it.

Q.   Who knows what you deserve; right now you're 72nd.   There is going to be some moving in the standings, and to your credit, you got off to a really solid start today. 
JOSH TEATER:   I did.   I played well the first eight or nine holes and everything was in control and had a threeâ€‘putt and then a bad shot on 11, good shot there, and then hit some poor putts.   You know, I could have played better today, I could have played better earlier this year.

Q.   Is it something that you were cognizant of as the round began and throughout the round, grinding for that top 70?
JOSH TEATER:   I mean, I knew where I stood.   I went out there with a game plan and I was playing well at the start of the day and comfortable.   Just wasn't what we were trying to do.   Kind of got off track and never could get back on.
