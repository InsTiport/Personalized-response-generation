  JOSH TEATER:   I would say eagle there on 18.   Making the turn was a good one any time I guess you get a five‑pointer in this format.  
But I didn't play the other par‑5s very good which was a little disappointing.   Didn't finish on a very good note.   Thought I hit a good shot on 9, but I think I maybe overcalculated the altitude and came up a hair short.  
   
 Q.   How much of a factor is playing at this altitude?  
JOSH TEATER:   It's different for sure.   I mean, we're playing around 10%‑‑ ball is carrying 10% further.   Usually you're hitting a 9‑iron about 150, and now you're hitting it 165.   It's a little bit of an adjustment.   
Last year I played well here; played well in Utah a couple years ago on the Nationwide Tour.  
Feel like I got a pretty good handle on it.   Sometimes shorter shots you may not factor as much in.  
   
 Q.   What happened on No. 9?  
JOSH TEATER:   I had like 90 yards and I factored in a little bit of the altitude and hit about an 80‑, 82‑yard shot and came up a little short of the green.   Had a little awkward pitch and just missed about a five‑footer coming back.   
   
 Q.   Good way to start, though.   
JOSH TEATER:   Yeah, not too bad.   Get a little practice in this afternoon and relax.
