  JOSH TEATER:   You know, it was really good.   I hit the ball where I was looking, which was always a plus.   I putted well, had a lot of opportunities.   Playing from the fairway, which is key on this course.   You can really kind of attack it a little bit more. 
    The conditions are good.   The wind was down until about the last hour or so. 

Q.   Clubhouse leader right now. 
    JOSH TEATER:   That's always good. 

Q.   When you look at this golf course, just the setup and everything, is it playing harder or easier than you thought?
    JOSH TEATER:   I'd say right now maybe a touch easier.   It's a little softer than I remember it being a couple of years ago.   The ball is not running out as much.   I'm sure it's going to firm up as long as we don't get any rain.
    If you control the ball, get it in the fairway and attack from the fairway, you can shoot some good scores here.   If you miss it on the wrong side of the green or come out of the rough, it makes it tougher.

Q.   It looks like the wind is going to pick up, maybe a little tougher this afternoon for the guys?
    JOSH TEATER:   Yeah, I think so.   The last four holes were kind of tough trying to judge that wind.   And finally we got it, finished. 
    No. 9, I had it way too far, I had 170.   I was hoping to have at least 150.   I made a good shot, made a good par. 
    I know tomorrow afternoon the wind will probably be the same.   I played yesterday, had a lot of wind, so I'm ready for it.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
    JOSH TEATER:   At this point it really doesn't mean anything.   They don't reward you for leading on Thursday.   So you know you can't win today but you can lose it today.   Just to know that I'm in position, if I continue having good days I'll have a chance.
