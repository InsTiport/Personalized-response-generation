 Q.   What was going good today?   
JOSH TEATER:   You know, I kept it in the fairway quite a bit.   Just not much going on out there.   In the fairway, on the greens, which was pretty good considering the wind was going pretty good.   
Had a little bit of side winds.   Made a few key par saves.   All in all, pretty good.  
   
 Q.   How frustrating is it, all the starting and stopping, when you have it going good like that?   
JOSH TEATER:   Oh, you know, it's never the best, especially when you're on the last hole putting.   
But it's just what it is.  
   
 Q.   Conditions out there, what was the course like?   
JOSH TEATER:   Very soft.   I mean, I remember playing here in the years past hitting three, four drivers, and now about every hole is a driver because the ball is just hitting and stopping.  
But, I mean, fairways are good, not much rough.   Kind of get a good lie in the rough when you hit it there.   Greens are good as well.
