 Q.  So that was a heck of a battle you had there with Caroline.  LINDSEY McCURDY: Yeah, it was.   Q.  Tell me about going to that last hole and going for the win.  LINDSEY McCURDY: Yeah, I want to say it was on 13 or 14, got it to all square, and I'd been down most of the match before that, so not really -- we didn't really change the game plan, though, just kept playing steady golf, going for it when we could and playing safe when we needed to.  It's been working all week, so it definitely worked at the end.  Pars will get you to win holes out here, so that's what I just wanted to do on the last hole, and it ended up working out.   Q.  What's this whole experience been like for you so far this week?  LINDSEY McCURDY: It's been awesome.  I've never played a Women's Am, so getting out here and playing match play and obviously doing well is the goal, and it's been fun.  I love match play.  It's been a completely different game since the first two days, so it's been fun.   Q.  And playing the local girl, you had a bit of a following out there?  LINDSEY McCURDY: Yeah, definitely.  There was definitely a crowd favorite, but it's all right.  I still liked it.  I enjoyed competing, and it didn't bother me too much.  It was still fun.
