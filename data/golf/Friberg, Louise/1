   THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, wonderful round. What's happening with your group, two 68s, are you just feeding off of each either? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, I know. I think I played well on the beginning, and then she played well on the back nine. So a combination of the two was even better. 
 THE MODERATOR: Have you been to Hainan before? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No, I've been to China twice before. One time, Xiamen, and I'm going to butcher this, but Guangzhou, right by -- close to Hong Kong. So I've been there before and played. 
 THE MODERATOR: And both were the China domestic tour? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: One was the Orient Tour, and the second one was I travelled around in Asia for about a month playing Pro-Ams in 2001. 
 THE MODERATOR: So it was the Asian Ladies Tour? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, I guess that's what they call it maybe, yeah. 
 THE MODERATOR: So you are old friends to all of us? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, sure. 

 Q. Was it maybe '04 when you played in Xiamen? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, I think it was '04. Yeah, it must have been in the fall of '04 maybe. 

 Q. How do you like the course? Can you tell us a little bit, and compare today to your practice rounds? Is it pretty tough? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: The fairways are pretty wide, and usually that's actually my strong side; that I hit a lot of fairways. So I guess statistics-wise, it wouldn't really suit me. But I like the course. There's a lot of grain on the greens. So I managed to stay kind of patient out there today, and read the greens pretty well and my iron shots were actually the best. I hit three of my birdies within two or three feet of the hole, so it just happened, yeah. 

 Q. How many birdies all day?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I had five, and one bogey. 

 Q. (How do you feel about your year so far)? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, I'm a rookie on the LPGA. Played in Europe prior to this. Won my third event of the year in Mexico City, and been a little bit up-and-down, a little bit of a roller coaster. But the last few weeks or month and a half, I've been playing pretty well again. So that sums up the year I think. I think I'm like 40-something on the Money List. 

 Q. Did you see any players back from Xiamen; do you recognize any players playing this week? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No. I think when I played there, I think I was grouped with mostly Americans, actually. 

 Q. What about local players? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No. 

 Q. Any Chinese players you recognize? 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No, it's too long ago. I'm getting old, I can't remember anymore. 

 Q. Weather-wise, it's a little bit calmer early in the morning, and you were one of the early starters; so is it an advantage, because two of you came back with 68 and it seems like the wind is picking up later. So it could be an advantage to shoot a good score early in the morning?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, it's always a little bit easier to play in the calmer weather. But probably when we had about five or six holes left, the wind picked up. 
 It's always a little bit difficult when the wind actually picks up because you have different club selects and you have to account for the wind. Yeah, definitely being a morning group, I would say that's a bit easier than when there's wind. 

 Q. Do you still remember any Chinese back from 2004-2005?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Ni hao.

 Q. That's it?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I forgot the words! But I learned how to say, "Excuse me, can you please roll up the window" in the taxi from yesterday. But I can't remember the words. And I would completely butcher it if I tried. 

 Q. We would like to you try. 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No (laughing). I'll come back tomorrow after my other 68 and tell you. 
 THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll give you another shot tomorrow. 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I'll learn it by tomorrow, I promise. Thanks. 

 Q. Coming from Sweden, is Annika Sorenstam a role model to all players, even the younger players now?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I think for Sweden, especially in general, she's been a role model. She's opened a lot of doors for Swedish golfers. 
 For me, I guess I'm a little bit untraditional in the way that -- ten years ago, I barely enjoyed golf. So I've never really had a golf role model I guess. But I know she has done a lot for Swedish golf, for sure. 

 Q. But ten years ago, did you play golf?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I played golf ten years ago, but I used to not like it. 

 Q. (How did you get started in golf)?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: To be honest with you, golf is in my family, and I did horseback riding, and I wanted a horse. And my dad said, "No, I can't get you a horse." 
 I said, "Fine, I'll dust off my clubs and become a pro and make my own money and buy my horse." And I still don't have a horse, but I play golf. 

 Q. So what happened, you won in MÃ©xico; it should be fairly cheap down in MÃ©xico to get a horse. 
 LOUISE FRIBERG: But I don't have time to take care of it. 

 Q. Maybe in the near future you might have a farm or a range?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No, not in the near future. It's maybe like 20 years down the road. I'm here to play golf for a few more years. 

 Q. You have a farm in the future?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Possibly. I'll see what my boyfriend says about that. Maybe he doesn't want to live in a zoo. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you so much. Welcome back to China.
