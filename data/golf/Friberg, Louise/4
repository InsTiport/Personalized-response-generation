FULL AUDIO INTERVIEW

  
Q. Did you surprise yourself today?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: No. I'm hitting the ball good. It's just but I felt very calm. I told myself to have a lot of patience and to be focused and make clear decisions and all that. And mentally I did so good today. The result came with it.
 
  
Q. You were sure of almost all of your shots? How much  
does the mental and the physical go together?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Well, this is my first Open, so I knew that I was going to be maybe a little bit nervous. It's a little bit different to be here than a normal LPGA event. So I was prepared to be a little bit nervous on the tee, but I actually wasn't for some reason. It was a good nervous, I guess. And --
 
  
Q. You had to peek a lot to see your name up there?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I didn't, until actually on -- where was that -- on my 16 hole. I think I saw it there. And I was like, oh, wow, I'm on the top. Because if you're hitting the ball well and putting decent here, you can shoot a low score. So I thought there were going to be a lot of low scores, here.
 
  
Q. Everyone said putting is very important around here?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Yeah, and I even left a few putts out there in the beginning. I had a good opportunity on my first hole and on my second hole that I didn't quite get to. But I putted well. I putted solid today. The pace was good.
 
  
Q. Long ones? 
  
LOUISE FRIBERG: Not way long. No, I think the longest one  
was 18, 20 feet that I made, I think. 
 
  
Q. You got off in a good time early in the morning, the course  
played perfect. Are you going to be able to hold on to this do  
you think?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: Well, I take each day as it comes. And this is, as I said, is the first time I play in this big event. Every day is a new day. I'm just going to keep doing my best and mentally be -- have patience.
 
  
Q. Doesn't that help you, knowing what to expect?
 LOUISE FRIBERG: I guess I don't really -- I shouldn't say I don't care, but I just take it for what it is. It is what it is. I just love being out here.
