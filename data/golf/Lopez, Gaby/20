 Q.  Quite a productive day with birdies at 6.  Made a great move on Saturday.  Tell us about how you played.  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I'm really happy how calm I stayed out there.  It was windy in the end, a couple holes, and I think just remaining calm, remaining patient out there is probably the key for this golf course.   
We have a lot of birdie chances, maybe.  Sometimes with the wedge play and the par 5s.  So being smart with where you want to putt from, I think, that kind of helped me.   
 Q.  Did you hit the ball well enough that you felt you could be a little bit more aggressive with your approaches, or --  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, it was a combination.  I guess hit it close when I had to, and sometimes, you know, those pins that are tucked into the left or the right, you just got to be smart and play to the middle of the hole and remain calm.  I mean, there is no calmness enough for this golf course for the U.S. Open and being able to enjoy that.   
 Q.  How do you do that?  How do you maintain that patience and that calm?  What do you do?  
GABY LOPEZ: Well, I try to do, you know, pretty much same as everyone.  Just try to live the moment.  Trying to be patient, trying to be -- sometimes to me, seeing it as a good option, and I don't know.  I guess, you know, take it as another tournament.   
I've played well the last couple weeks, and I've kind of known myself a little bit more under pressure, and that has helped a lot for sure.  And then, I don't know, I just got to keep learning from my mistakes and hopefully get better.   
 Q.  Having your name so far up the leaderboard has got to be very pleasing to you.  What do you do to try to win this thing now?  
GABY LOPEZ: Try to do the same thing that I did today.  Give myself as many birdie chances as I can, play smart.  Tomorrow, probably the pin positions are going to be a little bit more tucked in, and I've just got to be aggressive with my wedge play and probably a little bit more safe on the par 3s, I guess.   
It's key to have a good play on the par 3s.
