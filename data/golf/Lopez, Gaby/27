Q. Well played today.  Tough.
GABY LOPEZ: Yes.  It's windy and it's hot, so you got to keep hydrated and eat something every couple holes.
Q. It's a real test of the patience.  What is the key to playing well in these blustery, windy conditions?
GABY LOPEZ: I guess, you know, just being focused on every shot, in the very, very present.
The wind can take you all over the place if you let it.  Just hitting solid shots, doing what you actually can do.
It's tough out there.  You know, it's good opportunity to have fun out there.
Q. This is a chance for you to shine.  You must be loving this week.  We're in paradise here.  For your season, to be playing well and being up toward the top of the leaderboard, you've got to be thrilled.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I'm actually very excited to see lots of improvements in my game, and I'm hitting solid shots when I need to.  I'm just very proud that time has actually showed up.
Q. It has.  So what's been the difference this week for you?
GABY LOPEZ: Just being very calm with myself, knowing that I'm actually giving 100% to what I actually can have.  Not being stressed about the result and about I can't do.  Accepting what is actually coming and trying to give it all and see what happens.
