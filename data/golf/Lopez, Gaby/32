 Q.  8-under bogey-free today.  What was working so well for you?  
GABY LOPEZ: You know, I just I think all a mindset.  I know I can hit the shots.  It was just keeping myself away from being Gaby in the golf course.   
Today I was, you know what?  I don't care what's going to happen.  I don't care where the ball is going to go.  I'm just going to make my swing.  I think that's exactly what I did.   
I was playing really well last week and this week.  I was feeling good sensations, good feelings.  But, yeah, I think it was more look a mindset overall.   
 Q.  You had a good first day here.  Kind of struggled yesterday.  Do you feel this is a golf course you can really excel at?  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah.  I think it's demanding off the tee.  You got to put yourself in position in the fairway just because the greens are pretty firm, so hitting it off the rough is not going to spin as much.   
It's also so many birdie opportunities that you got to be patient.  The last thing I remember is just being 8-under on the last hole, so I can't tell you that remember a lot.   
 Q.  How much momentum will you bring into the final round tomorrow, especially with a birdie on 18?  
GABY LOPEZ: Good.  I think lots of momentum.  But at the same time, you know, just the same belief that I've been building in myself and not letting the score determine the player I am and just enjoy Gaby outside.
