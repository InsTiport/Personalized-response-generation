 Q.  Top-10 finish at the Women's Open is still something very good for your rÃ©sumÃ©, I'm sure?  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I've been working really, really hard.  And just I think the LPGA brings the best out of my game.  And every week is a new experience.  It's an amazing adventure out here.  I totally love it.  I worked so really, really hard.  And I'm really, really excited for what's next in my career.   
 Q.  Wearing your Mexican colors today, did you get some support out there?  
GABY LOPEZ: Yes, I did.  I love to finish the tournament wearing the Mexican colors.  It's always an honor and pleasure to represent my country at the highest level in golf.   
 Q.  How about the golf course today?  Where did sit, in terms of the four rounds, in terms of difficulty?  
GABY LOPEZ: I think today played the hardest, because it was windy and the pin locations weren't that easy to get, and to get very close for birdie opportunity.  So I think you have to be more than patient of any day and look for the spaces so you can actually attack the hole.  Even with a long putt, you better have a chance maybe in the bunker or the rough.   
But you know it's a championship golf course, for sure, and I'm really happy that we get to play in CordeValle golf course.   
 Q.  As a player who's just beginning her professional career, a good finish like this, what do you take from it?  
GABY LOPEZ: I take a lot of the notions, a lot of great shots.  I really believe that I belong on this Tour and hopefully I can follow Lorena Ochoa's steps along the way.  And try to focus on my game and create my own path.
