Q. Pretty good round.  You'll take it.
GABY LOPEZ: Yes.
Q. How are you feeling right now?
GABY LOPEZ: Good.  It's hot out there, but, you know, it's a fun tournament.  I really like this tournament.  I don't know why not many people play it.  I just feel that it's fun to play around the wind and dogleg par 4s, and the greens are slopey.
So, I mean, I guess it's -- you got to hit it good to get it close.
Q. Maybe a fun challenge out there, a combination of where we are in the resort and everything?
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, exactly, and especially my birthday is on Friday, so kind of makes it extra special.  Yeah, it's really fun to be out here.
Q. How do you feel you played today?  Bit of a back-and-forth and up-and-down kind of day for you.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I hit the ball really well.  You know, I think it's about being in the right place on the tee or on the greens.  I feel very solid.
A little disappointed with actually one swing that cost me a lot.  You know, it's golf.  You got to accept what it brings you.  You got to take the good stuff.
Q. May I ask what swing that was?
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah.  It was -- I don't know, it was a left-to-right wind and I hit it right in a par-5.  I mean, I was lucky to found the ball.
At the end it's a combination of everything.  It's not one shot what defines your round.  I'm actually really proud that I got the birdie on the last hole.
Q. Tell me about the wind.  We're hearing two, two and a half club wind out there.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, for sure.  There was some times that I was hitting 140 yards and I was hitting 6 irons and it was like a really penetrating 6.
It's fun because sometimes we don't hit that many hybrids or 5-irons into greens, and for sure we did today.  Like No. 9 was playing long; No. 10 was playing long; No -- it was 4 or 5?  I think it's 4.  Those kind of holes -- 5 actually?  Those kind of holes that it demands a lot of presence.  You got to be present to hit a good shot.  If you don't hit a good tee shot you have 230 yards left.  Especially when you're playing in the wind.
So I guess it's fun.  It's a good challenge to play stay in the present.
Q. You seem really happy.  You seem to like this challenge.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, no, I'm actually -- it's kind of -- it's bringing out of best of me, you know.  I think I like this golf course.  I'm playing solid so I'm not worried about anything.  I'm just trying to enjoy this week as it will be the last one.
