Q. Solid start to your round.  A little bit bumpy finish, but how were you feeling out there today?
GABY LOPEZ: Feeling solid.  I mean, to be honest, I think the key here is just to hit great tee shots.  There's a lot of bunkers out there, and you got to be very, very smart to watch your play.  Sometimes hitting a 6-iron rather than 9-iron is the right play.
I think I'm just very confident with how I'm hitting it and made a few putts drop out there, but I think the takeaway is how calm I feel out there and how comfortable I feel out there.  I think that's what every golfer is looking for, just some calmness and peace out there.  You know, just do the best you can.
Q. Why do you think you were so comfortable out there today?
GABY LOPEZ: I love tough golf courses.  I mean, I like the tough conditions.  Last week in Hawaii during tough conditions I shot 5-under.  Just like the tough setup.  Kind of makes me focus more and be more present instead of just trying to think of different stuff.
So, I don't know, I guess that's right now how comfortable I feel with, you know, how precisely has to be.
Q. There are a lot of girls in that 5-under, 4-under, 6-under range.  What's it going to take to step above the rest?
GABY LOPEZ: You know, patience.  These poana greens in the afternoon can get a little bumpy.  I grew up in poana greens and that's the beauty.  I love it.  I'm not afraid of seeing the ball jump right or left; I'm used to that.
I don't know.  Same thing in San Diego.  We kind of play sometimes poana greens, and I think the player that adjusts the best to the greens and the speed is going to be probably the best at the weekend.
