 Q.  Despite the one bogey at the beginning of the round, you were able to really pick it up after that and finish strong.  Overall assessment after this tournament.  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, you know, yesterday was a little tough for me.  At the end of the day, it's golf.  Sometimes goes your way; sometimes doesn't.   
Today I was able to hit a lot of greens.  Think I hit like 16 greens, and just got to be very, very patient here.  These poana greens are getting firm today.  Was a little cold yesterday so they're getting firmer and faster.   
The quicker you adjust to the speed I guess is the time to make putts.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you adjusted pretty well after yesterday?  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, yesterday I was hitting putts too hard and some of them I was hitting too short.  So yesterday after my round my coach and I worked on some speed control, and that's when I focus today.  Just hitting good solid speed over the greens.   
 Q.  There is going to be some poana greens next week at well.  How will you take this momentum and what you did today here in L.A. to next week in San Francisco?  
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, just be patient.  Yeah, these poana greens can get a little tricky.  At the end of the day, the one that trusts more her stroke is going to putt well.  I think it's all speed.   
I mean, these were a little fast.  Next week for sure they're a little hilly, and I think it's just being able to hit the right speed.   
 Q.  You've done a lot off the course here at Wilshire at well.  How has your time been this week off the golf course as well?  
GABY LOPEZ: It's been the best for.  Many I love to connect with Mexican people.  During the round I'll sign a ball and give it to a little girl.  I think the people behind this event, they deserve way more than they get.  I don't think we appreciate or we're not that aware of all the work that's done behind the scenes.   
Just being able to say thank you to my fellow Mexican workers, tell them how proud I am to represent them as well.
