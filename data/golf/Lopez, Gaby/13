 Q.  Only six birdies were made on this hole all week long from the professionals. You made three of them. Have you ever found yourself a more enduring pressure than you had in the last 24 hours?  
GABY LOPEZ: I don't think so. I was mentally prepared for this last 24 hours. Coming down the stretch yesterday, I knew I needed to birdie this hole to have a chance. I knew Inbee was a couple holes behind and she could birdie 17. She's a birdie machine as well.   
So I don't know, I was very lucky to have a good look at it above the hole, and I was lucky to make it.   
 Q.  You played from well behind coming into yesterday, and you end up with a victory. What did you prove to yourself?  
GABY LOPEZ: You know, I don't need to prove it to anyone else but myself. I proved to myself that I can win in any situation. My first win was in the lead, and now my second win was coming from behind. And being able to put all those moments together and recall them while I'm walking on the fairway here and try to stay patient. I think that's what I proved to myself the most. It was my ability to stay in the moment.   
 Q.  Are you happy you don't have to see this hole again for another 52 weeks?  
GABY LOPEZ: Not really. I mean, I do have a feeling for this hole. I like it. It was a perfect number for me. Yesterday, to be honest, I was hitting 4 hybrid, 3 hybrid, 4 hybrid. The wind was down. The wind was into. It got cold. So it was hard for me to kind of figure out the number, but this morning with my coach, and with my caddie, we kind of figured out the number with the TrackMan, and we knew it was the perfect number for me today.
