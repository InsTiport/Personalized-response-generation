  Q. What a way at the end of your round today.  Just walk us through what was working so well out on the course.
 GABY LOPEZ:   Yeah, the course is playing unbelievably amazing.  Greens are rolling so pure.  We did a great job, my caddie and I, of just getting some numbers when I had in between numbers, and the club selection was key.
 And I just felt more comfortable as the day went on.
 Q. Have you played at this golf course before and what is it about this golf course that's bringing out a good part of your game?
 GABY LOPEZ:   Right.  No, this is my first time competing in this golf course.  I got the chance to play a practice round with Annika and I played with her at Diamond Resorts and she's an amazing player and she gave me some good tips out there.
 She is such an inspiration for everyone and we're so bless and happy to have her back.
 Q. You said also on Instagram how excited you were to have that kind of practice round.  What were some of the tips she gave you?
 GABY LOPEZ:   I guess some tee shot blinds.  She said, don't hit it my way, a little bit more aggressive.  But at the end of the day just being with her just gave me this kind of peaceful environment and just reminded me of how blessed and how thankful I am to have this opportunity to be able to compete with her, just because I remember the seven-year-old Gaby chasing her down the golf course to get a signed golf ball.
 This is a dream come true to be with her.
 Q. Let's take us through some of the highlights on the course today, especially that eagle on No. 15, the Aon Risk-Reward hole.  What were some of the challenges you had and what was that like to be able to put an eagle in your first round today?
 GABY LOPEZ:   Yeah, that was a little surprise.  I been hitting the ball a little further so that's been a good advantage for my game specifically.  I've been able to hit also my driver pretty straight for the second back nine.
 So I don't know.  I just guess when you swing more confident and you hit a little further everything kind of brings up the momentum.  I guess self-talk as well, being able to talk to yourself positively.
 Q. What happened there?  How long was that first drive?  When you reached it in two I believe, correct?
 GABY LOPEZ:   Not sure how far it went, my driver, but I hit 3-wood to the second shot.  It probably just bounced probably couple yards short of the green, and I had like a 25-footer for eagle.  My caddie gave me the perfect read.  He said it was straight and I hit it straight and it went in.
 Q. It's your first round in the books.  What is there to look forward to tomorrow and maybe take some tips from Annika into the second round?
 GABY LOPEZ:   Yeah, I mean, I guess just stay patient.  The golf course is in great shape.  The rough is a good challenge out there.  We have quite a few inches of rough, so being able to hit it in the fairway I guess is a key.
 And being able to just take advantage of those short holes, because the par-3s are playing a little longer than usual.  So, yeah.
 Q. You talked about it a little bit, but we know about Annika's brilliant career.  What is her role in this game right now and just the overall sense of having her out here this week, how important that is?
 GABY LOPEZ:   Yeah, her role in this game, I mean at this time of her career, I guess, is just keep inspiring girls.  I played with her at Diamond Resorts, and I can tell that you she's still as competitive as probably when she was 20 years ago.
 You can see that her short game; putting is still on.  That's something that she has in her veins and is going to shine forever.  She said that she's probably not hitting it as far or straight as she was before, but at the end of the day, I'm going to say it again:  She's my super hero.  Her and Lorena are probably why I'm here.  Being able to share this with them, with her specifically, is just unbelievable.
