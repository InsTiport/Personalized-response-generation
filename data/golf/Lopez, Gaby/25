Q. Happy birthday.  We have two cakes here, one for the hole-in-one and one for the lead.  How good was that?
GABY LOPEZ: Awesome.  You know, I had lots of fun.  And I don't know, I think my caddie and I today did a great job talking (indiscernible) each other.
Q. You got off to a brilliant start:  three birdies through the first three holes.  Playing with Ariya Jutanugarn who is so good, a lot of players would crumble under the pressure.  You thrived.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I been waiting for this moment.  I mean, I'm very lucky to share the course with the best player in the world.  You know, I had fun.  I enjoyed today.  That's all it takes.
Q. How much did you enjoy that tee shot on 17?  Tell us about the shot.
GABY LOPEZ: As soon as the ball left the club I knew it was a good shot, but I couldn't see because the sun was in my face.  I turned around and my caddie goes, It went in.  I'm like, No way.  And the camera guy told us, Yes, it did.  I couldn't give myself a better birthday present.
Q. First hole in one?
GABY LOPEZ: This is my eighth.
Q. Eighth?  So this is a birthday to remember.
GABY LOPEZ: Yes.  Just very lucky and happy to be here.  I'm enjoying the moment for sure it's good afternoon ever been a long way to get here many we done nothing yet.  18 more holes to go.
You know, just try enjoy as much as possible on whatever happens tomorrow.
Q. It's going to be a big day for you, but this is what dreams are all about.
GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I practice every single day for this.  I'm not keeping score.  I'm trying to hit the best shot possible.
