Q. Gaby, thanks for taking the time with us.  Second round under your belt.  How do you feel with two more rounds to go?
GABY LOPEZ:   I'm feeling fine.  I feel that the golf course is in amazing conditions, the greens are rolling extremely good.  They are so pure, so fast.  So I don't know, I feel that just got to get that speed back into play for the weekend.  They're going to get probably drier, a little firmer, and probably a little faster.  And, yeah.
Q. What did you think was the most -- what was the high of today and the low today?
GABY LOPEZ:   Probably the high today was making some putts that gave me momentum.  The low was that I kind of felt a little bit low in energy probably on 16.  We had to wait a little bit longer than usual.  So that was probably, I don't know, get down.
But, yeah, I'm going to rest today.  It's been four weeks since I haven't probably walked four days in a row 18 holes, so I'm just going to take a good rest and be ready for tomorrow.
Q. Speaking of rest, how do you rest, especially during tournament weeks?  We talked to some players, maybe catch up On the Bachelor?  How do you rest?
GABY LOPEZ:   I like to go to the physio room to get treatment.  I usually also do the Normatec boots, be able to get my fresh legs for tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll watch a movie, I'll have good dinner with my family, kind of disconnect with from golf a little bit, and come back fresh tomorrow.
Q. Is the game plan still the same for the next two days?
GABY LOPEZ:   Yes.  There is a ton of birdie opportunities out there, so just being patient is the key.  Just trying to hit some good putts with good speed so the ball drops kind of the last roll and not try to hit the back of the cup.  These greens are so fast.
But, yeah.  Stay aggressive mentally and physically loose.
Q. Last question, promise.  Who did you look forward to playing with tomorrow?
GABY LOPEZ:   I guess everyone.  I mean, everyone out here has amazing backgrounds with so many successful careers.  To be able to learn from all of them, it's great.  I played with Mardy Fish last year probably three rounds or two rounds, and that was awesome.
Probably play again tomorrow with him.  I would like to do that, but probably I'm not in that position yet.
Yeah, still, everyone around here is super fun.  Yeah.
