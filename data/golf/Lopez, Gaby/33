Q. How are you feeling?  How did you do out there?GABY LOPEZ: Good.  I enjoyed a lot this round.  I think it was one of the most rounds that I've enjoyed in the last two weeks.Q. Really?GABY LOPEZ: Yeah.Q. Why is that?GABY LOPEZ: I don't know, my brother just kept me laughing the whole way, and either I missed a shot or I make a good shot, he would just not stop making me laugh.  It was really, really fun.  He kept me a lot in the present.  I was just focused on the here and the now, and without knowing, I birdied the last five out of six holes.Q. And you didn't even know it?GABY LOPEZ: I mean, my teammate came up to me, she's like, you birdied five of the last six holes.  I'm like, no way.  I bogeyed one, I know that.  She's like, really, you know that.  But it was fun.Q. Who told you that?GABY LOPEZ: Summar Roachell, my teammate.  I'm so glad that she came up today and watched me.  My mom, she was another huge support for me.  She enjoyed it a lot.  I think that it was really different from yesterday because she was really, really surprised.  You could see her face, it was just like panicking the whole way.  I don't know, I think I'm just going to take it one day at a time, enjoy this day, and today is a new day.  Can't control what happens tomorrow, but can control what I can do today, which is rest and get in the cold tub --Q. Get in the cold tub?GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, it's been painful the last two weeks, but I've been doing it.Q. Last two weeks you've been in the cold tub?GABY LOPEZ: In the cold tub.Q. Where do you do that?GABY LOPEZ: Just in the shower.  I put water and I put like 20 pounds of ice, and I just drop in, yeah.  I mean, that's the only way I can do it to recover fast and move on to the two weeks in a row that I have.Q. Who taught you that?GABY LOPEZ: In my University, you know, it's always been, oh, you have to get in the cold tub after the gym and working out, and I hate the cold tub.  It's one of the worst things I can do.  But now that I know it's necessary, I do it.Q. I did want to ask you in the stretch of birdies that you sort of remember, were you hitting them all really tight, or was it your iron play?  Were you draining putts?GABY LOPEZ: I was draining putts everywhere.  No. 10, I had an eagle opportunity for like 18 feet and left it like a couple inches short, made birdie, and then the next hole, I was above the hole, 11, and I made like a 40-footer for birdie.  And then the next hole, I made bogey, and then the next hole I made like another maybe 20-footer, and then the next hole I made a 45-footer, and on the last hole I made a six-footer for birdie from the bunker, on the par-5.Q. She must have just been shaking her head, like this girl needs to go away.GABY LOPEZ: I know.  It was fun.  Actually I haven't made a lot of putts in the last two weeks.  My brother is a judge.  He can be the witness.  He's like, you just made everything you haven't done in two weeks, or six months.  I'm like, thank you, for six months.  But when you're relaxed and when you're in the present and when you sort of feel that it's going in, it's going in, and that's the magic of golf.  I love it.  That's why I keep in love with this golf, with this sport.Q. When you feel like everything -- say that again, it's the magic of golf?GABY LOPEZ: That's like the beauty of golf, and I think it's the magic of golf, how sometimes when you feel it, you do it, and no one is going to stop you because when you're in the zone and when you think that you can do it, you'll do it.  Making three 40-footers, it's impressive for me.  I don't make that many, especially in five holes.  It's been, I think, all the hard work pays off, and even though I struggled the first two rounds in medal play, finally all my putts dropped in, and hopefully they keep dropping.Q. Maybe the cold shower won't feel as bad?GABY LOPEZ: Yeah, I think the weather was -- it's a perfect day.  A perfect day.  Can't complain about this.  I was just really, really happy with everything, and I just think that it's going to be a good week.  It's my last U.S. Amateur.  I'm prepared to face any shot, and I don't know, whatever is going to happen, I'll be happy with it.
