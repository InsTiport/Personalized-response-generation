Q. Who are you picking to get to the Super Bowl? 
BRIAN URLACHER: That's a tough one. I was going to pick Pittsburgh, but I think Ben's hurt. I'm going to pick Seattle and Denver in the Super Bowl, and I'm going to take Seattle to win it‑‑ or Arizona. I'm not sure yet. What do you think?

Q. I'm thinking Seattle's probably going to get there, for some strange reason. 
BRIAN URLACHER: They've got to beat Carolina this weekend and got to beat Arizona next weekend, if Arizona beats Green Bay. You have my pick then? Hope it works out.
