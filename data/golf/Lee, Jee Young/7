  Q.  How did you play today?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  I played very well.  But she's a great putter, and I was so nervous.  I hit it good in the fairway, and then that made it easier for my second shot.   
  
  Q.  Are you ready to play 18 more?  Are you nervous still, or are you excited?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  Well, it's exciting.
