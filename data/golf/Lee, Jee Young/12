PAUL ROVNAK:  Jee Young, thanks for coming in.  A great tournament.  You shot 6 under today.  You and Lorena had a little battle going there, she would birdie, you would birdie.  Go ahead and give us your thoughts on the day and we'll take questions.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  I don't think that I looked today.  Like I said yesterday, I enjoyed playing a great player, a top player.  I didn't play bad.  I played well, but she played better than I, so I learned a lot today.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll go ahead and take questions whenever you guys are ready.
Q.  I believe through 13 holes that she had 5 birdies and an eagle and actually was still down.  Could you just ask her if it was a little frustrating.  She was playing so well, but she wasn't able to ever get the lead from her.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Actually, I was not frustrated at all.  I played my game.  What I was concerned with was just my score, not her score, so I played well today.
Q.  Can you talk about your eagle and the momentum you had going into the back nine?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  The first several holes I couldn't make a birdie.  But No. 9, I eagled so I felt okay.  And then I was on my way and I could play well.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us over your scorecard, to the best of your memory.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 4, the par 5.  What you hit in and how many steps.
