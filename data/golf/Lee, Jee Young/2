   THE MODERATOR: All right, Jee Young. Thank you very much for coming in. You're at 6-under par, and you're co-leader again.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah.  
 THE MODERATOR: Just like yesterday. Just tell us how you played today.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I played good today. My shot was really good, but I missed a lot of putts. So I just make 1-under. You know, I just misread it just one, one time.   
 Tomorrow hopefully it'll work.   
 THE MODERATOR: How did you enjoy today's delay?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Oh, you know, yeah. That's okay. You know, I was hungry, so I just eat a lot, and I was talking to my friends.  
 THE MODERATOR: What did you eat?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Wing.  
 THE MODERATOR: Chicken wing?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah.   
 THE MODERATOR: I saw that. Any questions for Jee Young in the back?   
  
  Q. Just one birdie and you find yourself joined together. How do you feel?  
 THE MODERATOR: How do you feel about being the co-leader right now?   
  
  Q. Despite a birdie. You only had one birdie.   
 THE MODERATOR: You had two birdies; right?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Two birdies.  
 THE MODERATOR: Two birdies, one bogey. How do you feel about being the co-leader even though you only had two birdies today?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know, this morning I feel a little bit, you know, like my body a little tight. So I just trying to like try to smooth swing, and you know, still just trying to smooth it. Yeah.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing after the rain?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: The course?   
  
  Q. Yeah. How is the course playing after the rain?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know, the air is heavy, so I just one club more, and then tried to easy shot and the best worked.  
  
  Q. Is it added pressure for you to start tomorrow as the leader? Yes?  
 THE MODERATOR: More pressure being in the lead?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Oh, absolutely. Yeah.   
 THE MODERATOR: How will you deal with the pressure?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Deal?   
 THE MODERATOR: Will you do anything differently tonight or tomorrow morning?   
  
  Q. Will you sleep tonight?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I just try to call my mom and talking about tomorrow and just relax and shower.   
  
  Q. Is this the first time that you are going to go into the third round as a leader or co-leader?  
 THE MODERATOR: Have you ever had the lead entering the final round?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah, a couple times. But I hit really bad, so I didn't make it.   
 THE MODERATOR: Anything else? All right. Thank you so much.
