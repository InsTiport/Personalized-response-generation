   JASON TAYLOR: Good round today, 6-under. You have a one-shot lead right now after your first round. Seven birdies, just one bogey. Not too bad.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah.   
 JASON TAYLOR: If you would just talk a little bit about how you feel.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I was hit pretty good today. Lot of times keep in the fairway, driver. A lot of easy birdies there, so I can make birdie.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You said you kept it in the fairway good today. Have you played here the last couple of years?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah, last year first year.   
  
  Q. Different time of the year. Some players have said the rough is maybe not really deep but thicker than before. Are you more worried about the rough here this year than before because it's thicker?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah, little bit thicker. Rough is a little bit deeper. I really hit it longer, so I can get out, easy get out. Is not difficult.   
  
  Q. You had a morning tee time. Some players said early that the greens were maybe a little faster than they thought they would be. Did you notice that early in the day? Were the greens fast as far as putting?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I think same as yesterday. This week is a little fast than Corning last two weeks.   
 So I think we're better control hitting, yeah, so...   
  
  Q. Your second round at Corning you had a 67, a good day. Does that sound right?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yes.   
  
  Q. Did you do a lot of things that day that you were able to do today, a lot of good things happening?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Corning?   
  
  Q. Yes.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: No, not really. Like Corning is like ball going anywhere. Last week I went to Orlando, and my coach there, a lot of practice. You know, more consistence.   
  
  Q. Who is your coach or your teacher down in Orlando?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Right now is Andrew Park.   
  
  Q. Have you worked with him for a while now?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yes.  
  
  Q. The field here is very good this week. A lot of the top players. Is that more exciting for you, knowing the competition is going to be really good this week? Do you get excited about that or do you not think about what other players are here?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: But I think about more concentration golf. Second things is money. First thing is on the course, just hit it, every hole I concentration.   
  
  Q. The year this year you've had, have you been happy overall or do you feel like you need to improve on certain things? How would you describe your year so far?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: This year is I think not good this year because I changed coach this year, this winter. He change swing little bit. More consistence. But I think is okay. Getting better now, yeah.   
  
  Q. You said is the swing making you have more distance?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Consistence.   
  
  Q. As far as staying in the fairway?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah, uh-huh.   
  
  Q. You had a 66. There's still a lot of players out there. Do you think a 66 might stay in the lead or do you think with the course and conditions somebody could go lower than that today?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I think a lot of great players out there. So I think is couple players out there maybe leader and more good playing, yeah. Think so.   
  
  Q. Is this one of the best first days you've had in a while to get off to a good start?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Uh-huh, yeah. You mean first day?   
  
  Q. You had a very good score here the first day. Is this one of the best first-round scores you've had in a while?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Oh, yes, uh-huh.   
 JASON TAYLOR: It's her best round this year. Season low.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Because first couple tournaments I start 1-over four tournaments in a row. So this is good.   
  
  Q. So this is better?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah, way better (laughter).   
  
  Q. I hate to bring this up. The Kraft Nabisco, you had kind of a tough second day.   
 JEE YOUNG LEE: 80.   
  
  Q. Anything that went wrong that day? Do you have days like that sometimes where things just don't go right? Was there a certain problem that day?  
 JEE YOUNG LEE: There was freezing windy, like 50 mile almost. Balls going anywhere, in water, out of bounds. Like next two days, played okay. So, yeah, not many problems.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Thank you.
