Q.  How did you feel about your round today?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  I had a very good condition starting today.  I had a very good feeling about doing it, but my driver wasn't working quite good.  I wasn't hitting the fairways at all, so that was one of the drawbacks on today's round.
Q.  Tomorrow what do you need to do to put yourself closer to Stanford?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  I have a very good feeling of iron shots.  I'm shooting really great.  I'm going to try to work on my irons and my drivers and putters, and then we'll have a good round tomorrow.
