PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks for coming in and talking to us again.  Another great round today, 5 under today, 11 under for the tournament.  Right now you're tied for the lead.  Just give us some opening comments on her day again and we'll take some questions.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  From the beginning of the tournament she was very confident.  So every shot, every driver, iron shot, putting, everything was really good.  But today she missed like 5, 6 birdie chances by lipping putts.
Q.  Could she say what holes she missed birdie chances at and how far the putts were?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  No. 4 and 5 and 6 and 9, 15 and 16.
Q.  When you missed makable birdie putts in a row at 4, 5 and 6, is it difficult to stay calm and play the way she normally can play?  Was it a little frustrating for her?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Actually, missing the putts at 4, 5, and 6, didn't affect her game at all.  Actually, starting this tournament at No. 1, she made a birdie.  She used two kinds of gripping in her putting.  Today she used a putting overlapping style.  She tried that and missed 4, 5, 6, and then she came back to her original putting grip.
Q.  The only three holes that she used that overlapping style was 4, 5 and 6?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes, 1 to 6.
Q.  What grip did she use yesterday in the first round?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Two kinds.
Q.  How long have you been putting with two different grips?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  From a long time ago she tried both ways, and yesterday both grips was going really well.  She feels really good about her putting these days, but not today.
Q.  The first six holes she used a different overlapping grip than what she used yesterday?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yesterday she used both of them.  Normally she uses both of them.
Q.  She did not overlap yesterday?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  She used both grips yesterday.
Q.  Has your teacher ever told you to settle on one grip or the other?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Actually putting depends on feel, so she was not instructed this way or that way.
Q.  Has she ever tried the claw grip that some of the guys use, like Chris DiMarco?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  A long time ago one of her coaches asked her to use that kind of grip but she didn't like it.
Q.  You're tied right now for the lead with Soo Yun Kang.  What is the relationship you have with other golfers from South Korea?  Do you feel competition with them?  Do you feel friendship with them?  What's the relationship like?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  She cannot deny the competition among Korean players.  But on the other hand, she knows that golf is actually against oneself, so she wants to overcome herself.
Q.  Could you ask her what a victory would mean to her, winning here on tour?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  As you know, she is a rookie this year, and winning a tournament this year means that it proves that she has overcome herself and she has won herself and she will realize how much she will have to make an effort to keep up her position.
