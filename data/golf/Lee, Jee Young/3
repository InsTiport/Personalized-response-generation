   THE MODERATOR: All right, Jee Young. Thanks for coming in. You played really well out there today. 5-under par and then nice par on 9 to stay at 5-under par that we saw on TV. Just tell us a little bit about your round, please. 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Actually, I hit it really good today, and a lot of sand on putting green. Green, a lot of sand there, so I can control, like spin control. 
 So it was really difficult, but I had a good putt a couple of shots, so that's why. 
 THE MODERATOR: Now, this is a really short course. 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah.
 THE MODERATOR: And you're a really long hitter. So how does it set up for you? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know, I hit driver like only three, four times. So I just hit like -- I just concentrate like on fairway and greens. 
 THE MODERATOR: So you're hitting your 3-wood a lot? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah. 3-wood and rescue and a couple irons.
 THE MODERATOR: Can you tell us about how you've been playing this year? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know, I played great, good at the end of last year, and I saw changes a little bit last year, but it doesn't work. So I just come to my old coach. So feels better now. 
 THE MODERATOR: What's your coach's name? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Tony Ziegler. Yeah, I have three coaches actually. I have shot coach and short game coach and putting coach. 
 THE MODERATOR: Wow. 

 Q. So what changes did the coach do that worked for you that improved your game?
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know, my swing is like a little bit -- very short, very short. But last year I changed coach, like he's a technical coach. 
 THE MODERATOR: Now you're more about feel? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah. Feel shot.
 THE MODERATOR: Just feeling rather than having a technical golf swing. 

 Q. Feeling good for tomorrow? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: I just try hard, and you know, I concentrate on my goal like hole by hole. 
 THE MODERATOR: What did you do during the delay? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: You know what, that happens a lot of times like this year and last year, last couple years. So I don't care about that. 
 THE MODERATOR: What did you do? Eat? Listen to music? 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Yeah. Eat and talking. Yeah. 
 THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you so much. 
 JEE YOUNG LEE: Thank you.
