 Q.   Well played, can you what a specific round, can you tell us a little bit about how it went?   You had three birdies on the front nine.   What sort of clicked for you today?

JEE YOUNG LEE:   Yeah, much.   
   
 Q.   Much harder?   
JEE YOUNG LEE:   Yes, much harder than yesterday.   
   
 Q.   And then you were going very strong and then you had a bogey on the 17th, what happened there?   
JEE YOUNG LEE:   Pulled my driver and then I just hit hybrid.   
   
 Q.   Happy?   
JEE YOUNG LEE:   I think it's okay.  
   
 Q.   And what do you like about links golf?   
JEE YOUNG LEE:   Kind of windy, but wide open fairways, so hit it anywhere.
