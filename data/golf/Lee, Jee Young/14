PAUL ROVNAK:  Jee Young, thanks for coming in.  A terrific round today, 6 under par and you're tied for the lead.  What was working best for you out there today?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  A couple of weeks ago her irons have been very stable, putting was not good.  But today the fairway is wide open.  Iron shots and putting was good.
Q.  After the first round last week in Portland with a 64, obviously she's in good position again this week.  What happened in the last two rounds last week that she would like to do differently this week?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Last week she was too aggressive with her driver from time to time.  But this fairway is really wide open.  She wants to keep it in the fairway.  She'll be a little bit prudent.  She thinks she'll do well.
Q.  (No microphone.)
JEE YOUNG LEE:  There's less run, but it's a wide open fairway.
Q.  With her having won the tournament last year in Korea and the way she's been playing lately over here, does she have the confidence that she might be the next great young Korean golfer on this tour?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Of course she hopes to be a great young player in Korea.  But as time goes by she got accustomed to the association in the United States.  Not many games are left this year, but she wants to do really great.  And if possible, she wants to win the game this year.
Q.  She wants to win a tournament before the year is over?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes, if possible.
Q.  What was she doing that was particularly good when she was on a string of birdies?  She had six birdies and an eagle?  What was she doing?  Was she driving well?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Putting, the green is not the best.  She can be kind of aggressive in her putting.
Q.  Is there a Korean player in particular that she would like to model her career after, somebody she really admires?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Se Ri Pak and Hyun Ahn.
Q.  Is she friends with them?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Hyun is closest to her.  And Se Ri Pak, they are on good terms with each other, but due to an age gap, not that close.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Let's go over your scorecard.  We can start on No. 11, if you want to, because you started on the back side, correct, the par 5?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  6 iron, over green, 10 yard chip and one putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  6 iron over the green?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And then you chipped?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you remember how far the putt was?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Maybe three feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Birdie on 12, the par 4.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  You'll have to ask my caddie.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Is your caddie here?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  He's on the putting green.
PAUL ROVNAK:  I'll just get it from your caddie.
