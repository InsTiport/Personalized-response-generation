   PAM WARNER:  Great round out there, 3-under, do you just want to talk about how you played today?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  The wind was blowing crazy today and it was very tough to play, but I practiced in orange county Country Club in Orlando, Florida during winter practice and they have a very strong wind out there.  I think that paid off, practicing there.   
  
  Q.  What's the hardest part about playing in the wind out here, the most difficult part of playing in the wind?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  (Inaudible.)   
Q.  Do you think the 66 is going to hold up?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  There's a lot of wind.  So as long as you use the wind to your favor, the scores should be better and predicting about 12- or 13-under for the winning score.   
  
  Q.  Will the 66 today hold up?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  I think it will hold up.   
  
  Q.  What did you work on in the off-season?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  My weakest point was the accuracy on irons, and so I was decreasing the distance on irons but improving the accuracy.  And that was the most important part that I practiced.   
 And I'm struggling with short game, like putting and bunkers and chip shots and I've been working on those things.   
  
  Q.  Who is your instructor at Orange County?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  Tony Zigla (ph).  His father is a senior pro.   
  
  Q.  What are some of your goals and objectives this year?  What are some things you're trying to accomplish?   
 JEE YOUNG LEE:  After I become -- inaudible -- I want to win an LPGA title, so I want to win every single tournament this year.
