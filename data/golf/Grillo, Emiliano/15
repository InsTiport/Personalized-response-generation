 Q.  Great round today, 5-under today, five birdies.  Talk about your round.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: I just stayed patient.  I hit some great shots coming back, and I think the key today was playing from the fairway.   
 Q.  17 has got a nice pin placement for you guys today, and you birdied it.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, I had a perfect distance today, a little bit downwind, and it was a perfect gap wedge.  All I had to do was just aim it a little bit right and then make the putt.   
 Q.  18, tell us how that's playing today.  It's kind of a beast, isn't it?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, it's kind of playing similar to the other days, a little in from the left.  I think that's the toughest tee shot on the entire TOUR.  It was a good tee shot, a good second shot.  I was able to hit a good putt, I just left it a little bit short of the hole.   
 Q.  14 greens out there in these windy conditions.  Talk about that.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, it definitely got tougher today than the past couple days, but we were able to hit a lot of greens today, and the ones that we missed were right there on the edge or we were able to get a few up-and-downs in there and keep the round going.   
 Q.  You had 99 feet in putts.  Were the greens getting crusty at all?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: I think the little rain this morning helped a little bit, otherwise it would be as dry as it gets.  Not like last year, but it's getting very firm, and hopefully -- we were lucky to have that rain this morning.   
 Q.  Talk me through the 2 at 17.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, we had a perfect distance.  It was 126, a little bit downwind.  I hit my 52 about 122, so it was just a full shot in there and just keep it right of the flag, and it was a putt about seven feet.
