  JOHN DEVER:   Good afternoon.  Welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship here at TPC Harding Park.  We are pleased to be joined by Emiliano Grillo.  Opening round 70, a lot of pars, which is steady.  One bogey, one birdie.  Give us your take on the whole thing together.
 EMILIANO GRILLO:   I started hitting it well and then all of a sudden I wasn't hitting so well.  I played pretty well off the tee and then I wasn't able to hit it close from the fairway, which is a shame.  If you play from the fairway here, you're going to have a lot of chances, and that wasn't the case.  I was able to make the ones for par, and then I just missed one on the back nine, I think it was hole No. 5, and like you say, a lot of pars.
 JOHN DEVER:   Thank you for stopping by.
