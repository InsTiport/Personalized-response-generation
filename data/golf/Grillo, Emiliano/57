Q.   Your thoughts on this round of 66 today?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   It was great playing for me today tee‑to‑green and on the green, I played very well.   Just a shame those bogeys on 16 and 17, I got a little bit nervous after the chip on 16.   I was under control before that, and, well, made a good putt on 18 that got me a chance, and a good tournament.

Q.   Start of play today, did you fancy you still had a chance? 
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Kind of.   I knew that I needed a good round, like I did a little bit better maybe.   But the guys out there, there are some pins that are not easy out there.   I think you can see on the scores and the leaders, they have got a little bit of pressure, and hitting it close is not easy. 
So I just have to wait and see how they do.

Q.   We've seen you have some excellent rounds on The European Tour, but I guess this has to be right there up there, isn't it? 
EMILIANO GRILLO:   It has to be because of the situation.   It was a good moment to get a good round, especially with my situation of the ranking.   I think it was a great week for me.
