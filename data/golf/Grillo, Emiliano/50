 Q.   Your thoughts on today, backing up yesterday, I know you finished with seven birdies today and you got another right at the start today.   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, it was good to start with another birdie today.   I think that makes it eight in a row.   Yeah, I played very good on the front nine, which is the back nine.   I played very well.   Just one bogey on that side and made another birdie on No.2.   
But you know, my game just went a little bit down after that, and you know, I closed with a nice birdie on the last one with a chip‑in from the right rough.   I'm really happy where I'm positioned for the weekend.   At the moment, I think I'm three shots behind, so I'm in a good position for the weekend.   That's all that matters.  
   
 Q.   When you chip‑in at the last to eradicate any thought of bogeys before, that makes it all the happier, doesn't it?  
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, definitely is going to make lunch taste better, that's for sure.   It's always nice to close with a birdie, especially with a chip‑in.   It's the first one of the year.   I actually complained this week that I haven't had one so far.   Hopefully there will be many on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   You said last week you feel ready to win.   Presumably you're feeling very confident about your game, putting round upon round together like this.   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, definitely.   Usually my long game, it's the strongest one and it's not been happening, it's the opposite.   So I think I need to get better on that and I need to work a little bit on that and I just have to let my putter, just let it go and let it work like it's been doing.   I think I'm going to have a good chance if I hit it from the fairway.
