Q. (No microphone) on 16?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, on 16, I had a very difficult putt on the hill.
On 17, I was ready to hit, and the official told me not to hit, and then they waited a minute to blow the horn.  So I'm kind of pissed about that, but it is what it is.  I had to -- I had to go home with ten shots instead of eight or maybe seven, what I was thinking the way I was playing.  But it is what it is, and tomorrow will be another day.
Q. What did you do during the delay?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Nothing, just waited.
Q. Did you feel like you were kind of back in rhythm and then you had to kind of wait an extra minute there?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Well, it just -- I was ready to hit, and then they told me not to hit it, and then they waited a minute to blow the horn.  So it's kind of a bad thing down there.
Instead of hitting a driver on 17, I'd be hitting a 3 wood and my second shot from the fairway most likely.
