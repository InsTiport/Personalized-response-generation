Q.   Tough finish, but I mean you gave it a good run, got yourself in a playoff on a TOUR event and gave yourself a chance.   Can you give your thoughts on that last?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah.   It's definitely a tough one to shall Whoa, that's for sure, but I would take a playoff at the beginning of the week and have a chance to win the tournament. 
You know, it's hard, it's not the case, but it was a good week overall, and you know, the goal was to get in next week, and I'm happy with that, but still have to keep working, to keep grinding and to have a chance next week.

Q.   What's a finish like this do for your confidence?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Well, it's sort of a mix.   It gives me the confidence I can win out here as well, but I'm still looking for my first win on the big TOUR, but it's one shot today, and you know, it feels like I should have won this tournament by four or five shots, but it is what it is.

Q.   Take us through 18 in regulation.   You and Jon were both in kind of the same position there.   He said he had a lot of nerves.   Were you kind of going through the same stuff?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Well, I knew that I just need to hit an okay shot and try and give me a chance to make a 4.   I knew that his ball was not a good lie and he had a hard shot from there. 
You know, I wasn't nervous.   I really don't know, that last went by very quick, and maybe I should have take more time.   I don't know, I have to learn from these things that happen and move on.
