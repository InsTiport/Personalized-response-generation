 Q.  I didn't get a chance to see any of the match.  Can you tell me how it went?  Obviously you played well?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, definitely played great on the front nine.  It's a great format.  He started playing well on the back nine.  And he started closing the gap.  But I was able to hold in there.  It's a very difficult course.  Most of the holes out here, par is a good score.  And you're going to win holes with pars, and you're going to lose a lot.   
 Q.  What do you think the key was getting off to such a good start?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: J.B. unfortunately made a bunch of mistakes on the front nine, and I was able to execute the shots to win the holes and make pars or sometimes birdies.  I made I think two birdies on the front.  I played great on the front nine.  On the back nine I knew if I keep making pars it was going to be enough.   
 Q.  Do you think beating a good player like J.B. gives you some confidence for your next match?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Definitely.  I know the next match is going to be against a top player in the world.  I knew if today's match give me some confidence, tomorrow will be good.  Even if I didn't play good enough to win your match, it's something good.  And tomorrow I'm going to have to play again maybe the same way and hopefully I can get it done, as well.
