 Q.  What are your thoughts on finishing in style with four successive birdies?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: To be there to have a chance tomorrow, I needed a strong finish but I didn't expect four in a row.  Very pleased with today and move on for tomorrow.   
I hit it well, just a couple of shots here and there, I couldn't make a putt on the first 15 holes.  2-putts on 15 and that's it.   
 Q.  A bit windy out there, made it pretty tricky.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: The pins were a bit harder today.  I think tomorrow, I don't think the course is going to play this difficult, at least with the pins.  There is some tricky pins out there.  If you manage to hit it well, you can score.   
 Q.  You obviously scored terrifically well yesterday, so presumably more of the same, is just what the doctor will need for the final day, isn't it?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, I guess I need a low one tomorrow or I won't have a chance.  There's some big names in front of me and I know I need to catch them with a good round.
