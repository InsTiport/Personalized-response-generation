 Q.   What are your thoughts on back‑to‑back 66s?  
EMILIANO GRILLO:   I think I'm swinging well.   I'm playing well.   So good indication for a week that hopefully ends up better than these past two days.   It's been a rough couple months, personal and on the golf course, so I'm quite happy so far.  
   
 Q.   Is this a course where you like and see the chances?  
EMILIANO GRILLO:   It was okay, and I think I've found something special this week and like I say, I hope to keep finding it out there on the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Have you actually found something in your game, something that wasn't there over the last few months?   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   I've made a few changes in my equipment and the changes I've made, they are working out, so like I say, I hope they continue working out.   I've been working hard and it's paying off.   
   
 Q.   Certainly don't want to pry into personal things, but what have the problems been over the past couple months?   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   My dad passed away in December, so it's been a couple long six months.   So it's been a long six months so far, and a lot to deal back home.   Pretty sure he's happy seeing me playing so I'm happy with that.  
   
 Q.   Golf has to take a second seat then, doesn't it, really.   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   That's right.   I've learned a lot with that.   I've learned a lot of things about life, so I think I'm growing up faster.
