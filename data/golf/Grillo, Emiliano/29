EMILIANO GRILLO: I played well.  Played well tee to green and made a few putts out there.  It worked pretty well.  The conditions are absolutely perfect.  There's not a single grass out of place on this golf course.  The greens were absolutely perfect this morning.  It was hard and the ball was going far.  So everything was good to post a good score there.
Q. What was the most challenging out there?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Well, you have got to play from the fairway.  When you go in the rough, it seems short, but it's very tricky out there.  If you miss the greens on the wrong spot, you are going to struggle for up-and-down.  These greens are tricky.
Sometimes you see they go right or left and they end up going left to right.  You have got to pay a lot of attention out there.  It's a very hard golf course.  You can see on the scores.
Q. How are you enjoying it so far?
EMILIANO GRILLO: It's great.  Playing good anywhere the planet is good.  This is one of the biggest tournaments in the world, and it's a nice to post a good score in this kind of conditions.
Q. (Inaudible)?
EMILIANO GRILLO: I mean, he just keeps pretty simple.  Just play your own ball and just you don't have to care what everybody else is doing.  That's what I've been trying to do the last year and it's been so working.  So I'm going to continue with that.
Q. How much has he inspired you?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Pretty much.  He won two majors when I was just a little kid.  Watching him win the Masters -- well, the U.S. Open and then the Masters was unbelievable.  Watching him win the green jacket back in Argentina, it's a lot of motivation.
