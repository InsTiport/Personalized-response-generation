 Q.   Talk me through that finish, it was incredible.   
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, besides from that second shot on 18, everything was quite good.   That second shot on 18 went a little bit left and a little bit further than I wanted, and got lucky and then I got lucky with a big putt.   I just wanting to and get ready and maybe a playoff, maybe not, I don't know.   So right now, I'm quite happy with what I've done, and it was a good run overall.   I think I left some putts around there, but I think that one on 18 gave me the one that I missed.  
   
 Q.   So now you'll keep warm and ready for potentially a playoff?  
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, maybe putting, hitting a couple balls.   The rain is coming, so I don't know.
