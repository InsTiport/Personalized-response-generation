 Q.  Thoughts on The Presidents Cup team?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Well, that's not up to me.  Today was up to me and I did my best.  It worked out.  There's a big difference in those.  This is a goal that I've had for, you know, since the year began.  And the other one has been a lifetime dream, basically.   
I think I did my best.  Now it's up to Mr. Price.   
 Q.  When is the last time you talked to Captain Price?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Bridgestone we had a meeting.  We had a Presidents Cup meeting there.  You know, he said just play well and do your best, and that's what I did.   
 Q.  How often were you looking at the projections?  Did you look at them --  
EMILIANO GRILLO: I knew exactly what I had to do.  Anything inside 35 was going to get it done.  That was my mentality.  So I knew I had to shoot under par, 1- or 2-, maybe 3-under.  I didn't know how much it was going to be.  But I knew anything inside 35 was going to be fine.   
 Q.  There's a lot of boards out there.  Did you take a peek at all?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: All the time.  I like knowing where I'm at.  If I didn't know, maybe I would have regret it after the round saying, well, maybe I should have played more aggressive or maybe not.  It's good knowing where you're at.   
 Q.  Starting outside the Top-70, did you feel any added pressure, or is it just free-wheeling?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: You know exactly what you're goal for the week is.  So you set a goal and I think it's a bit hard and it's a bit easy at the same time.  Like I said, you know what you had to do, and just go at it and try and get it.  That's it.
