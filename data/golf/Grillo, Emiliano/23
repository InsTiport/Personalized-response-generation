 Q.  You started the day and ended the day with a couple of hiccups.  In between that was sandwiched some very good golf.  How did you put that double in your rear-view mirror out of the gates?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: It was only the first hole.  It was playing really hard today with the wind, very long hole to start with.  I knew that I had 17 holes ahead of me, and so just put it behind me.   
 Q.  You're right in the thick of things in your first FedExCup Playoff event and you won your first PGA TOUR start this year, played in the majors and the Olympics.  Describe what the last ten months has been like.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: It's been crazy.  If you would have told me a year ago I would be standing here with a chance of going to THE TOUR Championship, it's going to be hard to believe.   
But here we are and we have a chance going into the weekend.  It's been good.  The last two months, it's been paying off, all the hard work I've been doing the last ten months.   
 Q.  What's the mentality this weekend?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Just hit fairways.  Very important to play from the fairway out here.  That's going to be it.  Afterward, it's going to be just try to hit it close and make the putts.   
 Q.  How did you turn things around right away?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: I made a double on 10.  It was a very rough start, but I knew it was the first hole and I had a lot of chances.  That's what I did.  I put it behind and I managed to make three birdies there on the front nine.   
 Q.  So far you're sixth in strokes-gained putting.  How are you feeling about the flat stick?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Amazing.  Last couple tournaments been great.  We did some changes with my putting coach, and you know, it's been working.
