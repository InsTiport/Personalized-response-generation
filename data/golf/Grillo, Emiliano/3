  Q. Just some thoughts on your round; looks like that back nine was pretty solid, just an unfortunate miss at the last there.
 EMILIANO GRILLO:   I played well.  I played well all day.  Pins were tougher on the front nine.  I would say they were a bit easier to get close on the back nine, and I was able to do that.  I birdied the two par-3s on the back nine, which is a plus out here, and I didn't have the opportunity to putt for eagle many times today, so I think that's a key for tomorrow, to just go out there and have chances, put up a good number on the back front and then have a chance on the back nine.
 Q. What did you feel like you excelled at today out there?
 EMILIANO GRILLO:   I hit it well.  I've been hitting the ball well the last couple months, and that was the case the last three days, so I was able to give myself opportunities and also to make some birdies, which is what was lacking in the first couple tournaments after the break.  It's just that.  I've been playing well all around, so I'm just taking advantage of it.
 Q. Looks like you might be two, maybe four points behind going into the final round.  Do you feel like this format gives you more of an opportunity to catch up?
 EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, absolutely.  You know, birdies count double.  If you start with some birdies on the front nine, you're going to catch up quick.  There's a lot of opportunities on the front nine.  If you take advantage of those, you're going to be having a chance on the back nine.
