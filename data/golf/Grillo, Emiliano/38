 Q.  Thoughts on shooting 64?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Definitely a nice round.  I played here last year and didn't feel comfortable on the golf course, but I don't know, something changed this year.  Hitting the ball very nicely.  Very pleased the way I played and hopefully I can keep it going for the next few days.   
 Q.  Are you feeling so much a better player after the results in the United States?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Definitely.  It gives you a lot of confidence.  We know there it's not easy.  Anywhere it's not easy.  I was lucky enough to get two wins in a row and that gets me twice the confidence.  But here it's pretty much like a major here.  You've got the best players in the world and you've got to play really well to keep it up.   
 Q.  I appreciate the Earth Course might not have been kind last time but elsewhere in Dubai, that's been good, hasn't it?  So good style of golf for you.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, playing here, it's amazing.  The golf course is great.  There's nothing wrong coming here.   
 Q.  How was the experience playing alongside Rory McIlroy?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Second time playing with him.  I'm really thrilled.  Felt good today.  He's one of the nicest guys out here and that makes it easier.  But it's nice playing good with him.   
 Q.  Does it make you feel very involved in the championship, as well, with such big crowds following?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Definitely not easy playing with all the crowds.  A lot of guys they have cameras and photos and clicks and everybody keeps moving, so it's not easy.  But I've got to get used to it and keep playing well.
