 Q.  Tough conditions, you start the year off with a win, first event of the Playoffs, you got yourself in a great position as we head through.  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, it was a tough day.  It was a very tough week.  The beginning of the week, I said if we managed to get around 7-under, it's going to have a chance.  I'm very pleased.  Still have a chance, you never know out here.  The last three holes are very tough.  They still have a few holes to play.   
 Q.  What surprised you about this golf course?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Really tough.  It's very demanding from tee-to-green.  You can make a lot of putts out here and that's where you need to attack.  You need to play really well from the tee and you need to play really well from the fairway.  When you have a chance, you have to got to take advantage of it.   
It's a U.S. Open golf course.  It wasn't a U.S. Open but it was almost like one.   
 Q.  Looks like you're going to move yourself inside the Top-10 in points going forward.  What's your goals?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: You know, I said if I have a chance going to Atlanta, that's all I need.  You never know.  You see Bill Haas when he won, he was 20-something, and he won that week $12 million.  It's great being in the position of having a chance already, and going to the last three, that's something good.
