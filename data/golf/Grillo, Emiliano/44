 Q.  Birdie there on 18, now 11-under.  What was your key to the round today?  EMILIANO GRILLO: I hit the ball pretty well off the tee.  I think I only missed two fairways today in windy conditions, which was very nice.  I'm going to try to keep hitting the ball the same way I'm doing, and I holed some good putts on the back nine which gave me some red numbers today.   Q.  How difficult is it with the wind because it's definitely much stronger today than it has been?  EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, I played with Colt Knost today.  He was struggling with the wind.  (Inaudible) A lot of people are struggling with the wind direction -- 10, 11, 11, 12, 13 -- it kind of swirled (inaudible).  It was kind of hard to get a good club in there.  Me and my caddie did a great job today choosing the right clubs (inaudible).   Q.  The leaders aren't in yet, but you're going to be right there maybe five, six shots back.  Possibility to win this thing tomorrow?  EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, it's going to be hard.  I've never been in this position here in PGA playing -- it's a big event, and I'm enjoying it.  I'm enjoying every moment of it.  I'm going to try to do the same tomorrow, just stay, just stay focused on my game and stick to what I'm doing.   Q.  Have you gotten any advice from FabiÃ¡n GÃ³mez or El Pato?  EMILIANO GRILLO: Fabian today told me to take it easy -- it's going to be a tough two days -- just keep doing what you're doing and don't rush it.  Just stay in the moment and keep playing.
