Q.   Talk about finishing in that sort of style with a lovely putt at last for 66?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, I wasn't expecting that putt to go in to be honest.   But I played pretty well the whole day.   You know, a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and made some good putts.   I've been improving a lot on my putting, so it's showing off all the good work.   You know, I hope to continue playing like this. 

Q.   I take it would have been a good day, anyway, but that tells you that your putter is working nicely?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, I was definitely trying to 2‑putt on the last hole and trying to finish a good round with no bogeys.   It was a bonus.

Q.   Did you see a low score out there when you just saw the course for the first time?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   It's not raining a lot.   The course is pretty soft and the greens are rolling pretty nice.   It's not easy to leave it close to have good chances on the front nine but if you manage to play well on the front nine, then on the back nine you have some good chances.   The long par 5 you can reach in two, and some short holes.   If you play good, you're going to go 4‑, 5‑ or 6‑under. 

Q.   Tell me how well you have been playing?
EMILIANO GRILLO:   I've been playing really good.   My scores, they are not showing how good I'm playing.   Like I say, I've been improving a lot on my putting.   So I know I just need to keep hitting fairways and greens, and the rest is going to come up.

Q.   Are you excited by playing The Final Series in the elite groups like this? 
EMILIANO GRILLO:   Yeah, the first time in three years that I play in The Final Series, and I want to take advantage of it.   I'm trying to make my run to The Race to Dubai.   I know I need a few good tournaments to get in, so this is a good start for it.
