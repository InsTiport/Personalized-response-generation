 Q.  A hundred feet of putts made, seven birdies on the day.  How would you assess this day?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: It was very good.  Like you said, a bunch of putts that I made today, that helps anybody.  I was able to hit it better than I did the last two days and the putting was great.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
EMILIANO GRILLO: I think it's a good one.  Playing from behind will be easier than playing from the front.  It's up to me now, I just have to play my own game top and see what happens.   
 Q.  Do you think you will need a number like today on Sunday to ultimately win the trophy?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: It depends on the weather tomorrow.  I haven't seen it.  But if it is like today, then no.  Like I say, it's not easy playing out here Sunday at THE PLAYERS, it's like a Sunday at a Major.
