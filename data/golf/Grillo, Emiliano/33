 Q. Your first Masters round, 1‑under seems a good score in these conditions, how do you feel?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, great. It's a great feeling, it's one I've been getting ready for the last four or five months, and one that I was expecting my whole life. It's a great thing. I didn't expect it to be that good of a round, my first‑‑ I was pretty nervous on my first shot. But I just went out there and enjoyed the round.  
   
 Q. How did you feel with the pressure? Is there anything you do specifically to cut the pressure on your first tee shot in the Masters?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Well, I wanted to make it very special. I didn't care where it was going.  
   
 Q. You didn't care where it was going?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: No, as long as I didn't hit anybody I was happy.   
   
 Q. Where did it go?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Just straight up. It was a great feeling. After that, getting the first shot is the hardest thing out here. It's all about enjoying being here.  
   
 Q. How were the greens today? They've been quick this week, were they quicker today?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: They were quick. They were soft from the rain last night. I think they were perfect. They were receiving. You hit a good shot, they were receiving. And if you hit a bad shot it was going away. If you hit it in the right spot you were fine. Like I said, it was receiving. But the downhills and very quick putts that you've got to be really careful. They're not impossible, but you've got to be really careful.   
   
 Q. You and Justin [Thomas] seemed to get along really well. I noticed he waited for you outside the scoring trailer after you won. What was it like today with him?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Great. I joked that Ive waiting my whole life to get paired with him. It was a great thing, enjoying with a friend out here. I think it's better than playing with somebody else that you don't know. They played already a bunch of times out here. It was great playing with somebody you knew. We were both nervous. After we got past that first hole it was fine.   
   
 Q. You guys were looking at his putter on the first green. Just talking about putting?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, yeah. Talking about clubs and stuff like that.   
   
 Q. Do the same thing tomorrow, is that what you hope, do the same thing again?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Hopefully. Anything around even par around here in these conditions, it's going to be good. I don't know how it's going to be tomorrow. I've just got to check the weather and get my game plan for tomorrow.   
   
 Q. What's the hardest thing, judging those approach shots with the blustery wind?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yes, especially after‑‑ I think it was 13, the gusts were picking up and it's very hard downhill, and you've got the wind in your face. On the green you don't have that much wind because of the trees. It's very hard out there.
