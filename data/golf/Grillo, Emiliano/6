 Q.  Plus three might make the cut, five birdies, coming back from yesterday's round.  Talk about what you were thinking out there?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, it wasn't looking pretty after the third hole when I was standing on 7-over par.  I had it going there for a little bit.  Swing showed up.  Some good signs of good ball-striking, so I mean, I was putting well yesterday.  It was just a matter of getting the ball in front of me and having good opportunities.   
 Q.  When you say the swing showed up, did you come across a swing feel?  Did you and your caddie say something or did something just come to you?  
EMILIANO GRILLO: No, I mean, been working last three weeks for a good feeling there.  Still don't have good feelings about it, but I was able to hit good drivers today all day, and you know, I was in good position for those four holes in the middle of the fairway and I was able to, you know, not only get the club right, but execute well.
