Q. Emiliano, how do you prepare for tomorrow now?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Same.  Go do some exercise.  I haven't done anything all day.  Just a little bit of that and tomorrow just get ready again for a very long day.
Q. How do you think the course will play tomorrow after all the rain?
EMILIANO GRILLO: It's going to be pretty soft.  I think it's going to be pretty similar to what we had on Friday, very wet, and you can go at it with any club, pretty much.
Q. You played very well two days; is it going to help your game a little bit?
EMILIANO GRILLO: It's going to be long for everybody.  The rough is going to be very wet and it's going to be very hard to get the ball out of it.  It's going to be one of those that if you are very precise off the fairway, it's going to pay off.
Q. If they decide to play 36 holes, will that work out all right if they play 36 tomorrow?
EMILIANO GRILLO: Yeah, there's going to be people that are going to play 18 holes, and like Kevin Kisner shot 5-under this morning and he's going to have a little bit more of an advantage there.
Yeah, if you get on a roll and play 36 holes being you can get away with it.
