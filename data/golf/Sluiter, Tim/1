 Q.   Well played out there, just your reaction?  
TIM SLUITER:   I must say, lovely day, lovely round.   The weather has been good.   I thought in the morning it was a little tougher, but yeah, the weather turned out great for us.   Had a great time out there and lovely to have so many people walking with us.   Yeah, it's nice.   
   
 Q.   Bounce back, first day, second day, nice to bounce back today?   
TIM SLUITER:   Definitely.   Definitely.   As I said yesterday, I was playing pretty good yesterday and didn't get it in the hole.   Today, I might have played a little less tee‑to‑green but I putted great and my short game was really good.   
So I'm very pleased with that and bouncing back obviously.   
   
 Q.   Currently one off the lead, going into the final day, do you prefer to chase?  
TIM SLUITER:   Well, to be honest, I haven't been in this position, so I couldn't tell you.   But it's nice to see Joost up there.   He was up there when I was probably on the 7th or 8th hole.   I thought, it's nice to see that little guy up there.   Yeah, that's good.   
   
 Q.   Been a good week for Dutch golf and hopefully a good day tomorrow for Dutch golf?  
TIM SLUITER:   Yeah, if not me‑‑ yeah, it would be nice, but we'll see and just got to be working hard.   I heard the weather is going to be really bad tomorrow, so it's really going to be a tough day.   So, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Any side bets between the two of you tonight?   
TIM SLUITER:   Probably.
