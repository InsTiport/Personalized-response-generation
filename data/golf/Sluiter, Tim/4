 Q. You've kept yourself right in the fray, haven't you?
 TIM SLUITER: Yeah, I've kept myself in it. It could have been a lot better obviously, but I kept myself in the game, and I'm happy with the way I played. Yeah, it's unfortunate I missed a few putts today and a couple three-putts which cost me a few shots. But I'm still playing well, and hopefully they'll be going in tomorrow.

 Q. When you reflect and you turn up tomorrow you'll find yourself very close to the top of the leaderboard. 
 TIM SLUITER: Yeah, exactly, exactly, and that's obviously -- same on the last. I hit a good putt that was five feet, and I actually wanted to pick it out of the hole, but it missed, so that was a little unfortunate. But what you're saying, tomorrow I'll be out there and looking forward to competing tomorrow.

 Q. This is what it's about, isn't it? You're right up there in a big event near the top of the leaderboard trying to win?
 TIM SLUITER: Yeah, obviously. Just trying to get my game better and better every time, and yeah, we'll see tomorrow. You can't control the other players. I'm just going to play my own game and see what happens.
