  KEVIN STADLER:   A little bizarre to be so far under par early in the week and stuff like that, but if you would have given me a second place coming over here, I'd have taken it.   Played well in spurts, tough to play in the rain.   
   
 Q.   The course was very tough today.   
KEVIN STADLER:   It was tough and I drove it terrible today.   If you miss the fairway, you're going to get punished out here.   That's just the way it is.   Played great for a couple of days and had tons of chances and spent all day in the kneeâ€‘deep stuff today and the score showed it.   
It was so miserable on the front nine today, I was practically expecting to bogey every hole.   It was virtually impossible.   Just hung in there and obviously made a couple of birdies late to have a chance.   It was unfortunate on the last, played a little safe second shot and I felt good over the putt, and just whiffed it unfortunately.   
   
 Q.   How is your back?   Has that played any part?   
KEVIN STADLER:   It was all right today.   I got treatment a couple times.   It's a little sore but it's definitely better.
