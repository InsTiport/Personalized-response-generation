 Q.   A really solid round of golf, really good start for you on the back nine.   
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, I got off to a great start on the back.   Nice birdie on 10 and picked up a few more in there.   It was a good start, and I just couldn't really keep going on the back, but it was a good day.  
   
 Q.   You know, it could have been even better, and everyone says this, but you had some really good putts on 15 and 16 that I thought you hit your spot and they just didn't go.   
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, I did on both of them.   I had great putts.   Just went right over the edge.   Both of them caught a lot of the lip but didn't drop.   
No complaints.   Made it through there with a couple of birdies, so it was a good day, a good start.  
   
 Q.   Did that 25â€‘footer on 17 make up for any of those?  
KEVIN STADLER:   A little bit.   It was kind of fitting.   I hit a terrible pitch there and made that for birdie when I felt like I probably should have got the two before it.   It all evens out in the end.  
   
 Q.   I thought conditions were more difficult in the second round.   The wind came up.   Looked like you were between clubs a lot of times.   
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, there were a lot of shots last eight or ten holes I wasn't really too comfortable with.   The greens were a little bit inconsistent.   You could land in some spots and be really firm.   Others would check up.   So it was hard to attack some of the pins, for sure.  
   
 Q.   How close was that pitch mark on 6?   I mean, that was a big trampoline box.   
KEVIN STADLER:   It was about a foot short of the hole, and the lob wedge released about 30 feet somehow.     
I had a lot of kind of funky shots like that around the back, front nine, just didn't quite work out.
