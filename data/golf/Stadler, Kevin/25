Q.   The scoring is awful good this week, isn't it?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, the next couple days out here should be.   The courses are pretty getable.   No wind, it's great.

Q.   Could there be a scoring record out here this week?
KEVIN STADLER:   I don't know.   I would imagine.   I don't know what it is, but you can really play pretty average and make a lot of birdies out here. 

Q.   So what is your game, is it a little over average or where are you at right now?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yesterday I played pretty well over at La Quinta.   Today was a little scrappy, I didn't really feel too comfortable out there, but I birdied a bunch of the par-5s and just knocked a couple wedges in close for a few more birdies.   So I'm happy with six, but I really don't think that's that exceptional of a score, so it was okay. 

Q.   Stuck on six, get it to 24 and maybe finish in the top-10 when it's all said this week?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, that would be fine for me.   I just got to try to keep it going.
