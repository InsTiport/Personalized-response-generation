Q.   Played your way into Chicago?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, that's kind of what I came here for. 

Q.   Huge move from 75th to 23rd.   You put yourself in a good position to make it to Atlanta and possibly get yourself up there going into the last tournament?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, we'll see.   I don't think that number is set in stone yet.   There's some birdies out there for the guys coming in.   But it's better than where I started.

Q.   These are all projections, but great playing this week.   Have a good week off and good luck next week. 
KEVIN STADLER:   Thank you. 

Q.   First the goal of getting to Chicago.   How does that make you feel? 
KEVIN STADLER:   It's what I set out to do when I got here this week.   I wasn't expecting too much starting last week.   It's nice to go on and have another round.

Q.   You've been playing well.   It seems like in every event.   How much confidence are you building with the good showing?
KEVIN STADLER:   It's starting to come around a little bit.   I was dragging a little bit this summer.   I started shooting some good numbers is stuff for good confidence.

Q.   Did you feel any kind of pressure knowing you had to move up?
KEVIN STADLER:   A little bit.   Starting the day today I was in a pretty good spot.   And worse case shoot around par, still wouldn't be good enough.   I didn't think about it today going forward.   Started out with a couple of birdies early.   And put myself in the mix, but didn't get anything going after that..
