 Q.   Disappointing 3‑putt on the last hole but still really solid playing this week.   
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, it was good. I played pretty well all week and to cap it off with a good one today is good.   
   
 Q.   You finished 27th at Humana and 11th at Waste Management, now it looks like you're going to finish in the top 5.   Have you been playing well?   Did you see this coming?  
KEVIN STADLER:   It's been starting to be pretty good.   I had a really good final round last week.   It's the first time I've really struck the ball any good all year; I've been a little scrappy.  
But to play well last Sunday kind of definitely put me in a good frame of mind for this week, and just started hitting the ball more solid as the days went by this week.   
   
 Q.   What's going well for you the last few weeks?   Have you been working on something in particular?   
KEVIN STADLER:   No, not really.   Just the same stuff I'm working on the last couple years.   Comes down to making putts.   
Gotten to the point where I'm pretty consistently a good ball‑striker, and when I play well is when the putts are going in.   I felt like I really didn't make a whole lot this week, and I just hit a lot of really quality iron shots and never really in too much trouble, so it's good.
