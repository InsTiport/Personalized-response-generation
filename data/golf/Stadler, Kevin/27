  KEVIN STADLER:   The wind picked up pretty good this afternoon.   Couldn't really tell if it was hurting or helping.   It was tough.   Played great for the most part.  
   
 Q.   You played very well.   Is that the hardest part about choosing the club, you get that crosswind swirling and you don't know whether it's --  
KEVIN STADLER:   For sure, especially out here when you've got a lot of trouble.   You really want to hit the ball well high.   You pick the right one and it's tough.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, you want to win.   What's the plan for tomorrow?   What does Kevin Stadler do between now and your tee-off time in the morning?  
KEVIN STADLER:   Relax.   I feel real good about the game, and that's it.  
   
 Q.   Who are you rooting for in hockey?  
KEVIN STADLER:   Kings.
