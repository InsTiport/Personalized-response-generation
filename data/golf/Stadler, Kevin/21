Q.   What a way to finish, with four consecutive birdies.   That was a nice run.   Nice flow out there?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, you know, I kind of got in a groove with the putter.   It was the best round I had this year, in quite a few years, really.   It was fun seeing the ball go in the hole.

Q.   Your stroke was so fluid.   It was stress‑free.   That had to feel so good out there?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, absolutely.   I wish I could say that's the norm, but it's the far from it.   Usually kind of holds me back.   But it's been getting better. 
And I putted well in practice the last couple of days.   And seeing them start dropping on the course today was good.

Q.   Talk about course conditions.   Was it perfect out there?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, I mean the course is good.   The greens are soft.   The fairways are soft. 
I don't know what Phil shot, 8‑ or 9‑under, he was going low in a hurry out there on the back nine.   This course every year seems to bring out a lot of low scores.   And just happy to get one of them for a change. 
I don't really know what it is that guys see with this place, but every year the scoring is pretty low.

Q.   Obviously it fits your eye pretty good?
KEVIN STADLER:   Yeah, it was good today.   And I played good here last year, so it was good to have another good round.
