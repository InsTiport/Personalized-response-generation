Q.  Just talk about your round today, how you think things went.
KEVIN STADLER:  It was by far the best round I've had probably of the year, but in a really long time.  I've been really struggling.  I got it in play and made some putts today.
Q.  How does it feel when you've been struggling like that, and everything seems to be working, seems to be clicking and you play really well?
KEVIN STADLER:  It's a little better than it would normally.  I haven't had a round like this in ages.  I've probably made more birdies in the past week that I would in a month or two.  It was a lot more fun.
Q.  What was really in particular working for you today?  Was everything clicking?
KEVIN STADLER:  I made a lot of putts.  I think I've been rolling it pretty well here and haven't made anything, and today they were just locked in and they were all going into the middle of the hole.

I made a handful, and somehow a left a few out there.  I made a bogey and a double, and just made a ton of putts, other than that.
Q.  You're lurking around the leaderboard.  How does it feel to be coming in on Saturday
KEVIN STADLER:  I don't think it's going to be near the lead.  I think I'm six, seven behind, which is a ton.  But obviously playing the weekend is going to be a big plus.
