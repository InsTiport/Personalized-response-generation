Q. Can you tell us about your round today?
MAJA STARK:   To be honest, I was so nervous I could barely feel my hands during the first couple holes, so was pretty happy that I managed to only make two bogeys.
Other than that, my driver was a bit off.  Just kind of been off and on.  Some drives were great and some were not very.
But I think my putting has just been pretty steady for most of the time.  I had a couple three-putts, but I think that's kind of what you have to take with these fast greens.
Yeah.  That's about it.
Q. Walk us through the eagle.
MAJA STARK:   Yeah, sure.  I hit my second good drive of the day and we just -- me and Emma, my caddie -- just talked about it like I bombed it.  I had 121 meters in and I kind of thought, Well, why not be aggressive with it?
I was aiming one meter to the right; probably pulled it a bit, so went half a meter to the right.  Yeah, it was a great shot.  So it was just perfect.  We didn't see it go in but the people started screaming, so we were pretty happy.
Q. Lastly, how was your birth day and did you do anything special to celebrate?
MAJA STARK:   It was really good.  I thought if I played badly on my birthday that would just suck.  I was really determined to play well.
Yeah, we got some cupcakes and stuff from the USGA, so we just gathered the sweets and had a cupcake party yesterday.
