Q. Maja, great playing all week.  Just playing in your first U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, how would you sum up this experience?
MAJA STARK:   Well, I was surprised I think because I thought it would be more difficult.  We came here on Saturday and walked the course, back nine of Cypress, and we saw how far back the tees were.  We were like, Jeez, we're going to have 4-irons in all the time.  They kind of moved up the whole tournament.
So I thought -- my mind was set to it being more difficult than it was, at least length-wise.  The greens are something that I've never experienced before.  That was awesome.  It was really fun, and I'm happy that my putter really worked for me this week.
Q. Just being able to finish 5-over par for this championship, finish this high up the leaderboard against some of the best players in the world, what does this do for your confidence moving forward and what does this do for you as a player moving forward?
MAJA STARK:   It's been great.  I have never played a major before, so I'm really happy that I got the chance.  I'd been kind of doubting myself because I've never played against these players with this capacity, so I was really happy about it.
I'm so looking forward turning pro soon because this is great.
Q. You're currently tied with Gabriela Ruffels 5-over par of Kaitlyn Papp still has golf to be played.  If you were to earn low amateur at the 2020 U.S. Women's Open, what would that mean to you as a player?
MAJA STARK:   It would give me a lot of confidence.  I think playing back home in Sweden I played this summer, played lost against Beatrice Wallin, Ingrid Lindblad, and I've always been kind of a few shots behind them.  So I've been doubting myself and thinking, Well, how good am I actually?  They are great.
But it's been kind of a hit to my confidence just seeing that they're always that bit better than me, so it was really great to beat them for once.
