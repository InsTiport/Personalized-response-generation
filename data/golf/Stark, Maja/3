Q. Tell me about your round today and how it went out there.
MAJA STARK: I think I played pretty solid.  I hit a lot of greens, so I wasn't really in trouble from the tees.  So that really helped.
I had some trouble on the green because I'm not used to playing on these fast greens.  But yeah, I got used to it, and the back nine, I made some more putts.
Q. How was the Chairman's dinner last night?
MAJA STARK: It was like magical.  I had not pictured Augusta that way.  I pictured a lot more trees and closed, but it was so open and beautiful with the azaleas and everything.
Q. What are you most excited about going into Friday, getting to play a practice round?
MAJA STARK: Just seeing the elevations.  Everyone has talked about it, but you don't really see it on TV when you watch.  Seeing just how difficult it is, yeah.
