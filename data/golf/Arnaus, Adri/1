Q. You're right in the thick of it going into the final round, last event on The European Tour season, and it's not out of the blue, a couple of top sixes in your last four starts.  What's all coming together with your golf game at the moment to putt you in this position?
ADRI ARNAUS:   Well, you know, I was taking the decision to rest this weekend, take it easy come out with a fresh mind, and then I came here, worked on a couple things that I needed to do and just going out there and trying to put it together, which, yeah, I've been able to do, and so I'm pleased to be in this position going into tomorrow.
Q. A long way away, a lot of golf to be played, and if you were to win tomorrow, $3 million, what would be the first thing you would buy?
ADRI ARNAUS:   Nothing special.  At the end of the day, we play for trophies.  I want to have that opportunity tomorrow going into the back nine, so I want to put myself in that position and after that, we'll see how things unfold.
