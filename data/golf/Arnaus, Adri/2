Q. Not a single black on the scoreboard, how did you find it today.
ADRI ARNAUS:   It's always good news when you're not adding any strokes to your scoreboard, so yeah, very, very pleased with how I played.  I was very on point from tee, hitting on to the green and then I rolled some putts.  So enjoyed it a lot, my first competitive round around here, and it was very, very fun.
Q. How did you find the course, playing a bit longer than what the players would have been used to, but how does it suit you?
ADRI ARNAUS:   It's definitely playing a bit longer, I would say because it's a touch wet but it's the only way I've seen it, so I don't know how it was playing the other years.  They have told me it was running much more on the greens a bit firmer.  Just a matter of putting it in place and then attacking from there.
Q. Good weeks at The Irish Open and Scottish Open.  Have you found anything?  Obviously these kind of courses are suiting you.
ADRI ARNAUS:   Yeah, I just tried to go in Ireland, getting some adaptation to the Irish weather, the U.K. weather, and I guess I did that in a good way.  So Scottish Open was also a lot of fun, even playing in the rain, and so here we are, and try to play some good golf.
