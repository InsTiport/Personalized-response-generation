 Q. What were some of the highlights of your round today?
 LINDY MILLER: Really it was kind of a consistent round. I was real fortunate and hit a lot of greens. I didn't hit it real close all the time, but when I did hit the greens I was able to 2-putt. And then when I did hit it close I made I guess three birdies, three birdies and two bogeys. So it was just a really kind of consistent tee to green and I got in with a pretty good score.

 Q. Do you have to make any adjustments to altitude playing up here?
 LINDY MILLER: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It's a little bit different here because you got altitude first or maybe not even first, but you got elevation change and then you got the altitude and then you got the wind. So you've got to make a lot of determinations on how much the ball's going to be affected especially with the wind and the elevation change and the altitude all in one. 

 Q. How do you feel your round today sets you up going forward the rest of the week?
 LINDY MILLER: I feel good. I feel comfortable with it. I hit it pretty good. But you just got to come out here and play this golf course. It's a difficult golf course and you got to play it good. You can't have any let downs. And we'll just see what happens. Because I feel good about getting in with 71 getting started.
