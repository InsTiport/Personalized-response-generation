 Q. First of all, general thoughts on today's round?
 LINDY MILLER: Wasn't too bad. I kind of got off to a bad start, made double on number 5 and that kind of set me back a little bit, because I had birdied 2 and bogeyed 3. But all in all, the wind switched and I kind of got something out of my round, I hit some good shots and it was okay.

 Q. Thoughts going into tomorrow?
 LINDY MILLER: Just go play one shot at a time and try to figure out where to hit it and hopefully hit it good again and it will be okay.

 Q. I know the goal every week that you play in an event like this is to do your best and see where the chips fall, but do you ever think about things like being the low club professional?
 LINDY MILLER: Oh, I think you do a little bit because our organization, it would be a real thrill. But you really can't think of that while you're playing. You just got to play one shot at a time and like you say, it's just wherever it ends up, it ends up. But those things, just, they just happen after you play well enough. 

 Q. Getting a lot of support from the crowd?
 LINDY MILLER: Absolutely. Absolutely. I got some people here. So it's been good. The crowds are great out here. It's a fine place. So it's been a lot of fun. 

 Q. If somebody would have told you before the week started that going into Saturday that you would be four, five or something like that, would you have taken that?
 LINDY MILLER: When I first got here, absolutely. Absolutely. Because the wind was blowing 60 miles an hour. So who knew what was going to happen. 
 But people are getting kind of used to playing the golf course and even though the wind did switch a little bit, it's still playing a little bit different. But it's not too bad. I don't know where I stand as far as the whole tournament, but it's not too bad.
