JENNIFER JOHNSON: I chose not to have a player partner. I actually never played alone in a tournament before. You have to remind yourself to take some breaks because, normally, when you play in a threesome, you take a break when othre people are hitting. The volunteers were nice. They were all clapping for me. I'm happy with that (72). I stayed pretty patient out there. My goal tomorrow is to have a few more birdies. It was pretty relaxed, actually.
