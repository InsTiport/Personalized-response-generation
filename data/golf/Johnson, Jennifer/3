  THE MODERATOR:   You ve been in this position before but not this year. What is the strategy heading into tomorrow?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Really I m just going to think about placement. This course is pretty much, you have to place yourself on the greens so you have a birdie chance, and hit the fairways because when you hit it in the rough, it s hard to make birdies. So I don t know, normal stuff. 
THE MODERATOR:   How much tougher did it get out there? The wind seemed like it really picked up as the afternoon went on and how much tougher will that be for the afternoon wave?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   My back nine was definitely windier than when we started. Those holes out by the water, there s nothing to protect you from the wind, so it s going to be pretty tough I think. 
THE MODERATOR:   You ve seen all these Americans get on the win track and you won last year, how important is that to you to get back up there and have you been jealous at times seeing all the Americans win this year? 
JENNIFER JOHNSON: I would never say jealous. I m pretty happy with my improvement, and that s really the goal is just keep getting better.
THE MODERATOR:   Is it a tougher task to come from behind tomorrow with Stacy in the lead heading into tomorrow. She s got a chance to be the No. 1 player in the world and obviously shot a 63 today. Does that make it an even tougher challenge?
JENNIFER JOHNSON: No, she probably has more pressure than I do [because of No. 1], so really you just put the pressure on yourself because no one else is putting it on you. 
THE MODERATOR: How much do you like this golf course? 
JENNIFER JOHNSON: I think it just kind of fits my eye pretty well. I like how the drives are straight away and then the approaches are the challenge of the course. 
THE MODERATOR: What was the difference in your game between today and yesterday?
JENNIFER JOHNSON: Well, when you shoot your lowest round ever, it s hard to follow that up. Everything went my way yesterday and nothing was dropping today.
