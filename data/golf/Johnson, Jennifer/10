  Q. Minus-8, tied for eighth. Tell me about your tournament.   
 JENNIFER JOHNSON: It's been a great week. This is my highest finish so far on the LPGA. Yeah, I'm just happy. You know, this is a good week to choose to donate my earnings because I played well. I should think about doing that every week.  
  
  Q. Why that group, that organization, that charity?  
 JENNIFER JOHNSON: I learned about it through Navistar. It was the tournament charity the past couple years I played in this event.   
 The more I learn about it, the more I just realize it's such a great organization the way they help our wounded veterans. You know, we wouldn't be here without them, so I just think it's important to give back and show how much we appreciate what they do for the country.  
  
  Q. And with your finish it's a good check.   
 JENNIFER JOHNSON: Yep.  
  
  Q. Any other thoughts about the week?  
 JENNIFER JOHNSON: Wish I could have putted a little better.  
  
  Q. Played a little better?  
 JENNIFER JOHNSON: Putted a little better. Yeah, I just left a couple shots out there.   
 Other than that, definitely played the course better this year than I have in the past, so I'm happy about that.
