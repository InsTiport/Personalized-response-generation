 Q.   Talk about how you played today?  
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I just want to get back to the way I played yesterday, hitting fairways and greens and get rid of the three‑putts.  
   
 Q.   What is the course playing like for you?   How tough is it?   
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   The rough's really tough, so there is a precedent to hit the fairways and the greens.   
But I think it's scorable.   They're holding okay.  
   
 Q.   Is the competition you're playing against pretty standard for you?   
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   It's the same girls every week, so no problem there.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned you had a couple bad holes.   Is that what made your score suffer today?   
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   The holes that I bogeyed, two of them were three‑putts.   I hit a good drive, hit a good approach shot, just got a little brain dead on the greens.   I've got to watch my speed a little better tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Are you off to the driving range now?   
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Maybe some lunch and a little practice, then go rest.  
   
 Q.   I'm curious how you feel heading into the weekend?   You should make the cut.   I don't know where at the end of the day you'll fall on the leaderboard, but do you feel that you're in a good position to make a move tomorrow?  
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Oh, yeah.   I'm right where I need to be for the weekend.   Just a couple under over the next few days, and we'll see where that puts me.
