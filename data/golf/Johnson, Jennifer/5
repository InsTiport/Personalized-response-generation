Q.   Back‑to‑back 66s, awesome.   Just talk about your round today,   no bogeys on the back nine, just how everything went? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Yeah, on 3.   I just kind of had a stupid bogey hit my drive in the trees.   4, I played great.   4 and 5 I kind of got the rhythm back.   Then three‑putt 6, and that was enough of that and kind of got it back on track.
Q.   Now, Meg's out here.   She said she went to see you play a little bit.   Has that been any extra motivation?   Obviously, you're making that last push for Solheim?
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Oh, definitely.   The final spots are all really close, and there are five players for four spots.   So that is in the back of my mind, definitely.
Q.   Does the fact that your strategy maybe more aggressive, less aggressive, knowing the Solheim Cup points are on the line? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I'll just play my own game.   That is just an after effect of how I play.
Q.   Do you like your position going into the final round? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I like it.   You know, the higher up the leaderboard you are, the better.   So I'm pretty happy how I played the last two days.
Q.   You had a rough start here Thursday.   How did you get it back so well the last two days?   What was the biggest adjustment? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Yeah, I don't know.   I started hitting the ball close, making the putts I needed to.   It adds up.
Q.   Now your first win, you came from behind.   It was kind of we were sitting there waiting at the green to see what happens.   You've done it before, and now you have a win under your belt.   Do you ever reflect on that experience?   That was a huge turning point in your career, obviously?
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I'll definitely use it for some confidence.   But when I'm out there, I can't really afford to think about the results, because that would just get in the way of hitting the best shot you can.
Q.   Knowing you can do it and you've done it before, obviously, it will help going into tomorrow?
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Yeah, I think so.
Q.   Are you excited for St. Andrews? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Yeah.   I've been there, but I haven't played the course.
Q.   Is that right?   Are you kind of a golf historian? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   No, we were there two years ago at Carnoustie, so we took a little drive over.
Q.   What were your impressions just walking around? 
  JENNIFER JOHNSON:   It's a cool place.   I don't really know much about it.
