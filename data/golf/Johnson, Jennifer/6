Q.   Tell me what you did this morning.   What time were you going off, supposed to?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I was 8:21.   So I woke up at like 4:51.   I always set like odd numbers on my alarm clock.

Q.   Why?   Superstition?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Just ‑‑ yeah.   And not 5s.

Q.   Wow.   Oh, my gosh.   Okay. 
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   So we got here ‑‑ I actually thought I was going to be late because my dad missed our freeway exit.   We drove like three miles past. 
But then pretty much just sat up in the player dining and looked out the window and watched it rain from 6 to now.

Q.   Pour, pour, pour.   With something like this, a huge delay, probably pushing it back to tomorrow, kind of mess up your routine?   Stacy said you guys are used to this, but how deal with knowing first round will be Friday, possibly 36 holes down the road.   Do you mentally prepare for that?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   It makes it a little more challenging, but I think it's good that we didn't start so we can have a fresh, clean start tomorrow hopefully.
And I don't have anything scheduled for Monday.   So.

Q.   That's nice. 
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I don't have to worry about making my flight or anything.

Q.   That's good.   Plans for the rest of the day.   Do you have a go‑to thing you do on rain delays when you get to go home?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   I don't know.   Lexi and I were talking, maybe go to the movies.

Q.   That's usually everyone, go eat, movies, relax, pretty much?
JENNIFER JOHNSON:   Maybe go get our nails painted or something like that.

Q.   Okay.   I like that.   I'll come back to you tomorrow and see if you got them done.
