Q. Another bogey-free round for you here.  To what do you attribute your success on this course?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I know I can tell where I shouldn't go.  It's easy to find that.
As long as I stay away from those areas, that's what makes it a good round.
Q. Have you even come close to making a bogey yesterday or today?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Yes, I had a few where I had like three feet here and there and not par putts, but I made those putts.  Yeah.
Q. Can you describe the eagle you had I believe on the 7th hole today?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  The drivers really went far, and also my irons were fine and the putts just went in.  So, yeah, perfect.
Q. So you were on the green in two then?
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah.
Q. Any idea how far the putt was?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  About four meters, so about 12 feet.
Q. Do you remember the last time you made a bogey at this tournament?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Two years ago, yeah.
Q. Okay.  So you know.  How do you stay so calm?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  It's been a while since last tournament I was playing because I was ill and then home, but I was able to just stay calm and be as is and not worry about things and just go ahead and play it.
So, yeah, yeah.
Q. What has this year been like for you?  You won last year, but then to come back and win one more.  To follow up last year's win by winning this year as well, has that built your confidence further?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  To be able to win constantly in a good term and good timing is what I want.  I want to win as much as I want, so it's really good to win here.
