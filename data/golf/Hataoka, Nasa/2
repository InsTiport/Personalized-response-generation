THE MODERATOR:   Welcome back, Nasa.  2-under 68 today.  You're just a couple strokes off the lead.  How are you feeling right now, three rounds down, looking to tomorrow's final round?
NASA HATAOKA:   Well, today is obviously moving day.  I wished I could have gone lower, so just a little bit disappointing that I couldn't go lower.
THE MODERATOR:   Disappointed, but you still had three birdies.  What was the highlight of your round today?
NASA HATAOKA:   The second shot on No. 10.
THE MODERATOR:   Could you tell us about that shot?
NASA HATAOKA:   It was a 9-iron for my second shot.  I hit it to within 30 centimeters, and where I had to land it, it was very difficult, so that was a very good shot.
