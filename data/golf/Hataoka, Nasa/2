  THE MODERATOR:   That was an amazing round today, the low round of the championship, a 64.  You opened up with the amazing eagle from the fairway here at No. 1.  Can you tell us about that, the yardage, the club you hit and just about how you played that hole?
 NASA HATAOKA:   It was a 188-yard shot with a 5-iron, landed obviously below the pin, and luckily it rolled in.
 THE MODERATOR:   We saw it on TV; you didn't know.  You couldn't see it rolled in.  Who told you, and did you have any idea it was that good of a shot?
 NASA HATAOKA:   Yeah, I first noticed the fans by the green kind of cheering, so I thought it was close, but then one of the TV crew told me it went in.
 THE MODERATOR:   Overall an amazing round today, a 64.  Were you trying to be aggressive knowing you had to play hard to catch up to Sei Young, or was this just a good round of golf?
 NASA HATAOKA:   Yeah, so I had six shots between myself and Sei Young, so I thought if I played well enough, I may have a chance, so I just fought all the way until the end.
 Q. I was just wondering what the best part of your game was today.  Was it your ball-striking?  Was it your putting?  What was working the best for you today?
 NASA HATAOKA:   I would say my ball-striking.  My second shots to the green were very close.  I would say my iron play was really good today.
