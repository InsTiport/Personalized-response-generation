Q. So first question:  What a round for you to be able to take the lead.  How were you feeling out there today?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  It's a result of me playing having a good result.  That's the result of it, yeah.
Q. For you, your bogey streak came to an end today, but you were able to save it with a nice eagle.  Explain the mindset you had after the 14th hole.
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I wasn't thinking about where I was going to get a bogey or anything like that, so when it came, it came.  Then I just cleared it.
Q. How was the eagle for you?  Explain your strategy there.
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I was having problems with that distance on the eagle, so being able to make it really, really makes me happy.  Yeah.
Q. How big is your confidence level going into tomorrow?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Since I do like the course and it matches me, so I'm just going to go ahead in a good mood and do the right things to get the win.
Q. You've said you want to win many times.  You've already had a win this year.  Are you thinking about what happened at the Kia Classic to take with you tomorrow?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I'm just going to go for it one by one, not connecting with that, yeah.
