 Q. Nasa, stellar round out there today.  How are you feeling coming off the golf course today?
 NASA HATAOKA:   It's my second time playing here this tournament.  Feels a lot different than the first time I played, and I had a lot of quality shots out there today.
 Q. I was going to say, it's been a couple years since you played here, too.  Do you remember anything from when you stepped back on the course this week?  Do you remember anything from the last time you played here?
 NASA HATAOKA:   I remember the fescue, the rough, narrow fairways.  Felt like playing a links golf course.
 Q. You know, you've been kind of coming back into your own since the restart here.  How comfortable are you feeling about your play and what does a round like today mean for your game?
 NASA HATAOKA:   So after the restart I only had top 10 at ANA, but I had some good weeks off in between and I feel good now and I feel confident also.
 Q. Confident enough with that eagle on No. 18.  What was that like for you, and what kind of went into that shot?  Was that from off the fairway or how did that go in?
 NASA HATAOKA:   Since the restart I'm getting my feel back with the putter.  That was a big thing.  I had some long putts out here today, so that was very big.
 Q. Was that long putt on 18?
 NASA HATAOKA:   24 feet or something.
 Q. All right.  So nice solid into the green.  What's there to improve on into tomorrow, do you think?
 NASA HATAOKA:   So towards the back half of the round my tee shots were a little off, so maybe I'll work on that a little bit.
