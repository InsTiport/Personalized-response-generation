 Q.  Nasa, nice 5-under par opening round at the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions. How good do you feel about the day and simply just getting back into competition?  
NASA HATAOKA: I was really nervous before the tournament started, but I'm really happy how I played today.   
 Q.  Bogey on 18 to end the day. How do you rebound tomorrow from that and get off to another hot start like you did today?  
NASA HATAOKA: Hole 18 is typically a very hard hole, so I'm going to forget about it today, and I'm going to start fresh tomorrow.   
 Q.  How was your off-season? It looked like you had some fun, played TPC Sawgrass, filmed a television show back home. Take me through the off-season, especially those points.  
NASA HATAOKA: The off-season is way too short, but I had a really good time with my family and friends. So I had a really good off-season.   
 Q.  How much do you enjoy getting to meet different celebrities and learning about how they approach the sports that they've played or their professions, just like you approach golf?  
NASA HATAOKA: I played with Joe Carter today, and it was so much fun playing with him. I want to play a normal tournament having more fun, just like playing in these kinds of events.
