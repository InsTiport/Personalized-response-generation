 Q.  To win an LPGA event in Japan on home soil, you must be so proud.  
NASA HATAOAKA: I'm so proud.  I'm so happy to win this event.  Actually, I wanted to win this tournament before it began.  I am really happy to accomplish it.   
 Q.  It was close.  You got off to a brilliant start and then you dropped a couple of shots on 11 and 12.  What did you say to yourself on 13?  
NASA HATAOAKA: I realize something has to come to me and I had to get through it, and I knew it was at the 13th hole.  I was not totally comfortable with the shot, but I was calm enough to play well on that hole.
