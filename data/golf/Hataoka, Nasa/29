Q. Nasa, first to you.  Great win today over a very strong American team.  You must be feeling very happy.  (Wind interference.)
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I'm very happy.  I'm glad we can go playoff.
Q. And a playoff, a lot of pressure there.  A lot of permutations.  I guess when you came out today you were just focused on winning your match and then see what happens.
AYAKO UEHARA: We knew we must have to win today, so winning this game is going to be good momentum for the playoff.
Q. Nasa, talk about the partnership you developed here with Ayako, the strengths that you both bring to the team?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  We have really good teamwork.  We don't have any lose points and we have two winning and the even, so we definitely have a good teamwork together.
Q. Final question, Ayako, what was the key turning point in this match which really enabled you both to dominate?
AYAKO UEHARA: (Through translation.)  We started on 13, par-3, and Nasa hit it close, but Jessica hit even closer.  And same line.  So I Ayako was really far apart, so we don't want it to show line for Jessica so I was like, I must make it.
And then I make it, so 13 was turning point.
Q. What distance was that putt?
AYAKO UEHARA: (Through translation.)  Like almost eight, nine feet.
Q. On 13?
AYAKO UEHARA: Yeah.
