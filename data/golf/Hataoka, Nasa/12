Q. Nasa, a huge day for you again here in Orlando. Just take us through what is it about this course that lends so well to your game.
NASA HATAOKA: Compared to last year, this year the greens are a little bit softer. So that's why I can kind of go at it.
Q. How much fun is this compared to any other tournament that we have on tour during the season? Is it kind of something you look forward to?
NASA HATAOKA: So the beginning of the season with this kind of event is really relaxing and it's really fun. If I'm playing a normal event, I get a little bit nervous, but this kind of event is more fun, and I'm really enjoying it.
Q. What's the mindset going into tomorrow for you? Are you confident? How confident are you in your play right now?
NASA HATAOKA: I'm just coming back. So I really want to be aggressive tomorrow, especially on my putting.
Q. This year obviously the Olympics will be in your home country. That's got to be very special. You already have the points to be there. But do you want to win? Do you want to have some wins before you get to Japan to play the Olympic games?
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah, I definitely want to win before the Olympics for sure, but my first goal is to be No. 1 in the world before the Olympics, and then I want to play in the Olympics.
Q. Nasa, do you still feel like you're trying to win respect around the world as one of Japan's great players? I know you're still young, but obviously we knew Ayako Okamoto and Kobayashi and some of those people. Now you're the new generation. How do you want to follow them?
NASA HATAOKA: So it's very limited coming from playing in Japan to come to here and playing. But, yeah, I really respect legends like Ayako, and I wanted to be like them.
