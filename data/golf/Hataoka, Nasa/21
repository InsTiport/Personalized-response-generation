Q. Winner of the 2019 Kia Classic, Nasa Hataoka.  Nasa, what were your emotions when you walked off the 18th green knowing you had the win?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  First couple days I wasn't putting very well so I didn't really think I could pull this off.  Until the 18th hole, anything could happen, but I was just very relieved that my second shot landed on the putting surface.
Q. Anything could happen.  Tough bogey at 16.  What did you tell yourself going into 17 with the clutch birdie you had?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Anyone can make mistakes out here.  I forgot about the bogey very quickly.  I knew that 17 was a chance I could make a birdie, and just very relieved and felt great that I was able to actually get a birdie.
Q. How do you plan to celebrate with your win?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I got the big tournament coming up next week, so I'll celebrate a little bit but get my mind refreshed and start again next week.
Q. With the win you get a 2020 Kia Telluride.  Have you thought about what color you want that car to be?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Just so happy that I can receive a car, and I think I'll order a white one.
