Q. That was a great round today.  A lot of TV coverage for you.  How did you feel coming off the golf course?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I think I hit it really good and played really well.  I think that these winds the other two days kind of helped me.  I had three eagle chance and just couldn't make it.
I made a lot of good shots.
Q. Seemed like your putting was going very well today.  What was the biggest moment for you on the golf course?  What was the biggest, most important spot?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I think No. 7 made a birdie putt, one of the best putt.
Q. How long was that putt?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Five meter; probably fifteen feet.
Q. Okay.  Great.  It's great to see your name up at the top of the leaderboard.  What kind of inspiration do you take into the weekend with how well you're playing?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I'm kind of excited about that tomorrow.
Q. And I know you got to go to the Master's last week.  Tell me what that experience was like.  Is that maybe inspiring you to play well this week, too?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I think the visualize, kind of imagine the shot helped me this week.
