THE MODERATOR: Hello ladies and gentlemen.  I'm so excited to be here at the 2019 Kia Classic in the media center with your champion, Nasa Hataoka.  Congratulations, Nasa.  Tell us, how meaningful is this win for you?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  The goal for me this year was to win a four-day tournament as well as a major.  So I'm happy that I accomplished one of them.
THE MODERATOR: You shot a 69, 70, 64.  How did you keep your focus there?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Few mistakes out there, but I knew with my ball striking that I could get some back.
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it to the floor for questions.  Raise your hand and we'll get a mic over to you.
Q. Three wins in 40-something starts on the tour in your career.  (Audio malfunction.)
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  There are a lot of great players that are similar age, and I saw how they practiced and I really tried to imitate that as well.
Q. In the post-tournament trophy presentation the announcer on the green said he thought you might be the next big thing in golf and that many more tournament wins could be coming.  When you hear that, what are your thoughts?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I feel honored to be called that, but to attain it I'm just going to keep on working harder.
Q. I was talking to Danielle Kang about you.  She called you a little warrior.  Are you proud of kind of how you handle conditions under pressure and how confident are you under pressure?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I'm still in my third year on the LPGA and I'm only 20 years old.  I don't really have much to be afraid of.  I also feel like I'm always a challenger out here, just taking one shot at a time.
As a player, it's always great to see what I've been practicing leads to results.  It has given me a lot of confidence, and definitely will be a good flow to next week's major.
THE MODERATOR: Along with the winner's check you get a new car.  How excited are you to be driving a new Kia Telluride?
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I have a base starting this January in the U.S., so I was just looking for a car.  Just a great feeling to receive one.
THE MODERATOR: Good timing.
NASA HATAOKA: Also looks great, too.
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  Congratulations again, Nasa, and great luck next week.
NASA HATAOKA: Thank you.
