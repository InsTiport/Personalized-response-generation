Q. So have you ever been in a playoff this long?
NASA HATAOKA: This is the first time for me.
Q. What are your thoughts going through your mind as you keep teeing it up?
NASA HATAOKA: So first playoff, I was a little bit nervous, but as you go like one by one, my nerves kind of died down.
Q. Did you maybe think about trying to play one more hole, or did you know you were done?
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah, it's really hard to read the greens. So we just finished.
Q. Have you ever had to do anything like this, sleep on a playoff, or something this big?
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah, but it never happened to me before. Last year I was watching Pernilla Lindberg and Inbee -- two years ago, the Inbee Park playoff going into the next day. So it kind of reminds me of that.
Q. So what do you think you're going to do tonight?
NASA HATAOKA: Well, first I wanted to eat some really good food and then rest.
