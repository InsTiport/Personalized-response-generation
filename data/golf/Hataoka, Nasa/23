 Q.  Best round of the season at 8-under par.  When in the round did you realize you were playing so well?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I started out playing really well, attacking the pins, and had a lot of par saves as well, good par saves.   
So it was over all a good day.   
 Q.  This is your first event since you played in Singapore.  What have you been working on since the Singapore event?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  It's more like working on from last year, (indiscernible) position as well as improve my swing.   
 Q.  Speaking of last year, you had a fantastic end to your season.  How did that round feel compared to the great run of play you had at the end of last season?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I did feel a little tired at the last event, last year, but I was able to finish top 10.   
This year I just hope to get a win sometime during the season.   
 Q.  With how crowded the leaderboard, how does that affect your play tomorrow with how many people are close to you?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Just want to focus on what I'm working on right now and not think about the score.   
 Q.  What were your best birdies today?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Tough to choose.  They were all pretty good today.   
 Q.  Any long putts?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  It wasn't a birdie putt but the par save on 15.  The first putt was about 30 yards long, but I was able to make par and so that kept my flow going to the 16th hole, which I obviously wanted to birdie.   
 Q.  Great shot on 18.  What iron and was what the yardage?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  9-iron, 128 yards.   
 Q.  Is this a golf course that when you came here you thought would be a good golf course for you?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I didn't really think about the course so much because I wasn't playing very well.  Every day I improved, and just things have been going well since then.   
 Q.  There were a lot of low scores today.  You shot the lowest score in the afternoon.  What did you think of the conditions today and why was it more scorable?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Definitely wanted to go low today.  The conditions were fairly good today, so glad I was able to shoot a good round.   
 Q.  Were the greens less bumpy?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  A little bit.   
 Q.  Forgive me for the question, but the story behind your first name.  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Obviously my parents named me after the NASA space station, and the reason behind that was they wanted me to accomplish something that has never been accomplished before.   
 Q.  Did you ever want to be an astronaut?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Maybe if I retire from professional golf.
