NASA HATAOAKA: I started out with good birdie on No.2. I knew the score will be good on this course, so I tried to be aggressive and very happy that I was able to finish with 6 under.
Playing with So Yeon Ryu, I feel really comfortable because she has good tempo. My aim was 4 under each day, so for 3 days 12 under total. I am happy that I was able to clear that aim for today. But now with many good scores, maybe I have to set new target score like 15 or 20.
