NASA HATAOAKA: I had one bogey today, same as yesterday, which I three-putted. It's costly. Compared to yesterday, I had less birdie chance today.   
In the morning my tee shots were toward the right side, then started all over. Left and right. My iron shots, I pulled a lot.   
I tried to adjust my tee shot, so toward the end, it was getting better. but never iron accuracy.   
Maybe I was swinging faster. A bad habit recently is that I am gripping my left hand too strong.   
Minjee was playing so good, I tried to concentrate on my game but I looked at her. She played too good and took off. Trying to catch her, two strokes is possible, but three. That gets harder.   
But I was very fortunate that I made birdie on 18. Four strokes for the final round to catch is hard but better than five strokes.   
Overall my game is not bad, so if I can pick up some hints, I might have a good score tomorrow.   
After I turned pro, Minjee's name was always on the leaderboard. I think she is very steady. Watching her, she has the same tempo all the time. She's a great shotmaker.   
At Walmart, I played with Minjee in the final round, that time I was tied at the top at the start. So the condition is different this time.
