NASA HATAOKA: I was really nervous from the beginning to end, but happy that I won.
Q. You came from four strokes behind ?
NASA HATAOKA: I set my goal to 15 under, I couldnât reach that. But I saw the scoreboard and Minjee was dropping her score. So I told myself, just stay ahead of her. I tried not to be too aggressive. Just played my own golf then.  I saw the score board after the sixth hole, on the way to the seventh hole. That time I was tied, then I was on top of leaderboard.
Q. You were in lead before back nine?
NASA HATAOKA: I was not expecting that, I thought Minjee will come back. So I thought I have to play good and score back nine.
Q. What was in your mind when you shot bogey 11 and 12?
NASA HATAOKA: Actually after two bogeys, par on 13 was turning point and 14th birdie. If I bogey 13 I wouldnât be here. That par turned 14th to birdie. No.13, I hit tee-shot into left rough, 164 yards to the pin, I hit 7 iron short. 28 yards with pitching wedge. Tried to roll the ball and settled 3 feetfrom the pin. I learned this type of approach after I started playing in US.  I asked my caddie what kind of slope the green is, to make sure ball rolls toward pin.
Q. Winning in Japan?
NASA HATAOKA: I had a win in US, I was in contention few times after, but I couldnât win. I am happy that I won in front of Japanese fans. I wanted to show how I improved playing in US.
Q. No.18th Birdie Putt?
NASA HATAOKA: I did not want it to be too strong.  Just set the speed and good stroke. It was 2m (7ft) down hill slice line.  So I just set my image to the speed of the green.  When it rolled in, It felt like when I won in Miyagi TV Cup. Now my goal is to win at four-day event, because both event that I won was three days. I need to strengthen my physical to do that. And I like to prepare for Majors next year.
