 Q.  Another bogey-free round.  How did you feel out there?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I putt really better than yesterday, so I played really well today.   
 Q.  I heard someone say you were very dialed in and felt like nothing could go wrong with your game.  How did you feel?  How was your focus?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I'm not nervous today and I focused on one shot at a time.  I hit it good.   
 Q.  What do you think is the best part of your game right now?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I think off the tee.   
 Q.  Off the tee?  
NASA HATAOKA: I hit it really good off the tee.   
 Q.  You almost made another hole-in-one today on the same hole.  How about that shot?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Laughter.) (Through translation.)  Yeah, the tee is forward and short irons and wedges on my hands, so in my mind I just say two cuts from to the right side.   
So it's so close.   
 Q.  Yeah.  So last year -- was that the first time you played this course last year?  Yes.  But missed the cut.  Why do you think this year you're playing so well?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I think the golf course suits me.  I was thinking about last year kind of suit me, but I think my golf game is coming back this year.   
 Q.  Just in your second year, how much more comfortable do you feel out here playing a full schedule on the LPGA?  
NASA HATAOKA: (Through translation.)  I think last year I didn't know the golf course at all; this year kind of I know the golf course.  And also I plan really well a little week to week.   
 Q.  Great.  Thank you.  
NASA HATAOKA: Thank you.
