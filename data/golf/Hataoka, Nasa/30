Q. Ladies, congratulations.  You had a draw yesterday; fighting back well with that birdie, birdie finish and a victory today against a very strong team in Sweden.  Nasa, you must be very happy with how you performed together.
NASA HATAOKA: Definitely the birdie, birdie finish did after today's rounds, and really happy with team with Ayako, because we are really good team.
Q. You both seem to be helping out when needed.  If the one doesn't birdie, the other birdies.  You've dovetailed well as a combination.
PLAYER: Yeah, definitely help between to each other.  Like when she's down I help, and when I'm up -- you know, we both help each other continuing from yesterday.
And today winning point is really big, so hopefully bring this moment up to the next match.
Q. Obviously very different weather conditions today.  How differently was the course playing?
PLAYER: Definitely the distance is really long because it's wet, so few par 4s feels really long being like a par-5.
Q. Finally, Ayako, nice with a lot of golf to be played today you could get the match finished early before the very quick turnaround for round three.
AYAKO UEHARA: (Through translation.)  Well, our strategy today was we wanted to be aggressive and really finish early so we can take a break longer and then prepare for the next match.
So we did our strategy very well today.
