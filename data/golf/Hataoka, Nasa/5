(Through translation.)
Q. Nasa, being able to finish strong like that, what does that do for your confidence going into a final round tomorrow?
NASA HATAOKA:   Yes, today's round the putting didn't go in so I couldn't get into the flow of things, but I didn't feel like I played that badly.
Hopefully tomorrow putts will go in.
Q. I was going to say, what do you think you need to work on?  What are you going to think about heading into tomorrow's final round?
NASA HATAOKA:   I feel like the speed on the greens was a little bit off.  I was online but came up short, so I think I'll work on that.
Q. Your whole group had some really nice birdies, even some eagles in there.  Does that motivate you to do better when your group is doing well?
NASA HATAOKA:   Yeah, just try to stay close as possible with the players that I played with.  The two eagles on No 9 from the other players were great.
Q. Are you one of those people that likes chasing the lead, as you'll do tomorrow?
NASA HATAOKA:   At the start might get a little bit nervous if I was the one being chased, but once the round starts tomorrow and if I'm the one that is chasing, that's fine as well.  I'll just keep on playing aggressively and make all the birdies.
