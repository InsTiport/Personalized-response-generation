 Q.  Great finishing round of 66, your second 66 of the week. What was your assessment of the tournament?  
NASA HATAOKA: I was aiming for 15 today, so I was able to get that.   
 Q.  What did you do well today that enabled you to shoot that score?  
NASA HATAOKA: I was able to just keep my target in mind, even if I started with a bogey, so that was the main part that got me going.   
 Q.  Why was 15 what you had in mind? I know the leaders are potentially a little bit higher. Where did you think 15 would get you to?  
NASA HATAOKA: I was aiming for 20. I usually go for Top-20, but in this case it was kind of hard, so I decided on Top-10, and then aim for 15 to get into the Top-10, yeah. That's my kind of thinking on these tournaments.   
 Q.  What's next for you after this?  
NASA HATAOKA: A major in Japan.   
 Q.  When is that?  
NASA HATAOKA: Two weeks from now.   
 Q.  So you've had quite a stretch of events with all the majors and other LPGA events. How have you managed to keep on your game?  
NASA HATAOKA: Just let my good points grow will keep me going, not being negative.
