Q. Alongside Nasa Hataoka carding a 6-under in the first round of the Cambia Portland Classic, and your final nine, which was the front nine for you today, you shot 5-under on that side. What got going for you there?
NASA HATAOKA: Because of my irons being in pretty good condition, I was just aiming toward the pin, and that made that 5-under.
Q. On the opening nine for you, the back nine, it was a little bit slow out of the gate and you birdied the 15th, which got the round going. What happened at 15 to get that birdie?
NASA HATAOKA: I got it with my iron shot. It gave me a little comfort because I was going from over to under par.
Q. You also got a little comfort in Canada last week. You hadn't been playing super well going into the last week, finished tied for fifth. What did you bring from Canada to Portland that's continued to let you play so well?
NASA HATAOKA: Having that two weeks off and being able to kind of adjust on that Canada tournament kind of brought this good condition to me for this week.
