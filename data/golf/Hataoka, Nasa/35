 Q.  A little bit of an up-and-down round today; how would you describe things out there?  
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah, I did start with a bogey, but I was able to put some birdies on the scorecard on the back nine.   
 Q.  How much of a difference was the conditions today versus yesterday?  
NASA HATAOKA: Yeah, it was definitely windy and it was very cold today.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow in terms of how you're going to approach things on the golf course?  
NASA HATAOKA: I'm playing better day by day, so I want to go out there with that confidence.
