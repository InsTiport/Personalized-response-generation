Q. Eight birdies and a 63, you must be happy how you played in the final round?
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, I didn't know what to expect today.  I just knew that I had to keep my head in the game, really, and hit every shot really fully committed.  I'm happy that I did and I'm glad with the score.
Q. With an outside chance, how was it to play in the final round?
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, I know those guys are superstars, so I just said, play my own game.  I'm glad I posted a low score.  I don't know what's going on behind me.  I think they are a few ahead but I'm just happy with my second start as a pro.
Q. How do you find playing in Saudi Arabia for the first time, good experience?
MIN WOO LEE: It's great.  I haven't had any problems.  The food is nice.  Everything, the weather is awesome, and it gets windy, so I love that, yeah.
Q. And finishing in fourth place, you must be delighted?
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, as a second start as a pro, I'm very happy.
Q. You must be confident now going on for the full season?
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, hopefully it's a bit of a momentum booster, but yeah, I'm super happy.
