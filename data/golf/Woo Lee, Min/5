 Q.  Okay, how disappointed are you right now?  
MIN WOO LEE: Pretty disappointed.  Like I said, I didn't lose to a bad player, so can't do much better.  It's Match Play.  I just didn't produce shots when I needed to.  Bit disappointed, but always on to the next one, hold my head up high.   
 Q.  Was there anything that you had felt this was coming over the last couple of days?  That you weren't just quite right?  
MIN WOO LEE: What do you mean?   
 Q.  Did you feel like you weren't quite in form the last couple of days?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, like the stroke play rounds I scored well, but I just didn't -- there were so many holes where I just -- nothing -- it didn't feel right.  I shot 2-under, 4-under, not too bad.  Just pretty good scores, but I just didn't feel right.  My game's not at an A-level right at the moment.  It's not up there.  So, yeah, I did well to shoot those scores with a pretty decent, average game.   
 Q.  Right.  Was that a goal coming into this year though to defend this title?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, definitely.  I knew I had a good chance of winning.  I got knocked out first round, so can't do much now about it.  I always keep confidence in myself, and always have a mindset of winning because there is no point in playing if you're not going to win.  You don't think you're going to win.  I felt good coming into it.  Yeah, unfortunately, lost.
