 Q.  Great round of 63.  Can you tell me how well you played today?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, I found something on the range today.  Yesterday afternoon it wasn't pretty, so I found something this morning, and stuck with it.  Yeah, it turned out well, a lot of momentum putts and yeah, I made a lot of birdies, so that's nice.   
 Q.  How easy were the conditions this morning?  
MIN WOO LEE: They were nice.  They were good.  There was some holes that got windy on the back nine, but yeah, I just took advantage of it.   
 Q.  What do you think of this course?  It's quite a tricky course and the greens are quite grainy?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, it's very grainy.  I'm putting pretty well and feel like I'm rolling it pretty good.  I think some of the other guys aren't putting that good, so yeah, it's nice to roll some putts in.   
 Q.  All right.  Would you say that's one of your best rounds as a professional golfer?  
MIN WOO LEE: Actually, I had two 8-unders when I was like 16 back in Australia but over the past few years, yeah, it has been.   
 Q.  Are you hoping to be as good as your sister on the ladies tour?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, hopefully better, but hopefully I'm heading in the right direction.   
 Q.  And I suppose you're hoping it's going to get windy like it has every afternoon and you might have an outside chance tomorrow?  
MIN WOO LEE: Yeah, I'm hitting it well enough to post a low score, so see what happens.
