 Q.  Your first win, how does it feel?  
HAO TONG LI: It feels incredible, especially tomorrow, you know, against Brooks.  It's going to make me more comfortable, at least I'm up, got one win already.   
 Q.  Looks like you were solid all round.  Game was good.  Long game was good.  Putting was incredible.  
HAO TONG LI: Yeah, putting was good.  I rolled three birdies putts and one eagle, as well.  It's been playing solid, and especially today had a few holes a little bit off and short game recovery very good.  And my partner just didn't play his best today.   
 Q.  This sets you up nicely for the group matches against Brooks, as you were saying.  How much do you want to beat Brooks tomorrow?  
HAO TONG LI: I just want to play my best and hopefully I can show him my talent.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're in control of your game and your swing this week?  
HAO TONG LI: Yeah, getting better.  Especially putting.  If my putting is better, I think, everything just going better.
