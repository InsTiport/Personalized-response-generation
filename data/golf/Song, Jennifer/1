  Q. Jennifer, How was your round today?  I mean, even though you had two holes where it looked like it was a tough time, you still bounced back and shot minus-2 overall.
 JENNIFER SONG:   Yeah, it was just a lot of bouncing back can forth.  I think overall I played really well and I feel good going into the weekend.
 It's just the greens are getting really firm in the afternoon and with the greens being new it's kind of judge look how to read the putt or like the roll isn't quite like just right as I want it.
 So I think that's a little bit of a struggle.  Like I said, everybody is playing the same golf course so it's all about how you manage it.  Definitely I feel really good.
 Q. What was your goal, if any, coming into this week?
 JENNIFER SONG:   Just trying to feel more comfortable.  Last week was our first event, so like it was happy nervousness, but it's just -- you know, I just had to kind of get in the groove of like to play tournament golf, and I felt more comfortable coming in.
 I just want to play my game out there and I think it's coming along very well.
 Q. We noticed before your round started there were some friends, maybe of Annie's too that you laughed and smiled with.  How is that to have lighthearted fans follow you guys?
 JENNIFER SONG:   It was pretty funny.  I was giving them bottles of water and I said, It's $20 a bottle.  Yeah, it was fun having friends around and they were definitely being supportive.  It's great to see familiar faces out here.
 Q. Last question is:  What are you looking forward to for the weekend?
 JENNIFER SONG:   I want to go low.  That's all.  I just want to play great golf.  I know it's there.  I think as long as I just play my game and have fun out there everything should be good.
