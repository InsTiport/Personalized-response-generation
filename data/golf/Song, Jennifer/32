 Q. Tell me a little bit about the day. 
 JENNIFER SONG: Basically I was just hitting a consistent shot. Wasn't hitting it all over the place. I had a lot of the birdie chances, and I just managed to make three of them.
 There was definitely more birdies out there that I should have made, but I'm really happen about shooting 3-under par score on the first day.

 Q. How was the wind today? How do you think you handled it? 
 JENNIFER SONG: It was very windy on the front nine. You know, it's really tough on us because mentally it wears you out. But, I don't know, I somehow managed to play well here.

 Q. It's the LPGA's first time in Taiwan. How has it so far?
 JENNIFER SONG: It's really good. I've been here five, six years ago. I don't know the exact time, but I came the Korean national team and I played this golf course. 
 So it's good to be back. 

 Q. Are you donating money this week to a charity?
 JENNIFER SONG: Yes.

 Q. Which one is it?
 JENNIFER SONG: I haven't looked at it yet, but I always look around with my agent and my dad. I haven't had a chance to look at what charity to donate, but hopefully there is a good one.
