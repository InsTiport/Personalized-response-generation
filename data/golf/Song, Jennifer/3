Q. Jennifer, another final grouping for you.  What are some positives you can take away from today?
JENNIFER SONG:   I shot under par for four rounds and definitely Top 5 is something.  It's a great positive.  Going into the major championship I feel great.
You know, Mel played so solid today and was it really fun to watch.  I think our group had everything going right except for me.
But I really enjoyed it and I just need to work on just little things and I think I'll get better.
Q. Were you able to have just a lot of fun out there too as well?  Seemed like you guys were very focused on each other.  I feel like these groups it's a lot fun as well.
JENNIFER SONG:   Yeah, we had great camaraderie and we were cheering each other on.  When other players made birdie we were saying, Good birdie.  Definitely fighting out there for great scores and Mel was -- she just showed perfect golf today.
Q. You had the lead late on the front nine.  Did that give you some hope, and what was the turning point you think for you?
JENNIFER SONG:   Well I had no clue where I was.  I was just playing one shot at a time.
You know, I definitely left a lot of birdie opportunities out there, so I'm kind of disappointed.
Overall I'm very happy about where -- with my tournament because I think every week I'm getting better.  I feel confident and I know exactly what to work on.
So I'm looking forward to next week.
Q. What is there to work on going into the major next week and how comfortable are you with your game after a strong showing here?
JENNIFER SONG:   I think I just need to make a lot of putts next week.  I heard Aronimink is a great golf course, so obviously I think it requires like straight drives and we have to be really good with fairway shots.
I think putting is the most important thing.  So we'll see how it rolls.
