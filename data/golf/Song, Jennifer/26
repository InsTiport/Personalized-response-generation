 Q.  Bogey-free 65 today; how would you describe the round?  
JENNIFER SONG: I really enjoyed my round today.  I had some struggles here and there.  I missed some tee shots that went into the rough, but I made great up-and-downs, and I was so surprised that I had a bogey-free round because usually I make a lot of bogeys, which gets me upset, but I'm really happy about today.   
 Q.  You started with a 72 here yesterday.  What was the biggest difference for you out there today?  
JENNIFER SONG: Well, shots weren't that great.  I think I just putted well, and I had some good looks here and there, and then when I got it close, I managed to make birdies.  Whenever I had a chance for birdie, I made them all, so I think that helped a lot.   
 Q.  Do you have a number in mind or feel like you need to go low again to have a chance here on Sunday?  
JENNIFER SONG: I mean, I definitely think that I need to go low because there are a lot of great players out here and greens are soft, so it's very easy to attack the pins, so I definitely need to play aggressive tomorrow.
