 Q.  So 4-under.  
JENNIFER SONG: Yep.   
 Q.  Five birdies.  You managed to hit an eagle on No. 8.  
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell us about your day today.  
JENNIFER SONG: Basically everything was going pretty well.  My shots were I think close to perfect.  I missed here and there, but just walked away with a par.   
There was couple -- the ones that I made bogey -- what did I do?  I don't even remember.  When I had a good birdie chance I made it.   
The shot I hit on 8 to make the eagle putt I just stiffed it.  It was six feet to the right and I just drained it clean.   
Just kept my momentum going.  I just hoped I would've played a little better on the back nine.  Still, I finished even par on the back nine, 4-under for the day, and I'm very happy about it.   
 Q.  What will you take from today's round into tomorrow?  
JENNIFER SONG: I think if I get the pace right, pace better on the longer putts tomorrow I think I'll have better chances of shooting better scores.   
If I just keep the same attitude I think I'll play very well.   
 Q.  What do you do to prepare yourself for this season?  
JENNIFER SONG: I just looked at my statistics from last year, and I realize my GIR statistic wasn't that great.  If I hit good shots -- I know I'm a great putter, so I knew I would have a lot of birdie chances, so I focused on shot making over the off-season and just kind of practiced getting the same rhythm, and I think that helped out.   
 Q.  Did you change anything in your bag?  
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, I think every year I just try out new equipment.  I'm trying out new M3 and M4.  I just try to switch to new things because it just feels like new Christmas present and I get a better vibe when I start with it.   
Everything has been going very well.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  So how are you feeling about your game at this point in the season?  
JENNIFER SONG: Very good.  I think I'm going to have some good tournaments, so I'm excited for myself.
