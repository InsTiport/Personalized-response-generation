Q. So 5-under, 68; that's one of your best scores all year.  How did you feel out there today?
JENNIFER SONG: I felt pretty good about my shot.  The last couple weeks I wasn't happy with my ball trajectory, so before coming here I met my coach and worked on my swing and tried to get the normal trajectory that I want, and I think that really helped me out this week.
When I had the chances, I made a lot of putts.  Helped me out a lot.
Q. So you think you found something that's working?  Obviously.
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, it's not quite mine yet, but I I'm still working on it.  I think as long as I keep this feeling going I think I'll have some good scores.
Q. What is your coach's name?
JENNIFER SONG: Robin Symes.
Q. Have you been working with him for a long time?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, I've known him for like nine, ten, years, and I've been working with him.
Q. So you had like a streak of four birdies in a row; three birdies to end the round.  That's just making putts you think?
JENNIFER SONG: I knocked it very close to the pin and a couple it wasn't that close, but I putted well, so I think that that led to a good score today.
Q. You like this course?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah.  I mean, I think I left a couple putts out there, but 5-under is still a good score.
Q. So feel pretty good going into tomorrow then like knowing you could have gone even lower?
JENNIFER SONG: Yes, pretty good.
