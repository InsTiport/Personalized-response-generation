 Q.  Talk about your round.  You're up there.  One off the lead.  
JENNIFER SONG: Actually I'm really happy about how I played the last two days.  First round it was a little slow.  I was actually 2-over par and brought it back to even.   
Yesterday and today I just wanted to come out here and just play my best game.  I think I just played really confidently.   
 Q.  Looks like from the numbers the difference between rounds one, two, and three, was putting.  Is that what you see as well?  
JENNIFER SONG: Yes.  First day my shots were just kind of all over the place; once I got the rhythm down I think I started to hit some good shots.   
Actually changed my putter coming into this week, so I feel kind of refreshed and feels really great.
