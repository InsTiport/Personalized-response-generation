 Q.  Can you just sum up your day overall for me?  
JENNIFER SONG: I actually putted really well.  I had some troubles here and there getting the paces right, but then I managed to finish with par.  I think, which hole was it, I think 14 I holed out, so I made an eagle there.  I think I got on a good start, but I kind of struggled the back nine.  But I kind of regrouped and putting started to follow again.  So I'm glad I finished under par.   
 Q.  Tell me more about the eagle on 14?  
JENNIFER SONG: It was, I think, 136 to the flag, and I was just trying to decide if there was a breeze or not.  Thankfully I had the right club and I hit it pretty perfect.  I didn't get to see the ball go in the hole because I was on the left side, but the crowd screamed, so obviously I knew it was something good there.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be 4-under and you're at the top of the leaderboard heading into the weekend?  
JENNIFER SONG: It always feels great being on the top of the leaderboard going into the weekend.  You know, it's just fun being out here.  The crowds are great.  I was actually surprised the first day to see so many spectators out here.  They're very supportive, so I felt really happy being out here.
