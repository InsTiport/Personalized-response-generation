Q. Pretty good round today.  3-under, right?  What was the difference for you today?
JENNIFER SONG: My shots were pretty dialed in.  I got in a little trouble with my tee shot, so I was in the rough a couple times, but I managed to -- some of them I just walked away with par, and a couple of them I hit a decent shot.  But I mean, it was close so that I could make a birdie, but then I missed it.  So overall I think my shot making was pretty good.  Then when I had a good birdie chance, I was able to make those birdies.
Q. Yeah, you feel pretty good about your game heading into this week?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, it feels pretty good.  As long as I maintain the same feeling and just have no doubt in myself and commit to my shots, I think it will be great.
Q. Kind of a middle of the pack finish.  You made the cut the past few years, but just kind of in the middle.  Do you like this venue, this event, this course?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, I always love coming to the west coast.  I went to USC for two years, so it feels like home.  Who doesn't love California?
Q. Right.  Do you have people following you?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, I've got a couple friends from the UK and from California, and a couple of my college friends will come out on the weekends, so it will be great seeing them.
Q. Eagle at 11.  Is that your second hole of the day?
JENNIFER SONG: Yes, that was the second hole of the day.  It was a little chilly.  Drives weren't flying far.  I think the afternoon tee times will have more benefit in the afternoon.  But then I was on the fringe.  I hit a good second shot into the green, 3-wood, and it was just a yard off the fringe.  I putted, and as soon as the ball left the face, I was like, oh, that kept the line, it felt good.  Then it just kept trickling through and went in the hole.
Q. Awesome.  Is that typically how it works here?  In the morning it's a lot different?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, I think you get more carry in the afternoon.  The ball gets firmer, so the ball will run out a little more.  So in the morning, I don't think the morning people got the advantage of getting more distance on the course.
Q. So then you have to feel good about getting a good number out there this morning.
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, yeah.  I felt good.  I mean, I was first off, and I wasn't sure if my body was going to be ready, but it felt good.
