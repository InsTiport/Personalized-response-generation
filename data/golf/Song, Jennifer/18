Q. You were pretty sneaky this week.  What worked out there for you today?
JENNIFER SONG: Well, I kind of struggled with my putting last week and starting this week, and I finally kind of figured out what's a good stroke for me, and I felt really comfortable out there.  I missed a really short birdie putt on 16, but other than that, I think I played great out there.  Just gave myself a lot of chances at birdies, and when I did, I made them all.
Q. What differences did you make or what changes did you make to your putting?
JENNIFER SONG: Well, I was kind of upright in my setup position, so I kind of got down low and just made sure that elbow to the shaft is straight down to feel comfortable with my arms.
Q. Overall how did you feel about your week here?
JENNIFER SONG: I loved it.  The superintendent did a great job in bringing back the golf course, and the food at the dining was awesome, and the crowds were amazing.  I would definitely come back here to play.
Q. We have one more event before the major championship; what are you going to work on?
JENNIFER SONG: I think my shots, my tempo was kind of off here and there, so I just need to work on that a little bit.  Other than that, just keep everything the same and get my confidence going.
Q. Looking forward to the end of the season, are there any events or any goals that you had in mind that you still would like to accomplish?
JENNIFER SONG: I definitely want to play well at the Evian Championship.  I had a great event last year, so I have good memories there.  Hopefully many more good events to come.
