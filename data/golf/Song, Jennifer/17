Q. You watched the ball?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, we all watched the ball.  It was pretty straight and just -- I couldn't tell if it went in or not because it was just behind the ridge, but I knew that it was pretty close to the hole.
Q. So 8-iron?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, 8-iron.
Q. How many?
JENNIFER SONG: 151 -- how many?
Q. Yeah.
JENNIFER SONG: This is my eighth hole in one.
Q. So the last?  The last hole in one, when you had last hole in one?
JENNIFER SONG: I his it was like two years ago.
Q. Two years, okay.  So a little bit of disappointing with no prize for this hole in one?
JENNIFER SONG: Yeah, it's okay.  Any hole in one is good.  It would've been really great to have some sort of prize, but I think we get a prize, right?  We have a deal with LPGA, so better than nothing.
Q. Okay.  And 1-under, right?
JENNIFER SONG: 2-Under.
Q. So 2-under for such a windy day.
JENNIFER SONG: Uh-huh.
Q. It's a good score for you or just...
JENNIFER SONG: Well, I got off to a good start.  I was 4-under at one point when I got on the 9th hole, but then I kind of struggled on the 9th hole and made a double on 10.  So it was a disappointing turning point, but I fought back and brought it back to 2-under, so I'm pretty happy about my round.  There are three more days left, so I think I have a chance.
Q. Except hole in one, other highlight of the this day?
JENNIFER SONG: I think it was No. 14.  I was on the fairway and I hit driver off the deck.  That was a good feeling.  I had a good shot, so came off that hole with a birdie.  That was a good hole.
