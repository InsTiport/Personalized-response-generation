 Q.  Great round today, 5-under.  
HYO YOO KIM: I'm pretty satisfied with how I played today.  During the first and second rounds, I didn't really have a lot of birdie chances, but today going 5-under, I feel pretty good my game right now.   
 Q.  Was there any difference in how fast the greens were rolling?  
HYO YOO KIM: Today was pretty much the same as yesterday.  The greens were rolling pretty fast, and the greens were pretty hard, and so on the front nine, the wind was blowing, which helped it roll, and the greens were very much similar to that of a major.   
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's round.  I definitely want to do well and get birdies on those par 5s.  I didn't get any on them today.  I'm looking forward to playing really well.
