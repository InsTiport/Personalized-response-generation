Q. Martin Flores, 5-under par today.  Tell us about your round and how you're feeling.MARTIN FLORES: I feel really good about where I stand in the tournament.  I was 1-over, you know, starting on Thursday, and then made a clutch putt on my second to last hole, about 40 feet, just to make the cut, and then I had felt that things had been coming along for a while, I just haven't done anything in a golf tournament, which is what you're supposed to do.  I feel really good about the state of my game, and I'm happy where it's moving.Q. Seems like the wind is down a little bit from the last couple days.MARTIN FLORES: Yeah, it sure is.  In the wave that I was in this week, it was pretty windy, and today, you know, it was a lot less, which was nice.  I mean, you've still got to -- it makes it easier to possibly hit fairways and hit the greens, but the greens are a lot firmer, so it's definitely going to put a premium on where you leave the ball on the greens.
