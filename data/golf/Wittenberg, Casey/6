Q.   A solid two rounds, especially this round.   You birdied the last three when the rain started coming down harder and it got colder.   How does that work? 
    CASEY WITTENBERG:   I was fortunate to have some good numbers out there.   I was fortunate to hit some close shots.   You're out there and you just try to put your head down and try to do the best you can.

Q.   Obviously, the South Course is going to be softer than when you played it in round one.   What are your expectations this weekend? 
    CASEY WITTENBERG:   It's going to play longer.   The rough will probably play a little mere penal.   The greens will be more receptive, so I'm sure some of the longer hitters will shoot some low numbers out there and make some birdies.

Q.   Adizero is sponsoring our live coverage all week.   The first time playing with the new kicks in the rain.   How did it feel? 
    CASEY WITTENBERG:   It was awesome.   They're great.   They're super light.   One of the worst things about shoes is when they get wet, how heavy they get.   So these are awesome.
