Q.   Even par.   Tell me a little bit about your round. 
CASEY WITTENBERG:   I got off to a slow start, I bogeyed the first two holes but those were my only bogeys of the day so I calmed down after that.   Had some opportunities on the back nine to make some putts, and unfortunately I couldn't wiggle them in.   I hit it in a bad spot on 16, just had a hard enough time making par and then 17 I missed a pretty makeable putt.   Just kind of one of those days.   I hit the ball okay.   Didn't hit it great, but I hit it okay, and just couldn't get it to go in the hole.

Q.   Over all four days into the championship you're happy with your performance?
CASEY WITTENBERG:   Yeah, I mean it's a learning process for me.   No doubt. 
It's always fun to play with Tiger.   He's fun to be around and a good person and so it's always fun to watch.   So I'll take something from this week and play some good golf the rest of the year.

Q.   What are your plans for the next event and next place you're going?
CASEY WITTENBERG:   I'm head to Wichita Tuesday afternoon, so I got to I know issue up that Nationwide Tour stuff and then hopefully I'll have my card by the end of the year.
