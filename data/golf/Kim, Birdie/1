 Q.  What was the turning point for you? 
 BIRDIE KIM:  I played pretty good.  I hit an almost perfect shot and had a really bad miss on 14.  I just missed a tee shot in the water and I was like scared.  We both made birdie on hole No. 16.  And then she miss, on hole 17.  That was a turning point I think. 

 Q.  How did you keep your head in the match?  How did you stay in the match after you hit the ball in the water on 14? 
 BIRDIE KIM:  I was before in the matter, so if I lose, just one hole, and I have the confidence to make a lot of birdies. 

 Q.  What did you do on 17? 
 BIRDIE KIM:  I just make an easy tee shot with a 7-iron, easy 2-putt. 

 Q.  What's it like beat a player of Morgan's caliber; a big win for you? 
 BIRDIE KIM:  I think I just play my own game and I just beat her today.  Same thing tomorrow, I just try to play my game. 

 Q.  How is match play for you?  Are you familiar with match play, is it something you're comfortable with? 
 BIRDIE KIM:  I like match play, it's very fun, yes.
