Q.
(No microphone.)
BIRDIE KIM:  Oh, I don't think about that yet.
Q.  What kind of influence did your golf instructor have on your game?
BIRDIE KIM:  He helped on my mental a lot and then after that a swing a little bit.
Q.  What would your plans have been last week before you qualified?
BIRDIE KIM:  Actually, back to my home, Miami.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Not a bad change coming here though, right?
BIRDIE KIM:  Yeah, lose my ticket.
Q.  How important is a match play tournament for the future of women's professional golf?
BIRDIE KIM:  I think it's very important that women's match play should go on and maybe get a little bit better in prizes and more events.
Q.  Have you been involved in match play before and do you like the format?
BIRDIE KIM:  Yeah, when I was amateur I tried U.S. Women's Amateur Championship.  That's match play; right?

I think I like.  (Smiling).
Q.  Could you describe the difference in how you approach match play versus stroke play?
BIRDIE KIM:  Yeah, match play is more exciting and the more I can play it.  I can play a little more aggressive on match play than stroke play.
Q.  Have you played any other courses
PAUL ROVNAK:  Atlantic City.
BIRDIE KIM:  I think I won in Mana Lupa (ph) when I was playing on (Asian) LPGA TOUR.
Q.  Did you plan on ignoring    (no microphone. )
BIRDIE KIM:  My feel was my feeling, but told me it looks like very hard, like if I miss the cup, maybe go over the green.  I don't think it's not that bad.  Maybe a bit of luck.
Q.  What went through your mind when you hit that shot?
BIRDIE KIM:  Actually, I didn't saw the roll.  Just saw it go in the hole.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you, birdie.
