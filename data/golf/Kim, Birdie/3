   MIKE SCANLAN:  Birdie Kim, you shot a 6-under 65 today and you're tied for third after the first round.  Can you just talk a little about how you feel you played today?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  I today I hit pretty good shot, I didn't miss the green.  Since the Ginn I played good and today I made all the greens and played everything -- 16 putts I had birdie chance.   
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Can we go through your score card quickly? Birdie on No. 1.  Do you know what you hit?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  9-iron to one yard.   
 MIKE SCANLAN:  No. 5?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  I hit 6-iron.  7, I use wedge, 30-yard shot, about a foot.   
 8, I made 3-putt.   
 11 was like two feet.  I hit a 58-wedge from 70 yards.   
 13, the par 3, 7-iron to 13 feet.   
 15, I use wedge, 52, from 80 yards.   
 16, I use 5-iron.   
  
  Q.  Do you put a lot of pressure on yourself when you see a lot of early, low scores?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  No.   
  
  Q.  Does it change the way you approach it at all?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  No, because they play on their course and I play my game.   
  
  Q.  Did you have any realistic chances for birdie on 17 and 18?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  17 actually I had long putts, I made 2-putt.  And 18 I had like four yard birdie chance but I missed.   
  
  Q.  Have you played here before?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  Yeah, last two years.   
  
  Q.  Did the course play easier today than it has or that you are it?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  Pretty same but only different thing is my shots is a lot better than the last two years.  (Laughter).   
  
  Q.  Did the wind ever kick up?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  Today wind was pretty quiet.   
  
  Q.  You had mentioned the Ginn tournament, what have you been doing well there and since then?   
 BIRDIE KIM:  Last year I worked on my swing pretty hard, and this year I played good.  I had really good swing and the confidence to play but first few tournaments somehow I couldn't make good score.  My short game is getting better so I'm making better score there.   
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Birdie, thank you very much and good luck this week.
