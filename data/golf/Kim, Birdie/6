Q. Tell us how you were able to hole out that bunker shot at 18?
BIRDIE KIM:  I don't think I make.  I just try to get close.  Tried my best to make par, maybe I can, make bogey still I have chance.  I just want to try to par, get close to hole.  But I never think about those ball go in the hole.  So amazing.
Q.  Tell us about that shot on 18.
 BIRDIE KIM:  Just amazing.  (Laughs).  I didn't try to make it, that's why I was surprised and maybe that helped me, that's why I can make it.
Q.  What were you trying to do?
 BIRDIE KIM:  I just tried to get close to hole and then just best I can to make par.
Q.  Can you describe what it was like watching it roll to the cup?
 BIRDIE KIM:  Yeah, I watching Michelle's.  Her ball is not much that rolling, not a lot.  So I catch -- green is not that -- I have confidence that I can close to make the hole, then make it.
Q.  Did you see it go in?
BIRDIE KIM:  I just see it go in.  I didn't see the roll.
Q.  What did you think when it went in?
 BIRDIE KIM:  Maybe I win the tournament.

Well, it was really I didn't think anything.  It was just I make it.  That's all.
Q.  What is the biggest tournament you have won before this one?
 BIRDIE KIM:  I play already Futures Tour three years.  I win tournament three times in the Futures.  Then first time in the LPGA.
Q.  How does this win compare to those?
BIRDIE KIM:  I don't know now.  (Laughs) Still I can't believe.
Q.  Can you talk about your emotions when that birdie dropped in on 18?  Did your heart start to race?
 BIRDIE KIM:  Oh, no.  I just -- I don't think so.  It was just I make it.  That's all I feel.  I was so tired.
Q.  Golf is so important in your country.  What do you think is going on right now in your country with this win?
BIRDIE KIM:  I don't think about that far.
Q.  When you started your round this morning, you had every intention of winning this tournament?
 BIRDIE KIM:  No, I just try to Top 5 (laughs).  I didn't try to make the win.  Just I always try to easy, just right at the fairway right at the green, two-putt.  If I miss, I can make later.
Q.  How about your emotions now, has it sunk in that you are the U.S. Open Champion?
 BIRDIE KIM:  A little bit (laughs).  A lot of interviews though (laughs).
