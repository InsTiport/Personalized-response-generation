Q. Your first time at the same Darby LPGA Malaysia and an amazing first round.  Could you have expected that this would have happened on your very first round here?
SU-HYUN oh:  No, actually I didn't have very high expectations.  I just went out there and just played like clichÃ© one shot at a time, kind of thing.  I was off really early, and it was really dark when I got here.  So I wasn't sure if I could get a full warmup in, and just got enough time to have a full warmup.  Just got done before the storm hits.
Q. Eight birdies out there today.  Would it be fair to say you had a pretty aggressive mind-set approaching the course?
SU-HYUN oh:  Yeah, well, it's not too firm out there.  It was actually firmer than the practice rounds.  Yeah, I think quite aggressive.  I made two 6s out there, so I think there's still room to improve on.
But overall, I think I hit the ball quite solid.  Just a couple of hiccups along the way.  Like my tee shots weren't as good on the front nine, and then on 10, obviously -- well, my 10th hole, the first hole.
But overall, it was pretty good, yeah.
Q. Lastly you're now the clubhouse leader in an LPGA tournament from day one.  What are you going to do for the rest of the day?  What's downtime going to be like for you?
SU-HYUN oh:  Well, that mall right next to the hotel is pretty nice.  My dad's here.  It's his last week on the road with me, so we might get a foot massage and then probably hit Din Tai Fung for dinner.  Got a lot planned.
