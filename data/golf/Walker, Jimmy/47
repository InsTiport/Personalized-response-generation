Q. I hope you don't let that bogey at the last hole flavor what was a very solid round of golf.
JIMMY WALKER: I appreciate it.  It is going to -- it stings a little bit, bogeying 9, but just didn't hit a very good tee ball.  I played real solid all day, made a lot of great putts.  A lot of good par putts.  It was a nice, solid day.  Just kind of kept the ball out in front of me.  I also felt like they had some pretty tough pins today, actually.  I thought it played -- it wasn't like you were just throwing darts out there.
Q. I thought the greens were receptive but also had some speed to them, particularly if you were on the wrong side of the slope?
JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, on 18 I ran one by about 12 feet, I think.  You definitely had to be careful.  The greens were running pretty fast.  But they were receptive, which was interesting.  But the greens are fast.  They were good.
Q. What is it about the fall season that seems to bring out some of your better golf?
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know.  I'm looking forward to the off-season.  I do enjoy playing golf here.  I like the golf course.  I don't know what it is.
