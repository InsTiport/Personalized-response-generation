Q.   Beautiful 6‑under 66 today. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, it was just a solid day. 

Q.   Well, you finished 9th in 2010 and 9th in 2011.   Now it looks like you're going to finish around third.   What is it about this place that you love so much?
JIMMY WALKER:   As you play more courses or as you play the courses over and over, you start getting more comfortable and feeling more familiar, and you just start feeling more at home.   I really enjoy being out here check.   There's no better place to be when the weather is nice, and we've had really good weather all week.

Q.   The last couple years seems like you're getting more and more comfortable out here.   Love to see you in the winner's circle soon. 
JIMMY WALKER:   I hope so.   It's been a great weekend, enjoyed my partner.   We had a blast and looking forward to coming back. 

Q.   Just comment on your round today for us. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Just started off slow.   Didn't do much the first couple holes.   Knocked it on in two on 6, made a 2‑putt there.   Then I hit it pretty close on 7, made another birdie.   8 is always a good par.   And then made a good bird on 9, good birdie on 10, another good birdie on 11.   Got one at 14 and then had two really good looks on 15, 16 and they just missed. 
So I rolled it good today.   Made a lot of good putts, no bogeys around here, that's pretty good.
