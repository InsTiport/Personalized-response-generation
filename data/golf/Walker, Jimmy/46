 Q.  You finished today at 4-under 67.  You seemed to kind of turn it on on the back side.  What clicked for you?  
JIMMY WALKER: I just stayed patient.  The front is usually a little tougher around this track, I think.  It's got some tough holes, and they had some good pins.  Then the back nine, just stayed -- just kept trying to stay patient, and finally got a couple of birdies and feel like I got on a little bit of a roll, so it was fun.   
 Q.  You've had some great finishes here over the past couple of years.  How does that help you heading into the weekend?  
JIMMY WALKER: I like the golf course.  I like the town and the weather is great.  I have just fun memories of the place.  It's nice to have a place that you enjoy showing up to and look forward to playing more golf.   
 Q.  What do you expect as far as scoring from the field and from yourself?  
JIMMY WALKER: Probably a lot of the same.  It just depends on -- I don't know if the weather is going to be -- I don't know what the weather forecast is going to be, but the greens started to firm up a little bit this afternoon, so you had to be a little bit more cautious.  It started to kind of purple out and you could see a lot of the footprints, and the fairways are starting to firm up out there, so they'll just keep getting firmer and faster, I think, if they let it go.
