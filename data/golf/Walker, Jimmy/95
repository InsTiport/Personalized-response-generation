Q.   Just talk about the round. 
JIMMY WALKER:   The round was good.   Ernie and I, we started feeding off each other, hitting good shots, kind of playing top this and top that.   We got a nice little roll going. 
My finish was strong.   That little hiccup on 10, going for the green in 2, but all in all, it was a good day.   Struck it well and made a few putts. 

Q.   Just talk about the golf course. 
JIMMY WALKER:   It was pretty wet out there.   Walking up 18, I was really surprised about how dry it was.   Didn't have any mud balls.   The golf course played soft, was able to hit some good shots.
