 Q. I've seen you put on some gutty shows before. Getting up-and-down at Disney to save your card, things like that. How tough was it out there for you today on your knee?
 JIMMY WALKER: It was tough. It wasn't too bad to swing, it was just getting around. My left leg is pretty tired from working all day.
 But I played pretty well. I had a flyer on 16 that I didn't anticipate that and cost a bogey. Really only made one bad swing all day today, and it was an 15. So, I mean, I played really good. Just didn't make as many putts as I needed to to keep the round really rolling. 

 Q. But you played great and you got to be a part of something else pretty special playing with Stuart.
 JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, he putted unbelievable. He made everything today. I mean, that's what you do. He hit some really great shots and made all his putts. There you go, 59. 

 Q. Talk about your round a little bit. Seemed like you were in a lot of pain out there. 
 JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, my knee hurts. Need to go get it checked out. It was tough all day putting -- or hitting and just walking really. So it was a tough day.

 Q. In spite of the pain, you still kind of managed to put up a good round. 
 JIMMY WALKER: I did. I hit it really well. Didn't make a many putts on the weekend as I did the first two days. 
 So, you know, I'm happy, especially with what was going on with my leg. It was tough, you know, just getting around. I was just hoping it would hold up, and it did.

 Q. Playing with Stu must have been something?
 JIMMY WALKER: It was cool watching him do that. I've never played with anybody that shoot that low. He made everything. It was really cool to watch. 
 We were talking down the last hole, and I told my caddie, No chance he misses it. He's in the zone today.
