 Q. Nice way to celebrate your birthday with a good finish here, way to start off the season. 
 JIMMY WALKER: This was a good week. I've been working hard in the off-season, a lot of swing stuff, and I played solid this week. Hit it really well, and me making four bogeys, that's pretty rare. So it was a good, solid week, especially around this track.

 Q. How was it playing 36 out there today?
 JIMMY WALKER: You know, after a nice long fat holiday, it's probably not your favorite thing to go do, 36 on a Sunday, but I felt pretty good. Maybe a little shaky there the first couple holes starting the second round for some reason and then kind of worked my way out of it and started playing a little better.

 Q. What was the key to your success this week?
 JIMMY WALKER: Driving it well. I drove it really well and kept it on the fat side of the greens and tried not to make any mistakes.
