 Q.   Solid out there:   Ten birdies, one bogey; fourth place finish last year.   What is it about this golf course and this tournament that makes you have such good, solid play?  
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, I came in off knee surgery last year so I didn't have many expectations.   I remember liking the golf course.   I got back here this week and it looked good again and everything felt pretty good.   Felt like I kept getting better every day this week.  
   
 Q.   We saw some lower scores little bit earlier in the day.   Is there a reason for that?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know.   There wasn't much wind today.   That really helped.   They moved the tees up on all the parâ€‘5s it seemed, so looked like they set it up to score today.  
That's what we thought playing.  
   
 Q.   What was the key to your round?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Hit a lot of really good iron shots; made a lot of good putts.   That was pretty much it.   Kept hitting good shots and I made putts, so that was nice.  
   
 Q.   Earlier this year last season you were knocking on the door quite bit looking for that first PGA TOUR win.   What do you have to do to try to go out and get that victory?   
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, you need little bit of luck, I think, and you need to play good.   Maybe just haven't played as good as I need to on the last day or somewhere during the golf tournament to win.  
So go out there tomorrow, you know, and good things happen.
