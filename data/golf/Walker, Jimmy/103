 Q. Talk about what kind of score you think it will take to win.   
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, it's hard to say.   I don't really know.   Seems like it's playing pretty tough.   The wind is kind of all over the place a little bit but fairly steady.   So just depends on what the weather does this weekend as to what scores do, I think.  
   
 Q.   Did your 17th drive hit a bird in mid‑air?   
JIMMY WALKER:   I couldn't see that.   I don't think so, or otherwise it probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.   It got down there pretty far.   We saw it fly the whole way and then it kind of disappeared over the trees, so I don't think so.  
   
 Q.   It seemed like there was a slow‑motion shot of it nicking a bird in flight.   Have you ever seen anything like that before?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know.   Was it the first or the second shot?   
   
 Q.   The first, off the tee.   
JIMMY WALKER:   I didn't see it.  
   
 Q.   Was the up‑and‑down on 18 a big moment?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yes, it was.   It was to save the whole day.   I hit a pretty poor drive, and I thought I hit a pretty good second shot, but it flew a little too far, caught a flier, and then hit a great chip.   Any time you've got to bump it into these uphill, into‑the‑grain Bermuda fairway‑type deals, it's tough, and we judged it really good and it just kind of ran out and made a really good putt, so it was nice to finish the day like that.
