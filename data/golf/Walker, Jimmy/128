 Q.   How did things go out there today?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Today was good.   I played really well on my front, the back, and hit some really good shots, hit some close shots, and then on the back was just a fraction off, a couple bogeys, had a couple birdies to finish even on the back.   But all in all, it was a good day for sure.  
   
 Q.   What are the players going to face out there today do you think?  
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, the golf course is running.   The greens are decently receptive, and it doesn't like the wind is going to do anything crazy, so it seems like the golf course is right up there.   You've got to drive it in the fairway because the rough is up and it's tough to hit these smaller greens out of the rough for sure.  
   
 Q.   How has the time been here in Hawai'i?  
JIMMY WALKER:   It's been good.   If you come here and you complain, something is wrong.   It's been good.   Golf courses have been great.   My two boys and my wife and inâ€‘laws have been here, so it's been good.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about you're off to a good start in 2014.   Just trying to keep building on the momentum you've got from the start of the year?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I want to keep the pedal down.   I want to keep playing well.   I was disappointed last week.   I wish I would have played better.   But took some positives out of it and bring it into this week, and want to keep playing well.  
   
 Q.   Do you notice your position in the FedExCup now or do you just wait and you know that if you play well it'll take care of itself?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, if you're playing well it always takes care of things, but it's fun to be No.1 and it's fun to be right up there at the top.   It's a long year and it rewards good, solid, consistent play, and I know that's what it takes.
