Q.   Just talk about the round today, pretty good, got going out there. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, hitting it solid on the front, just didn't hit a lot of shots close.   No.9 is playing really tough.   I made one birdie, and then I bogeyed 9 on the back.
And then the back nine, those first couple holes are pretty tough into the wind, and got a birdie on the par‑5, 11, and when I got on some of those downwind holes I got on a little roll and hit some really good shots and made some good putts, and then a little chip‑in to cap it off on the last hole.

Q.   What do you think compared kind of yesterday to today, and are there some things that you've learned the last couple days that have helped you today? 
JIMMY WALKER:   Just got to be patient.   It's so hard to‑‑ it's easy to get frustrated out here.   It's tough.   It's a tough golf course.   It's funny because fans today were going, is it easier today?   No, there's nothing easier about this place.   It's tough, especially with the wind blowing.   No, you just stay patient and keep hitting shots, and hopefully some putts go in.   So that was it. 

Q.   And playing under par today, does that give you confidence going into tomorrow?
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I feel good.   I've been hitting it good.   I shot 4‑over the first two days and felt like I played pretty good.   Yesterday was interesting.   It was really hard, really tough pins, wind was really blowing hard.   People don't understand how hard it was blowing.   You can see it by the scores.   But yeah, I feel good.
