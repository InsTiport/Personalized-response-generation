  JIMMY WALKER:   Didn't hit it great today but just kind of kept it right there and I had a good chance to shoot a good score.   Just didn't really materialize there at the end.   
   
 Q.   Are you learning through all of this that you don't have to be perfect, still contending?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Today was one of those days where I just wasn't hitting it‑‑ didn't have great control over the things that were going on, and just keeping it in front and trying to get up‑and‑down when I could, make a few birdies here and there.   But yeah, definitely, happy to be in a decent spot going into the weekend and have a good, solid weekend.   
   
 Q.   Greens seemed like they were a little firmer?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I think they are just going to get firmer and firmer, and that's going to be the nature of the beast this week and it's good.   It will make it more difficult and you'll have to be a lot more precise into the greens.   
   
 Q.   Does it put a certain score out of reach and keeps things bunched?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Historically the winning score is between like 8‑ and 14‑under, so I don't know, just have to see how it plays out.
