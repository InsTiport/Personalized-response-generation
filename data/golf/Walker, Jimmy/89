 Q.  You are going to play together again this afternoon in the foursome format?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I'm looking forward.  We might have hit a couple off line, but I feel like our ball striking was spot on.  We just didn't get a lot out of it.  Continue that ball striking this afternoon, and see if we can get a few more putts in this afternoon.   Q.  Did it feel a win rather than a halve?  RICKIE FOWLER: Any time you can score a point whether it be a point or half point, especially being 3-down at one point.   JIMMY WALKER: We kept giving ourselves good looks at it.  We were in good shape.  It turned out half point is what we got.  Pretty fun day.   Q.  It looked like you guys were helping each other on the greens quite a bit.  What about the putt on 18, what advice did you give?  RICKIE FOWLER: I basically just him what I was seeing.  He was seeing a little bit inside the hole, I told him I saw the edge.  I'm not sure where it started, but the only thing that matters is it went in.  Nice to see one go in.  We didn't have many putts go in all day, so continue the good ball striking this afternoon and get the job done
