Q.   10‑under par, you're right there with one round to go. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I think so. 

Q.   There's 30‑odd guys within five shots.   What about this golf course, year in, year out, do you think lends itself to such a bunched leaderboard all the way into Sunday? 
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, it's tight.   There's not a lot of guys hitting fairways.   It can make it tough to make birdies, I think.   You know, there's only two par‑5s so the longer hitters can't really space it out, attack the par‑5s so much, I guess.   It seems like it always kind of gets packed in, which makes it exciting.

Q.   Since Fry's have you had maybe a different perspective heading into the final day knowing you can do it?   What will it take tomorrow and how do you think you'll be able to approach this Sunday differently?
JIMMY WALKER:   It just depends.   A lot of it's weather with this golf course.   It can play really tough when it starts getting windy, and you can tackle it when it's benign.   We'll see what tomorrow's weather looks like.   You can't make any bogeys.   On Sundays bogeys are tough, so I've got to try to cut that out because we've been having two or three a day.   Not firepower, but cut some bogeys out tomorrow, and I think we'll be good.
