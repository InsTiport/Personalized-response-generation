Q. Talk about today's round.
JIMMY WALKER: Probably a little up and down on the front.  Each time I make a birdie I would kind of follow-up with a bogey and then nothing -- no bogies on the back, just a couple of birdies.
Would like to have gotten a couple more coming in on 17 and 18.  Putted well, just short irons were lacking this week.
Q. Overall, were you happy with this tournament considering what you've been battling?
JIMMY WALKER: I mean I would have loved to have gotten up there a little higher on the leaderboard but, you know, I'm not saying -- I don't say that how I'm feeling is affecting my golf or any of that.
I wanted to play better, wanted to have a chance to win.  Felt like there were parts of my game that were good enough to do that but some other parts that just lacked this week which kind of you need all your stuff together if you're going to win.
Q. How are you feeling physically today?
JIMMY WALKER: Feel good.
Q. At the end of four rounds, could you tell a difference moreso than usual?
JIMMY WALKER: No.  Actually pretty good week.  So, can't really complain.  A little bout two nights ago where I felt pretty bad after the day was over.
Q. The 1st Round?
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know.  A couple days ago.  Other than that, it's been good.
Q. What's next?
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know.  I got some phone calls to make after the round and I withdrew for next week because I was looking forward to that with Sean.  We'll figure it out in the morning.  I've got a guy to see here in the morning and that will be my last stop.
