  JIMMY WALKER: It was a bummer to not win it.  We all thought it was possible last night and we were all in good spirits.  It's all we can ask for.  It's a bummer.  It's a bummer.   Q.  Talk about your match here today against Lee.  Obviously went out there and played well?  JIMMY WALKER: I played really well.  I played great.  Lee, to his credit, it was like a birdie fest.
