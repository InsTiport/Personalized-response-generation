Q.   Jimmy, you weren't going to let it come down to a here today.   You took all of the drama out of this tournament. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah.   I guess.   I just kept plugging it way, kept making the shots, kept making putts.   It felt great.   Felt great yesterday, felt great again today, so it was really cool. 

Q.   I thought we would look back and see a lopsided win, but this was very close on the front nine, and you just grounded out some pars there that I thought were really key to the round in your first set of holes. 
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, we stayed real patient.   I made a couple of good par putts that really were nice, ran one by there on 7, and finally got a good shot on 8, great chip on 9, another good pitch on 10 and then kind of off and running.   Then I started making a couple of putts and it kind of started distancing itself a little bit there and it sure was nice to finish it off.   17 was fun.   Finishing 18 was really, really cool.

Q.   Had to be fun to walk up 18 knowing that you were going to WIN it. 
JIMMY WALKER:   It was pretty cool.   It was kind of surreal.   I was trying to enjoy every moment today, just trying to really slow down and take it all in. 

Q.   Are you looking for some beachâ€‘front property here now?
JIMMY WALKER:   No.   I should.   No, I love visiting and it's nice to come back and solidify next year's plans already.
