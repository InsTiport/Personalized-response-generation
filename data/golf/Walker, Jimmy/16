Q. Congratulations.  You have a good match tomorrow.
JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, going to play No. 1, so I'll have to play pretty good.  Looking forward to it.
Q. How much does being a Texas guy, having a good amount of experience in wind, help you on a day like this?
JIMMY WALKER: It helps.  This is pretty awkward.  It doesn't really blow like this in San Antonio.  This is really abnormal to blow this hard out of the south.  We'll get north winds in the winter that blow like this.  This is interesting.  We're used to more like 10, 15, 20.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JIMMY WALKER: You've really got to try to control it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JIMMY WALKER: Not really, it felt like a struggle for both of us, I think, and it was just probably the conditions, I think, for both of us.  But it played tough today, it really did.  So it felt like a battle, more than let's go make some birdies and let's try and top each other.
