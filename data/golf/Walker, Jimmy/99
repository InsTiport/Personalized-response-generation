 Q.  FedEx point leader, decent performance here at the U.S. Open, well, you evaluate your performance here?  JIMMY WALKER: It's great.  We got a chance to have a top-10.  And any top-10 in a Major, I think, is pretty good.  So it's nice to have a high finish.  Put some more points on the board.  You can't complain.  I was very happy with the way I played this week.  I got a lot out of the golf tournament.  Got a lot out of my rounds.  Made some really good putts when I needed to make them, so it was good.   Q.  If there was a challenge or difficulty that you ran into early that didn't get you further up the scoreboard, what was it exactly?  JIMMY WALKER: You know, I had a couple three-putts this week.  And just a few little things that kept the momentum from building.  I'd make a birdie and then I'd bogey a hole later or two holes later.  I couldn't quite get that birdie, birdie stretch going to maybe get me over the hump.  It's a hard golf course to get on the right side of momentum because it was so tough.   Q.  It seemed like everyone was managing the score well today.  One person mentioned pin placement.  Was that the key to today's good round for you and for the others?  JIMMY WALKER: There were some more gettable pins today.  But it was still tough.  You still had to hit quality shots and still had to drive it good.  It played tough all day today.  It looked like there was a 3-under out there.  And I played with Jason and he shot 2-under.  I don't know what anyone else did in the morning in the earlier groups.  But anytime you shoot under par in a U.S. Open round is pretty good.
