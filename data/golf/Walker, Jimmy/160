   JIMMY WALKER: Making two doubles on the end, on the weekend. I played really good and I played solid. I can't really complain. Just a couple tee shots kind of got me into trouble but other than that, I played good, hit it good. I'm excited for things to come.

 Q. What does it mean to you?
 JIMMY WALKER: It means a lot. It shows progress. Progress is good.

 Q. The things you've been working on, putting, obviously off the tee box, what kind of strides did you make this week?
 JIMMY WALKER: You know, I continued to putt well this week. I did some stuff last week and really felt last week and continued over to this week. So I think that was awesome. The stuff that we did on the putter was really good, you know. Everything else, it's all a work in progress.

 Q. You in next week?
 JIMMY WALKER: I don't know. That would be seven in a row for me and that's a lot of golf.
