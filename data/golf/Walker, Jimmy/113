 Q.   What's the difference between yesterday and today, how much down to you and how much down to the course being easier?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Definitely felt like I hit it a little better.   Still it's a very tough driving course, even with no wind, there's lots of bunkers.   I played well and made a few more putts and it's definitely easier to make a few putts today with the wind not blowing the golf ball around the green for sure.   
   
 Q.   We followed your success this year.   What's been the difference that's changed you into a multiple winner on the PGA TOUR?  
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, I wish I could really put a finger on it.   It's just a lot of hard work, a lot of years of putting right people in the right place that I feel can help me and I feel like I've got a bunch of good guys working for me; and I've really enjoyed it and it's been a good ride and it's going to continue to be a good ride.  
   
 Q.   Butch Harmon works with us and he's a big fan of you, as well as being a coach to you.   Butch enjoys the fact that you have real self‑belief.   
JIMMY WALKER:   I do.   I think he's really helped me a lot with that, too.   First thing he said when he worked with me was you have to believe in yourself for good things to happen.   It's just been awesome.   I really enjoyed my time with him and look forward to more.  
   
 Q.   You're in good position now.   How do you rate it?   
JIMMY WALKER:   When we were teeing off, it was like, getting back to even would be nice today and almost got there.   I played well.   I hit one little bunker shot out of a green‑side bunker that ran off into the water and made double and that was kind of a bummer.   Played solid after that.   Really kept it in there and kept it going so it's nice to get the rebound and keep it rolling.
