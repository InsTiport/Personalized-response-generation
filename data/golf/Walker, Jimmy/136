 Q.   Jimmy, always one of the toughest holes on the golf course, good finish.   2‑under today and 8‑under overall, you're right in the thick of things?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, birdie on 18 was good.   But it was a struggle today.   I wasn't hitting it as good the last two days, and hitting shots a little off, so we're going to go work on a few things.   But I hung in there good, and it was nice to finish with two birdies in the last three holes.  
   
 Q.   You guys have faced some interesting conditions this week.   I think if you played in the morning, the two days were kind of cold, little breezy.   But today, muggy conditions, a little bit more of a breeze.   How much different did the golf course play?   
JIMMY WALKER:   I thought the golf course is very different every day.   So it will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.   But it's played different every day, and it's had its challenges every day.   I think some guys like different winds, but I was just having a hard time controlling the ball a little bit today.   
But it was a solid round.   Stayed in it, stayed patient, and finished with a good round.  
   
 Q.   There is a guy at the top of the leaderboard named Woods who is now 11‑under par and the leader.   Your thoughts as you try to chase him down tomorrow?   
JIMMY WALKER:   You've obviously got to go out and put some birdies up and not make any bogeys, and not making any bogeys around here is tough to do.   If I can go out and not make any bogies tomorrow and minimize the mistakes, I'm going to make my share of birdies.   So that is the plan.
