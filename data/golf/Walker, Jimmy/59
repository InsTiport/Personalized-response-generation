Q.   What is the feeling today?   You're 2-under.
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah.   I missed a couple putts.   Missed a couple today.   I hung in there, made some good putts so I hit some good shots.   Kept it in there.   I made a bogey on the par 3 and made a couple birdies coming in.   All were good shots.

Q.   Overall, the mindset on a golf course that's been giving up a lot of birdies, including a lot to the guy who is leading.   How do you look at tomorrow?
JIMMY WALKER:   I made my fair share of birdies this week.   I need to have some tomorrow.   I missed a couple points.   I hit it pretty good all day for the most part.   Just missed a couple putts I should have made.   I really wish I could have holed those and we'd be two, three shots better.   So, the course played about the same, not much different.

Q.   How much would it mean after winning Valero to have another Texas victory being a Texan?
JIMMY WALKER:   Be very cool.   I'm not going to leave anything on the table.   I would love to have the trophy in Dallas.   That would be cool.
