 Q. Are you feeling pretty good going into the final round?
 JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, I played solid, hit it well, made some good putts and just kept it right out in front of me.

 Q. You've gotten into a good rhythm the last two rounds actually. 
 JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, just trying to keep the ball in the fairway and put it on the right side of the greens. Just been doing a pretty good job of that.

 Q. Any thoughts going into the final round?
 JIMMY WALKER: Keep doing the same thing. You can watch the leaderboard and see if you've got to kind of try to make a few more birdies here and there. But I'm just going to try to keep doing what I'm doing. It's working pretty good.
