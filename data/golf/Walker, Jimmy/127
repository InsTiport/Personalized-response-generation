Q.   A couple three‑putts.   Did the golf course get a little tougher this afternoon?
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, the wind was kind of up and down and it was swirling a little bit, so you had to watch that.   I had two three‑putts, one of them was from off the green, but a long way away, and the other one was from quite a good distance.   But I really hate three‑putting.   I can't stand it.   Other than that I hit it pretty good.   I didn't drive it as well on the back as I would have liked, but finishing with two birdies really was nice.

Q.   How challenging is it to find the fairways here at Waialae?
JIMMY WALKER:   It's very tough because it seems like you're always‑‑ a club kind of goes through the fairway off the tee or it doesn't quite get enough far, so it's trying to find that perfect distance off the tee for some of these corners, and there's tricky roughs up this year a little bit, so if you miss the fairways, it's tough to get your club on the ball and get the distance right going into the greens.   The greens are a little firm, so it's playing tough. 

Q.   They're going to move the tee times up, a little rain in the forecast tomorrow.   How much do you think the rain might change this golf course?
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know.   It will soften it up a little bit, might make the greens more receptive.   It'll make it play a little longer than it's been playing.   But who knows what weather is going to do.   It's been saying 40 percent all week on my phone, so I don't know what it's going to do.   We'll just see.   It is what it is.
