 Q.  How would you describe what happened to you today, your play.  
JIMMY WALKER: I had three 3-putts today.  Two yesterday, one today.  I don't usually do that.  Just kind of struggled a little with the speed of the greens, some of the up hills, it was blowing 35 downwind, you know it was just kind of tough.   
But it played really tough, we got out there and all of a sudden dent wind started blowing again and we just finished into the wind.  It was tough.   
 Q.  You leave here with what?  What are the memories?  
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know, I mean I hit a good putt on last hole, I guess.   
(Laughter.)   
So, that's about it.  It's a bummer.  I wish we could have -- I don't know.  Nothing really to say.  Just didn't get it done.
