 Q.   It was a lot of fun to watch.   You started on the back nine, which has been the scoring nine out here, and you were 3‑under for your first four holes.   Did you get the sense something special was brewing in that short stretch?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, I was making good swings and I made some putts.   Anytime you start doing that, it starts to breed a little more confidence.   Last couple days I just couldn't get anything going, and then you go three out of the first four, and then you get those feelings, like yeah, we can keep doing this all day, but you can't get ahead of yourself.   You've got to stay in the moment, and the old clichÃ©, one at a time, but it's so true.  
   
 Q.   You didn't have the finish you wanted at the Frys, but you came to Las Vegas, and if anything Las Vegas is home to your swing coach, Butch Harmon.   How much confidence did he instill in you heading into this event?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, we just did a couple little swing things and tried to implement them a little bit this week on the range and a little bit on the golf course.   I didn't drive it as well as I would have liked to Thursday, and then yesterday it was better, but I ended up shooting the same score, and then today it all felt pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Fifth time you've shot a 62 in your career.   This one had to seem like one of the simplest ones.   It was pretty easy out there today.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, I think I hit a lot of greens and I had a lot of really good looks, and I remember there was a lot of putts that didn't go in, too, but I hit a lot of close shots and I made some really good putts.   It was fun.   Hit it good and putted good.  
   
 Q.   Last year you shot your last 62 at the Frys.com Open, and you shoot 62 here this week.   Any similarities possibly to another year starting off pretty solid?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know.   I mean, they've still got about nine more holes to go, so I don't know what's going to happen.   But you would expect some more birdies coming in.   I put myself in a great spot for tomorrow, and that's all I could come out today and ask for.  
   
 Q.   This M Life logo on your shirt, tell me a little bit about it.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, it's the MGM Resorts rewards program, and we just‑‑ it's a good partnership, and we just literally started it last week.   Looking forward to the year with them and hanging out, and so far they've been a great group to hang out with, did a little outing for them on Tuesday and Shadow Creek and just had a blast.   Good group of guys.  
   
 Q.   Was this round maybe a little bit affected by the stuff you worked with with Butch on Monday and Tuesday?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I think a little bit.   We worked on stuff and we talked about it, and it's a matter of me doing it.   But I do feel good.   I got the feeling of what we were trying to work on, and I could start to feel it.   I started driving it better, and hit some really good iron shots today, some close wedge shots, a couple tap‑ins, so that's always nice.   
   
 Q.   Was there one specific thing that kind of clicked?   All your stats just went through the roof today.   
JIMMY WALKER:   You know, just work at getting through the ball a little better.   It's as simple as that.   It's as hard as that, but it's as simple as that.   It's easy to say, hard to do kind of thing.   But felt good, and going to go hit a few balls after this and keep grinding.  
   
 Q.   Was it a matter of you guys actually changing stuff, trying to improve on something for the season or just correct little things?  
JIMMY WALKER:   It's mostly corrective.   There's long‑term stuff, goals down the line, that are hard for me to do just from years and years of doing it one way, and that's not a big deal, but it's about the process of continuing to try to make it easier, make it easier to repeat.   
   
 Q.   You said it's Monday and Wednesday you guys worked?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   At his place?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, went out to his place.   
   
 Q.   Was the weather a factor at all today in helping your round?   Did it soften up the greens a little bit?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, there was really no wind, and the greens were a lot than they were yesterday evening when we finished up.   Yesterday evening they were pretty firm, and they were baked out pretty good.   You could see all the foot traffic and the greens were starting to turn purple a little bit.   It was definitely more gettable in that sense from what I played yesterday afternoon.  
   
 Q.   How often do you come out here to work with Butch?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Probably anywhere between three, four, five, six times a year, somewhere in there.  
   
 Q.   Do you stop by here at all?  
JIMMY WALKER:   No, no, I just go out there to see him.  
   
 Q.   Do you get a good room with the logo?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I did okay this week, yeah.   
   
 Q.   This is a golf course that fits you, obviously.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I mean, I was talking to my buddy last night at dinner, I'm not the biggest fan of desert golf.   This has some holes to it where it's very deserty and some that look more like a regular golf course.   I play a golf course at home that's very demanding off the tee, and that always helps me when I come play golf courses that off the tee for me are a little more demanding.   You know, that always helps.  
The more I play here, the more I feel comfortable and enjoy it.   Looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What's different from last week to this week?   
JIMMY WALKER:   I mean, after Ryder Cup I didn't do anything the next week, and I mean, I went in‑‑ it was a very taxing week, and it was amazing and fun.   You know, I was just a little off.   It was a tough course.   It was tough greens and they put some tough pins, and it just kind of ran me over a little bit.   That was it.   I was hitting it okay, but it was nice to get in here and see Butch this week.  
   
 Q.   Just a little rusty?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, just mentally fatigued a little bit.   I mean, physically I feel fine, but I mean, Ryder Cup was a good, fun, taxing week.
