 Q.  It was a tough day for America, but you certainly proved yourself very well out there.  JIMMY WALKER: Thanks.  I played solid all day.  No bogeys, didn't give anything back. Lee played great.  We just had a really good match all day.  Proud of everybody, proud of our play, I look forward to next time.   Q.  You came out fighting, it looked like you guys were making some head way.  Some very positive red signs on the board?  JIMMY WALKER: You know, the board was lit up with red early.  I don't know what happened, but the back nine just got us a little bit.  It was nice to see the charge mount early.   Q.  Another win for Europe, they are a strong unit?  JIMMY WALKER: Yeah, they played great.  Need to figure out if there is some kind of formula they are doing or what.  I don't know.  They're all great players.  We saw see each other week in and week out and we beat each week in and week out.  It's one week. We look forward to the next time.   Q.  Ryder Cup is an incredible event.  There are winners and losers, but The Ryder Cup always seems to win?  JIMMY WALKER: I think so.  It think you can see that here.  So many people from so many different parts of the world that are here.  The amount of people that watch this event on TV.  This is a global event.  It's special to be a part of.  I think it's going strong.
