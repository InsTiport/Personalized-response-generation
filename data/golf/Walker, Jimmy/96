 Q.   First off, 2‑under today, started off 3‑under on the back nine.   Can you just talk about your day?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I hit it pretty good on the front.   Drove it in the fairways on the back nine.   Didn't drive it in as many fairways.   Just didn't get any looks at birdie.   Made a couple of bogeys. Hit a bad chip but other than that, played pretty solid today.   Made some good putts.   Have to drive it better tomorrow for sure.  
   
 Q.   That's been the theme from everybody that's been out so far is the importance of driving it in the fairways.   
JIMMY WALKER:   It helps, because the pins are tucked.   I think they did a really good job of making every pin today‑‑ it was pretty tucked.   There aren't any gimmie greens today, so I think you had to hit quality shots if you wanted to look at birdie.   So that was the golf course's defense today with not much wind.   
   
 Q.   Has to be good starting off another major championship under par.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I was looking forward to a good start, and stay in contention and have a chance to win.   That's why I'm here and I've been close a couple of times this year it felt like.   So I'm excited for the rest of the week.   
   
 Q.   And you're up there, in The Ryder Cup standings, with that looming, does that play any extra part?   
JIMMY WALKER:   I think I'm on the team is what it sounded like.   So kind of put that on the back burner now and just got a lot to play for here coming up at the end of the year, especially with this tournament and the FedExCup.   Go over to Scotland and kick some butt.
