  JOHN BUSH:   All right, Jimmy.   4‑under par.   Great start to the tournament.   Just get some comments on your round.  
JIMMY WALKER:   I hit it really good today.   I felt like I was keeping it right out in front of me.   Came up with some good iron shots.   Made a few putts; would've liked to have made a few more.  
Just wasn't really in trouble all day.   I kept the ball in front of me, and this is the kind of golf course you want to do that.   I thought there was some possibility for some good scores.   
The had some pins kind of sitting where they were easy to get at them.   
So, yeah, good day for me.  
JOHN BUSH:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   You were talking earlier that the course today was pretty hard and the greens fast.   Can you comment about that?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Well, the greens are still pretty soft.   You can attack any flag you want.   The greens are very fast.   I'm talking fast, fast.   I had a putt down the par‑5 on the front right in the middle of the green.   I felt like I moved it three feet and it rolled 25 feet.   Very quick and you have to be careful.  
I felt like it was decently gettable.   There are some really good holes.   But for the most part, you're down there with lot of wedges.   I thought the scores would be pretty good today.
