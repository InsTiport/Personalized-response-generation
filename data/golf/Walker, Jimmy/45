 Q.  Obviously not nice to finish the way you did, but you positioned yourself exactly where you need to be heading into the final round.  Tell us about your day.  
JIMMY WALKER: It was just kind of slow.  I birdied the first but then it was just kind of -- didn't hit very many good shots.  A couple of good putts here and there, but just tried to stay real patient.  Just felt like the pins were pretty tough today, I thought, and made a couple of birdies coming in there on 15 and 16, which was nice.  That kind of felt like it was making the round a lot -- was heading the right direction.  It felt like I was hanging around all day.   
 Q.  I saw you on 18 back away a couple times on the shot, on the approach.  You weren't quite comfortable?  
JIMMY WALKER: No, it was just the light.  It's just kind of hard to see in there, and I was really trying to get focused on a line, trying to land it just right of the flag to get it close, and that's where you have to land it to hit it close.  115, and I was taking dead aim at it.   
 Q.  This event is typically a birdie-fest.  20 plus usually wins it.  It's not that this year.  Why is that?  
JIMMY WALKER: I think that the pins are a lot more difficult than they normally are, a lot of tough pins.  It's like they don't want us to make birdies.  A lot of holes par is pretty good here.   
 Q.  Given the bunched nature of the leaderboard and given your experience, do you feel like you're the man to beat?  
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know.  I'm not in the lead.  There's a guy that's two shots ahead.  We've got to go out and catch him.  That's how I'm looking at it.  I've just got to go out and put a good round together, don't make any bogeys, hit good shots, make putts, and we'll be right there at the end of the day.
