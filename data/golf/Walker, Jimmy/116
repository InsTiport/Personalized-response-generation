 Q.   Four back, are you in the middle of it or is it an uphill battle for tomorrow?  
JIMMY WALKER:   If you're in the last couple groups, I always feel like you've got a shot at playing well and you have a chance and a lot of it depends on what everybody else does, but you can certainly go out and play really well on Sunday and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Does it matter that the course seems to lend itself to some better scoring than normal this week so far because of the dry conditions and little rough?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, I thought the greens would be a little firmer today than they were.  
Actually I thought they were pretty receptive but I think it's fun, because you have to go out and make birdies and it's there for the taking, if you go out and hit good shots, you're rewarded, so you still have to be precise on hitting it into some of these pins, shaping the shots into some of these pins, and the rough‑‑ the rough is not really there, it is in certain spots, so you've got to just‑‑ you know where the bad spots are on the golf course, some of them are not quite as severe, but there's still some spots where you can get in there, a little bit of trouble but for the most part it's playing fast and it's fun, a lot of birdies.   
   
 Q.   Does the momentum carry into your mind from last week or are we now already‑‑ last week is last week?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I feel good.   I feel like I'm playing good and I feel like that kind of carries over.   
   
 Q.   Did you change hotels?   
JIMMY WALKER:   No.   I have my bus.   
   
 Q.   Do you sleep on the bus, too?   
JIMMY WALKER:   It's got a full‑size refrigerator, washer dryer‑‑ we don't have full‑hookup this week, so we can't‑‑ we don't have enough sewers, so we can't dump all the time, so we are kind of rationing the water consumption.
