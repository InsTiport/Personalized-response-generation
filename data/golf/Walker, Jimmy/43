Q. Your thoughts quickly looking back at how you kicked off 2016.
JIMMY WALKER: I hit it really well.  Wedge game was really good this week.  I think most of my birdies came from kind of inside of six feet.
Longest putts I made all week were last two holes today.  So I just didn't really make many putts this week but made a lot of really good, close putts and some really solid iron shots.
Q. How excited are you to go back to the place that you have won two straight years, especially last year in dominating fashion?
JIMMY WALKER: Oh, it's cool.  I'm excited to go.  I've never experienced anything like I'll experience next week, winning two in a row and try to make it three.  So, it will be cool.  I've got a lot of good memories coming from there.  We're excited to get over there.  We're going to get over there tomorrow evening and kind of take our time getting back over there.
Q. What is it about that place, a very different golf course than what you see here, how have you quickly been able to make that transition the last few years?
JIMMY WALKER: I don't know.  It's just been a matter of solid putting there and just quality iron play.  I know I've driven it well there the last couple years, which I know it's a tough place to drive the golf ball, because it's so narrow and firm.  So I managed to get it in the fairways and hit quality shots and probably played the par-5s pretty well.  There's only two of them but it's big and you need to play them well.  So I think those are some of the keys, real good putting, too.
