 Q.   Jimmy, well played out there today, 3‑under par, 69. Only one bogey out there.   How much different did the golf course play today because of the weather?   
    JIMMY WALKER:   It was amazing how different it played from Wednesday.   I played the Pro‑Am here on Wednesday on the South, and you could hardly stop a ball, and, today, it didn't matter if you hit a 3‑iron in there with height, it would just stop immediately.   You could spin wedges.   So it was a lot different, and it played a lot longer too.  
   
 Q.   What were the keys to your rounds the last two days?   
    JIMMY WALKER:   Just keeping it right there in front.   Not getting in any trouble, really.   Made some good up‑and‑downs, making a few putts, and just playing solid.   Haven't really giving anything away, and I've been driving it pretty good, so it's been solid.  
   
 Q.   You've dealt with injuries over the years.   I know you've been healthy for a few years.   How has it been, and how has your transition and progression been going?   
    JIMMY WALKER:   It's been good.   I started working with Butch Harmon last year kind of toward the middle, end of the year, and really enjoyed the work that he and I have been doing.   So that's been nice.   I had a nice off‑season.   I feel rested, and I was ready to come out and play this year.  
   
 Q.   You're three shots back.   What are your expectations for the weekend?   
    JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know, you know.   We'll just see what the weather does.   I don't know if it's going to keep raining or what it's going to.   Do but all you can do is, the old cliche, fairways and greens and all that stuff.   
    I'm looking forward to a good weekend.   I've been playing well, and expect good stuff.
