 Q.   A great start to the season so far.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Thanks.   I had a rough first round and really fought back the whole rest of the week, so it was good.   It was all right there the first day, just a couple of bad swings led to some unfortunate doubles.   But putted good this week, had a bunch of good iron shots, so it was good.   I drove it good.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the position you've kind of put yourself in now just three events into this new kind of fall start to the year.   Seems to be setting up the rest of the year pretty well for you.   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, you know, winning the first tournament of the year is nice and then to follow it up with two more good ones is fun.   Hopefully we get our visa and get into China tomorrow.   So I'm looking forward to that.   Hopefully it goes through, and then that'll be it, I think.  
   
 Q.   You're going to take a little break and have some turkey and open some Christmas comments?  
JIMMY WALKER:   I think so.   We're going to be opening Christmas presents and getting on a plane to Maui.   I'm looking forward to a lot of cool stuff coming up, so I'm excited.
