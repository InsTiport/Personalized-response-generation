 Q.  You had it going and when you get this course, you had it 4-under at the turn, looking like maybe we could do something.  Back nine was a little bit of a struggle?  
JIMMY WALKER: Just didn't drive it as well as I would have liked to today.  I have been driving it really, really well.  I did so even at home last week.   
I felt like Hawaii was a nice two weeks for me getting back out after the break.  Just didn't quite drive it as well as I wanted to and it's tough out of the rough here.  So love to drive it a little better tomorrow and it will be a lot more fun.   
 Q.  When is the last time you've seen rough like this.  They're saying it might be a little tougher than the first cut of the U.S. Open in 2008.  But it's pretty heavy.  
JIMMY WALKER: It is in spots.  It seems like they may have cut it down a little bit after the last couple days, when I played it last.  But it's there, it's tough, and you got to get in there and gouge it out.  Luckily I had some pretty decent lies out of it today, just got to get rid of the wayward tee ball tomorrow.   
 Q.  That's the thing on the course tomorrow, because the scoring really wasn't that low and the guys are all saying the rough is really tough over there on the North Course?  
JIMMY WALKER: It is, I've I played it.  It's maybe a little spotty year over there, but for the most part it's there and you want to avoid it at all costs.  Greens seem smaller on North Course and you want to be able to control the golf ball, you really do.  High and soft is nice.
