 Q.  Hard-fought match....it looked like it just came down to whoever made the last putt...  
RICKIE FOWLER: Or whoever made a putt, period.  None of us were really doing much today on the greens.  All four of us had opportunities all day and no one really made anything.  We had a few good looks at birdie that could have made the difference but we really never got anything to fall or any momentum going at all.   
 Q.  The type of match that just seems like it's going to come down to 18 no matter what?  
JIMMY WALKER: We didn't want it to.  We were trying to keep that from happening.   
RICKIE FOWLER: It was a grind.   
 Q.  Did it feel like everything was working except on the greens?  
JIMMY WALKER: We were 2 up pretty quickly but just didn't make any birdies after the 7th hole and that's not going to get it done.  I left Rickie out to dry a few times and we just never got any momentum going on the back nine.   
 Q.  With how hard you were both grinding so hard through the entire match, did you have any chance to see how the tide was turning for each team?  A lot of red in the beginning and then the Internationals started to turn it around.  
RICKIE FOWLER: I didn't.  Not really.  I don't know about Jimmy, but I was just trying to focus on what I was doing and keep us in the match.
