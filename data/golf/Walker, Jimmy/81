 Q.   Nice to open the calendar year bogey‑free and 6‑under par?   
JIMMY WALKER:   Yes, it is.   I was on the driving range saying to Andy, I was kind of nervous today.   He's like, good, you should be.   It's always good getting back and never knowing what you're going to get but prepared and all that stuff, so I thought I played good.  
   
 Q.   Not going to say it's pressure, but goals have to be reevaluated from what they were not just last year, but a couple years ago.   You had so much success just a year ago and certainly you're looked on in a different light by the media and by your peers?  
JIMMY WALKER:   Yeah, you can hear it when I get asked questions and I get asked a lot of different questions now.   It's all good.   This is what I'm out here to do is to play and to play well, and put in the hard work, it's nice to see it payoff.   I do have different goals‑‑ not different but just continuation of what I did.   
Last year was hitting in my goals and competing in majors and winning tournaments, and that's what I want to do again, is keep winning tournaments and competing in Majors.   
   
 Q.   You've been here two years in a row.   Do you notice more grain in the greens?   
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't think so.   I think it's about the same as last year.   I know they said they had 25 more inches of rain this year than they did last year at this point, so it makes a big impact on the golf course.   You can feel it on the golf course and on the greens.   The fairways are a lot softer than they have been.   It's nice to have that normal wind here today where you can knock it down on 18.   I've never hit 5‑iron into 18 before.   It was the right wind again today.   
   
 Q.   5‑iron, you're big and strong?  
JIMMY WALKER:   That's what the stats look like I guess.
