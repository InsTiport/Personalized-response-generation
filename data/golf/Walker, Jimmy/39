JIMMY WALKER: It played really tough into the wind even downwind, it played very tough.  When you're downwind you had to get it in the air, but couldn't hit it too high or too hard or go too far.  Into the wind was brutal.   
I know they moved some of the tees up, but some of them they kept back pretty far and it just played really long.  I don't remember hitting 3-iron into par-4s too often that are under 440 yards.  But that happened a couple times today.  I had to hit a 5-wood in once.  It was tough.   
It was tough to putt on the greens and when it's blowing 30 miles an hour, I think, that's why you see guys making lots of bogeys.  A lot of par putts today for a lot of guys.  And so just played really tough, and we'll go back out tomorrow and get after it.
