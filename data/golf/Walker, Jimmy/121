Q.   Considering the suspension, the wind, the rain, the cold, how good was that 4‑under round here at Monterey?
JIMMY WALKER:   It felt good.   It was‑‑ it played really tough.   When you made the turn on 9 coming back and playing about five or six in a row in the wind, it was really stout. 
We had 5‑wood 190 yards on 9.   4‑iron 160 yards on 11, the downhill par‑4, it played really tough.   And we were all just kind of laughing at some of the shots that we were hitting and the numbers we were hitting, but it played tough, made some good putts, some good saves, good birdies.

Q.   You got it in too.   So, you're going to get to sleep late tomorrow.   Some players are going to have to go out and play.   How important is that?
JIMMY WALKER:   It's important for me because we have got two little kids and they go to bed at 8 and they get up early, so that's good.

Q.   Finally, you head into Sunday with a significant lead.   With that said, how aggressive do you play, how not aggressive?
JIMMY WALKER:   I don't know.   I think a lot depends on the weather and what it does.
I have no‑‑ I mean I have never had whatever big lead this is going into the last round, but just go out and hit good shots and play good golf and see what happens.
