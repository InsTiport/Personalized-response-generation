 Q.  You were down one early.  There was nothing much happening.  What happened those last five?  
JIMMY WALKER: The day just kind of kept building.  I was really nervous starting out, hit some pretty squirrelly shots.  Zach kept us going.  We both got into a rhythm I think is what happened.  We started reading putts, started seeing it and we started pouring them in.   
 Q.  You have been through this before.  What were you thinking when you were behind and nothing was happening?  Was there something said between you that got it turned around for you?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Jimmy and I are good friends.  I don't care where he hits it.  He doesn't care where I hit it.  For us it's all about team.  Execution becomes easy.  There's freedom involved when you don't care where your partner hits it.  We read greens similar.  That was a big thing once you get one to go.   
His par putt on 9, quite frankly, I know we didn't win any holes until about the 12, but his par putt on 9 was the catapult.  That kind of kept us doing.  That's what a team does.  Again, the outcome of the shot is irrelevant.  We're going to keep fighting.   
 Q.  Phil and Rickie just won their match.  That's a sweep of foursomes for you guys on Friday morning.  That's remarkable.  
ZACH JOHNSON: A lot of talent, a lot of talent on both teams.  A lot of golf left..
