 Q.  Obviously ran into a guy who has been there and done that before.  
BRADY EXBER: You know what? I hit a brick wall today, didn't I? You know, we both played well; I don't think it was our best games.   
But the eagle he had on 14 was critical.   
 Q.  Uh-huh.  
BRADY EXBER: Because he lost the hole prior, and then making eagle there. Then of course, I mean, I made a really nice par putt on 16 after kind of hitting a very poor bunker shot. So great par putt on 16 for me; 25 feet probably.   
And then to stay even, and then he just made that great birdie on 17; hit a great shot. Almost made a hole in one on 7. That was only 208. Left it about few inches.   
He's a great champion.   
 Q.  A great week for you. Obviously you get to the quarters and now you're back for next year so you don't have to qualify. Thoughts on your week? I know you said you had low expectations. Now you got something to work towards for next year.  
BRADY EXBER: Yeah, you know, it's always great to not have to qualify. Qualifying is the hardest thing. It's harder sometimes than playing in the tournament.   
So I'm thrilled to be back in next year. Obviously now, you know, I wish I could have done a little better today, but --   
 Q.  Pretty memorable week. Knocked off a couple big-time heavyweights yesterday.  
BRADY EXBER: I did. I mean, I can play pretty good sometimes. Next year, with a little preparation, who knows?
