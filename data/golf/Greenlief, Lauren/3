 Q.  Obviously a great start for your round, coming off a quarterfinal appearance from last year.  You made 11 straight pars out there.  Just talk about shooting even par on a golf course that's proven pretty difficult.  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: Yeah, it's a challenging golf course.  It's set up pretty long, especially with it being a little bit wetter this morning with all the rain yesterday.  I hit the ball really solid today.  Couldn't get the putts to drop, but overall happy.   
 Q.  As a veteran of USGA championships, you know the goal is just to get into match play Wednesday.  72 is obviously a good start.  Do you have a game plan for tomorrow?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I think I'll just take it one hole at a time.  These things are a marathon and they're challenging, so you really have to stay in the moment, just try and do the best that you can on each hole, so I'm going to go get some rest this afternoon since it's so hot, stay inside, drink a lot.   
 Q.  You played with the third youngest player today ever to play in the championship.  Give us your thoughts on playing with Gianna and your thoughts on her game.  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: It was a lot of fun.  Gianna has a great game for an 11-year-old.  It made me feel really old being 17 years older than her.  But she really held it together, was very focused, very (indiscernible).   
 Q.  I don't know if you played golf at 11, but your thoughts of an 11 year old being out here, number one, and number two, shooting a pretty solid score for her first-ever USGA championship?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: Yeah, it's a lot of golf course out here and a pretty long setup.  At 11 I was playing a ton of different sports.  I was out on the golf course, but I certainly wasn't qualifying or a contender for a USGA championship.
