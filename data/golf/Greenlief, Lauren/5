 Q.  It's a long day.  How are you able to kind of keep your focus?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: Just leverage my match play experience, having gone through this in the Mid Am going all the way.  I think having played a lot of match play tournaments in the past really helps kind of keeps you focused.   
 Q.  You're the first Mid Am to make it this far in over ten years.  What do you think it was about this week and this course that was able to get you there?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I've been playing really well coming into the event.  Won the Virginia Am for the second straight year in a row.   
Just wanted to carry the momentum through, and I've been striking the ball really beautifully.   
 Q.  How does this course fit your game?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I really like it.  I mean, it has soft greens.  It's a ball-striker's golf course.  You can kind of fire right at it and be aggressive.  I think each day I've tried to get a little bit better.
