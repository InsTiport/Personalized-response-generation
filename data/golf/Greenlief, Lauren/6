 Q.  This is the first time in match play for you?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: First time in six tries.   
 Q.  Wow, about time, eh?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I've been close.   
 Q.  What do you think has been the difference this week?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I've had a really good month of golf and I've done really good preparation, had a lot of momentum coming in here, and just felt like striking it well and making some putts.   
 Q.  You made an eagle out there today?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: Had a little chip-in eagle on the par-5, so that was nice.   
 Q.  Which hole was that?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: It was the fifth hole.  I was only five yards off the green to a front pin.  It was pretty straightforward but went right in.   
 Q.  How do you feel going into match play?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: It's just a tournament reset.  It really starts again tomorrow.  I think match play is a place where I can really leverage my experience, having been there before and having gone through it.   
 Q.  Carrying a banner for the mid ams.  Ellen is going to make it.  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: Awesome, that's cool.   
 Q.  And you, and that looks like it might be it.  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: At least we have some, though.  Last year we didn't have any.  I think we both missed by one.   
 Q.  Do you guys play with like a little chip on your shoulder given there's so many teenagers here?  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: I think we just play.  We want to represent the mid ams well and prove that after college you can still play golf.  There are a bunch of really solid mid am players that we see at these tournaments.  It's really awesome to see this many of them out here this week.   
 Q.  With you playing so well, now you've got a good feel for the golf course and get some momentum going --  
LAUREN GREENLIEF: It's kind of a ball striker's golf course.  The greens are soft and you can fire at the pins, and I feel really comfortable, so just trying to get a little bit better every day.
