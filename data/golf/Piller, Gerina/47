Q. Could you just sum up your day?
GERINA PILLER: I got off to a good start.  I birdied the first three and made a kind of oops, double bogey on the next hole.  The course is in such good shape, the greens are phenomenal, so I think that's one of the reasons why the scores are so low.
But just kind of -- I was kind of kicking myself because obviously I went into the par-5, I think it's 14, I was 1-under and I didn't birdie that hole, and so it's kind of like you're giving back strokes if you don't birdie the hole.  So I was able to birdie 17 and made a good par on 18 and then made the turn.  And I knew I was playing well, and so just kind of give yourself opportunities, as clichÃ© as that sounds.  But I had a couple of tap-in birdies, and I made a really great save for par on the par-3, 4.  So that also kind of kick started it, just giving you a little extra confidence in your putting.  And also made a really great par on 8.  So it's just one of those days where you have good clubs in your hands and it makes it a lot easier when you're sitting in the fairway.
Q. When there are so many birdies being made, I didn't even count how many you guys made as a group, but does it just kind of fuel all of you?
GERINA PILLER: I mean you kind of get in a rhythm, and you know, this is kind of like golfing in a bubble.  I mean it's perfect weather, great golf course, perfect conditions.  So that also helps.  Obviously Sei Young making lots of birdies, Anna, myself.  You can definitely get in a rhythm out there and just kind of feed off each other.
