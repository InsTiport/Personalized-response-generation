Q. Thanks for coming.  Great score in the afternoon with the wind, minus 1.  Tell us what you did well today.
GERINA PILLER: I think I just kind of kept it in front of me.  You know, a lot of these greens, a lot of these pins, you can't -- you know, if you don't have a good club, you've kind of got to err on the short side.  Front of the green is going to kill you.  I felt like I did that.  I felt like I kind of kept it in front of me.  A few putts rolled in, so that's nice.
The wind was tough out there.  If you can just get it on the green and make some putts, it definitely goes a long way.
Q. Was the wind disconcerting at all?  Did you have to do some extra calculation, or you just kind of said, okay, I got to figure this out?
Q. It was a little tricky.  I think it's more tricky when you're in between clubs.  I think we had a lot of good clubs today, so that makes it a lot easier to choose clubs when you know one's too long and one's perfect.
You know, it definitely did not play anything like the practice rounds.  11, I hit 7 wood into it, and the practice round, I hit 6 iron.  16, I hit 7 wood into it, and today I hit wedge.  Definitely didn't play anything like our preparation, but the game feels good.  Like any other U.S. Open, you just got to kind of keep it in front of you.
Q. With an afternoon round today and a morning round tomorrow, that's probably a good slate for you because maybe the wind will be down, you'll have better greens, et cetera, for scoring.
GERINA PILLER: Hopefully.  I don't know how the wind was this morning.  We're staying kind of by the beach, and it was whipping over there.  I feel like tomorrow, hopefully, we get a little softer course.  That will be nice.  And we're not trying to hit short of the green and run it up.  So looking forward to tomorrow.
