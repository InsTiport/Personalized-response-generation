Q. That was a bomb on the last hole.  Hot start, hot finish.  Can you talk about your round today?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, you know, I just -- I don't really -- my ball-striking does not feel good right now.  And so I think that just kind of lowered the expectation.  And just knew that I was going to probably hit some squirrelly shots, but if I can kind of keep it in front of me and if I'm out of position, and get back in position, I'm putting great, so I know if I can just get around the hole I have a chance to make par or birdie or save some shots there.
Q. How tough was it today out there?
GERINA PILLER: It's pretty tough.  The golf course is tough, itself.  And with it being a little cooler today than it was at the beginning of the week, the ball is not flying as far.  And with the rain it's definitely not making it easy at all.
Q. You had a lot of winds going back and forth, how do you keep an even keel as you're battling it through?
GERINA PILLER: It sounds clichÃ© to say you have to take one hole at a time.  Especially out here, there's no relaxing.  There's a par 5 coming up, I can get one back here -- for heaven's sake, it has a tree in the middle of the fairway.  There's definitely not a time that you can relax.  And I think out here par is a good score.  And I feel like just kind of keep it in front of me.  If there is a chance where I get a scoring club in my hand, I really have to take advantage of it.
Q. On 18 before you had that putt, that was a really difficult shot you had from the rough, that was not easy, correct?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, I was joking with my caddie, I told him that was the mayor's office.  And he kind of laughed at me.  But I had 200 yards to the pin and just choked down on a 5-wood and tried to run it up there.  It's definitely taking some creativity out here and a lot of trust in your golf course.
Q. What was the putt, about 40 feet do you think?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, it was probably about 40 feet.
