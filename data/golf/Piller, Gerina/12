 Q.  Just what are your thoughts on today's match?  
GERINA PILLER: I felt like we played good.  Same as yesterday.  Our putts just didn't fall today like we would like them to.   
So hats off to the Europeans.  They played really well.  I don't think they missed a putt all day.  It's hard to compete with that.  It's just the name of the game.   
I know that they're really good golfers and we're really good golfers.  So it's just a matter of who makes the putts.   
 Q.  So what were your thoughts on the match today?  
STACY LEWIS: Anna and Charley [sic] played great.  They didn't give us anything.  They didn't make a bogey all day.  And we just had a lot of putts on the edge.  (Indiscernible) hit a lot of good shots.  Just couldn't convert the putts.   
 Q.  Could you talk about Georgia and her putts down the stretch of the match?  
STACY LEWIS: I played with her yesterday and she was making the putts yesterday, so it wasn't really a surprise to see Georgia making putts.  But it is what it is.  Great players rise up when they need to and that's what she did.
