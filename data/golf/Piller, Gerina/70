Q.   Thoughts on your round?
GERINA PILLER:   Overall it was great.   Just really stayed patient today.   I was really focused on hitting fairways and hitting greens and hit a few close today and made a few putts.   But overall I'm very happy with the way I played.

Q.   Would you have thought this is where you would be standing on the leaderboard after 36?
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah.   That's our goal; right? 

Q.   True. 
GERINA PILLER:   But at the beginning of the week I didn't feel like I was hitting the ball like I should, and just called my coach, talked to him and just kind of took a deep breath and just reminded myself it's still grass and still a little ball and just went out there and tried to stick to my game and it's easy to get caught up in the scoreboards, but you just gotta play your own game.   That's going to be bogeys that are going to be made, but also you have to give yourself chances for birdie, and there's some pin placements that you have to be pretty conservative with but there are also some that you have to be aggressive with and take advantage of those.

Q.   Conditions (inaudible). 
GERINA PILLER:   Yes and no.   Actually the fairways are starting to firm up.   Everything is starting to firm up and getting a little faster.   So obviously it is cooler now, but I just ‑‑ it's just definitely different from yesterday. 
I noticed with a couple of wedge shots that I hit, it didn't dig as much in the ground, and it kind of bounced.   The course is definitely drying out and getting a little faster.
