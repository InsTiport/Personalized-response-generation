 Q.   Couldn't quite escape that group that everybody is at 4‑under?  
GERINA PILLER:   Yep.  
   
 Q.   What was today like for you?   Obviously a really good round.   
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, it was just kind of solid, hitting greens, hitting fairways.   I think I missed‑‑ well, if you don't count 17, I missed one green, so didn't really have to chip, so that's always good.   Chipping out here is a little difficult just because it's kind of tight and wet, so hitting greens is definitely an advantage.   
   
 Q.   Considering the circumstances of this tournament being here, how excited are you that you came out on Thursday and played well?  
GERINA PILLER:   I'm super excited.   You know, just any tournament, but it's really special being in Texas and sleeping in my own bed and having all my family and friends.   It's always good, and you have that extra pressure to play well because you want to do well for your family and friends, so I'm very pleased.  
   
 Q.   There was more pressure do you think?  
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, I think so.   I mean, because I kind of put this pressure on myself, they drove all this way to come watch me and they're supporting me and they want me to do good, and of course I want to do good for them, so definitely extra pressure.  
   
 Q.   A lot of rain lately, and obviously there's mud and it's wet.   Is it drying out at all?  
GERINA PILLER:   No, it's drying out.   The course is in phenomenal condition.   The greens are the best I've ever seen them.   This course has never been this green when we've played, so hats off to them, they're doing a great job.   You have a few spots in the fairway that are just collection areas, but most of all, I think the course is awesome.  
   
 Q.   Are you living in Plano?  
GERINA PILLER:   Fort Worth.  
   
 Q.   What changes have you made in your game and what have you been working on recently?  
GERINA PILLER:   I've been working hard on my putting.   My short game, that's just‑‑ I feel like that's kind of been my crutch lately.   I learned a new shot.   There's a guy that used to play on Tour, Jeff Brehaut, and he coaches Juli, as well, so I've been playing practice rounds with Juli, and he just kind of gave me a little tip here and there, and just been picking his brain and working hard on that chipping.   You know how it is with putting, you get that rock rolling, and that's kind of where it all starts.
