Q. So you had the lead straight from the beginning and then kind of pulled away at the end.  It was like 1-up, 2-up the whole way.  What changed for you at the very end and how were you able to close it out?
GERINA PILLER: I think Yani is a great player, and she got off to a rough start.  I just kept myself -- I just couldn't let myself get comfortable in that spot of being 1-up.  Kind of just realizing, she's a great player, and she's a prior No. 1 in the world.  You can't overlook that.  She's got the game.  She's got the length.  You know, she fought hard, and I just feel like I just kind of dug deep towards the end and kind of had the mentality of taking no prisoners.
Q. Is that a pretty good feeling having Stacy Lewis walk up?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, it's been a blast getting to play with her again, Solheim and now, and I think she's just a great player and a great teammate, and I'm looking forward to do more.
Q. Did you enjoy playing by yourself today after team play?
GERINA PILLER: You know, it's kind of one of those things, like I grew up playing team sports, so I love having a teammate.  It's kind of like a cushion, you know, I feel like if I don't come through, I know that she's going to have my back.  You know, at first it is kind of like, oh, man, where's my buddy, but then you tee off and you've just got to remember what's at hand, and I've been playing great golf, and I've just got to go out there and be me.
