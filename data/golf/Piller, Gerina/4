Q. Gerina, such a great round here on a Sunday at the U.S. Women's Open.  You had it going there.  When did you realize you were in contention?
GERINA PILLER: I think with any tournament, when the cameras start showing up, you start noticing you may be close.  I just kind of tried to tell myself my golf ball doesn't know where I'm at and kind of really relied on Solheim Cup and that experience, just because I've been on maternity leave all last year.
Trying to get the feeling back.  And just how I handle pressure, it's kind of a learning experience, but I just kept my head down and kept making putts and just played smart.
Q. Not only trying to get the feel back, but also doing that with some really tough conditions there on the back side.  You dropped a couple of shots coming home.  What are the leaders going to be facing this afternoon when they face that stretch?
GERINA PILLER: Those pin placements, you have to be -- if you don't have a good number, you definitely have to be careful on where you want to miss.  I three-putted No. 13, and that's just a hole, you know, you only have wedge in your hand, but you can't be too aggressive because you don't want to be long, and you don't really want to have a long putt there.
I didn't have a long putt, but they have some undulations in the greens.  And you get a little speedy in your putts, and they can get away from you.
Q. Gerina, great round.
GERINA PILLER: Thank you.
