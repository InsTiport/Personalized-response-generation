Q. It's an uncertain situation, what's going through your mind right now trying to grasp where you are in the Olympic situation?
GERINA PILLER: Well, I'm just glad to be finished.  That was a very tiring week.  Like I said at the beginning of the week, I just wanted to play some good golf.  And I feel like my game is headed in the right direction.  And I've already posted, I did my score.  It's kind of all up to the people that are still out there.  So, you know, it's kind of out of my control.  But just hope for the best and we'll just sit and wait.
Q. Were you thinking about it at all?
GERINA PILLER: No, not really.  You don't really have time to think of anything else but the golf course and which way the wind is blowing.  So it definitely kept my mind occupied with that.  And there's not one shot out there that you cannot be lackadaisical about, even putting.  And the pace of play was -- you just kind of hit and go, hit and go.  So there's not a whole lot of time to sit out there and think about what you're even having for lunch.  I'm hungry.
Q. What do you take out of this, another top-10 finish in a major?  What do you leave with?
GERINA PILLER: You know, a lot of -- again, a lot of confidence.  I've taken away a lot of just positives from this week knowing that I can compete out here and I do belong and hopefully -- I don't want to ever get to where I'm trying to force a win or push too hard.
Golf is one of those sports, it's a game of opposites.  You try harder and it just kicks you in the butt.  The more I can just, as clichÃ© as it sounds, just stay patient, it will come.  I think it will come when I think I'm least expecting it.  Just because I want to win, that doesn't mean that that's going to happen.  I'm going to work hard on my game and I'm just looking forward to the International Crown and playing with our Americans.
Q. Projections are complicated because it depends on what other people do.  I think there were people that thought you made it when you were coming off.  Were you hearing people say congratulations?
GERINA PILLER: You know, no, I didn't.  I actually didn't even know how close -- I just know I saw my name on the leaderboard.  And I figured I had to be kind of in the top-10, and I think I was told top 17 finish.  But obviously that depends on everyone else.  So it's just one of those things, it's just a waiting game.  I said from the beginning, people asked me if I was going to go.  And we'll cross that bridge when I get there.  We've got to wait until -- I've got to qualify first.
Q. What is the wait going to be like for you, the wait to see how the numbers finish?
GERINA PILLER: You know, to be honest, coming into this year, I didn't even think I had a shot at the Olympics.  One of my goals was to make the International Crown.  So to be in the situation, I think, is a success in itself.  Even to be considered and being that close to being in the Olympics, I think is pretty special.
Q. Do you know how the news of whether you're fully on the team will be communicated to you?
GERINA PILLER: I do not know.  I'm sure the LPGA will contact me at some point.  They said a couple of hours after the play, they'll have the Rolex Rankings figured out.
