Q. Looked look you kind of had the tale of two nines today.  Was that the case?  What was going well for you maybe?
GERINA PILLER: Well, I didn't start out very well.  I made a great par on 1 and 3-putted 2, but I chipped in on 3, so that was kind of nice.
I think I made another bogey somewhere else.  I can't remember where it was.
But I felt like I just really hung in there and gave myself chances and got it up and down when I needed to.  The course is firming up, and 18, I don't know how anyone is going to get close.  I don't even know if there will be a birdie all day, unless, I don't know, maybe they try to skip it through the water.
The conditions definitely have gotten tougher this afternoon.
Q. This looks like another top 10, maybe Top 5.  Does this give you momentum for the rest of the season and the last major?
GERINA PILLER: For sure.  Feel like I played well at Solheim, and last week took the week off just trying to recover.  Felt a little tired this week, so just trying to build on the momentum of this week.  I think Friday I was maybe outside the cut line, made it back inside the cut line, and ended up making the cut at 3-under and just kind of clawed my way back up the top.
Definitely had the momentum, and hopefully it'll carry over the next two weeks.
