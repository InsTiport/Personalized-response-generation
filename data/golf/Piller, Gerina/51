 Q. You have to be pretty happy with the way you've been playing this week. Are you?   
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, I am. I've had success here before. Last year I didn't play very well. To come out this year with the start that I had, I'm super excited with where my game is at. Just really excited for tomorrow.  
   
 Q. What are the keys to success on this course in particular? Other than the 18, you've been bogey free?  
GERINA PILLER: I would say just hitting greens and fairways. The greens are pretty tricky just because there's a lot of grain in them. You have to be pretty confident and aggressive with your putting and that was what I did today and it definitely rewarded me.  
   
 Q. Kerr is leading this. What it's going to take to beat Kerr on Sunday?  
GERINA PILLER: If she starts walking them in, I don't know if I can beat that. Just the kind of thing there's other girls behind us and in front of me. You can't really worry about that. You just got to worry about yourself and if I go out there and I stay confident and be aggressive, I think that hopefully there will be a good outcome.  
   
 Q. (Inaudible)?  
GERINA PILLER: Well, it would mean a lot just to get the win. It would mean even more so we don't have to answer this question anymore. I've had a good year, switched caddies, switched clubs, so I think it would be very special.  
   
 Q. What's changed for you since that putt at the Solheim Cup?   
GERINA PILLER: I would say just my confidence. For a while I would hear a lot, only if she could get her putting going. I think that was a huge stepping stone for me to show people that I am a great putter and I think so. I think that was probably some of it.  
   
 Q. Now you are a clutch putter.   
GERINA PILLER: Thank you.
