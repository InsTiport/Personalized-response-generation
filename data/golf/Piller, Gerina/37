Q. Talk about your round.  What happened today?
GERINA PILLER: Just didn't get it in the hole quick enough.  It's not an easy golf course.  And you have to execute.  And I don't think I did a good job of that today.  But I took a lot of positives away from it.  So just looking forward to the next event.
