Q.   How important was the last two birdies?   Obviously that put you in an incredibly good place going into tomorrow, four back of Stacy?
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, that's huge, just because this course obviously with no wind, it plays pretty easy.   But I don't know what the forecast is for tomorrow, so with those two birdies, it's definitely put me in striking range, and it's not too far out of my range to catch her.

Q.   Pretty proud of that round today with the wind blowing like it was?   It was pretty calm early in the morning and then it turned up. 
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, I felt like I hit the ball well today and my putting was a lot better today than it was yesterday.   Just one of those things where you've got to stay patient.   There's going to be birdies and you're going to have some bogeys, and you just have to stay patient.   That's what I did today, and I just trusted myself and my swing, and I didn't have the best warmup so I was kind of nervous, didn't know what to expect teeing off, and just really wanted to go out there and post a good number. 

Q.   What happened on 17?   I didn't get to see that. 
GERINA PILLER:   I hit a gap wedge.   I wasn't sure if the wind was helping or hurting, and so I just hit that full, and I was probably about 26 or 27 feet past the pin, and it went in, so that was nice.   Those long ones are nice to have.

Q.   What's the strategy when chasing a player like Stacy?   Obviously it's another player, you kind of maybe know they're not going to come back.   They might come back some.   You know with her she's probably going to shoot a number.   What's the strategy?   Do you have to be more aggressive?
GERINA PILLER:   No, I wouldn't change anything that I'm doing.   It's one of those things where you just play good golf and the rest of it takes care of itself, so that's just my plan for tomorrow, just go out and hit good shots and just really stay in my game and not worry about anyone else because the only thing I can control is myself. 

Q.   I saw you throw a strike at the Phillies, has that momentum translated to this week?
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, that was pretty cool.   It's one of my childhood dreams to play in the major leagues.   Obviously that did not work out, so just to‑‑

Q.   Well, you didn't end up on SportsCenter like 50 Cent. 
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, that's very good.   I was hopeful I was going to end up on SportsCenter for a good throw.
