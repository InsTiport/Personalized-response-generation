 Q.  Can you just talk about today?  Solid round for the afternoon especially.  
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, you know, I bogeyed my first hole, but hit a great shot in there.  Just really stayed patient, I know as cliche as that sounds.   
The afternoon was definitely a lot tougher.  The wind picked up pretty good and the course is drying out very fast.  So I felt like I played really smart today.  If I couldn't go at the pin, I left myself in a position where I could get up-and-down and I did it so that always helps.   
Staying patient and allowing -- just give myself opportunities for birdies, I think that's key out here.   
 Q.  When you see an 8-under on the board at a Women's Open to start the day, got to wonder what goes through your mind?  
GERINA PILLER: You know, playing the practice rounds this week, the morning, the course played definitely a lot different than in the afternoons.  And you know what, we have three more rounds to go.  You can't get caught up in that, especially at a U.S. Open.  You can't go out there and expect to be 5, 6-under.  I'm 1-under at the time or even, and you kind of -- it's almost like you have to forget there's other girls out there and just play the golf course and I feel like I did that really well today.
