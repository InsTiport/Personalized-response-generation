Q. Talk me through your round and how you were feeling out there today.
GERINA PILLER:   You know, preparation going kind of into this week, I was probably a little stressed out, but just really tried to focus on just swinging my swing and what I have and what I bring to the table is good enough.  Obviously birdied the first hole, it's a good start, and just tried to keep focusing on hitting good shots and putting myself in position.  If you can keep yourself in position, especially on the greens on that side, it's a little more demanding I feel like as a second-shot golf course, and I feel like I did pretty good with that.  Had two hiccups there, but finished strong and I'm pretty proud of that.
Q. Started out with three birdies on the front; what did that do for your confidence starting the championship and getting going?
GERINA PILLER:   It just really confirms and just really helps me believe that what I have and how I swing the club, it is good enough.  After coming back from having the baby, I think my body, you may not see it physically, but I know it's changed and my swing has changed, and it's taken me a while to kind of get comfortable in that, and I'm 35 years old, there's no need to try to reinvent the wheel here.  Just really trying to focus on swinging my swing.
