Q. What did you think of the round today?  I know you were disappointed with the bogey on 17, but pretty good day overall?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, I mean, the scores were pretty low, and I played really well yesterday.  To come out today 4 under didn't quite feel as good as a 7 under, but I felt like I hung in there and made some good par saves.  The pins were a little tricky today, and the wind kind of made it a factor.  But I played great, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.
Q. What is it about this course that brings out the low numbers?  Is it that it's in such good shape that it's easier to make some putts out there sometimes?
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, it's not very long, and the greens are pure.  If you line it up and you stroke it there, it's going to stay there.  But I think a combination of that and the fact that there are some reachable par 5s and you have a lot of wedges in your hand, or at least I do.
Q. It looks like -- is this a long hitter's golf course?  Sei Young hits it a long ways, obviously, you hit it a long ways.
GERINA PILLER: Probably not off the tee, but we definitely have an advantage into the greens.  The greens have like one hop and stop.  Obviously, when we're hitting wedges and they're hitting 8 irons, it's definitely an advantage for us.  As far as off the tee, I don't hit many drivers.  I probably hit four, maybe five drivers.  So yeah.
Q. What impressed you about playing with Sei Young today?  What impresses you about her game?
GERINA PILLER: She doesn't miss.  She gets on the green, and she has a par putt, and she just -- she scrambles really well, and she hits the ball really good.  And just kind of plain vanilla, but she's really good.
