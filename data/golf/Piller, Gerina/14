 Q.  Just what were your thoughts on the opening match?  
GERINA PILLER: I felt like we played well.  The Europeans had a momentum change there on the back nine.  Made two great birdies on 13 and 14.   
And 13's a tough hole to birdie.  So that's huge momentum for them.  And we just really couldn't get anything going.  The pin placements were really tough today.  Couldn't really get much close.  So you kind of just rely on making long putts, and I felt like we're in good shape.  They're just -- they're a tough team, and I feel like we all played well.
