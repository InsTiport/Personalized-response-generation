 Q.  15-under, pretty good and would win most tournaments without I.K. going crazy.  Give me your assessment of this tournament.  
GERINA PILLER: I feel like my game, I played really well.  To start off 8-under, that's huge.  But I didn't come away with the win, but it doesn't mean I didn't have a winning performance.  I'm looking forward to taking the week off and heading over to the British.   
 Q.  You knocked it out of the park here this year.  What was the difference?  
GERINA PILLER: I think I've just matured as a person, as a golfer.  I trust my game a lot more now.  It probably still needs a little tweaking here and there, and it helps me to have a course that's this pure.  I'm glad to be back.  I missed it last year and played the International Crown, so that kind of conflicted, but glad to be back.   
 Q.  What will you take away from here, frustration or a positive feeling?  
GERINA PILLER: Definitely not frustrated.  There was a couple times the last two days that I was over par and I ended up bringing it back and finishing over par.  At that point you've just got to focus on the positives and learn from your mistakes and move on and become a better golfer.   
 Q.  You're essentially guaranteed to be on the Solheim Cup this year.  What are your thoughts about that?  
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of one of my No. 1 goals whenever I start a new year, start a new Solheim Cup year.  My first year I was lucky enough to be a captain's pick, and two years ago I was like, I don't want to go through that again, and my goal was to make the team on my own.  I think I finished maybe sixth or something on the points list, so not very high, and this last year, qualifying for the Olympics and qualifying for the International Crown was huge on my list, and another goal of mine was to be a shoe-in for Solheim and become a leader and a face on the Solheim team.  I feel like I'm going in the right direction, and just excited about it.   
 Q.  When you're playing in tournaments like the Solheim Cup, is that in your mind?  
GERINA PILLER: Probably not during a tournament, but it is something that I feel like it's a huge honor to be a part of.  I feel like any time you can represent your country is one of the greatest honors, and it's just a special tournament, and there's no tournament like it.  It's just one of those things where I would love to play it every year.
