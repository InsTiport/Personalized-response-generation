 Q. Good day for you, 4‑under par, about four shots off the lead heading into the weekend. Like your position?  
GERINA PILLER: I do. I like where my game is at. Made some really key up‑and‑downs coming down the stretch. To come out here and shoot a bogey‑free round, it definitely gives me a lot of confidence heading into the weekend, and I feel like even though I went bogey‑free today, I felt like could I have done a little better. That's always nice going. Two more days to play, there's always room for improvement and I'm looking forward to that.  
   
 Q. What does that say about your short game on a course like this with so many tight lies and raised greens and thick, furry bunkers and things like that?  
GERINA PILLER: I think it's huge. I think it really takes the pressure off your iron shots, which takes pressure off your tee shots. I think it's kind of like a domino effect. If you can hit fairways and you can hit greens, and you know you're putting well and you're chipping well, it just takes the pressure off your game as a whole.   
I think that will allow me to play a little more free and just kind of let my ability take over.  
   
 Q. With you and Stacy in good position heading into the weekend, and Lexi in position to finish up strong here, good overall position for the United States Team?   
GERINA PILLER: Yeah, that would be pretty cool to have a podium sweep. It's definitely been talked about amongst us. But again, there's a lot of golf to be played and you can't put the cart before the horse. For me, I just want to focus on playing consistent golf and hitting good shots and making putts.
