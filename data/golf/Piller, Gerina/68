Q.   7‑under round, great playing today.   What was working for you?
GERINA PILLER:   Just everything.   I started off kind of rough, had to make a couple long putts for par, and that kind of just got my round kick‑started.   After that just tried to focus on hitting fairways and greens, and tried to hit it closer, and that always helps. 

Q.   This course really requires fairways and greens for a good round.   Can you talk about how you put it all together today? 
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, the good thing about this year is the rough isn't as thick, so that kind of gives you leeway and not so much pressure to hit the fairways.   If you miss the fairway you still have a chance to get it on and even get it close, so that was huge for this week.   Just really trusting yourself and not trying to play perfect golf.   That's what I did yesterday, and you can see that did not work out as well. 

Q.   You mentioned multiple times your great round today.   How do you carry that momentum and carry that into the weekend?
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah, I mean, it's anyone's game.   Anything can happen.   It's a great course.   It's in awesome shape, and you get the birdies rolling and you can go low out here.   I'm just happy to be here playing for the weekend.   It wasn't looking like that yesterday.   Just want to stay patient especially and not put so much pressure on my tee shots.
