Q.   What was that like for both of you, like for you today to be playing and knowing what she was doing?
GERINA PILLER:   Well, obviously I didn't know what he was doing, and I definitely was more nervous for him than I think I was for me. 
Like I‑‑ I wouldn't say it affected me, but I was just more concerned with, because he's worked so hard, and‑‑ it's just been‑‑ like it's hard to see him fail, and like going into this year obviously he wasn't guaranteed any tournaments, and for him to work his tail off and play his way back in, that's just been awesome.   I couldn't be more proud. 
Now I have to buy him a new truck, because I told him before the year, I said, if you win a tournament and you get back on the PGA TOUR, I'll buy you a new truck.

Q.   Now you owe him a new truck. 
GERINA PILLER:   I do owe him a new truck.   So it's just awesome.   I mean I could care less what I did today.   I was just really wanting the best for him, and it just makes my heart smile.

Q.   When did you find out that he won?
GERINA PILLER:   On 15 tee, Cristie came up to me, and I had just birdied and obviously I was having kind of a rough day, and she was standing in the ropes and I'm like, what is she doing.   And she said my husband won.   And I lost it.   And I had the tee.   I'm like, don't tell me now.   I have to hit the ball.
So obviously I started crying, and it's just been‑‑ it's just been awesome.   Words cannot describe‑‑ I just can't wait to talk to him.

Q.   We looked on the Money List and he's like 29th or whatever and you're 28th.   So it seems like you two are quite a little pair in terms of making it work. 
GERINA PILLER:   Yeah.   I couldn't be more happy for him.
