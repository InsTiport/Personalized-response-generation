 Q.  6-under par today.  Got yourself to 9-under.  How do you feel about your round today?  
GERINA PILLER: I felt great about it.  I felt yesterday I didn't play very well at all, and it wasn't necessarily my physical game.  I think just a little off mentally.   
I'm so thankful for my caddie.  He definitely keeps me in check.  He gave me just -- we had a little talk afterwards, and it just really helped today.   
Just going out there to play great and not going out there to not play bad; to aim for a shot, to hit it great and not worry where it goes.   
Just really tried to do that today, and getting off to a start with two birdies is always a big boost.  But happy where my game is.   
 Q.  Were there any particular shots today that stood out in your mind be, any holes?  
GERINA PILLER: You know, I birdied every par-5, so that's really big just because, I mean, well, two of them are reachable.  You know, it says a lot.  Four birdies a round, that's pretty good if you can have those every time.   
Just kind of eliminated the bogeys.  But there are some really tough driving holes I feel like; 9 is pretty tight, 16 -- or sorry, 17, and 14.  I felt like I was really good on those.   
I wouldn't say like I hit it perfect, but I had a good mentality going into it.   
 Q.  How has the golf course kind of changed since Thursday?  
GERINA PILLER: Well, it's definitely -- it gets later in the day firm and fast.  The I tee'd off at 9:30, so mid-morning, and there were a few greens on the back already firming up.   
Definitely plays a lot different, a lot firmer in the afternoon.  But it's in phenomenal shape.  I could play this course every day.   
 Q.  What is your game plan for the final round?  
GERINA PILLER: Just go hang out, watch some college football, and, I don't know, maybe treat myself to some pizza.
