 Q. The sun is shining and you played a lot better today. 
 MIKE BORICH: Yeah, a little better today. I hit it better and didn't putt it any different, but I hit it in the fairway more and I hit it on the greens a little bit more. So, yeah, not bad.

 Q. One of the other guys who made his debut said this morning that yesterday he kind of let the crowd get to him a little bit. Did you feel a lot more settled today?
 MIKE BORICH: Yeah, settled, a little more settled today. I let situation get me yesterday. The whole thing. 
 And I, you know, you play your whole life to get in these positions and these situations, but until you get there, you're not ready for them. 
 And certainly I, to be tell you the truth, I just wasn't prepared for it . And I have got my left foot is all swelled off. And that's not an excuse either, but I'll go with it. 
 But I ran out of gas the last couple holes. 

 Q. Do you feel like though that this is definitely something you can take with you --
 MIKE BORICH: I think so. 

 Q. -- throughout the course of your career?
 MIKE BORICH: Yeah, I do. I think there will be some more of these for me.
