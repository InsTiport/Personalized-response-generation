   PHIL WEIDINGER: This is the third hole-in-one in the tournament's history. Last one was ten years ago by Dan Jansen on No. 5. First time No. 17 has ever been aced. What were you thinking when it was up in the air? Did you have any idea?   
 MARSHALL FAULK: I hit a good shot. And it was right at the hole. Funny part is I hit a bunch of shots at the hole and all of them spun back and off the green. I'm just hoping this one stops. It hit and spun back and went in.  
  
  Q. Did everybody go nuts?  
 MARSHALL FAULK: Yes. But I was like the last person to go nuts because I'm still standing there like holding a pose thinking, "Did that just go in?" Pretty cool.  
  
  Q. I understand that there's been a few drinks going on on your tab over in the north?  
 MARSHALL FAULK: I partnered with American Century.  
  
  Q. Hang on one second, because there's something over -- hang on one minute. I just something over here that -- the bar tab came in $2,137.49. Congratulations.   
 MARSHALL FAULK: That's me and American Century. This is part of my appearance fee.  
  
  Q. Chris Doyle from American Century, what do you think about that?   
 CHRIS DOYLE: I want my money back.   
 PHIL WEIDINGER: First time in 10 years. Congratulations. Great playing. Nice shot. Anybody have any questions of Marshall?   
  
  Q. Didn't even hit the green. Just bounced right into the hole. That's what the spectators said. It took one hop behind the pin and bounced right in.   
 MARSHALL FAULK: From my point it looked like it hit and spun in. I don't know.  
  
  Q. They said it never touched the ground.   
 MARSHALL FAULK: It had to at some point in time. I couldn't tell from where I was.  
  
  Q. Hole-in-one is good for eight points. Eagle is normally good for six. That's the biggest number we've had on the board ever. Way to go.   
 MARSHALL FAULK: Thank you.   
  
  Q. What was the score for the day?   
 MARSHALL FAULK: 11. I missed a lot of putts.  
 PHIL WEIDINGER: Got eight back on one. Congratulations. And thank you for coming in.
