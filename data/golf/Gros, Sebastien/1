 Q.  How good is 5-under around here?  
SEBASTIEN GROS: Well, first round here, so very happy.  Grass is always different for European guys to come here.  Been very good going to the greens, so I had many opportunities and I had a great score at the end.   
 Q.  And yet you have some experience of playing in Asia.  Does that help?  
SEBASTIEN GROS: Yes, because playing on The Asian Tour in 2014 helped me to try to get answers to all the questions I had around the greens, especially, and trying to deal with the grain every time.  That's something you can't find in Europe.  Maybe it helped me but it helped me get on The European Tour for sure.  Today, I don't know, because I haven't been chipping that much.   
 Q.  Are there still questions to be answered around the greens here and on those greens?  
SEBASTIEN GROS: Yeah, I was very good with the irons.  I think I haven't made a chip all day because I just had to lay up on 18 and I had a wedge shot to make par.  It was just a good day, so just being on the greens, sometimes with a good pace and a good line so I could make a few, but not that much, too.  Just good like that.   
 Q.  When was the last time you felt as good about your game?  
SEBASTIEN GROS: Well, I didn't have any good result recently on the last month but I could feel that maybe a couple of weeks, I was getting better.  I'm not that surprised of a good round of being second or 5-under -- well, it's always good.  But I could feel that I was getting in a better shape those last days, so happy with it.   
 Q.  Lovely way to start 2017?  
SEBASTIEN GROS: My start to 2017 was last week and it was a missed the cut but it wasn't that good.  But even last week, if I missed the cut by quite far, I think four shots, I could feel I was getting closer from it.  So it's just being patient with the game I think.
