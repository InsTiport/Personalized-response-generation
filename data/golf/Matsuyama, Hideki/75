Q. How important was that last birdie on 18?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The birdie at the last hole was really important because it still kept me in the tournament.  I still have a chance to win.
What really hurt was the missed putts at 15 and 16 and 17.  I wish I could have those back.  But at least I'm in striking distance.
Q. You're No. 1 in greens hit in regulation in the first two rounds, and you hit all the greens again today.  Talk a little bit about the putting.  Has that been holding you back a little bit this week?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: My putting hasn't been that bad.  I missed some key putts, though, along the way, and -- but it's nothing that I can't turn around for tomorrow's last round.
Q. Just a few shots back of the leader right now.  On this golf course, I think we have seen a lot of low rounds.  Is there one low round in you this week?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, somebody's going to shoot, tomorrow, 7-under or better, maybe 6-under, 7-under or better, and hopefully, it will be me, and I'll have a chance to win.
