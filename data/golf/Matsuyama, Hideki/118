  Q. Tell us about your round. What did you think of your round?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm tired. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. A lot of hills?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think I had a hard time because my tee shots were going sideways.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about your shot on 12? It hit a tree and bounced in the fairway but you made birdie.   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: That was very lucky, and I was so glad that I made the birdie.  
  
  Q. How hard was that hole?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think it was extremely difficult, and the first and second shot was difficult, but I think I was able to hit the chip really well.  
  
  Q. What expectations did you have coming into this week, and how did you meet your expectations? How did you prepare?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think I'm doing much better than I expected. I'm very, very happy.  
  
  Q. Right now it looks very good for you to continue to play. What would you like to get out of getting to play in the Masters as an amateur?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Well, I'm an amateur, so I have three more years of school, but I don't know whether I'll be able to come back next year or not. But I will do my best at University as well as at the amateur tournament, and if I can win the Asian Amateur tournament, then I'll come back here. I will do my best.   
  
  Q. Have your perceptions changed after two rounds, what you thought Augusta National was going to be compared to now?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Well, I think that it's a very difficult course, but I'm so happy that I was able to focus on my playing each hole.   
  
  Q. Did the possibility of playing the Masters as an amateur inspire you to improve your game or practice more or anything like that? Did it inspire you to work on your game when you first heard about it?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Well, I think that if I can just get into the Asian Amateur again, then I will do my best to play well again. But at the beginning I wasn't thinking about that.  
  
  Q. What year are you in University?   
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Second year.   
  
  Q. That's a freshman?  
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, sophomore.
