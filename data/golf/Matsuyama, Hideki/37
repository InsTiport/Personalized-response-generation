 Q.  Describe what it is like to play the 18th hole.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: That is a really difficult hole.  I mean, you can end up hitting right like Jason did today and then there is water on the left.  So it's tough all the way around.   
 Q.  Given some of your loose swings in the first nine holes, do you feel like you are in a good place to be just one back?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm disappointed the way I played today.  However, I'm happy to just to be one stroke back and still have a chance and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Your swing has not looked like that all week.  What do you think was going on?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably the pressure had something to do with it, being in the last group of a major tournament.  But all week I haven't been spot on all week.  And the worries that I had about my swing showed up today in the way I played.   
 Q.  When Jason got in trouble on No. 18, did you give any words of encouragement to him?  Did you say anything to him at all?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No words of advice, but, Let's go get them tomorrow.
