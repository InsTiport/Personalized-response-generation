 Q.   You and Keegan were matching birdies out there as quite a pairing you guys had today.   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Keegan birdied the first hole and kind of set the pace for us, and I just kind of followed him and caught some momentum the back nine, and we both came in pretty well.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your play in major championships this year, it's just terrific, third straight major, you have to feel pretty happy.   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I played far better than my expectations, but I have a lot of work to do and a lot of things I've got to practice and make my game a little stronger to be able to compete.   
   
 Q.   And lastly, how do you think the course is going to play coming down the stretch, those tough holes, for the leaders?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Whoever hits the fairway is going to be the one to win.
