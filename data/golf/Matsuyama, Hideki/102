Q.   Great playing, off to a good start today, just some comments?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Martin played very well.   I was fortunate to come out on top.   I played well, too.

Q.   Obviously you can't keep playing if you don't win, but how important is it to get off it to a good start going forward?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I'm really, really not that good at match play. 
I'm just happy to death that I won today and I get to continue on tomorrow.
