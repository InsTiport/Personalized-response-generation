Q. Hideki Matsuyama, even par 70.  How are you feeling going into tomorrow?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Yeah, I made a lot of birdies, more birdies today than I have the first two days, but hopefully tomorrow I can make the same number of birdies without the bogeys.
Q. Talk a little bit about your putting this week, especially today.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I hit some good putts today, but at the same time I hit some bad ones.  The greens were really difficult to read and to putt on.  Hopefully tomorrow I just pray that I have more makes.
Q. How do you use your experience in past majors tomorrow in this position?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I know how difficult the U.S. Open is.  I mean, you just have to get out there and grind, and the experience that I have, I'll just have to use that and grind as hard as I can.
Q. Can you talk through the third shot on the 17th hole and what the lie was like?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I can't blame the lie.  I wish I could, but I can't.  I just hit a bad shot there.  Hopefully that won't happen tomorrow and I can do my best.
