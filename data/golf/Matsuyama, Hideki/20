Q. 64 today.  Good score.  Must be very happy in windy conditions?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm very happy with the way I played today and especially to be in a position to contend.  It's been a while, and that makes me happy, too.
Q. I was going to say your year has been very consistent, lots of cuts made, but not really in contention.  So coming from behind must be satisfying?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, like you said, I've made a lot of cuts and played okay but haven't really been in position to contend for a win.  That's why it's doubly satisfying to play well today.
Q. The shot on 18 obviously was a great way to end the round.  What was going through your mind?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: To be honest, it was a difficult shot, but luckily I had a good lie.  And of course I wasn't thinking about making it; I was thinking about getting it within six, seven feet, I would have been happy.  So it was a bonus for it to go in.
Q. How does it feel going into Sunday in this position?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I was thinking just make par at 18 and I'd have been happy.  But really to make birdie was a really good feeling, good way to end the day.
Q. I know you've had some injuries, but can you recall the last time you had a round that felt as good as this round?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: That's a good question because I can't remember because it's probably been well over a year before I've had a round like this.  It was a good one today.
Q. What's the feeling like coming back here where you won, obviously?  Does that give you confidence?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Of course you come back to a place that you've won before, and you know if you play well you're going to have a chance to win.  That's how I felt.
