 Q.   Congratulations on a good round.   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Coming after good memories from last year, did he take those good memories and apply it to his first round and is he happy with his round?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I'm really glad to have the good results with the round, but at the same time I still see there is some improvement I have to make.   So I would like to do my best to improve that in coming around.  
   
 Q.   The conditions today with the course, was it much different than last year?   Is it softer?   Slower?   How was it out there?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I can't tell you so much, but at the same time I felt that the fairway was a little bit soft this year.  
   
 Q.   So after your performance last year, it must have given you so much confidence.   As an amateur you went onto win a lot of tournaments after that.   Do you have any plans on turning pro any time soon?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I don't have any plan for that, but I just want to concentrate on my play here so that I will be able to do my best.
