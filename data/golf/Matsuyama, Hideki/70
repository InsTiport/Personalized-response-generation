A flash interview with:   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA   
 Q.  I'm with Waste Management Phoenix Open winner, Hideki Matsuyama.  We have an interpreter.  Hideki, what a wonderful day.  You missed only two greens in 22 holes of competition, and your driving in the playoff was magnificent.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I struggled all week with my game, but it really came around today and I was really pleased that it did.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  Your second PGA TOUR win.  Top 10 of the FedEx Cup standings.  Well done.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Thank you.   
 Q.  Talk about your win.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  I'm really, really happy.  Really happy.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind on that last hole when you see him go in the water?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  You know, when I saw it in the water, I thought, well, I've still got to make birdie here, because he's going to get it up and down.  I just did my best and still planned hopefully to make birdie because I knew Rickie was going to get it up and down.   
 Q.  You seemed so calm in the playoff.  How did you remain so calm?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  Maybe from the outside it looked calm, but then I was nervous inside.  And I played well all day long and so it just carried over into the playoff holes.  And again, happy that it did.   
 Q.  What do you think of your week here?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  It was a blast playing in front of all these people.  Really.  Honestly.  It was a dream come true.   
 Q.  Talk about your play in the playoff.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  I'm really happy that I won.  Surprised and sad that Rickie finished that way, but all I can do is my best, and I was lucky to come out on top.   
 Q.  Nice.  Congratulations.  Heck of a performance there.  What does it mean for you to win this?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  I'm really happy.  Really, really happy with the win.  It's been a while since the first one, and I'm just really happy today.
