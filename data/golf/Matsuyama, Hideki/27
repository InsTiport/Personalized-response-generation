 Q.  Excellent play today.  Comment on your victory over Yusaku Miyazota?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: After a long way off, I played last week, and didn't really hit it very well.  But I really found my game today.  It was a great day out there.   
And I sure enjoyed playing with my upper classman, Yusaku Miyazato, he made me feel relaxed and it was an enjoyable day of golf.  And again, he played well.  And I'm glad that I played well, too.   
 Q.  Big stretch of the match came when you birdied three in a row on Nos. 7, 8 and 9, followed by birdies on Nos. 12 and 13.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The birdies at 7 and 9 got me back into it.  And then birdieing 11 and 12 and 13 were huge.  That really made the difference today.   
 Q.  Comment on your match tomorrow.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Hopefully I can keep it going.  I did hit it well today so hopefully that will continue.
