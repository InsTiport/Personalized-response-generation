  HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Joost made a couple of mistakes coming in, but I was able to take advantage of it and come out the winner today.  
   
 Q.   How does that work for your momentum heading into tomorrow?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   What it comes down to, it doesn't matter yesterday and today.   I'm playing Kevin Na tomorrow.   I've got to win that match to be able to advance.   And so I'm just going to play the best I can, and give it my best shot tomorrow.
