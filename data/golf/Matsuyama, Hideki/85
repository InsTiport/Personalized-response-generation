Q.   You obviously feel comfortable on this course.   Putted a lot better today than you did yesterday, how was that for you?   You felt confident with your day before the tournament, are you still trying to find your swing a little bit?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   You're right, I was struggling with my game up until Wednesday, and then yesterday was a magical day. 
Today was back to the same old grind.   So it's right to the practice range right now and see if I can get it figured out.

Q.   How long will you practice today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Until I figure it out (laughter).

Q.   How close do you think you are to figuring it out?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I'll be there a while.

Q.   The first day as defending champion you probably have one set of emotions.   The second day just back to normal?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Actually, I felt the same.   There was no difference, no added pressure. 

Q.   Have you been to Chambers Bay yet?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Yes.

Q.   What's your impression?   What do you think of it?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   It's a very long, difficult, tough golf course.

Q.   Did you consult with Robert Trent Jones, Jr. at all?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   The day I went up for the practice round, I did get to meet him and we exchanged pleasantries, but I didn't really get to talk to him much about the golf course, itself.
