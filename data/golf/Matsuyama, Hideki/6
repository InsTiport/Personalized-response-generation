Q. Hideki Matsuyama, 1-under 69 today.  Hideki, how was your round?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I played well today.  I hit the ball better and left a couple of putts that I should have made, though, out there and have to work on that.
Q. How much harder was today than yesterday?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   The Winged Foot bore its teeth today.  The greens were especially difficult.  I don't know if it was the pins or what, playing in the afternoon, but it was a lot tougher today than it was yesterday.
Q. Can you take us through your birdie on the 1st hole?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   It was one of those birdies that don't happen very often.  Again, I wasn't putting it very well, and I could have putted it, but I thought, well, we'll just use the backstop, and it rolled in.
Q. Did you think that the wind affected your putting at all today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Yeah, the wind dried the greens out.  So they were not only just dried out, but they were getting a lot faster and tougher to putt, and it was a challenge today.
Q. What's important for tomorrow's round?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   U.S. Open golf, got to hit fairways and greens, fairways and greens.
