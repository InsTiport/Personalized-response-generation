 Q.  Can you sum up your round for today?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I didn't play real well today but looking forward to a better round tomorrow.  Still have a chance and so I'll do my best.   
 Q.  You got off to a fast start and then the birdies sort of dried up.  What happened after those run of birdies?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Really I wasn't hitting the ball that well and got lucky on the first five holes to get it to 4-under for the day.  But coming in, it was a struggle.   
 Q.  You've played well on this golf course.  Obviously this golf course suits your eye.  What do you think you need to do tomorrow to sort of like get yourself back into contention?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Mainly, most importantly, get off to a good start.  Hit the ball like I did yesterday and score like I did yesterday and I may still have a chance.   
 Q.  Still playing like how you played last week when you won in Japan, as well?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, I played a lot better last week.
