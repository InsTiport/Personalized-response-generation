HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The course played tough.  The pins were receptive, though, more than yesterday.  I was just disappointed the way I played.   
 Q.  Overall, how do you feel about your performance this week?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The last major of the year, and I was in contention.  All I can do is just try harder next time.
