Q. You said you were not bringing your A game to the tournament.  Were you surprised at how well you played?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I putted very well today.  That was the difference.Q. (No Microphone.)HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably starting from last week I started putting a little bit better and it just carried over into today.  I was very happy about that.  No big change.Q. How satisfying was the putt on 9?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It was really a great way to end the round.  It was right in between, it was about a 12-footer and I was able to make it.  Real happy to end that way.Q. Now do you feel like you've got a good idea how to play this golf course?  Some guys have played it for 20 years and haven't quite solved it.HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The key to this golf course for me anyway is to keep the tee shots in the fairway.  Then score well on the back nine.Q. You have to know when to go for it and when to kind of just play safe?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, you're right, especially if you don't hit the fairway with your tee shot, you just got to put it on the green somewhere and hope to make par.Q. There's been a lot of chatter here the last three weeks about Rory and Jordan and he's kind of in the same peer group with those guys, wondering, if you think there's much difference where you are with your game and where they are, if any at all?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not even close to those guys, Rory and Jordan.  I just need to practice more and hopefully soon I'll be able to play at the same level that they do.Q. Who do you like in the Stanley Cup playoffs?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I have no idea. (Laughter.)Q. Do you like this golf course?  It's a little different.HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's a very difficult golf course.
