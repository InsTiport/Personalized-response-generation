 Q.  If not for a guy named Justin Thomas, it would be six wins in a row.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I tipped my hat to Justin.  He played well all day long.  Had a little hiccup there at 15, but I just say congratulations to him.  He deserved it.   
 Q.  When you were five back with five to play, you might have been thinking, oh, not for me this week, but then he gave you the life; did it give you that boost you needed to chase him down?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I was five back with five to go, and made the eagle at 13, or was it 14.  And then Justin had a little trouble at 15 and then I was really in it.  But my putter let me down there at 16, 17 and 18.   
 Q.  What will be your takeaway for the week, given that you have continued your really stellar play?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, I swang it really well this week and hopefully I can take that next week.  I just need to make a couple more putts.   
 Q.  You talked about working on short game a lot for the lead-up into the Masters.  Is that still going to be the focus for you?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Along with my full swing, I'll concentrate on the short game, but I can't forget my full swing, either.   
 Q.  Looking for to the rest of this year, considering how well you're playing coming into 2017?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The results have been there these past couple of months, so in that respect, yeah, I am looking forward to another good year.   
 Q.  Next tournament, what are your plans?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: San Diego and Phoenix.
