 Q. We understand you're aware of the earthquake today. Was it hard to concentrate out there? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I couldn't concentrate.

 Q. You finished even par. You've got to be pleased with that, considering. 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I am very satisfied today.

 Q. Where did you see the news, on the internet or...
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: My coach told me.

 Q. Considering what has happened to your region, what was your reaction when you heard? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I didn't think that we were going to have an earthquake again this year. 

 Q. Are you going to call any of your friends back home? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Well, I can't call right now because I don't have a cell phone. I think the only thing that I can do is play my best here, and I want to show myself to the people in Japan so that will encourage them.

 Q. Are you wearing the shirt of your University that was devastated? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yes.

 Q. How was the school affected, the University? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: A lot of the buildings were destroyed by a previous earthquake, so I don't know about this one.

 Q. What would it mean to you or maybe to the people at home if you finished as the low amateur? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: If I can play the way I played today, and if I play well, that will be encouragement to the people that survived the earthquake, including myself.

 Q. Were you at all discouraged by the three closing bogeys in the last three holes? Did that put a damper on today? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not really disappointed because as I went through there in the practice round, too, I wasn't doing well. But I think this has been really great.

 Q. Are all of your friends and family accounted for? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I don't know about this time, but the previous earthquake, yes, I know everybody is doing well. 

 Q. How does it feel to finally be here? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I would like to thank the people who supported me, including my family, and also the people from my school. Without those people, I wouldn't be here.

 Q. Do you usually wear that shirt, or is that a tribute in honor of the people at your school? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I made this specifically for the Masters. This flag is for those people who were affected by the quake. 

 Q. Knowing about the earthquake this morning, was it any extra motivation? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Well, I didn't know very much about it, but I can say I just tried to concentrate myself on playing golf, and that's what I did. 

 Q. Did you at all have to say anything to yourself to try to make sure not to get mentally down going into the round because of the news? What, if anything, did you do to try to stay focused? 
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think that it's the same thing, like I said, that the only thing I can do is just to do my best, and that's all I thought about.
