JOHN DEVER:   Good afternoon.  Welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship here at TPC Harding Park.  We are pleased to be joined by Hideki Matsuyama, beginning with an even-par 70.
Lots of pars, a couple bogeys, a couple birdies.  Just give us a summation of your round.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I didn't have a lot of birdie chances thanks to my driver.  I just couldn't get it in the fairway.  I'm happy to finish at even today.
