Q. Why do you play this course so well?  A win last year.  Bogey-free today.  What's the key for you here?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I wish I knew why I play well here, but I did hit the ball very well today, hit a lot of greens, a lot of good shots.
Q. How good is the game now?  How does it compare to when you won the HSBC?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not hitting it and putting it as well as I did in Shanghai, but hopefully throughout the week here I can get to that same level and compete for the win again.
Q. Bogey-free today.  What was working best for you out there today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The best part of my game, I hit a lot of greens today.
Q. What were the crowds like?  Were they treating you well?  Different experience for you?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, there was a lot of gallery out there today.  It's fun to play in front of them, because they are so supportive.
Looking forward to another great week here.
Q. Do you feel like you picked up where you left off last year?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not sure, but I did play well today.  Hopefully we can keep it up, and come the weekend we will have a chance to compete.
Q. Where does this tournament rank in terms of your favorite places to play?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably No. 1, because I have had such good success here and played well here.
Q. Tiger Woods told us last week that he don't get disturbed by anything in the golf course, like even when it's very beautiful, he's focused on his game.  He don't get disturbed.  How about you?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, I'm not sure.  You know, I grind.  But Tiger is Tiger, and I'm different from him.  All of us have our way of getting around the course.
All I'm out there doing is trying to do my best.
Q. What it's like to already be competing with Rickie in the first round this year after finishing together last year?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I would love to be in the final group with him again on Sunday.
