 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I played well again today.  I didn't quite hit the ball or putt it as well as I did yesterday, but I'm happy the way I got it around and into the hole.   
 Q.  What is your strategy going into the weekend?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm just going to try to do the exactly what I've done the first two days and hopefully that's good enough.   
 Q.  Does the heat change the way that you prepare?  Does it change the way that you feel during a round of golf?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, when it's so hot, we all sweat a lot and it's important to, for me anyway, to make sure I've got a towel handy and don't let my grips get wet at all.  Also, the concentration level that you need is much more difficult in the heat and you really need to be careful of that, how you're concentrating in order to score well.
