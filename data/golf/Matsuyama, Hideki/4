 Q. You had such a great finish in the last round last week. Can you talk about how you plan to carry that momentum into this week?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: That was a good weekend last week, but two completely different golf courses, two different tournaments. All I can do is just forget about last week but hopefully continue the good play this week.   
   
 Q. How different is it for you to play without patrons here and on a different grass in November?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, it's a shame the patrons can't be here, but we've been playing in front of no galleries all year, so I'm a little bit used to it. I guess the big difference, though, will be the difference in the grass. The overseed hasn't come in yet, and that'll be something that all of us are going to have to battle, I think, this week.   
   
 Q. It was the first time you played in a tournament the week before the Masters; what was your reason to do so?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Really no real reason. Nothing to delve into. It's just that the schedule worked out, and I'm glad I was able to play well last week.   
   
 Q. You had such a strong start here as an amateur in your first appearance. What's your most outstanding memory from that week, and why do you think you played so well at this golf course?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I remember I was really excited to be here in 2011, but that was nine years ago, so I really can't remember everything that happened this week. But I do know that I'm happy to be here nine years after that as a professional. Hopefully I'll be able to contend for the green jacket and play well this week.
