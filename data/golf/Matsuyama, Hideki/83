Q. Curious if you feel like you play well, just as good, if winning is hard --
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I agree with you, I've played well, but this tournament is not winning.  But sometimes when you're not winning, you learn the things that you need to know in order to win.
Q. How is this team different without Ernie?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Without Ernie it's a lot different.  But this is a team that can win and hopefully I can do my best to help the team bring a victory to the international squad.
