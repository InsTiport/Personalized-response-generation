 Q.  Some thoughts on the round?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I played okay, I hit a lot of fairways, but I didn't putt very well today.   
 Q.  You've been trying to get everything together for the last few weeks.  Is it nice to come somewhere where you know you've had good results to really click things into shape?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Especially happy that I'm playing well here.  This is a great tournament, it's like a major, even though it's a preparation for me for a major, but I'm pleased.   
 Q.  You're happy with your score?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's okay.   
 Q.  Is it something that you needed to see lately, just results on the board as well as in practice?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think as long as I keep playing well the results will be there, but again I hit a lot of fairways today and I'm very satisfied with that.   
 Q.  Are you feeling healthy?  A hundred percent?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm good.
