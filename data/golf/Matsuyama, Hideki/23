Q. What's it like being back after two months of separation?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Just like old times.  Nothing changed.
Q. Are you ready for a really big Playoff run?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm trying my best.  I'm trying to get better every day, and hopefully the Playoffs will be good to me this year.
Q. One of the things that we have seen you do in the past is go on momentous runs in your golf, really good stretches.  Does that give you confidence in a series like this?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I've been working hard and I'm seeing some improvements in my game, and hopefully that will carry on through the Playoffs and I can do a little better.
Q. At what point do you think you'll be comfortable?  How far away are you from your best?  I know you're a very hard marker on yourself.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's a great question.  It's a difficult question but I am improving.  I'm getting closer and closer every day and I'm not there yet, but I'm encouraged.
Q. How much weight did you lost and what was the method you used to change the shape of your body?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably the best diet, it was a stressful year.  It was a stressful year.
I was just planning to lose about three kilos, but it ended up six or seven.  Now I'm trying to get it back.  What do you think?  Do you think I look better?
Q. He looks great.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Okay.  Then I'll stay just the same as I am right now then.
Q. Have you given yourself some slack given you're a new dad?  A lot of players as a new dad have slip-in results, but that's to be expected, right?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, I haven't felt -- I think it's just a coincidence I haven't played well and being a new father.
I've been able to do both well I thought but you may be right.
Q. Do you still love golf?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yes, of course.
