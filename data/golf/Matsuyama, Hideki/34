Q. Just wanted to ask, at the end of a long season, you were under a lot of pressure for a lot of the season because you played well.  How nice is it to have a team event?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You're right.  It has been a long year, a long season.  But actually, playing in individual events is much less pressure, because I want to do well for my teammates.  But I'm looking forward to this week and I hope it's going to be a good one.
Q. Captain Price was talking about how you said you've come out of your shell over the last two Presidents Cups, and that you're a lot of fun in the team rooms.  Can you talk about how your interaction has changed?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's been, what, four years since my first Presidents Cup.  I still haven't learned enough English to really communicate well with my teammates, but I've learned enough to get along with them all.  They are all my good friends.  They are my brothers, and I'm looking forward to winning the Cup with them this year.
