Q. What was the biggest key in your round today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably the key was keeping the ball in the fairway off the tee.  When you have a chance like that to hit it on the green, because the greens are so difficult, but for me, hitting it in the fairway was the biggest key today.
Q. Great start to this tournament.  Obviously, three more rounds to go.  Are you thinking at all about the TOUR Championship and the possibility that it may be difficult to win the FedExCup?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'd like to think about it, but I really am not hitting the ball that well yet.  So I'm going to go to the practice range and get some work in tonight and hopefully have a good day tomorrow.
Q. If this is poor play by you, I'd hate to see great play.  Congratulations on the day.
