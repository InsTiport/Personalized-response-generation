HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I played well today.   I'm happy with the score and how I played.  
   
 Q.   You're a young man.   Does that work to your advantage on this golf course or disadvantage?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I'm not sure how to answer your first question.   But I got it around okay the first two days.  
   
 Q.   What do you like about this golf course?   Have you played a course like this, and what do you like about it characteristically?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Playing in last year's Presidents Cup has really helped me this week.   It gave me an idea what the course is like and helped me to get my lines.   
And so that was really a plus for me to be able to play it last year in the Presidents Cup.  
   
 Q.   What are your favorite holes out here?   Do you prefer‑‑ a lot of players prefer the par 5s to par 3s, par 4s.   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I don't have a favorite hole, but I really ‑‑ No. 12 is a challenge, and I enjoy playing that one.
