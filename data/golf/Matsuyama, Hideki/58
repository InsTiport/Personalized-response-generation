 Q.  Thoughts on 7-under today?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I hit the ball really well and it was a lot of fun today.   
 Q.  How was it playing in the wind, because it's so much more difficult.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: During the warm up this morning, it was starting to get windy and I thought maybe just a couple under par would be a good score.  So I'm really happy with how it ended up today.   
 Q.  Do you think that you're a good wind player; you're somebody that's good at adapting to different conditions?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, not really, but I mean, it was windy and it was cold.  The ball, it's hard to control, and I mean, it was tough out there today.   
 Q.  Is a round like this, though, something that's just indicative of how well you're playing at the moment?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I have been playing well but really today, I hit some good second shots, and made some putts and that's what made the round score well for me.   
 Q.  Is Sheshan a course that you particularly like, one that you just enjoy playing?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I mean, I've played here before and haven't done well at all.  So this is a nice surprise for me.   
 Q.  What has made that difference?  Is it just that general form?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Maybe it's my attitude.  I'm having fun and enjoying myself.   
 Q.  When did that attitude change?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Like I said before, I haven't really played well here before.  So before coming here, I was a little bit nervous again, thinking, well, maybe it's not going to be a good week for me.   
But then I decided, oh, wait a minute, let's just have fun this week.  It's made a difference.   
 Q.  And what does having fun mean away from the golf course?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Eating good food.   
 Q.  Are you finding plenty?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yes.
