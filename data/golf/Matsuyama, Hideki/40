Q. Congratulations.  A great round.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Thank you.
Q. Great way to finish.  Just your best results in a major championship so far.  How do you feel?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I played really well today.  Came up a little bit short.  No regrets, but I did play well.
Q. Just walk us through being put on the clock.  It didn't seem to affect you.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I didn't think we were playing that slow, but when they gave us the word, we played a lot quicker 16 and 17, yeah.
Q. Talk about what you were doing as Brooks was playing the last hole.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: We watched the finish in the clubhouse on TV.  Brooks is a good friend of ours, and happy for him.  Wish him well and congratulate him.  I'll try to beat him the next time.
Q. How did you like Erin Hills as a U.S. Open Championship course?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm glad the fairways were wide, but there were some really difficult holes out there, and I'm glad I played as well as I did.
Q. Should it have another chance at a U.S. Open?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'd be all for it, as long as they keep the fairways wide.
Q. What, if anything, have you learned from this week that you may be able to go one better next time?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: If I learned anything, you've got to put four good rounds together.  I played two good rounds, but it wasn't enough.
Q. We're hearing from the likes of Justin and Tommy Fleetwood and others about Brooks, saying that he's a great player and somebody who was really bound to one day win a major championship.  Do you feel the same way about yourself?  Do you feel the way you've been playing, you're one of the top players in the world?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I learned a lot this week.  Hopefully, though, in the future, in majors, I can play in the either last or next to last group to give myself a better chance.  But I'm happy with the way I played, and it gives me confidence going forward.
