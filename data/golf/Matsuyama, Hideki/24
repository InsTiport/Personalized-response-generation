 Q.  With Hideki and his interpreter, Robert Turner.  Hideki, really great round of golf today.  Six birdies.  Take us through the stretch, starting at the 3rd hole.  You made four in a row, and you made some really long putts.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I struggled with my putting all week.  It was good to make four in a row there.  It lifted my spirits a lot.   
 Q.  What did you think of the course conditions and the setup today for you guys to play, compared to yesterday?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The greens were rolling a little bit slower than yesterday, but they were perfect greens.  I mean, smooth all week.  So no excuses.   
 Q.  And how about the hole locations themselves today?  A little more fair?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, like they're more accessible than yesterday.  Yesterday was tough to even hold the greens.  And then, also, you never know about the wind.  I mean, we got to play early, and if the wind comes up, it could get more difficult.
