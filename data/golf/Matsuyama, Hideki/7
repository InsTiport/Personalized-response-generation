  Q. How would you characterize your round today?
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Great start and then just had to hang on.  Just tried to do what I could to stay in, and I was happy with how it went.
 Q. How difficult were the conditions out there today?
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Different wind today, the wind direction was different, so it played different, but very happy with how I played and how it went.
 Q. It's been a few years since you've won on the PGA TOUR.  What's it going to take for you to jump over that hill and pick up another win tomorrow?
 I played great these three days, so I just need to hit the ball well tomorrow and putt well and see where I'm at.
