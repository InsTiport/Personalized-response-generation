Q. Wonderful second round.  You're in second place now.  Are you pleased with your position?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm happy with the position I'm in heading into the weekend.
Q. You have shot 14-under the last three tournaments here.  Do you think you're going to need more than 14-under to win this week?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I think it will go probably lower than 14-under, so I'm going to have to grind hard and do my best.
Q. I know you have to be disappointed with your bogey on 18 after a very good drive.  Tell me what happened there.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I did.  I hit a good drive there and thought I could go for the pin and came up a little short.
Little disappointing, but I played well all day.
