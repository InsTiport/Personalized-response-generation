Q. History repeats itself here in Scottsdale.  Hideki, once again a winner of four-hole playoff.  How eerily similar was this week to what you did a year ago?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: We went four holes, and it was a struggle all the way around.  The same 17th hole, but the pin position was different from last year.
Q. What were the emotions like?  The chance to win it in regulation, more and more opportunities to finish it off?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I just had faith and believed that my chance would come again, and I just waited and waited, had patience.  Finally that last one went in.
Q. Five wins in your last ten events worldwide.  How good is the golf you're playing right now?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Hopefully I can just keep riding this as long as I can.
