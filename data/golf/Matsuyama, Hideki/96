 Q.   Keys to the round?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   My short game was really good, short iron game.   
   
 Q.   How hard is it to figure out the greens here?   Is that the hardest part to figure out about this golf course?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   The grain, you don't know if it's coming in towards you or going away from you.   So to judge that is probably the hardest.  
   
 Q.   How did you prepare for the week here?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Obviously with the holidays, with the break, I took some time off.   I came and my shot was still okay, so this week, just taking it easy and see where I go.

 Q.   When?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   First time.   
   
 Q.   What are your impressions of this course, first time here?
