A flash interview with:   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA   
THE MODERATOR: A great start to the tournament.  Can we get some comments on your round?   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.) I'm real happy with the start today.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
 Q.  You played very well here, previous two times and again today.  What about this course fits your game so much?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.) That's a good question.  I wish I knew.  But I really enjoy playing here.   
 Q.  What was your reaction on the 16th hole, the fan reaction?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.) You know, I really haven't been hitting it very well recently.  So I was a little nervous on the 16th tee, to be honest with you.   
Really happy I pulled the shot off.
