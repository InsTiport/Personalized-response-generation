 Q. Can you talk about your round?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Made a lot of birdies today. Played well. But that double bogey at the last hole kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.   
   
 Q. Can you give us more details about your birdies?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: At 13 I knocked it on in two and twoâ€‘putted. 14 I hit a good shot in. A six inch birdie.  
   
 Q. What's your expectation for play tomorrow?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Tomorrow I need to make a lot of birdies and very, very few bogeys. And that's my plan.
