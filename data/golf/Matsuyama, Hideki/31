Q. You and Justin Thomas have been at the top of the FedExCup all season, lots of high-quality golf.  What was it like to play that match today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Both of us were out there fighting.  Neither one of us wanted to lose and I'm happy I came out on top and got a point for our team.
Q. Just talk about your play today.  You were 8- or 9-under and just made one bogey today.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's been a long time since I shot a good round like today, and hopefully this will be a steppingstone to better rounds in the near future.
Q. Knowing that the International Team was in a hole to start the day, and yourself and others in front of you were on the leaderboard, did you pay attention to the leaderboard and see some blue scores up there?  Did it give you hope?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, the American Team had a big lead on us.  I wanted to go out third.  I didn't want to lose today.  I didn't want them to win the Cup on my watch.
So yeah, I peeked at the leaderboard from time to time.  We got the point but I don't know how we are going to do on the overall.
Q. Is there any sense of redemption for you beating Justin, given what happened at the PGA Championship?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not sure about that but look forward to battling Justin at more majors in the future.
