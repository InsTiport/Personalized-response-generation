Q. What does it mean to you to win this championship?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It's a great victory for me and hopefully this will be a good victory and a great victory for Japan and encourage others to play golf.
Q. When did you think you had it won?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably at 16 when I hit my second shot on the green, I figured I could get it in from there.
Q. Was that very nice to finish with a par here to know that there was no blemish at the end?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: To play bogey-free today was great for me.
Q. We know your form has been good.  But have you ever played this well so consistently at this level?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Not really.  And especially my putting this week, I mean, I've never probably putted better than I have this week.
Q. What does it do for you -- you're probably going to have to take stock, but in terms of the PGA TOUR, it's a very good start to the season, and World Rankings are wonderful.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm really speechless, but I'm really happy and thrilled that the World Ranking is going to go up.  I know there's a lot of guys, great players ahead of me.  It just gives me more incentive to work harder.
Q. This is good for golf in Japan, as well, isn't it?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Hopefully it is big in Japan, and it will make a difference there.
Q. What are your plans now, how will you celebrate?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It would probably be in the airplane flying back to Tokyo tonight.
