Q. Good way to finish?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, I played well.  I hoped to make a charge earlier but it didn't happen, but I got it around.
Q. Are you disappointed with the second place finish?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, of course.  A little disappointed not winning, but Justin played great and he deserved to win.
Q. Were you looking at the leaderboard out there, seeing what the leaders were doing and what you needed to do?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I was watching the leaderboard but they were just too far ahead of me.
Q. How is the game feeling for you after these four rounds here?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I really didn't hit the ball like I would like to have, but I'm happy with the finish.
