Q. How proud are you to win this singles match for today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  Very, very happy.
Q. And the best part of your game today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  The best part of my game today I didn't make a bogey.  I just kept grinding and grinding and hung in there.
The putt at 16 was huge.
Q. How much pressure did you feel on the last hole, that shot from the fairway?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I was feeling it, and I was just trying to knock it on the green.  I was a little disappointed I came up short.
