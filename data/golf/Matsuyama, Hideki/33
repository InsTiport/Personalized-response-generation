Q. What was it like on the first tee, so many people around, the wind blowing, presidents in your audience; must have been a big challenge?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was.  It was one of the most exciting moments of my life, standing there.  I was looking forward to this Presidents Cup for a very long time, and I didn't expect all the presidents to be there.  Just to get to meet them was a dream come true for me.  You know, then obviously to hit that first tee shot with the wind pumping off the right was quite intimidating.
But I thought I made a pretty good swing.
We made some bad errors during the middle of the round today.
Q. Is this a case of you want it too much for Nick today or just wasn't good chemistry the way you expected?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think it was really tough.  The conditions really wasn't easy.  There was a few key moments where things changed.  One was on the fourth hole.  Their ball, Rickie and Justin's ball pitched about a foot over the bunker.  It looked like we might actually win that hole; end up losing it.
I hit a bad shot on 7 in the water.  And then you give Rickie and Justin, which are both unbelievable players, playing good golf now, you give them just a little bit of momentum, they are hard to catch.
Q. Tough conditions in general.  Rickie made the big chip at 3.  What did that do for momentum?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, we really didn't get into our game today.  Just the rhythm just wasn't there.
Q. Any thoughts why?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm not really sure.  I'm sure Charl and I will talk about it and hopefully we can fix it.
