Q. A strong week.  Are you happy with how your game is right now?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (All answers through translation.)   In the first three days I was able to play good, and at the Hyundai tournament, too, I wasn't able to put a great round together on the last day.  So that's something I've got to become better at.Q. The eagle on the first hole, how exciting was that to hole out from the fairway there?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I had 125 yards to the pin, and it wasn't the greatest of lies but I was able to get it there.  So very happy with the result.Q. What do you think of how the course played this year versus last year with the new design and some of the changes to the greens in particular?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, I really, coming in this week, just looked at it as a different golf course, you know.  I think they made changes to where it's really become more difficult.Q. Is there a hole in particular, anything that surprised you at first that you had to get used to, really?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: 14.Q. 14?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah.Q. Just more difficult?HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The hardest hole on the golf course.
