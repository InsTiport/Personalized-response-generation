Q. Obviously feeling a little ill, so just playing nine today.  You have good memories of this golf course?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You're right, I do, great memories here at Riviera.  Love to play here.  I just hope I'm feeling better tomorrow, so I'll do my best.
Q. First thing is getting healthy.  What will you do this afternoon to rest?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm on medication now and all I can do is rest and drink lots of liquids.  Hopefully I will be better tomorrow.
Q. A victory at Waste Management, didn't celebrate too much last week.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It was an off-week last week for me, so I got my team together and we did celebrate.
Q. And that's not the result of the sickness obviously.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, no, it has nothing to do with the celebration.
Q. This golf course, what do you like about it so much that you've performed well here?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The Riviera Country Club is always in pristine condition.  The greens are very good, very fast, and you have to play well here.  You have to strike the ball well to play well here, and that's one of the reasons I like to play here.
Q. Even though you were feeling a little bad this morning, is there a part of your game that you're really happy with right now, or is everything going well?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'm striking the ball well.  I just really need to get some rest and get healthy so I'm ready to play tomorrow.
