Q. How would you assess your round?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I made some mistakes early but I was able to come back and play good golf towards the end, so it was a good day.
Q. How difficult were the conditions out there?  Did it feel like a U.S. Open a little bit?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Greens were firm and playing really tough.  There's some water holes that you've got to avoid, but all in all, I played good and was able to stay out of trouble.
Q. What was the best part of your game you felt like today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I'm not sure really what I had going today, but that last putt, that long putt that went in, very happy with that one, so we'll remember that one.
Q. Anything that you want to tighten up or improve on for tomorrow and as the week goes on?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I felt like I started playing some good golf last week, so I just want to continue that and be able to just keep playing good for the rest of the week and just play my game.
Q. Was there something specific that clicked last week that got turned around and you started playing a little bit better golf?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   You know, just slowly but surely just understanding where I needed to make some changes and what I wasn't doing right, and so just the process took a while, but just gradually I started to understand and play better, so I'm glad that I played well today, and hopefully I can have confidence in myself to know that I will improve and get better and hopefully it will continue this week.
