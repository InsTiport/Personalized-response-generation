Q. Hideki, that was amazing playing out there. Not a ton of success here in the past. What do you think worked so well for you today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I've been hitting it really well, especially with my irons, and everything has been putting up really well for me, and that actually helped me out a lot.
Q. We know what it's like to watch from outside the ropes when someone is as hot as you were. Inside when you're playing that well, what's it like?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Again, I was hitting it really well, and also my putting, I was putting really well. Unlucky with 7 and 8, but everything else, no mistakes, yeah.
