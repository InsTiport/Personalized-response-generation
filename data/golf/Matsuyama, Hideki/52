Q. Really nice, solid round today.  How would you sum up your performance?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I played well today.  I made a couple birdies early.  Got it going, and I felt good about my round.
Q. Four wins in your last five starts worldwide.  How much confidence do you have heading into tomorrow to pick up yet another win?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You're right, I do have a lot of confidence right now, and confidence going into tomorrow's round.  There's still a few weak links that I need to work on.  Hopefully that won't be a bother tomorrow and we'll play well.
Q. Just real quick, if you can just comment a little bit about Justin Thomas's game, looks like he's leading.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Justin doesn't have any weaknesses at all in his game.  He hits it long, has a marvelous short game, putts well, hits the ball well.  We've got to go low tomorrow to be able to catch him.
Q. Can you talk about how you keep seeing your name on top of these leaderboards all the time; are you getting certain confidence from that?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You're right, it is nice to see my name up there.  But not playing here last year; it's a goal of mine to get back here, and hopefully I can come back here every year.
Q. You talk about weaknesses and things you still have to work on.  How much better can you get?  You're the hottest player in golf right now.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, the weaknesses, they may not be prevalent to people who watch golf but I know what they are, and hopefully I can overcome them.
Q. Can you share some of the things you need to work on, specific?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably short game is one quick answer.
