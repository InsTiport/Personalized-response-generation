A flash interview with:   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA   
 Q.  Comments about your round.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.)  I didn't putt very well today, I didn't drive the ball very well, but I did get it around.  I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  How about the crowds?  Are you able to focus, tune them out?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: (Through translation.) You know, I really didn't give them much to cheer about today, but I was glad I was able to chip in at 14 and give them their money's worth there.   
But I'm just grinding.  You know, I can't think too much about the crowd.
