Q. What changed?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The biggest difference was I putted very well today.
Q. Do you leave happy with the score or disappointed that you couldn't get a couple more in the end?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, I'm very excited and very happy with the score.
Q. Are you happy with your swing today?  A couple times it looked like you weren't happy with the actual swing, but the results seemed good.
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: There were a couple of loose swings out there, but when you shoot 65, you can take those.
Q. Jon Rahm was pretty heated out there today.  Was that distracting at all?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: No, it didn't bother me.  We played together at Memorial the first few days, so I knew he's an emotional player, and sometimes he wears it on his sleeve.  But I was not expecting it, but it wasn't a problem at all.
Q. Hideki, being able to go out and shoot a 65 today, talk about the confidence that that gives you going into tomorrow?  What is your mindset for the weekend?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Shooting a good score today gave me a lot of confidence.  I really haven't been hitting the ball well as of late.  To shoot a good round like today, I'm certainly looking forward to the weekend.
Q. Did you know that 8-under is the lowest score in the U.S. Open ever?  And was it in your mind coming down 18?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I didn't.  I thought 63 was the number I wasn't thinking too much about 8-under.
Q. What was the difference in your putting yesterday?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: After yesterday's round, I received a couple of tips from different people, and it seemed to work well.
Q. What would it mean to you to win a major championship?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I really can't think about it until maybe after I win.  But anytime the Japanese have won a major, it would be great for the Golf World in Japan.
