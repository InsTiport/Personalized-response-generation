Q. How difficult was that today?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It was crazy tough.
Q. How did you shoot what you shot?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The greens were really tough and fast, as you all know, but I was hitting the ball well, hit a lot of greens today and gave myself some birdie chances that I was able to convert.
Q. What has been the key to making putting a strength for you this week?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I wish I knew.  The first two days I used a different putter than I used today.  I went back to the putter I've used for a long time, my ACE putter, but the feeling was a little bit different, but I was able to remember how I did it before and made some putts today.
Q. Why did you decide to change?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The first two days the putter I used, I did make some putts, but I just felt I needed to go back to my ACE putter that I'm familiar with and comfortable with, and things went well.
Q. You were 10 shots back going into the round.  Did you feel like you had a chance?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, at the start of the round, of course I didn't think I had a chance, but all I was trying to do is one shot at a time and get as close to the lead as I could.  As the round went along, I really surprised myself that I am where I'm at.
