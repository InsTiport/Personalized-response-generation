 Q.  There are a lot of young guys on the team. How have you helped?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Obviously with the language barrier, it's tough to kind of help guys, but I do the best I can. Guys like Adam and Marc that's been around that is there to kind of set the tone, so I'm just there to help out with whatever I can.   
 Q.  How is the energy? Are you guys getting along good?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: With Ernie being a captain, you can just feel that energy and everybody getting together. There's that winning feeling's definitely there.   
 Q.  Last time we saw you, you were with Tiger in the final round. Will we see that again on Sunday if you get against Tiger in singles on Sunday?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Of course, we won't know the pairings on Sunday (yet) but hopefully we'll be in it at the end and we'll be right there to try to get the Cup.   
 Q.  Is this team more united than in the past, or is it similar to past teams?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: We've had great chemistry in the past, but I can feel a sense of unity and everybody is kind of coming together. Definitely looking forward to this year's team.
