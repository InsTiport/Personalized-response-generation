Q. What have you learned playing this course that you are able to use now this week? 
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Probably my best memory of Augusta is walking up the 18th fairway on the final day of 2011. That was the first year I played here. It's something I'll never forget. 

Q. 8âunder puts you still in the mix, in competition. What do you feel your chances are? 
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Yeah, today I really didn't play my best golf. I wasn't in control of my game. But hopefully that'll turn around tomorrow and I'll do my best.
