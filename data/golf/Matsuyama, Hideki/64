HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Scoring-wise, it was a really good round.  Playing-wise, maybe not quite as good.   
 Q.  [ No microphone ]?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: My putting and short game saved me today.  I wasn't hitting the ball real crisp.   
 Q.  Would you rather hit the ball crisp or have a good short game?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Both.   
 Q.  Is it hard to keep the ball on the fairway?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: You know, it is, Doug.  From the tee, sometimes the line is difficult to pick up, where the fairway is.  Today I was lucky.  I mis-hit a lot of drivers, but they found the fairway.  So I was fortunate.   
 Q.  Did you come to the tournament thinking about a chance to win a tournament or a chance to win $10 million?  The FedExCup.  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I think all of us, every time we tee it up, we hope or plan to win, especially this week.  If you don't win the TOUR Championship, you don't have a chance to win the FedExCup.   
So we did get off to a good start.  Hopefully, it will keep going.   
 Q.  If you had $10 million, what's the first thing you would buy?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'd put it in savings.   
 Q.  When you took it from savings, what would you buy?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'll take it out of savings, and then it's just fun to think about what I'm going to buy.
