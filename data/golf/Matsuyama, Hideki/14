JOHN DEVER:   Hideki, welcome to the 2020 PGA Championship at TPC Harding Park.
This is your eighth PGA Championship.  Your scoring average in the PGAs is in the 60s, which is really, really rare, and you've never missed the cut.  What is it about a PGA Championship that fits your game and that you like?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I've always enjoyed playing in the PGA Championship.  Thankfully I've played well.  I had a chance to win all Quail Hollow and hopefully I can play good, play my best this week.
JOHN DEVER:   A lot of talk here at Harding Park about the marine layer and how the ball is not traveling as much.  How does that affect you?  Have you worked on adjusting the math in your head when you're out on the golf course?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   You're absolutely right.  It is going to be difficult to judge, not only judge distances, but get the flight of the ball the way we want it this week.  It's probably the coldest PGA Championship we've ever experienced, and it will be difficult.
Q. When you played your very first major up until now, as you look back, have your expectations for your performance changed with each year or as you've gotten older?
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Expectations have changed, yes, over the years.  When I first started until now, especially when you have a chance to win a major and know that you can do it, it does make the expectation or level of play a lot higher, sets the bar higher.
Hopefully this week -- I haven't really been playing well as of late, but hopefully this week, I can turn it around and contend again.
