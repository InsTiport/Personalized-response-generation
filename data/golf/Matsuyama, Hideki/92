 Q.   What are your thoughts on your round today?   You played very well.   
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I really didn't have my best game today, but I made some birdies coming in and it made for a decent day.   
   
 Q.   No. 2 was very impressive.   Can you talk us through that?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   The wind was a little bit against us on the tee shot.   I didn't really get it all.   I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get there or not with my second.   
But I hit a really good 3â€‘wood and knocked it in there about 20 feet or so and knocked it in.   
   
 Q.   Then on 12, did you think your ball was going to go in the water?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   The flight of the ball was good, it was right at the pin, and so I wasn't really worried.   If it was going to be left of the pin, there was a good chance it was going to kick and go down into the water, but I felt confident that it was going to stay up.   I mean, we're just talking, you know, inches to the left and it's in the water, yeah.  
   
 Q.   You weren't worried?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   No.   
   
 Q.   Are you feeling confident for the weekend?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   If I can make some putts, I can maybe make a move up the leaderboard.   But we'll have to wait and see.
