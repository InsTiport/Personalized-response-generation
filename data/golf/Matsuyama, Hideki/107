Q.   Can we get a couple comments about your two days playing with Tiger and how you played today? 
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Well, it was great looking at great play at the top of the world.   This is my rookie year, and I had a great chance to see the world No.1 player, playing together.

Q.   Did you realize that he was 9â€‘under through 13 holes so he had a chance to shoot 59?   Were you aware of that or were you just concentrating on your own game? 
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Well, I knew that he was looking for a very short stroke, like maybe 57 or 56 possibly, but he was not making much putts on the last stretch, so it was a good lesson for me looking at his play, and I really enjoyed playing with him.

Q.   What did you think of the crowds following you guys the last two days? 
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   I enjoyed just playing the final group of the final round.
