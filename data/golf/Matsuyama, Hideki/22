HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I hit a lot of quality shots, especially the front nine, and my iron play was vastly improved compared to the last couple of days.  I struggled a little bit coming in.  Hit some loose shots, but all in all, I'm happy.  Any time you can shoot 6-under here at TPC Sawgrass, it's a good day.
I hit my driver well.  I kept it in the fairway, gave myself a lot of good chances, but again, I need to work a little harder, go to the range after the round now and try to be ready for tomorrow and have a good finish.
