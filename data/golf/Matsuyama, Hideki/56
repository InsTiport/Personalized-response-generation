 Q.  Is there a degree of satisfaction when you've played as well as this?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Satisfied with the round today, yeah, and I'm in a good place, and hopefully we can make a run for a win tomorrow.   
 Q.  To go around, 27 holes now with no bogey on the card, that's lovely golf, isn't it?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: It was okay.  There was some tough holes I think.  But again, hopefully I can keep it up and play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  Does this mean that there's a little irritation, a little annoyance with not getting more out of today?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: The way I played today, four birdies was good.  I'm just glad I didn't make any bogeys.   
 Q.  What is your attitude into a final round when you have a commanding lead?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I have a three-stroke lead but I can't think about that.  There are so many good players behind; I just have to worry about my own game and play one shot at a time.   
 Q.  When you tee it up, do you find yourself that little bit more nervous because it is the lead on a final day in a big championship?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: Nervous, because I'm in the lead, no.  But because I have a chance to win, maybe.  I just have to go out and enjoy the day tomorrow and do my best.   
 Q.  I know this is a question for tomorrow, but have you allowed yourself to think of what it would mean to win a tournament like this?  
HIDEKI MATSUYAMA: I'd like to think about it, but I can't think about it, so we'll just leave it at that.
