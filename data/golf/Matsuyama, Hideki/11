  JOHN DEVER:   Good afternoon.  Welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship here at TPC Harding Park.  Pleased to be joined by Hideki Matsuyama.  Hideki posted a third round 1-under 69.  He is 4-under for the championship.
 Hideki, how was your round today, and do you feel like you are on the fringes of contention here?
 HIDEKI MATSUYAMA:   Birdieing 18 was huge for me.  It still kept me in it.  I didn't play particularly well today, much like the first round.  I didn't really have a lot of good looks for birdies but hung in there, and I'm glad to finish 1-under today.
