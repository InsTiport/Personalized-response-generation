  BEATRIZ RECARI:   When I won, it's only good, positive feelings, you know.   I come back and everybody‑‑ it's kind of dÃ©jÃ  vu.   Everybody is so nice to me.   Like I said, I'm here, and then everything that comes to mind is all the great memories from last year.
Really happy to be back, and I'm playing some good golf.   Had a good finish last week, so feeling good about my game, too, which is very important.   I am very excited about this week, you know, and to have this challenge again.

Q.   Steve Eubanks had a couple questions about International Crown.   How important is it for you to represent Spain and not just Europe?   How different will that be?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   It's slightly different obviously because you're representing more your country, more the people where you come from.   It's a great opportunity to represent your country on a professional level, because we always had national team events every year when we were playing juniors golf. 
This is really the first time we have the chance before the Olympics, so it's a great opportunity to have a feel for it and remember all those great wins when we were amateurs and try to replicate it as a professional. 

Q.   How different is that feeling when it's your home flag as opposed to representing Europe as a whole?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   You know, it's different obviously.   You feel ‑‑ it's not more representation, because it's not the right word.   But it's your country as opposed to your continent.   I guess here in the States it's a little bit different because such a big country.
But in Europe it's a lot of small countries.   Even though we feel as one as a whole, you still grow up independently.   So it's a slight difference, but just as much an honor to be in the Solheim Cup obviously and be in part of the Spanish team.

Q.   What sort of reaction have Europeans given you?   In your home country?   What kind of reaction did you get after Solheim Cup and everything?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Everybody was so pumped up and happy.   Especially for what we accomplished, winning here for the first time.   We had a great team.   We played great as well.   So everybody was like in a bubble, you know, for a long time.
So it was indescribable really.   Still have no words to describe how special it was.

Q.   World Cup year.   Spain didn't have the best World Cup. 
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yeah, skip that.

Q.   Is there any kind of ability to erase that in your mind? 
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yeah, you know, it was painful because football is such a big part of our country.   You know, it was painful to watch, but I guess it was a good moment to maybe clean the squad a little bit and bring some new, younger players.
Obviously the team that won four years ago was an amazing team, but maybe some players‑‑ I don't know, I'm not specialist, but obviously the results aren't there.   They need to do something, figure it out.   I'm sure that we'll come back strong and win it again in four years.

Q.   How much do you think about the Olympics with International Crown?   How good of a preview is this?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   It'll be amazing.   Obviously you'll get a sense of it next week when you put on the uniform and have a sense of it.   You really don't know how much it means to you until you put on that jacket, put on the polo shirt with the flag on it and really see, Okay, this is an amazing thing, and I really want to be part of it in the Olympics in two years' time.

Q.   Obviously Aza is playing great; Belen is playing a lot better recently.   What are the impressions of your team heading into next week?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   I think we have a great chance.   I think our advantage, as I said, is because we played team events when we were juniors every year, so we're used to‑‑ it's not going to be a challenge to remember that feeling and get back as a team because we have all that practice from previous years.
We always come back really strong and always feel like a very strong team.   We support each other.   So I think we're going to do really good. 

Q.   If you had one squad to pick other than ya'll to be worried about in this format?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   I think obviously U.S. is playing great.   Stacy is playing really solid this year. 
And always the Korean team Ry So Yeon, Inbee Park, and Na Yeon Choi, always got to keep them in mind. 
So I think those two would be the two to pay more attention to.

Q.   What are the junior events teaching you as a kid playing as a team?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Well, it's all about team.   You have to think as a team and not just you.   You know, it's such an individual sport, but then you have to think about, Okay, I'm playing my own ball, but I've got to support to my team partner here.
So you obviously, I mean, simple as it is, it teaches you to be more of a team.   We're not used to it on a regular day because it's your game. 
So like I said, I think we're not going to have any issues and we're going to pull it together really well.

Q.   You played well in Solheim Cup.   How can you use that?   What did that teach you?   Why were you able to play so well there?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yeah, that was a great experience.   Definitely going to have to remember all the things I did well in Solheim and all the things that I learned on how to be a better team member.
Yeah, it's going to play to my advantage to have been able to perform at the high level at Solheim and use that experience that I had last year for this year's International Crown.

Q.   Have you driven by your street since you came back?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   I did, I did.   It's really cool. 

Q.   That's pretty unusual for this event, too.   Is that something you think about?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   You know, it's obviously a great bonus not only to get this trophy and everything that comes along, but to get your own street for a year, that's pretty special. 
Yeah, I think Marathon and all the sponsors, O‑I, they do an amazing job and always think of the detail, like the street.   It's the only tournament that does that.   They always make sure that this tournament remains special in different way and that the players feel like they're treated the way they should be treated.
The street just comes to show you that message that they want to send.

Q.   Where is your game going into this?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Like I said, I feel good.   I had a little bit of a slow start first half of the year, but feel like everything is coming along.   Working on things that feel good for me.   I'm healthy and fit.   I had a very good performance last week and very happy with my practicing.   Just want to keep on improving it.

Q.   What do you accredit the slow start to this year?   What have you been working on?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   It's just a matter of injuries and compensations. 

Q.   What were you injured?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Low back and hip.

Q.   100% now? 
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yes. 

Q.   Feeling pretty good vibes coming back to this place? 
BEATRIZ RECARI:   I am feeling very good, yeah.

Q.   Run me through the 25‑footer on 16.   It was obviously big putt last year.
BEATRIZ RECARI:   It was longer than that? 

Q.   Really?   How long was it?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Longer than 25‑footer for sure.   No, I knew that Paula was right there and she pretty much had a tap‑in; pretty much guaranteed birdie.
I didn't want to focus on that.   I just wanted to put a good roll on the ball and give it a chance.   Obviously I read it properly and it went in.   That was a huge moment to keep the momentum going and keep my one‑stroke lead heading towards the 17th tee.

Q.   Lexi made that hole‑in‑one to put a little pressure on you. 
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yes, but it was more down to Paula and me.   On the last five holes, it was just her and me.

Q.   Do you know Mo at all?   What were your impressions of how that ended?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yeah, I played with her on Saturday.   I think she had level par on Sunday.   It was an incredible feat.   The conditions were really tough and really challenging.   I'm really happy for her.   She's a great girl. 
Obviously she proved that she hold under pressure.   Yeah, just really happy for her.   Must have been very special to hold the trophy on Sunday.

Q.   What are the thoughts when she hit the pin on 18?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   I didn't know she hit the pin.   But, you know, you take the bounces when they come to you and take advantage of them.   She did.   I'm just, like I said, really happy for her. 

Q.   Heard anything about Caves Valley for a golf course for the International Crown?   Excited to play that?
BEATRIZ RECARI:   Yes.   I haven't heard much, but I'm really excited.   Everyone is talking so highly about the event, so I can't wait to go experience it.
