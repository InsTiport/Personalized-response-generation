   THE MODERATOR: Beatriz, our third of three tournament leaders. Just talk a little bit about the day today.  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: Well, today I started confident. I finished very strong yesterday. My back nine I had 6-under, shot 6-under, so I felt really good.   
 And my striking was very good. I had birdie chances on the 2nd and made a birdie on the 3rd, and then I had a missed shot on 4, but overall I was feeling very good.   
 So obviously today on a Saturday the pins are going to be more on the corners and you couldn't be so aggressive.   
 So yeah, I just stayed patient and just let it happen and attacked the pin when I could, and yeah, I'm happy with today's round.   
 THE MODERATOR: And now, being the 54-hole leader going into the final group tomorrow with the lead, do you think there will be any nerves there?   
 BEATRIZ RECARI: Well, today I was leading, too, so I mean, yeah, I mean I have to be honest with you. I was kind of keeping an eye on the score and bogey, birdie, you know, how everything was moving.   
 But no, I mean when I started making some putts and just focusing on what I had to do was when I really made the birdies on the back nine. And yeah, I cannot control what other people do. I can only control what I do, and that's going to be my focus tomorrow.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. How proud are you that you were able to get your nerves under control from the beginning? After playing so well yesterday, does that give you a lot of hope for tomorrow?  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: Yeah. Well, it was kind of a dÃ©jÃ  vu for me and last year when I won my first victory in the European Tour in Finland, the year before I was leading after two rounds -- after one round and then I kind of got very nervous on the second, and I blew it up a little bit, and that was my learning process for last year. And even though it was in the last round, because I had a five-shot lead, I still struggled a little bit and I won in the playoff.   
 But you know, you have to take everything as a learning process, and I definitely learned a lot from my losses, from my victory last year. And today I think I just had to focus on what I did last year and said, okay, I'll just keep it simple.   
 And today the pins were not so tempting to go for because, you know, the punishment was going to be big, and I just did that.   
 And yeah, I think, you know, there is no problem with making mistakes as long as you learn from them and you don't repeat them.   
  
  Q. Do you know either of the other players who you'll probably be playing with tomorrow, Ilhee Lee or --  
BEATRIZ RECARI: Michele?   
  
  Q. Michele, yeah. Do you know either one of them?  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: I don't know Michele personally, but I played with Ilhee in first stage of Q-School last year, and she's a rookie like me, so yeah, you know.   
 When you're out there, you cannot -- each one of us is doing our own and just focusing on our play. So yeah, I've never played with Michele. She looks very nice, so I think it's going to be a very nice group.  
  
  Q. Ilhee said that these courses remind her of back home in that a lot of the Korean courses are hilly and kind of -- the course just lays out similar. Why do you think you've taken so well to this course?  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: This course, it fits my game because the greens are not very big and they're very shapey, and you know, you can really make it very tough out there, depending on where you put the pins, like today.   
 And that's something that really suits my game because my home course was kind of similar layout with small greens and very strategic from the tee and onto the green. And I have to say last year, the tournament I won was very similar to this.   
 So it just brings me good memories, and it's kind of like home soil for me or known territory, however you want to call it. But yeah, just gives me a good feeling. I've been playing good. I played very well last week. I did very good training during the last three weeks off. So feeling confident.   
  
  Q. What was the hole you were proudest of out there today, you felt like maybe you played really well or maybe you got out of trouble and made a save? Was there one hole that sticks out for you today?  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: I just -- I think what I take from today is that I hang out there, I hang out there. And yes, I made my mistakes. You know, I was probably too eager on going for the pins, and there was a couple of holes that I shouldn't have done that. But anyway, I cannot do anything about it now.   
 And yes, I made a couple of good saves. I made a save on 18, good save on 15, bunker save on 10 as well. And then I holed good putts, but as I said, you know, today was a day to be calm and not make stupid mistakes because then you're going to pay it on the leaderboard, and that's what I did and I'm very happy with it.   
 THE MODERATOR: Okay? Thank you.  
 BEATRIZ RECARI: Thank you.
