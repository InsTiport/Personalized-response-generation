Q. You're coming in playing just phenomenal golf.  Just talk about your mindset, how you feel over the ball right now.
RACHEL KUEHN:   Yeah, I feel in control over the golf ball.  It's nice to kind of stand out there and have some sort of idea of where the ball is going.  It's just a confidence thing, and I'm putting pretty well right now.  I've been glad to be able to put myself in position to make some birdies and then being able to convert some of those.  I just feel comfortable over the golf ball, which is refreshing.
Q. Your first Women's Am.  What have you heard from others?  How did you prepare?  It's a long week.
RACHEL KUEHN:   Yeah, it's a long week.  Any USGA championship is.  You kind of have to have that in the back of your mind as you're preparing for it, sleeping well the week leading up to it and all that, and the course is obviously so nice, and you kind of hear any USGA course is amazing, but it's playing long, but I've heard great things about the Am and can back those up with my experience so far.
Q. How does this course suit your game?  You obviously played well today.
RACHEL KUEHN:   Yeah, I'm hitting the ball really well, so I've been able to hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens and have a lot of putts.  My older brother Corey is on the bag, and we read the putts right today and happened to make some birdies particularly on the front nine, but it definitely sets up well for my eye, and I'm hitting it pretty consistently right now.
