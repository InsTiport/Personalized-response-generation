  Q. How were conditions this morning?  
 BOB DARLING: Chilly, to say the least. It was cold out. And it was drizzly. So rain jackets, long sleeved shirts, hats. It was tough.   
  
  Q. How do you feel like your round went overall?  
 BOB DARLING: I'm disappointed shooting in the '80's. I don't shoot in the '80's too often. But this is a little different venue than what I'm used to. I'm not disappointed. Tomorrow is another day.  
  
  Q. What are you going to look for going into tomorrow?  
 BOB DARLING: Try not to hit it in the rough.
