 Q.  With this championship now being canceled, the Masters being postponed, what is your take of everything that's happening?  
KEVIN NA: You know, it still hasn't sunk in yet. I know when we were playing this week, we saw every other organization, sports organization, suspending their season, we knew that we weren't going to play much longer. We thought maybe we could finish this week, but I think they made the right call. I think everybody's health is more important than just one event. I know this is THE PLAYERS and it's a big deal, but I think they made the right call.   
 Q.  They said the Masters will not be canceled but postponed, so it could happen again. What does this do for your schedule and your timing over the next month or two?  
KEVIN NA: Well, we just cleaned out my locker, and Kenny is going through my bag -- ooh, I forgot there's a banana in there. If he hadn't pulled that banana out, that banana would have been in there for a long time because I'm not going to touch a club for a couple weeks. 10 years ago I'd have probably been out there hitting balls the next day. When you've got a family with two kids -- time will go by, and this is the time where you can spend time with the family and kind of look around and tell your loved ones you love them. The world is not coming to an end, but it's a little reality check. Golf is not that big of a deal when you look around at what's going on in the world. I know Masters is being postponed. I think they're doing the right thing, and I look forward to hopefully playing the Masters later this year.
