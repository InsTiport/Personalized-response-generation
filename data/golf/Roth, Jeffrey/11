 Q. How did it go today?
 JEFFREY ROTH: I bogeyed the last six holes. It was tough. 

 Q. Challenging?
 JEFFREY ROTH: Yeah.

 Q. The weather conditions a factor at all? The wind?
 JEFFREY ROTH: No, no, I just didn't hit good shots. Didn't drive it particularly well and just lost a little focus and it's easy to make bogeys. 

 Q. Yeah. Tough course, playing tough. 
 JEFFREY ROTH: Yeah. Playing tough. Playing tough. 

 Q. We'll get the sun out for you tomorrow, okay?
 JEFFREY ROTH: Yeah, I hope so.
