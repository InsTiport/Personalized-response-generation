 Q. Last year was your first time competing and this is the weekend that you made the cut. How was the experience overall?
 JEFF ROTH: It was great. It was great. I had Jeffrey on the bag early in the week and then Justin came in and he took the weekend and.

 Q. Is that your son?
 JEFF ROTH: Both my boys, yeah. So both of them on the bag. And the wife came down from Michigan. So it was a lot of fun. 

 Q. What were your goals for the week?
 JEFF ROTH: Well, the first one was to make the cut, obviously. And then once I made the cut it was just shoot a couple rounds in the 60s, which I did yesterday and I just got off to a rough start today and played real solid though on the back side shooting 1-under. And so, you know, salvaged something out of it.

 Q. What do you take away from this experience going back home and going back to the people that you work with and teach?
 JEFF ROTH: Well again I'm playing full-time, so now it's back to the grind of Monday qualifying, which, playing in a tournament, it's like day and night. Monday is all about those four hours and tournament's all about the kind of pacing yourself and not making mistakes and then taking advantage of where you're hitting good shots. 
 So it's like two totally different animals. So now it's back to the Monday grind and the sprinting and the not making mistakes and the playing defensive and just kind of grinding it out.
