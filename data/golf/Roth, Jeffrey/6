 Q. You're not going to probably make the cut, unfortunately, but you played real well today. Talk about your overall experience. 
 JEFF ROTH: Great experience. The golf course is a big golf course and I just wasn't able it handle the conditions. 

 Q. But today you came out and played pretty well. 
 JEFF ROTH: I played better. I had it, I got it to 4-over and then made, I guess, three bogeys coming in. So kind of disappointed.
