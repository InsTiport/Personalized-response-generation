 Q. You're one of our club pros whose done very well. You're at, your kind of at 7-over right now. 
 JEFF ROTH: I'm teetering.

 Q. You're teetering. 
 JEFF ROTH: Yeah. 

 Q. This is only your second Senior PGA Championship event. What are your thoughts right now possibly going into the weekend?
 JEFF ROTH: Well, I would like to make the weekend. I've never, I played in what's, five PGAs and two PGA Seniors and I never made the cut. So it would be nice to make the cut. You don't get, I think it gets me into the Senior Club Pro, making the cut, so there's some perks that go along with it. And I got to pay my sponsors back somehow. 

 Q. Did you make any changes today compared to yesterday? The greens feel a little different?
 JEFF ROTH: Not really. My game plan was to just drive the ball in the fairway and keep the ball below the hole and not make any real stupid mistakes. 
 And yesterday I did make a couple stupid mistakes. Today I made a few glitches too, but I played a really strong back nine and made a couple birdies and then a bogey on the 18th hole. 

 Q. How do you stay focused if you're going into, you're going to be playing tomorrow morning?
 JEFF ROTH: Well, it will be easy to stay focused tomorrow morning. It will be a real bummer if I'm not playing tomorrow morning. So I'm kind of keeping my fingers crossed.
