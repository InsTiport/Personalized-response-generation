 Q. Talk about that monster, 16, what did that do for you? You parred that one. 
 JEFF ROTH: I parred that one. I hit a couple nice shots down there about 50 yards from the hole, actually, and had a short putt for a birdie, maybe six, eight feet and didn't make it. I got by it all right. 

 Q. Did the course play the way you expected?
 JEFF ROTH: Yeah, it played just perfect. The fairways are nice and fast and firm and the greens are firm and difficult. You just have to make sure you stay below the hole and stay on the right side of the hole.

 Q. You got a birdie on 3?
 JEFF ROTH: Birdie on 3? Yeah. Yeah, I made a nice putt there. I was kind of back deep behind the pin to the left a little bit and I was along the ridge and I got the speed down real good and it kind of turned to the right and then it stayed straight and went right in the middle of the hole.

 Q. What did you think of the back to back par-5s?
 JEFF ROTH: That's unique. We don't get a chance to do that very often. And I botched the first one up, hit a bad drive and just kind of chopped my way up the hole and made bogey.
