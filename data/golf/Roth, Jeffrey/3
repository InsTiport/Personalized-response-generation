 Q. Can you tell me about your week? 
 JEFF ROTH: Oh, it was a great week. Just kind of spoiled it on the back nine, made that great putt on 13 for birdie and then I relayed a little bit. Kind of chopped up the next hole, made a double bogey and that kind of took the wind out of the sails a little bit. 
 No. 16 and 17 are just darn tough holes. Not the kind of golf holes that I like to play, and I didn't manage them very well and made pars. And I missed a short birdie putt. It was a little bit of a sour ending. 
 But it was a great week. I played some really good golf. I really liked the golf course. It was set-up great, and I enjoyed my week.

 Q. Is it nice having a lot of friends and family from Michigan coming down here to support you? 
 JEFF ROTH: Yeah, it was ray great, really great. I kind of communicated with everybody before I came up, and it was nice to see people come out and text me and call me and wish me good luck. It was all good.
