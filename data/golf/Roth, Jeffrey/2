 Q.   Tell me about how the course played today.   
JEFF ROTH:   Well, it actually played very fair.   There was some pretty good pins.   If they're on the greens, they're probably pretty good, you know.   
I had a couple of funny putts, but for the most part it was pretty straightforward right in front of you.   
The course probably played harder Monday when it was cold and windy and we were just trying to learn it.   But it played a little faster, it will continue I think to play a little bit faster and it played very fair.   
   
 Q.   What makes the wind so much different than it would be at other courses?  
JEFF ROTH:   It's a thicker wind.   I'm out in New Mexico and this is, this is nothing, this is just a breeze.   But it's a thicker wind here.   It's a more humid wind and the ball just doesn't go through the wind as clean as it does in arid parts of the country, like where I'm from.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to work on for tomorrow after your round today?  
JEFF ROTH:   A little bit of everything.   It just wasn't a very good round.   It could have been a good round early in the round, didn't make some putts that could have fallen.   My only birdie came from like a foot.   And then I finished poorly, made a couple bogeys on the last two holes coming in.   That was kind of a sour way to end the round.
