 Q.   The putter, 12, one putt greens.   Is this the best putting round you've had in a long time?  
FABIAN GOMEZ:   I play well.   The birdie chance, some of them were really close, but even that I made a great putt at No. 15, and, you know, I feeling well.   The weather is nice for me, not so hot, and we'll see tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   12, one putt greens, 23 total.   That's a pretty good number?   You mentioned the fact you have been working hard on your game, really practicing.   Obviously you feel like that's paying off.

 Q.   What has been working well for you?  
FABIAN GOMEZ:   I've been playing well with the driver, and this course is so much important to reach the fairway to have the ball in the middle.   And also I've been playing really well on the green with my putter, and that's the way that we try tomorrow, you know, keep the same game plan.
