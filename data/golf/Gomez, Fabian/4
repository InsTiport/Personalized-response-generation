Q. Great playing.  You're obviously in a good position through three rounds.  Talk about your day today.
FABIAN GOMEZ: Really good putting today.  Felt really good when I putted.  On hole No. 6 I sunk one from the bunker, so I felt really good about that.
Q. What's your goal tomorrow?  Do you have a score in mind, or is it just go out and make as many birdies as you can?
FABIAN GOMEZ: I'm just going to go out there and make as many birdies as I can to get the lead.
Q. Is there something about the golf course that you like in particular?  Obviously you're playing well.
FABIAN GOMEZ: You've got to hit it straight, so that's what I'm doing, and the putter, I'm doing really well with the putter, so that's what I like about the golf course.
