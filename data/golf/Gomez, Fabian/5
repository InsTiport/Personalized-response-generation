 Q.  First off, your driving, you're No. 1 in the field in driving accuracy.  I know you turned something around in Memphis, but you're playing awfully well and hitting it awfully well here.  
FABIAN GOMEZ: Yeah, I've been working really hard with the driver in the last month.  When I'm on the tee I have a lot of confidence about it.   
 Q.  Approach shots pretty good, too, you have not missed a green in two days, 36 for 36, it doesn't get any better than that.  
FABIAN GOMEZ: It's a kind of course that the greens are a good size and usually you don't have to use a really long iron.  It's the kind of course that with the second shot, some holes, many holes you have short irons and there's not a lot of wind today.   
 Q.  Can you win for the second time on the PGA TOUR this weekend?  
FABIAN GOMEZ: Yeah, I've been working on that and I have a lot of confidence.  If I keep playing this week on the weekend, I know that I have a chance.
