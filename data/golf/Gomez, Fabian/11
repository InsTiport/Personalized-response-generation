Q.   Fabian, first of all, your thoughts of anguish with the title slipping away right at the end. 
FABIAN GOMEZ:   It's okay.   I was doing well, really close to finishing first.   On that final hole I hit a good drive off the tee, but followed that with a poor 3‑iron and it cost me big.   I had a very bad lie there and it was a difficult shot, and I was unable to pull it off. 
But that's golf.   You never know what may happen.   I had to make birdie for sure at the last because I knew he was going to make birdie as well.   I only needed to hit the middle of the fairway with that 3‑iron and I would be safe.   But it was enough club, but I hit it poorly. 

Q.   What was the big factor?   Did something change in your game today?   Was there too much pressure?
FABIAN GOMEZ:   Yeah.   A little bit of pressure.   In addition to that the pin positions were a little tougher, so it was harder.   Everything plays on a windy course, and I didn't play the putter well.

Q.   Finally, your thoughts on your best finish on TOUR, tied for second. 
FABIAN GOMEZ:   Yeah.   A runner‑up finish counts, but obviously I wanted to win.   I was pointing at that.   It was not possible this time, but I will keep working towards that first career win on TOUR.   Next time I get in this position it will be different for sure.
