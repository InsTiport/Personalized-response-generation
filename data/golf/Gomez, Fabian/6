Q. After a nice start today, just overall thoughts on your round.
FABIAN GOMEZ: Yeah, I started the round really focused.  The first holes I played really focused.  And it was a nice move that I could make the first five holes.  I made four birdies in the first five holes.
Q. The course is playing a little softer, had a little bit of rain, has it changed from the practice rounds to today?
FABIAN GOMEZ: Yeah, it's playing a little soft, in that way.  Some specific shots you can play a little easier than during the practice round.  A day like today when you know that the wind is not playing so hard, it's a day that you are trying to make a good round.
