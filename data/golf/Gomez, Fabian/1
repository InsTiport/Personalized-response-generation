Q. Fabian, a great bogey-free round today.  What went well for you out there?
FABIAN GOMEZ:   The putter the first two days wasn't that hot like today, but today before the round I felt something on the putter, so I got a lot of confidence, so I putted really well today.  So happy how I putted.
Q. How often were you looking at the leaderboard out there?  Did you know where you stood the whole time?
FABIAN GOMEZ:   Yes, I watched it starting the 14th, and I was sure where I stood, and I wanted to keep making birdies, so I was looking very carefully all day long at the leaderboard.
Q. You're currently projected to finish inside the 125.  How important is that to you as we get closer to the Playoffs this year?
FABIAN GOMEZ:   Yeah, my work paid off.  Yeah, I worked hard with this time off, so I'm happy that I'm in the Top 125.
Q. It sounds like you're going to stick around.  We don't know what's going to happen.  How are you going to prepare over the next hour or so?
FABIAN GOMEZ:   Actually I'm going to wait and maybe hit some balls and watch a little TV and wait to see what happens.
