   FABIAN GOMEZ: I think I was putting great. I found something yesterday. I made five birdies in a row on the back nine yesterday and I found something there. 
 Today, I like to play with the wind so this fits my game. The putts kept on coming. I made a lot. I made a huge putt on 12 from like 80 feet more or less for par. That gave me a lot of confidence. After that, that gave me a lot of confidence with my putt.

 Q. You said you like playing in the wind. What does that mean? You don't meet many people out here on the golf course that say they like playing in the wind. 
 FABIAN GOMEZ: Last year I won on the Nationwide near here in Louisiana. The final round was more wind than today and I shot 6-under on that day. So I don't know, something. The wind helps with good luck.

 Q. Game plan for tomorrow? Just keep doing the same thing you're doing? 
 FABIAN GOMEZ: No change. The wind keeps blowing tomorrow and just trying to make those putts.
