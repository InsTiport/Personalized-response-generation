ANDY SULLIVAN: You feel the good vibes already, just getting here on the Monday and being in the team room with the boys.  The banter was flowing around early doors and Captain Clarke has been absolutely fantastic, as well.  It's pretty special to be a part of it and just can't wait for it to get going now.  I think it's going to be a highly competitive match and good fun, as well.
Q. I guess not that long since you've been part of it on the Amateur levels, but good as a pro to be part of a team again?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, it's great, you get to the top of the amateur game and you get to represent your nation and your country.  For me to be representing my continent is absolutely incredible.  Four years in and being able to represent Europe in a team event for me is incredible.
Just looking forward to it, and like I said, the guys we have got out here, are a very strong team.  A bit inexperienced team but looking forward to the future.  These guys can play a lot of Ryder Cups ahead of them.
Q. And in your mind for this year definitely?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Trying not to think about it too much.  I know if I go out there and take care of my golf, that gives me a chance of doing it.  I know this week gives me a good insight of what it's going to be like and I think it gives Captain Clarke a good insight of what I'm going to be like; not really on the course, but I think off the course, I think he wants to see how we all handle the team environment.  So it's good to show him what we've got.
