  ANDY SULLIVAN: Got off to a great start there, 3-under through 10 and was flying, and then just turning back into that wind, them last few holes there were playing so treacherous, and it was so cold towards the end there.  I couldn't feel my hands coming down 17 or 18.  Hopefully the weather is nice in the morning, gives me a chance to have a good at it tomorrow morning.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANDY SULLIVAN: You never know.  It's links golf.  Most years it gets played there's always a good side and a bad side to be on, so hopefully we'll see tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll get my chance to play in some good weather, but if not just have to grind around there and find a way of making a score.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I've got a lot of guys come from Nuneaton.  My mom and dad are out there, as well.  A lot of people cheering for me out there which is nice when you hole some putts.  Keeps you going when things were going the wrong way today.  It was nice they were cheering for me and getting me up for it.   Q.  So now, going into tomorrow --  ANDY SULLIVAN: Happy, you know.  I played a lot of good golf out there today.  It was just really tough coming in.  I was going to drop one, maybe two on the back nine.  Disappointed to miss the short one at the last, but I'm quite happy with level par the way it's played.
