Q. What's the verdict on what appears to be a top five finish?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Obviously initial reaction is disappointment.  Obviously with two to go, obviously if I could squeeze a couple of birdies out, maybe I have a chance.
The way I've played for 72 holes this week, it stands up my team around me has said a good week's coming along, so I'm glad they kept the faith in me.  It's nearby.  Again hopefully next week, it will be a couple better.
Q. 18th kisses you one day, kicks you the next. It's that kind of course, isn't it.
ANDY SULLIVAN: I think it's evened itself out somehow over the week, but it's one of them things.  It's a really tough hole and finding yourself getting out of position, it can really come and bite you and it bit me today, one of them things.
So many positives to take from the week.  Top-25 sort of last three tournaments, so to have a sniff coming down the last sort of stretch there, it was nice to get back into that feeling again.
Q. With everything that's involved with the French Open, the prestige, the money, the points, all is pretty good.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  I think again, sitting back and reflecting, I've really put myself forward in a good position for Ryder Cup again.  I've tallied some good points up there.  I know I still have to go forward and play well in the next few events.  Like I said, a lot of positives to take out of the week.  Just a little bit of a disappointing finish.
