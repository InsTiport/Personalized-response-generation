 Q.  I didn't see any of the match.  Obviously you must have played well?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I played really solid.  I got a foothold in the game and then managed to chip in from the 8th, which is really a birdie.  So I felt like I really had a strong hold in the game.  And Bernie came back at me through the middle part, chipped in for eagle and that birdie on 13 to get it back to two.  Pars are pretty good out here in this weather.   
I think the course has settled pretty well for our type of game.  It's not going to be thousands of birdies and stuff.  I'm playing pretty solid and looking forward to the next few days.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you about the course.  It's new to everybody.  It has some quirks to it, but obviously you kind of took advantage of it today?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, again, I think the value of par around here is maximum.  There's going to be a lot of holes under par, and I think you'll see a lot of three-putts.  You get on the wrong side of the hole it's easy to leave it short.  Pace on the greens is going to be massive.   
But I think sometimes it might seem to the tele and to the spectators the middle of the green is a boring shot, but it's a really good shot out here sometimes, especially in match play in a situation where you just keep putting the pressure on him.   
Really happy with today, I felt like I handled everything burn I handed me pretty well and happy to be going into tomorrow playing well.   
 Q.  You have a little jolt of confidence heading for tomorrow?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I played really solid out there.  And again, Bernie, there's not much you can do about birdie and eagle.  As much as it felt like I let my foot off the gas, I think it speaks for itself.  Looking forward to my game tomorrow and trying to get ahead in that one.
