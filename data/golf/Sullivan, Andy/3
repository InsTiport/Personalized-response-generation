Q. Round of 4-under par to start. How pleased are you with that?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Very happy. I was playing well going into Dubai, a little bit of a blip last week. Nice to re-carry on that form again. Nice to get out there with no wind today. You feel like you could take dead aim from the fairway and felt like it was gettable out there today.
Q. How much grief have you received for the slight incorrect adding up of the scorecard last week?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, it's been good fun, a little banter with the boys. Been sending me pictures of calculators and Abacuses and all sorts. It was a double, triple-check today. Hopefully it's all right and I don't get a ref coming to me.
Q. You have great experience out here on Tour. Last week we saw a very different looking Emirates Golf Club; the Tour citing that players want to see stiffer challenges on the Tour. Where was that last week, did they get it right, and what do the players really want from your point of view?
ANDY SULLIVAN: You know, it's such a fine line. You know, I think if the wind died down a little bit last week, it's a completely fair golf course, and with just a little bit too much wind there and the rough was a bit too much. This week, you know, I think the rough, it's more penal enough that you lose control of the ball and it's tough to make to get it close and on the green. Last week it was just -- you're just struggling to reach the green from the rough.
It's a fine line I think, and at the end of the day, I feel like the more they put a premium on a fairway and making birdies from the fairway, the best golfers in the world will prevail. For me, that's what you want to be, and if you're not one of them, just get better and play better. That's the way you've got to look at it.
I quite like it not being a putting comp every week.
