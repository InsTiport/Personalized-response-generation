  Q. 68, tie for third, how happy are you with today's performance?
 ANDY SULLIVAN:   I felt early doors, could have got a bit more out of it and then at the end, wind got up and wasn't swinging as great towards the end.  Great to finish with a couple birdies at the end.
 Q. You mentioned in the European Tour player's blog you were anxious to get your ranking up.  How aware are you of that?
 ANDY SULLIVAN:   Yeah, made aware of it, but I can't control any of that.  Play golf and that's all I can try to do this week is get back to my processes which have worked so well for me.
 Q. You won for the fourth time on The European Tour tour.  How much would it mean to get No. 5 this week in Saudi International?
 ANDY SULLIVAN:   Yeah, winning in this field would be awesome.
