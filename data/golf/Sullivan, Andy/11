 Q.  Final round of 67 for you today.  Just fell a little bit short in terms of winning the tournament, but overall, you must be very pleased with your final day here?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, considering Monday wasn't thinking about playing for the birth of my son, and to be here and actually come out here and perform has been really good.   
Yeah, you know, just didn't really get going on that front nine to get close enough but all in all a good week and going back to my little boy.   
 Q.  Quite a slow start in a way, when you know there were low scores out there, does that make it a little more frustrating?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I just tried to stay patient and just thought, you know, the back nine, you can score on the par 5s with birdies or eagle.  I thought if I can try to hold in there and get one or two, just never really happened for me.  I had a little spurt in the back nine but that bogey put the stoppers on it.  Another consistent week in the Top-10, all trending in the right direction.   
 Q.  Rolex Series and Ryder Cup year, you're moving in the right direction.  You must feel the form is getting back to near your best now?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, definitely.  I just have to keep churning out these performances and try to get up there as much as I can and give Thomas something to think about come August, September-time.  All I can do is keep trying to get myself in position to win and hopefully I'll get across the line eventually.   
 Q.  Expecting a few sleepless nights now?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: No, I've had a good week of sleeping, so I'm ready for it.
