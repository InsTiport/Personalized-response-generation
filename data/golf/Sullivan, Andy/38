 Q.  A round of 70 compared to yesterday's 69.  How could you sum this one up?  
 ANDY SULLIVAN  I struggled with the blade last week in Germany.  And when I seen Phil Kenyon earlier this week, I felt really good on the greens and really started to roll the putter a lot better this week.  I think I rolled six or seven putts over 20 feet, so it's nice to see the ball going in from a distance, as well, and that's just made the difference, really.   
 Thought I played some really good golf last couple of weeks.  I think it's just sort of topping off now with the ball going in the hole, as well.   
 Q.  You're in the last qualifying spot for The Ryder Cup; playing with Mr. Harrington, can't put it in the back of your mind, can you?  
 ANDY SULLIVAN  I don't know exactly where I am.  If I go out there and play good golf, I know if I go out there and do what I'm doing at the moment, it will take care of itself, sort of thing.  I feel like I'm playing some really good golf and like I'm nearly going back to my best like I did last year.  Hopefully continue on to next week and really cement my place on the team.   
 Q.  Your last three finishes have been in the Top-25; you just feel like it's the putting that's missing and that can push you towards a victory?  
 ANDY SULLIVAN  yeah, definitely.  I feel like momentum putts, sort of 15 feet, feel like I've really been better this week.  Haven't had too many of them but when I have had them, I've holed them.  Just going forward, momentum feels like it's a lot better.  Last week in Germany felt like I played really, really well but again, the putter was a little cold.  Hopefully carry on in this vein.
