 Q.   What's next   after ‑‑  
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Go back to the hotel and sleep.   Just no respite out there.   Every hole you can make a slip‑up on.   Just had to be on the whole way around I think.  
   
 Q.   This wind is strong regardless but presumably if these gusts are up to 40 miles an hour‑‑  
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Like I say, you just have to hit perfect golf shots‑‑ just happy the way I finished, finished the last three rounds really.  
   
 Q.   Is there extra satisfaction with the final round score and your overall score, because it's a nice position.   
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Definitely, I've not played well on links courses in the past, so to putt a performance in puts me in good stead for sort of The Scottish Open and the Open.   I'm looking forward to going to them now whereas before I was a little dreading them.   Just really pleased how I've handled it this week and just mentally strong out there this week.   
   
 Q.   Have you been dining out on the albatross of day two?   
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Unbelievable, such a weird feeling.   When I hit it‑‑ it's a golf shot, no matter where it finishes but next thing, there's a massive roar.   Yeah, it's an unbelievable feeling.   Almost as good as a hole‑in‑one.   It's fantastic.   
   
 Q.   Presumably every time you're out over a meal, you're going through it a few times?   
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Yeah, I seem to keep making a habit of making these shots, so it's a nice thing to have in the locker.   It's always a good talking point over dinner, like you say.
