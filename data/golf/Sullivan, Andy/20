Q. Thoughts overall?
ANDY SULLIVAN: I scored better on the par 5s today, so I suppose that was a positive.  Just tried to force it a little bit a couple of times with putts and ended up 3-putting.  On the whole, pretty happy with 2-under.  Not quite as sharp as the first two days.  Hopefully go out there tomorrow and find some fire works and get up the leaderboard early.
Q. An eventful finish for you.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, it was a bit up-and-down towards the end.  17, hit a good shot in there and I had a good chance and then just forced it like six feet by and missed one coming back.  Frustrating in that respect, where I've chances and 3-putted them.  But five behind the lead, still sitting there.  So anything can happen tomorrow, and try and chase him down.
Q. A little bit disappointing.  But you're in strong position now going into tomorrow.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  Starting the season, there's always going to be a little bit of rust there.  But just more mental errors than anything else more than swing errors.  I feel like I'm in a good place and it bodes well for the rest of the year and then tomorrow hopefully.
