Q. Very well played.  You were put out early against a tough competitor and he was up early on.  Tough matched but you finished it brilliantly?
ANDY SULLIVAN: I felt like I had pretty much control of the match halfway around.  The up-and-down on 9 gave me momentum to kick on and birdies on 10 and 11 helped me do that.  Always knew it was going to be a tough match playing Thongchai, so good tee-to-green and he's not going to give you that many holes, so you're going to have to take them from him.
Really pleased with the victory and the week and hopefully the lads can keep going the way we're going and be a handsome score line.
Q. Nice start to the year.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  It's been absolutely fantastic week.  The whole team has been unbelievable in the team room.  Clarkey has been immense, not left a stone unturned.  The way we have gone out and done things, it shows how much we want to be in that Ryder Cup Team and how much we want to lift that EurAsia Cup.
Q. Ryder Cup next?
ANDY SULLIVAN: You never know.   I have to go out and still play really well this week.  For me, it's just more doing what I've done today out on the golf course.
