ANDY SULLIVAN: I just couldn't get anything to drop.  I felt like I gave myself a lot of chances all day.  You know, massively proud.
Q. Was it tense?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Not tense, I don't know if I was just getting frustrated more than anything else.  I was giving myself a lot of chances and not taking them, so I think that was the frustrating thing about it.
Q. As a whole, a lot of positives to take out of this week?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  I felt like my game's been coming on for quite a while now, and need to get myself on the right side of the leaderboard.  A positive going into The Final Series, and if I keep playing like that, hopefully I can pull one off.
