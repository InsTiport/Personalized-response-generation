Q. Give us your reflections on 70, please.
ANDY SULLIVAN: I'm just extremely happy with anything under par today.  It's a fantastic score.
I played really well again today but out there with the wind, we're giving it sort of a couple balls outside right and with the wind it was almost four.  It's tough out there, making calculated decision how much the wind is going to blow.
Q. Tee shot on 8; tell us how you go about figuring where to land the ball on these greens.
ANDY SULLIVAN: We had 199 pin, just try to pitch it short and hope it takes a nice little bounce in there which it did.  Pitched it exactly where I wanted to -- just contours of the green there.  Again, links golf, there's always an element of luck.  You're always trying to make that calculated decision where you want to land it.
Q. You clearly played very well in France last week and you were disappointed obviously to make 7 at the last hole to go from second to fifth place, but now you look back, you just take the positives.
ANDY SULLIVAN: There's 71 holes of that golf tournament I played great, so I'm not going to let one golf hole affect me.
Hopefully the wind stays and makes it more testing out there and the putter keeps working and everything feels good in my game.
