 Q.  Nicely placed into the final day?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Obviously just massively happy.  The start of the day I'm thinking we've got to go really low because it was so flat calm and the weather was perfect.  Trying to chase it down a little too much on the front nine.  The weather got for poor and I found myself thinking pars are pretty good on the way in.  Overall pretty happy and I don't think the scoring is going to get too far away.  So hopefully be within a couple going at it tomorrow.   
 Q.  Spectacular front nine with the two eagles.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, pretty special to hit the shots I did into 3, and holed the bunker shot on 6, that's pretty special.  I'm playing some really good golf at the moment, and I think just that little bit of luck on the way is going to hopefully help me see it through tomorrow and get my nose in front.  But I know I'm doing all the right things.  Just got to go out there and continue doing it.   
 Q.  When the rain swept in, was it a case of just being unpleasant or did it really affect the way you're playing?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: You know, obviously I felt like I was swinging it really well, and you get out there, you're just trying to hold on.  It's tough out there.  When it's flat calm, it plays so easy out there.  But then when the wind comes and there's a bit of rain, it changes so quickly.   
It would be nice to find a happy medium tomorrow maybe.  But you know, on the end there, just happy to get in with what I had really.   
 Q.  Probably means we can't second guess what's going to go on tomorrow, can we, weather-wise, it could be anything?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: We're so north, anything could happen.  It could blow in quickly, looks like it's going to be a nice day and suddenly it's hammering down.  It can be unpredictable.
