 Q.  You did everything but how close you got was amazing.  How tough was it to play against a guy like that?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Incredibly tough.  I gave it everything on that front nine.  Birdied a lot of holes and thought I was going to keep creeping away and just kept coming and coming, which I knew he would.  I thought if I just hang on there, and felt like birdie after birdie, 14 and 15 to stay with him there, because I knew how much of an advantage he had on me on them two holes and when he birdies both of them, it sort of put me two behind there and I just felt, it's going to be tough for me to grab three in the last three.   
Didn't expect him to do what he did on 17.  But done myself really proud today.  Really happy.   
 Q.  On 17, he slaps it straight into the water.  You must have thought, right there, I've got you.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I thought I'm back in the game.  I thought I'm back in it coming up 18 all level.  But gave him a real good teach on my line.  He was a foot ahead of me just to the right and he had a real good look at my putt.  After I holed it, thought, just expect him to hole it and he did, world-class performer that he is.  That's what world-class players do, don't they.   
 Q.  You've won a lot of money today but let's talk about Ryder Cup and let's talk about now, with seeing what you can do, and you know what you can do, when it comes to contending in majors, how much did you learn about yourself?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think Portugal is a big turning point.  Learned a hell of a lot about myself there and the qualities I possess.  Even more so today, going up against somebody of Rory's quality and to stand toe-to-toe with him.  For me it's about doing it on a more consistent basis and getting up there and trying to get in the last group with Rory more often.
