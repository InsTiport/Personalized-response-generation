 Q.  Good, solid start today.  You got off to a good start, birdie, birdie, before dropping a shot early on in the round.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I've been playing a bit of a doughnut recently.  I've not been playing that great.  So it's always nice to come back to somewhere where you've played well in the past and familiarise yourself.  It's obviously nice to get off to a good start after not playing great the weeks before.  It feels like a home way from home here almost at the moment.   
 Q.  The last couple years have been pretty good for you here.  What's the secret to shooting good scores around this track?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I think you've got to hit the ball in the fairway.  That's the biggest key around here.  You start missing fairways, you start losing the draw of the ball and then it's difficult to get close to the pins.  It's something I've done well in previous years and done well today to shoot that score.  Hopefully I can continue that for three rounds and try to get myself right back up the leaderboard again.   
 Q.  Is there a feeling the game is going in the right direction for you at the moment?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, definitely.  I feel like I'm making a lot of cuts and playing very solidly.  Just not making the most out of my round at the moment.  Today I felt like I played really solidly, and around a course where scoring is never going to get too far away from you.   
So it's nice to have that; knowing that I've not been going very low recently, and since I have that in the back of my mind, it's nice to know I don't have to press this week.  Just play the way I have been and hopefully a few more putts drop and get in the mix.
