Q. How would you assess your week?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Again, I think it's very positive.  I think it's just one or two holes again just keeping me just out of that win.
Again, I'm not going to be too down beat about it.  For 71 holes, it was pretty good today.  Just little mistakes here and there, just need to cut them out and hopefully have a little sniff.
Played really good all week in tough conditions and gave myself a chance going into that back nine.  So things are looking good going into next week, major championships next couple of events, so a lot to look forward to.
Q. That is a big positive, knowing you had a chance right down the wire, doesn't it?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  I think all this is putting me in good stead.  Obviously the next couple of weeks can be really big in terms of I feel like I'm playing well and going into majors, it's great and obviously Ryder Cup standings, always helps towards that.  All in all, got to take the positives out of it.  It's a really good week and I'm playing good golf, so I should go away smiling, really.
Q. Royal Troon, looking forward to that challenge?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Massively.  I heard the weather is going to be pretty similar to what it was yesterday, so yeah, it will be tough.  But major championships are not meant to be easy.  It will be a good challenge and can't wait to get out in the form I'm in.
