Q. Great start.  Three birdies in four holes.  Came to a halt, didn't it?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, it did.  It's tough out there.  Got a lot of mid-irons, long irons into greens.  You have just got to be patient out there, which I was happy with.
Last week I got a little bit frustrated and let it get to me and didn't quite make the most of it.  I was happy to stay patient out there and managed to pick up one coming in.  I think 4-under is a pretty good score today.
Q. Conditions have improved since yesterday.  Pretty dismal since the Pro Am, but much better conditions for scoring today?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, definitely.  It's unbelievable.  To play in front a home crowd in this weather is absolutely fantastic.  Long may it continue.
Q. Has it been nice to you to change the mindset because those two wins early in the year meant you have been able to pick and choose your events.  It hasn't been so frantic playing every event?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, definitely.  I took a lot of time off after the PGA, felt like I needed some rest.  Played quite a lot of golf.  Forced my way into the majors and got Top-50.  Took a lot of time off, took five weeks off and feel really good for it, feel refreshed and ready to get at it for this one and the final series today.
