Q. You left a few out there today.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, just two bad holes, really; 1st and 11.  Played actually quite nicely in between.  Didn't really hole my putts.  Disappointed, actually.  I'd been playing really well leading up to it.  And in between played nicely.
Just didn't cash in on any shots today.  It was disappointing.
Q. Par-3s were decent for you today.
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I played really nicely in between.  Just them two holes.  I suppose it gives me something to go for tomorrow, playing nicely in between it.  I felt like there was a low one out there for me.
Q. What was the course like?
ANDY SULLIVAN: It's weird, it's almost like harder downwind than it is into wind.  Most of the downwind pins seem to be at the front, you couldn't get it that close.  You were taking a risk trying to bump into a bank, and if you didn't get the right bounce you went on the green.
So downwind was quite tough.  Into the wind you know what you're getting.  The ball is stopping a little bit quicker.  So it's just sort of negotiating it, really.  It was a good one.  Never had it where the downwind was playing harder than into the wind.
Q. Does it feel extra special with the crowds?
ANDY SULLIVAN: It was mega.  We clearly had the best of the weather this morning.  But they're great.  And I love coming to Ireland and Northern Ireland to play.  It's good fun.
Q. Is that the message?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I feel like I played nicely in between the two holes, take those two doubles out and I've just got to get the putter going.  It's been a long five-week stretch, I'm not going to lie.  Coming into this run I was a long way back in the Order of Merit.  I still feel like I'm playing good golf.  And I still feel there's a low one out there, and I feel I can go out there tomorrow and get it.
