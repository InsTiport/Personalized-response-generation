Q. Talk about how much you enjoyed the good bits and what you learned.
ANDY SULLIVAN: It's been a massive learning experience, obviously massively disappointed not to get a point at all for the team.
Q. Talk about how much you enjoyed the good bits and what you've learned?
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think it's been a massive learning experience, obviously the first one in the States.  Obviously massively massively disappointed to not get a point for the team at all.  That's going to not sit well with me.  It's just frustrating, felt like I had opportunities to get myself back into the match but didn't make the putts.  Down to myself and no one I can blame for that one.
It has been an amazing week.  It would have been nice to cap it off with a win but unfortunately the Americans played that much better and holed the putts when they needed to.
Q. How close was this team to doing something quite special?
ANDY SULLIVAN: You know, just a few putts here or there.  They can change the momentum, and you can see that I think throughout the five, six sessions there, I think the Americans -- I think only one session we got our tails in the air.  But you can see the momentum was clearly with them and it's difficult to shift against that sometimes.
I think especially when you're a rookie, you're not quite seasoned in this sort of atmosphere.  It's tough to go out there and you've just got to really dig in.  Sometimes you just come up short.  Brandt played fantastic there.  Felt like I gave it everything out there and just came up short unfortunately.
