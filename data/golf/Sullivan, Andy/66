Q.   A fantastic week here at the Memorial.   First time here, you've got to be proud of yourself?
ANDY SULLIVAN:   I enjoyed the whole week.   I loved every minute of it.   I was a little tired towards the end today.

Q.   Would you like to play on greens like this every week?
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Yeah, for sure.   It's just so nice. 

Q.   Let's take a look at one of the highlights today.   At 16, beautiful shot in here, what club did you have?
ANDY SULLIVAN:   9‑iron at first, then I used an 8 and tried to smooth it in there from left‑to‑right and it came out perfect.   A birdie after a bogey. 

Q.   What's the plan now, are you going to go back to the UK?
ANDY SULLIVAN:   Yeah, go back to the UK and chill out and have next week off.   And then hopefully the U.S. Open, which will be the third venture into the States so I'm looking forward to it.
