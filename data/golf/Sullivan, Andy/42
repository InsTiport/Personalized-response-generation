 Q.  You gave it a good shot, didn't you.  That putt at the last was tremendous?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, you know what I mean, fair play to Dan, holing that putt, that was a tough putt.  That was a tough putt.  I didn't feel like I put him under enough pressure through the midpoint of the round.  Had a lot of chances and didn't quite take them.  The putts towards the end kept me in it, par saves, and you hole that putt on the last, you feel you gave yourself a sneaky chance.  But Dan is a quality player and you expect him to step up, and he did.  Fair play to him.   
The driver demons came back, started hitting a few poor drives, but like I said, the putter caught me out.  After nine holes, I said, it's going too quickly, enjoying myself too much.  You just literally want to wrap that stuff up and bottle it.  It was fantastic, the adrenaline, the emotions, going through it, it was good fun.  Bodes well for the rest of the year.   
 Q.  Team Sully with you again, like in Portugal and Dubai, helps?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, for sure, every time they have been there, I think I've done well.  It's been awesome.  I feel a little bit gutted for the two times they come to Dubai and been a bridesmaid both times, but I'm sure they are proud.   
 Q.  Sets up 2016 nicely, doesn't it?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, massively.  Had the lead in Abu Dhabi after 36 and put myself in a real good position there for the finish today.  Just keep putting myself in that position and eventually I'll get over the line.   
 Q.  What's next?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Going to take a week off next week and then go out to the States for a bit and play in the WGC and stuff.  Very exciting stuff for me.  Can't wait for that.
