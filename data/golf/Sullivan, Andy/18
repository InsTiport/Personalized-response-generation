 Q.  How would you describe the difficulty of this golf course today?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: The wind has really got up and the greens are so firm, so it's really tough to try and get it close.  You find yourself having a lot of 30-footers and a few tough up-and-downs.   
I think anything under par today is going to be really good, and if the wind keeps up, it's going to be really tough for the leaders, because I imagine it's only going to get firmer.   
 Q.  If there is a scorable part of this golf course, where is it right now?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I actually think the first few holes, I think you can get at them a little bit.  First, second, third, fourth, you've got to take advantage of some of them early doors and then sort of through that, through 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, try to hang in there and grind your way around.   
Obviously the par 5s coming in are massive.  You have to try to get the ball in the fairway and take advantage.  As soon as you miss the fairway on them, you have no chance of getting up in two.   
It's just really tough out there.  With that wind, a lot of crosswind, not always straight downwind.  So it's pretty tough out there.   
 Q.  How about big picture for The European Tour with the launch of the Rolex Series; how different does it seem around here?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Massive, I think there's a massive hype about it now, and I think we're sort of trying to compete with the PGA TOUR now in terms of trying to get more premium events out here.  I think it's fantastic for the tour, and hopefully we can get a few more on board.
