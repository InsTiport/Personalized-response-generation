 Q.  Congratulations for another big score.  It seems that you are playing another course.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, just playing really good golf at the moment and just hung in there early doors and managed to knock a few good putts in early.  And just kept that going throughout the round.  And ended up finishing 4-under for the day, which is awesome in that horrible weather out there.   
 Q.  Highlight of the day and the weakest point of your game today?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Weakest point of my game -- you know, I thought I handled myself well.  I didn't really feel like I'd done much wrong out there today.  I think like every part of my game is in good touch, and I didn't really ever leave myself too much to do.   
 Q.  And the highlight, the best shot of your day?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Best shot of the day:  Second shot into 17.  It's a tough lie and we weren't too sure if we could carry the water.  So to see it carry the water and then about 30 feet away was a big shot.  Especially after making bogey on the hole before, to bounce back straightaway was good.   
 Q.  What can we expect from you tomorrow?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: More of the same.  More of the same hopefully.  Just go out there and do my thing, and hopefully come in and sign for a good score again.   
 Q.  Five shots ahead, it will be a disaster for you not winning this Portugal Masters.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I'm glad you pointed it out and everyone else.  Just go out there and do my thing like I have been, and take it shot by shot and see what happens.
