 Q.  65, your best round of the week so far but a solid three rounds overall?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, felt like a low one was coming.  I felt like I made a few mistakes the first two rounds, so it's nice today, try and limit them as many as I could and make as many birdies as I did.   
 Q.  A couple of eagles on the card yesterday, as well as there's been plenty of birdies around this golf course.  You can be a little more aggressive; the fact it's been a little softer?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, definitely.  You know before going out there you have to shoot low if you want to be anything around the lead.  Obviously Slatts playing in front of me was going nuts, so I was just trying to cling on to his coattails and be somewhere near going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've had great results already this year and looks like the form is going back to where you would like it to be.  How nice is it going into one of these big events, contending on a Sunday?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  I think it's just more of the same.  I feel like this year, it's just been really consistent.  Sort of found my game again, going out there and being really, really comfortable.  I think a lot of my off-course stuff has to do with how I am on the course and I'm really happy off the course and it's just starting to show on the course.   
 Q.  Looks like tomorrow, consistency could well be the key to winning this tournament?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, try and hang in there on the front nine and get a few birdies and back nine, there's plenty to be had.  Even if you're within three or four going into the back nine, you can really get after it.  Hopefully somewhere near and try and let the Sparks fly.
