ANDY SULLIVAN: Made a real good swing on 7, and then from there on I just seemed to gain confidence in my game.  I hit a lot of good shots through the middle part of the round that really got me going.  I'm putting nicely as well for a change.  It was nice to see the ball go in the hall for a change.   
 Q.  Having dropped a shot pretty late on, it must have been nice to bounce back immediately?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: I was frustrated with that really because I hit two good putts.  Obviously, to come straight back with a birdie was really pleasing.  I was hoping to sneak one on the last, as well, just to get one ahead.  But overall really pleasing day.   
 Q.  I take it, it was nice to get it done, that sun is setting?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Going down quick.  We was going down 16 and it was dropping really quick.  So nice to get it finished and not have to come back to it in the morning.  Get refreshed and ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How has the course changed?  How have the greens coped with the conditions?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Even from yesterday, we played Pro-Am, the greens have firmed up a lot.  The balls are bouncing a little bit more, which is nice really, because it was a bit soft.  The rough makes it a different challenge this year, which is fantastic.  It puts a premium on hitting the fairway.  It definitely suits me more.  More rough is great.   
 Q.  When you have a such a wonderful season as this, do you reestablish targets that the end of the year?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, for sure.  It's nonstop.  You always want to get better.  Even, I'm sure, they guys that -- they are going to get back to even.  To me, there's always targets for me to get better.  Hopefully just start picking up where I left off at the start of the year. Off
