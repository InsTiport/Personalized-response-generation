 Q.  You must be happy?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Just managed to get it around a number really.  Stuck in there well.  Mentally was very, very good today.  Chipped and putted it around nicely.  Not my best, but I was really happy to come up with the score I did and finish my round.   
 Q.  You mentioned yesterday you had a few changes to equipment, etc., to get more control of the ball.  Seems to be working well for you now.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Yeah, it is getting better, I must admit.  It's starting to come back to when I was playing my best in 2015.  Hopefully more of the same trending that way and I can get my hands on the trophy.   
 Q.  What would you say was the biggest test out there today you?  You said you weren't that happy.  
ANDY SULLIVAN: You know me, keeping my head on mentally today.  I didn't hit many fairways at all, and it's difficult to make birdies out there, but I managed to carve a few out.  I would say mentally I was very good and managed to keep myself in the game somehow.   
 Q.  You've already qualified for The Open.  How important is it to get this or how valuable is it to get this links experience prior?  
ANDY SULLIVAN: Definitely.  You just can't get enough of it leading up to The Open, the little shots you play around the greens and stuff, you need to sort of familiarize yourself with that.  The more you do that, the more easier it becomes at The Open.  I'm sure the Irish weather wasn't be as kind at The Open as it has this week.  It's been a good week of prep for The Open.
