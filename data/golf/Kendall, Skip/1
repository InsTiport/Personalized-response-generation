 Q. Skip, great round, 7-under. Kind of talk a little bit about, I know it was a weird round, over three days you put this in.
 SKIP KENDALL: Yeah. Probably one of the longest rounds I've ever played. Yeah, I played really well, hit a the lot of quality shots, like I said yesterday. 
 Left one three-foot out there, leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but followed that up with made a couple of birdies coming in, so it was a nice way to finish, and obviously real pleased with the first round.

 Q. And the course conditions this morning? How's everything?
 SKIP KENDALL: You know, it was beautiful this morning. It's probably a little, you know, wetter on the front side. I think being closer to the rain forest over there, I think it gets probably pounded a little bit more. But really, you know, it certainly wasn't a factor or anything. It was nice out there, and you know, it's a beautiful day right now, so hopefully that'll continue.

 Q. What are you going to do with the rest of your day off?
 SKIP KENDALL: Man, I think it's pool time today. Family's here, and go have some fun over at the resort, and pool time, get some sleep maybe a little bit. It's been three days in a row up super early, and four days, tomorrow I'm sure, so a lot of early ones. 

 Q. Coming back, play 27, maybe more holes tomorrow, do you see the course getting tougher, maybe if it dries out a little?
 SKIP KENDALL: Oh, I definitely do. Well, I don't see it drying out that much, but you know, to where the fairways might be not as much water in them.
 You know, I think it'll continue to play soft. I think it'll -- I think it'll get a little tougher, though. The officials set the course up to where it was playing a little shorter, so they'll probably put it back a little bit, especially if the conditions dry out a little bit more, but I think it'll get tougher.
