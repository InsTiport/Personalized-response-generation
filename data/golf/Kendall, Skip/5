 Q.  Moving day ... You shot a 63. 
 SKIP KENDALL:  It was a great day. I've been striking the ball all week and finally got something out of it. I hit it close on two of the first three holes, and made birdies, and that got me rolling, sort of set the tone for the day. I made some nice putts out there and continued good ball-striking. It was a fun day. 

 Q.  What are your goals this year? 
 SKIP KENDALL: I just want to see improvement in my game to see if I can get my game to where it was, late 1990s, 2001, 2002, 2003. I know I can play out here, but unfortunately, I got hurt in 2005 and had some bad play because of that. I hope to get back to where I was and actually exceed that. But I believe good things are going to happen. 

 Q.  (On your play so far this year) 
 SKIP KENDALL: I hadn't shown anything so far this year. But I felt good coming here. I worked with my teacher last week. We kind of hit on something, and I'm hoping that will carry over all four days.
