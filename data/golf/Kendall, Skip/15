SKIP KENDALL: Started blowing on our backside pretty good.  Played the back nine second today and it was playing tough out there. 

Q.   Pretty good tee time tomorrow.
SKIP KENDALL: I feel good about it.  I am playing well.  I am looking forward to it. 

Q.   Being with Tiger, obviously a lot of people will be following him -- (inaudible)
 SKIP KENDALL: I enjoyed it.  I played with John Daly at Phoenix this year, there were 165,000 people out there.  I guarantee you we had half of them.  Won't bother me at all.  I look forward to playing with Tiger.  Doesn't bother me.

Q.   You put two rounds together...
SKIP KENDALL: I am feeling good.

Q.   Everybody is talking about the claw, and not about your game....  (Inaudible)
 SKIP KENDALL: I have been getting a lot more publicity for showing Chris DiMarco and some of the others how to do that than I have been for my own game so I wanted to turn that around a little bit.

Q.   Is it frustrating a little bit?
SKIP KENDALL: It's fine.  I think any publicity is good publicity.  It was good.  I am glad I'd helped some of the guys out.  If you can't beat them, join them.
