SKIP KENDALL:  I am just trying to get there.  Hopefully, one of these times it will go my way.  I guess what I learned, you know, you just have to stay patient.  I think it is just a battle of the nerves, is what it comes down to in that situation; at least it is for me.  Staying patient and calm and doing the things that you know how to do, and I watched -- I played with a number of guys now that were in my group last year that actually have gone on to win the tournament. Really, that is how they did it.  It wasn't anything fancy; went about their business and, you know, really just kind of hung in there and made it happen.


Q.  Can you apply that philosophy to a tournament like this where you know you got to shoot 65, 66 probably?

SKIP KENDALL:  Well, yeah, I know I am going to start a few back, so I am going to have to be very aggressive tomorrow, but I am to the point where I am not trying to be stupid either. So I am just going to try and see what happens and hopefully I get off to a good start tomorrow and make some birdies early and, you know, we will see what happens down the stretch.


Q.  Do you have a target score or anything like that tomorrow?

SKIP KENDALL:  I don't even know what is leading right now.  I haven't even seen a board.

SKIP KENDALL:  21-under.

SKIP KENDALL:  It is hard to predict.  Obviously I know I am going to have to play really well tomorrow.  I am not going to give you a number because I may not do it at all.  So you just never know.  Someone could easily come out of the pack tomorrow. I think it also depends on the weather.  I heard it was supposed to rain tomorrow.  I hope it doesn't.  But if it is a nice day, obviously the scores are going to be low and anybody -- 13-, 14-under par really has a chance to come from way back.
