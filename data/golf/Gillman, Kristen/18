Q. Kristen, you played 30 holes of golf today.
Was fatigue a factor for you in that's a lot of golf for the National Championship last week and this week, did that factor into it?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I feel like it never helps playing 30 holes.  I never, one, try to make excuses for my bad play.  So, I'd say that it wasn't fatigue but I mean it's a lot of time being out here with that heat for this long.
Q. What didn't work this afternoon, what did you struggle with?  You played solid for --
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I didn't get up and down when I needed to on the front-9 and hit a poor shot in the water on 9 and then after that it wasn't too bad but --
Q. Kristen, you were 5-over on the front-9 and were able to salvage the round, 2-under on the back-9.
Kind of where were you mentally after that front-9 and how were you able to do that?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: After the front-9 it was definitely not what I wanted but I knew that I just had to keep fighting out there even though I wasn't playing the way I wanted to because I didn't want to finish with the 5-over score.  I just wanted to play the back-9 under par after that.
Q. Coming in the week, what was your goal?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Obviously to make the cut.  That's a goal but I mean I just wanted to come out here to just try to play the best I could and -- because I didn't want to try to set any boundaries or expectations or anything.  Just got here, have fun and play the best I can.
Q. What would success mean to you by the time tomorrow ends?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Obviously you would want the low amateur.  I don't know where I stand for that.  I think I'll have to have a pretty low round for tomorrow.
