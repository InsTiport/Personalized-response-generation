Q.   So you're 4‑down with six to go. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   What did you tell yourself at the beginning of this comeback?   Something worked, obviously. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I told myself that I just needed to get back to what I was doing the other day, just keep trusting in the shots, and just to never give up and keep fighting. 

Q.   Walk me through coming in when you made those wins. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I won hole 13 with a birdie, and that gave me some confidence in how I was hitting it.

Q.   How far was that birdie? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I made like a three‑foot putt for it.   And then on hole 15 I ended up winning that hole with a par.   Then on 17 I hit it to about five feet and made that putt for a birdie to win that hole, and then 18 I got up‑and‑down and made about a five‑footer.

Q.   And then you have the 10th hole coming back, and then you're here on the 11th green facing a birdie that's going to win.   How did you keep calm in that situation?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I just knew I had to keep trusting in what I was doing and just not second‑guess the line I picked out. 

Q.   About how far was your putt here? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It was about 15 feet.

Q.   And it had to be a great feeling when you saw it fall in. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, it was.

Q.   I know you've had a good friend on your bag, Bethany.   How has she been helping you this week?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   She's been helping me a lot.   She's helped me on club decisions, where to hit it, and even putts on the greens. 

Q.   After your Junior PGA win last week and now making it to semifinals this week, you are having a very good couple of weeks. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, I am.   It's a lot of fun.

Q.   Has it sunk in at all?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, nothing has. 

Q.   I'm not going to say you came in as an underdog, but you were playing one of the best players in the world. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   How do you pump yourself up knowing what's on the line and knowing that you can do it? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I just made sure I didn't get like too into what people were ranked previously and what they are now and just realize that this is 18 holes, anything can happen, anyone can win.
