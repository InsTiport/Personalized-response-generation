Q.   My first question is what's gotten into you this summer?   What do you attribute your exponential rise in play?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I don't know.   I guess all the hard work I've been putting in throughout the school year is paying off, and just the more I play in tournaments, the more I learn from that, and I just keep taking that to the next tournament.

Q.   Well, it's working. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   Have you done anything different?   Have you changed anything from last year?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Not really. 

Q.   No new instructor, nothing?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, same instructor, same everything.   Worked just a little bit harder, worked out a little bit more, and that's it.

Q.   What are your expectations this week, this being your first time in a‑‑
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I still had pretty high expectations because of how I played last week.   I knew my game was really well and that I didn't know if I could make it to the semis coming into this, but I definitely had expectations of making the cut. 

Q.   How do you go from 4‑down to winning this thing? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, with six left.   I just told myself that I was going to keep fighting and I didn't want to leave here without any regrets and just keep fighting.

Q.   Was your caddie in your ear at all, saying anything special to you?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, she was making sure I was calm.

Q.   How long have you known her?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I've known her‑‑ I don't know.   I've known her for a while, but I've gotten to know her really well over the summer.

Q.   Was this your best come‑from‑behind victory?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, it is.

Q.   In your very young life?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   All 16 years?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   Can you drive?   Do you have a driver's license?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, I do.

Q.   What do you drive?   What's your car?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   An Elantra.

Q.   Not a souped‑up Texas truck or anything?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, I wish.   I want a truck.

Q.   Can you talk about that tear the last few holes?   What was going on, and how did you do this, seriously?   You rallied. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, I just kept visualizing my shots going close, visualizing me making the putts, and just keep trusting in my game and knowing that I could come back. 

Q.   So the first one that dropped in, where was that?   That was No.13?   Talk about that.   How long was that putt?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It was only like three feet, but it was still a good momentum changer.

Q.   And then 15? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, 15 I two‑putted from about 20 feet to win that hole.

Q.   What did you hit in?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I hit my pitching wedge. 

Q.   And then 17, you won with a birdie?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, I hit a 9‑iron into that green to about five feet.

Q.   Was that about four feet on 18 in regulation?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It seemed about 10 feet.   Yeah, I guess it was about four or five.

Q.   And then the putt on your first extra hole, 10? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   That was about five feet.

Q.   You hit that thing up there tight, so were you thinking that you were going to make that?   Did you feel like you had a good roll on it?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, I felt confident in the putt.   I just second‑guessed myself right before I putted it.

Q.   So the first extra hole you hit your approach to five feet and missed the putt?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   And the second I hit it to about 15 feet and made it.

Q.   For birdie?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   What did you hit in?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I hit my 4‑hybrid.

Q.   From where, how long?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   From 170 yards.

Q.   How satisfying is this?   You've got to be pretty stoked. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, I'm pretty excited to play tomorrow.   I'm happy in how I've been playing.

Q.   Are you surprised, or is this just a continuation from that crazy week you had last week? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I guess I'm a little surprised because the furthest I've ever made it in the Girls Junior was the round of 16, which was this year, so I ended up losing to Princess, who won, so I knew that I still played my best golf because I made that match the whole 17.   I was excited to get these match play rounds here.

Q.   How long have you been playing golf?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I started doing tournaments when I was eight.

Q.   You're at the academy?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I get lessons there.   I live in Austin but I get lessons there.

Q.   How long have you been doing that?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   For about two years.

Q.   When did you actually first pick up a club then?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I don't know. 

Q.   Are you a child of a teaching professional?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, my dad really enjoyed golf growing up, but he never played college golf, and so he kind of got me into it when I was younger, just take me and my older sister who's going to play at Nebraska this fall out on the course and just have fun in the bunkers and let us enjoy it.

Q.   What's your sister's name?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Emily Gillman.

Q.   So she's just a few years older than you are?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, she's two years older.

Q.   Two girls in your family?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, I have a younger sister, too.

Q.   Is she a golfer?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, she dances.

Q.   What's her name?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Jessica.

Q.   Who all is here with you?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Just my dad.

Q.   Was he the one that just came and hugged you?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah.   He's walking around.

Q.   He watched you but he didn't know how far down you were?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   He didn't watch.   He doesn't watch live scoring, and he had to work, but he's going to be caddying for me tomorrow.

Q.   Really? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Uh‑huh.   Bethany has to fly back home, sadly.

Q.   So he was here but he wasn't on the course?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No, he was back at the hotel working because he has a big presentation on Tuesday, so he had to do that.

Q.   But he normally does watch you or he normally doesn't?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   He's half and half.   It depends if it's like‑‑ it kind of depends on like work, because he can't take that many days off.

Q.   What does he do?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   That's a good question.   I think he's like‑‑ I don't know. 

Q.   You're not really sure?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No.

Q.   What do you think about the fact that the four semifinalists are 16, 16, 16 and 15?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I think that shows a lot about junior golfers.   I don't know, I think it's fun watching to see the junior golfers dominate.

Q.   You take pride in that?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes. 

Q.   When do you get your braces off?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I get them off in about a month. 

Q.   How long have you had them on?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I got them in December.

Q.   Not too long. 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, this is my second time having braces, though.

Q.   You're going to get them off for your birthday?   Will you have them off by your birthday?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Well, in the beginning of June they told me two months but I never went back since then, and I think I was supposed to go back once, so I'm going back on the 12th, so hopefully then, but if not probably a month after that. 

Q.   You're going to Scotland for the Junior Ryder Cup; is that your first trip to Scotland?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, it is, and it will be on my birthday, too, the first round.

Q.   What's your next event? 
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Junior Ryder Cup.

Q.   Why did you decide to play in the Am this year?   Because everyone else was doing it?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I guess, and I guess I had nothing better to do than travel here and play.   I think this is my first year trying to qualify, but I'm not quite sure.

Q.   When does school start for you, high school?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It starts on like the 25th, something like that.

Q.   Of August?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   August.

Q.   What high school do you attend?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Lake Travis High School.

Q.   Is that public?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes.

Q.   What have you learned so far about this week?   How do you add to what you did last week?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I mean, I'm always learning.   I don't know, I just‑‑

Q.   You haven't processed it?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I learned that it's never over, that you can always come back no matter what.

Q.   What do you think playing in front of TV cameras?
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I enjoy it because I like being on TV, and there was‑‑ it's hard to believe, but it seemed like there were a lot more cameras last week, so it was kind of‑‑ I'm used to it from last week coming into this week.   It's about the same.
