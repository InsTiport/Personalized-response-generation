 Q.  Top 5 here. Pretty good way to start your first Asia swing. Got to feel pretty proud of yourself.  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, definitely. This is the best finish I've had so far on tour. It was nice to be able to start the Asia swing off that way.   
 Q.  You had, what, ten, eleven straight pars until things started to change, but you really picked it up there on the back nine. You had the bogey, but then the big string of birdies. What changed for you out there?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, I mean, in the front first -- I mean, first nine holes I hit some great shots and I was missing some -- I was missing some putts that you should make, and then I was also missing some that like are kind of like on the verge of if you should or not.   
I knew was hitting it well, so I just kind of stuck in it there and kept telling myself, The putts are going to drop, the putts are going to drop. They all dropped at the end, which was nice.   
 Q.  Were you expecting this good of a finish when you got out here for your first Asia swing?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I don't think anyone can really -- I don't know, like I definitely knew I would be able to do it, but also being a rookie and being in Asia - or at least in China for my first time - you don't really expect to have this good of a finish and your best finish so far this year out of the country.   
It's kind of nice to be able to start it that way.   
 Q.  You've got a big smile on your face. You look really proud.  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah.
