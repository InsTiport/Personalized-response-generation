Q. Long day yesterday.  What hole did you start on this morning?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: 7.
Q. What did you do to pass the time during that long delay?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I was just hanging out inside with some of my friends.  A lot of the amateurs, we were all sitting together.  It was a lot of fun.  Time went by pretty fast.
Q. Over the course of two days, assess your round 2 play.
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I definitely haven't hit it how I've been wanting to.  But I didn't put myself in too bad of spots for the most part.  My short game was pretty good, so I didn't get myself out of this.
Q. The fact that you made the cut, good stuff.  What do you say about that?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: It definitely feels good to make the cut.  This is my first cut I have made so far in my professional events.  I'm just going out there trying to play the best I can, trying not to worry about the cut number.
Q. When you are out there, are folks looking at your hat, Roll Tide and all that?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Definitely a lot of Roll Tides out there, today.
Q. Did anybody say anything you didn't expect to hear?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Not really.
Q. How do you feel physically right now?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: It's been a long few days, but not too bad.  We still have two rounds to play, so I'm ready to get those started.
Q. Do you feel extra because you're playing in your home state, where you went to college?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Not really.  I don't feel extra pressure just because it's in Alabama.
Q. What have you got to do to catch up and move up the leaderboard?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Definitely hit it closer and make a lot of birdies, because I'm a few strokes behind.  Quite a few strokes behind.
Q. With your game as it stands, are you concentrating on one phase or trying to get everything better?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I feel like I'm always trying to improve on everything.  Nothing is terrible; it's just not at its best, which is where you want it to be.
