 Q.   It hasn't really set in for you yet.   How does it feel knowing you're in the Women's Amateur final?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It feels awesome.   Coming into this week that's all you wanted, so it feels great to accomplish that.  
   
 Q.   You came in on quite a roll off the Junior PGA. Did that help you at all coming into the week?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, it helped me a lot about all the momentum and just the confidence I had in my game.  
   
 Q.   Are you tired at all or are you just running on adrenaline right now?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Both.   
   
 Q.   It's a long week.   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, it's been a long summer.   
   
 Q.   When was the last time you were home?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I actually got to go home for about 12 hours after the JPGA because I only live like two hours from there, so just enough time to sleep and get on a 6:00 a.m. flight the next day.   
   
 Q.   What's been the reaction back home from your peers?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   They're really excited.   They're also‑‑ my family is also really nervous back home watching.   But yeah, they're excited, and they're enjoying watching me on TV.  
   
 Q.   Who all is watching at home?   Is there a viewing party going on?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yes, there actually is today.   My high school golf team is at my house.  
   
 Q.   How many people is that?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   There's probably about seven of them there.   
   
 Q.   Did your mom like order pizza?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Probably.   
   
 Q.   Walk us through that run you had there.   Was it 10, 11, 12, 13 that you had the run of‑‑  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   9, 10, 11, 12.  
   
 Q.   Where you won four in a row to really get yourself up big.   Kind of walk us through that stretch.   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Throughout that stretch I just kept making pars, so I knew that if I just kept doing that, then I could probably close it out soon.   I don't know, I just tried to stay focused and not get too ahead of myself.   
   
 Q.   Any particular moment that stood out to you as your best moment today?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Probably my‑‑ I had two birdies.   My birdie on hole 3 was‑‑ I mean, it was like a three‑foot‑‑ I made a three‑foot putt for birdie, but then also the birdie I made on hole 14 was also a big birdie coming into the last hole.  
   
 Q.   About how long was that?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   That was about 10 feet.  
   
 Q.   Why did you choose Alabama?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Just everything about it.   The coaches are awesome.   I love the facilities, the courses and the campus.   And I wanted to stay in the South.  
   
 Q.   Where else did you look?   Obviously there's a school in your backyard.   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah.   I don't really want to say anything on my other options.   
   
 Q.   Did you have any family history at Alabama?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   No.   I have a lot of friends going there, so I know everyone that's going to be on the team, and it's going to be a pretty small team, so it'll be fun.   
   
 Q.   What was it like having dad on the bag today?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It was nice.   I mean, he helps calm me down whenever I get a little nervous or a little too intense sometimes, so it's nice, and he also got to caddie for me two other times this week.  
   
 Q.   When else did he caddie for you?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   The Tuesday stroke play and my Wednesday match.  
   
 Q.   Who caddied for you Monday?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Myself.   
   
 Q.   You carried your bag?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   Then dad, then‑‑  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah, so I carried, then my dad, then my dad, then Bethany for three matches, then my dad, and my dad is doing tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Does your dad help you much on club selection or strategy?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Not really strategy because I like to do a lot of things by myself, but sometimes if I'm in between clubs I get his advice on what I think because he knows my game pretty well.  
   
 Q.   Was he your first instructor?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   I guess you could say he kind of taught me how to play golf.   I don't know if he was like a real instructor, but he just taught me how to play.  
   
 Q.   And then you've been at the Jim McLean academy for how long?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Two years.  
   
 Q.   And Lakareber Abe is there, too, right?   
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Your friend that's also going to Alabama?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   How much has your game improved since you've been there, since you've taken lessons from there?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN:   It's improved a lot.   I don't know, I just think it's improved a lot.
