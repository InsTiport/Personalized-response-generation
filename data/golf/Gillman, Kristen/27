KRISTEN GILLMAN: It was really nice.  It's in awesome shape, and I've really enjoyed playing here.   Q.  Being the defending champion, was there any added pressure do you think?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: I tried as hard as I could not to add any pressure and just come out here and have fun and just enjoy being able to have that title on my back and like put in a good way.   Q.  What mindset do you take tomorrow?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: I'm just going to go out there the same as I did today and just go have fun, and whatever happens will happen.
