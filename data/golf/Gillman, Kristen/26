 Q.  So first victory down; feel good?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, it feels good to win.   Q.  Tell me about your match today.  I know you were down at one point.  KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, I got to 1-down through five, but then I got back to even or all square on the next hole.  But I feel like we both made a lot of pars and didn't have too many birdies, but we also didn't have too many bogeys.   Q.  So you've got one of these under your belt.  What experience do you take from last year and then everything you've done over the last year coming into this week?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: I think it's definitely helped me, just how to deal with all the stressful or pressure situations, how to deal with that, and I think it's going to help me a lot this week.   Q.  Are you enjoying it this week as the defending champion?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, it's pretty fun being the defending champion.   Q.  Any cool little perks come along with that?  KRISTEN GILLMAN: You get a sign at the top with like scroll when you check in.  That was pretty cool.
