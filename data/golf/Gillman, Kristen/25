 Q.  Talk to me about today.  How did it go?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: It was pretty good.  I played pretty solid.  I had a lot of pars.  Not many bogeys.  Had a few birdies, but mostly pars.   
 Q.  Is that what basically like the goal is, just make sure you make par on these holes?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I think a lot of holes out here you want par.  There are also some holes you know you need birdie and you need to be more aggressive at.  That's always the goal.   
 Q.  Sure.  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: I feel like par is pretty good in match play.   
 Q.  Does your game plan change at all once you see other shots that your opponent has, or are you locked in?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: For today, for the most part I was always the first one hitting into the greens, and so my game plan was to just to play my regular game:  just try to go at the pins I know I can and go it safe at the tougher pins.   
But, I mean, definitely have to hit better shots and close.  You need to go for those.   
 Q.  Anything in particular you looking to change for tomorrow?  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: No, not really.  Just stay out there and play my own game.   
 Q.  Awesome.  Thank you very much.  
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, thank you.
