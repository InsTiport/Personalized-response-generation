 Q.  You look pretty tired.  
MARC DULL: Yeah, it was a long day today.  40 holes today.   
 Q.  I heard there was a point on 18 --  
MARC DULL: Yeah, they had two putts on 18 to win the match, probably two 12-footers.   
CHIP BROOKE: Two 12-footers.   
MARC DULL: They both missed them, and they had probably a nine- or ten-footer on 1 to win the hole, as well, first playoff hole.   
 Q.  Wow, you guys were dodging bullets as well as raindrops this week.  
MARC DULL: Yeah, I played terrible.  Chipper played great today.  I played terrible and left him on an island way too many times today.   
 Q.  Who made the putt on the last hole?  
MARC DULL: I did.  I made birdie.   
 Q.  How long was the putt?  
MARC DULL: 10 feet, eight feet?  About eight feet or so.   
 Q.  Well, you're back in the semifinals again.  
MARC DULL: I know, right?  I can't believe it.   
 Q.  So you guys have earned a trip to Bandon Dunes next year.  
CHIP BROOKE: We already had that one because now we -- we got a two-year exemption last year.   
 Q.  You get one year.  
CHIP BROOKE: You get two years for the semis.   
 Q.  No, you get one?  
CHIP BROOKE: You get two.  They told us we get two.   
MARC DULL: You get two, trust me, you get two.   
 Q.  I think it's only one.  
CHIP BROOKE: I promise you get two.   
MARC DULL: The quarterfinals is one.   
 Q.  There's no quarterfinals in the Four-Ball.  
CHIP BROOKE: I'll bet you a beer you get two.   
 Q.  I don't think you get two, I'm telling you.  I'll bet you it's one because they don't -- because it's only a 32-player draw.  
CHIP BROOKE: I'll bet you a beer they get two.   
 Q.  I'll ask Billy, but --  
MARC DULL: Anyway, it doesn't matter.   
 Q.  Obviously you're going to Bandon Dunes next year, and you're familiar with that place.  
MARC DULL: Yeah, super excited.  He texted me months ago when they changed it from Chambers to Bandon.  He's like, they're going to play the golf tournament at Bandon.  That's amazing.
