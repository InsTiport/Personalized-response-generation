Q. What went well today?
MARC DULL: I hit it great.  I only missed three greens, two of them I got up-and-down.  I missed a shorty that I didn't.  I three-putted once.  I felt like 66 was -- I don't want to say the worst score I could have shot, but I missed a lot of good opportunities for birdie.  I hit it really well today.
Q. That sets you up good for tomorrow when you've got the course that everybody calls the monster.
MARC DULL: Yeah, came into this one -- not expecting but knowing you need to play well out here because this is the one you can get and can be had, so I was just trying to go out there and make good swings, and I did, and I hit some really good shots in there three, four feet, and it worked out.
Q. Going into last year's Mid-Amateur, limited USGA experience, get to the final, caddie for Meghan Stasi at the Four-Ball, now you're in this and you play well.  Does that combination of stuff help you?
MARC DULL: Yeah, I mean, first round at the Mid-Am last year was huge.  I was T1 after one round, and it gave me the confidence that I could compete, and the last six months, eight months, I've really been working on my game and trying to get one step better.  But for sure that's all the confidence in the world, man, to see that you can compete at the highest level, and walking onto the first tee not afraid, just kind of with a little bit of confidence knowing you can play.
