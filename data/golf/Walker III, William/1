Q. So No. 2 has been pretty tough today.  Haven't seen a whole lot of red out there, so what did you think?
WILLIAM WALKER III: It was really tough.  I'm hitting the ball well, it's more just course management for us.  We knew coming into this that the greens were going to be hard and firm and if we can place the ball in good spots we would give ourselves a chance and make a good number and today it worked out.
Q. What are your thoughts heading into tomorrow?
WILLIAM WALKER III: Tomorrow, just same thing.  Go at it, it's a new day, just try and do the same thing we have been doing all day.
Q. Have you been out on No. 4?
WILLIAM WALKER III: I have yesterday.  It was good.  I think it's more scorable than this course, so I'm looking for another low number and hopefully that will place me well hopefully into match play.
