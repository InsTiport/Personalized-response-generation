 Q.  Going into the weekend, right now your name is atop the leaderboard.  How good of a feeling is that?  
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Really good.  I think today I didn't play my best.  I didn't hit it that close to the pin.  There were not many birdies today like yesterday.  But yeah, I'm pretty happy I ended up -- I shot a couple under par today.   
 Q.  The rescue of your boys in the home country in a cave, has that been an inspiration for you this week?  It's a good story.  
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Yeah, I mean, it's really famous right now.  Yeah, I'm really happy for them, that everybody is safe, all good, happy for them.   
 Q.  What was the difference with the course this morning versus yesterday, because obviously there was a lot more movement it felt like in the morning than yesterday?  
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Yeah, I looked at the weather today and they said it's not so windy, but apparently when we played today, this morning, it's windy sometimes, some gusts and stuff.  But today the pin position is definitely harder than yesterday.   
 Q.  Was it a difficult turnaround going from the afternoon yesterday to the morning today?  
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: I think so, yeah, the pin was tucked, really like left three yards from the edge and stuff, so it's definitely harder than yesterday.   
 Q.  Obviously birdies are important, but what are you going to have to do to keep playing well here?  
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Just going to have to play my game and keep it in play, put it on the green and try to hit it close as I can and hopefully it just drops like yesterday.  That's all I can do actually.
