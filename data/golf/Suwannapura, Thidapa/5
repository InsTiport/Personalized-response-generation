Q. So what was the best part of your game today?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: I think pretty much everything to be honest.  I hit a lot of fairway and a lot of greens.  Make some putts.  Most of the par 5s, I chip it close, make the birdie.  Everything just come together today.
Q. Do you take inspiration from the strong play of like Pornanong and the Jutanugarn sisters?  Is there sort of momentum among the Thai players?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: To be honest, just concentrating on my game.  It's the best thing to do.  You never know what's going to happen with this wind.  You never know what's going to happen next hole even.  So it's just kind of, you know, keeping that wave and just ride it through the whole day and make birdie and keep going.
Q. Did you like this course the first time you saw it or did it take some getting used to?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: I think this course for me is pretty fair; that some of the hole that kind of give me like a better idea when (to hit) a draw shot.  It's pretty much avoiding bunkers.
Q. Did you go in any today?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: I did on -- only on 16.
Q. Green-side?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Green-side bunker.  That's pretty tough shot, too.  But yeah, I manage to make par, so that's my goal, to make par.
Q. What are you hitting off the tees?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: That hole, I hit 5-wood.  I hit it to the right.  That wind took my ball pretty good.  And then I have it on the rough and that shot, a little fly shot, so I hit it a little bit left and bounce all the way to the back in the bunker.
Q. Are you hitting driver that much here?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: A lot, yeah.  A lot.  Most of the hole.  Only a couple of the holes I had 5-wood.
Q. Have you liked playing these type of courses just over your career?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Fair.  I mean, this golf course, especially links course, you have to be pretty creative and stuff.  You have to play like some of the weird shot or into.  I don't know, there's a lot going on, and you just have to use your imagination, actually, you know, and use your experience to play out here too, I think.
Q. Something you enjoy?
THIDAPA SUWANNAPURA: Yeah, enjoying to create a new shot.
