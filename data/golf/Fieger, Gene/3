  Q. Just an overview of your day.   
 GENE FIEGER: It was tough. I didn't get off to a great start. I had a 5-over in a four hole stretch of holes.   
 So that kind of put me behind the eight ball and the course was hard.   
 We're not playing lift, clean and place, you're battling a little mud on the balls, but it's just the way it goes.
