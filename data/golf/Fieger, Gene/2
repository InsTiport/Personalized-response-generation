  Q. Talk about your day.   
 GENE FIEGER: I got off to a decent start and made some birdies on the front and then I just had a bad stretch again on the back. Four holes I played 5-over. 11, 12, 13 and 14.   
 So, I mean, you just can't do that out here on a golf course like this. There's not enough birdie holes. So you got to make pars on the hard holes and you got to take advantage of some of the easier holes. But it's hard to be out there and it's a hard golf course.   
  
  Q. Talk about your week if you would. Just as a whole.   
 GENE FIEGER: Oh, it was great. A great experience. The first time I ever played in a Senior PGA. So it was certainly something that I'll always remember and be able to talk about when I get home. The crowds are great, the course is great, it was fun. It was a lot of fun.
