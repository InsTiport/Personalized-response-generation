Q. Just give us your thoughts after the morning foursomes.
CRAIG WATSON: Well, as we thought last night, it's going to be close. It's going to go probably right into the last game this afternoon. Both teams are so even. We got a half at the last game, so obviously it's going to be a boost for us. We're still ahead. But it's going to go right down the line, I think.
Q. How important is just that one-point advantage? Do you think that's going to be crucial?
CRAIG WATSON: Not in terms of the whole result, I suppose, but we've got to win the match because they're the holders. And in that way, it may be crucial. But the Americans will come out all guns blazing, as they always do.
Q. Do you think it might hinge on one particular match?
CRAIG WATSON: I think probably all the matches. They've just got to concentrate and getting their own blue on the boards and not really worrying about anybody else. If they can take care of their own games, hopefully it will be fine.
