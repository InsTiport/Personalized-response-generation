 Q.  Craig, just give me your thoughts on the morning's performance here from the team.  
CRAIG WATSON: Obviously it was a great morning for both sides. The course is playing night and day from what it has done in the practice rounds. It's a new course for everybody. But no, there's a lot of good golf played. Can't really grumble with it. I think it was a fair test of golf this morning.   
 Q.  Were there any nerves for the players? They looked quite composed actually.  
CRAIG WATSON: I think they handled it like a wee swan on the surface. There were certainly a few nerves on both sides off the first tee. Understandable because you wait to play all week and then you put some crowds there and the pressure, and I'm sure it's a feeling they'll look back and think, absolutely brilliant.   
 Q.  So we'll watch the singles now; what's your thoughts going into that?  
CRAIG WATSON: Just let them go out and play the way they have been playing. I think that's what they've done. I think we've just been putting the guys that we think can do their business out and then see what happens.   
 Q.  The conditions out there, does that level the playing field a bit more?  
CRAIG WATSON: Absolutely. The wind out there is coming from a completely different direction from what it had done in the practice rounds. I think it's, as well, ideal for good golf, and hopefully both sides will produce it for the number of people that are here to watch.
