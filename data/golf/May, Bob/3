 Q.  First six holes, six pars, and then things really started cranking on the right side for you at 16.  Take me through 16, 17 and 18 and 1, too. 
 BOB MAY:  I hit some good shots all day.  You know, just didn't make a lot of putts.  Then made a putt at 16, hit the green in two on 17, made another birdie there.  Hit a good shot into 18 and made another birdie. 
 And then hit No. 2 in two, made a birdie there, and then hit four great shots in a row on 3, 4, 5 and 6, and just couldn't buy it.  I hit three good putts and one bad putt there.  I hit a great putt on No. 8 and I thought it just didn't break.  I just had a little bit of hard time finding the lines.  If I can find the lines, I think I might be all right. 

 Q.  Is this as well as you've hit the irons since that 2000 PGA when everybody remembers you hitting the irons so well that week at Valhalla? 
 BOB MAY:  I've been hitting the ball pretty well lately, and unfortunately my putting hasn't been as good as I'd wish.  It seems like it's coming around, it's getting better, and as long as I keep hitting the irons the way I am, I'll have plenty of chances. 

 Q.  How huge was that last putt at 9, your 18th hole of the day, just for some confidence for the weekend? 
 BOB MAY:  Sure, it's nice.  You never want to finish on a bogey.  It always makes it for a sour night.  But it was nice to roll it in.  I hit a good putt and I was just hoping it was going to stay on its line for a change instead of finding a way to get out of there. 

 Q.  But now it's off to the putting green because you're still not convinced? 
 BOB MAY:  Well, I'm convinced it's coming.  It's just good to work on it right after you get off the golf course and you might find something.
