Q. So obviously not the way you wanted things to end, but going into today what was your thought process?
JAMES SONG: Well, beginning of today just kind of play every shot like how I what happened to.  Don't think too much about score or anything like that.  Just take it one hole at a time and just play the best golf I can.
Q. Okay.  And then you were with him for a stretch on the first nine and then he went on a little bit of a run.  What did you see from him?
JAMES SONG: He's a good player.  He's a great player.  He's really solid.  Didn't really hit many bad shots.  My game was not there that back nine or the front nine actually, so I just had a poor round.
Q. What aspects of your game were lacking?
JAMES SONG: I wasn't keeping it in the fairway.  I was just spraying the ball everywhere.  Got in some bad spots where I don't want to be.  There are some nasty spots out on this course, so I got in a lot those.  Not the way I wanted to go.
Q. But good week for you.
JAMES SONG: Yeah.
Q. What were your thoughts overall on the week?
JAMES SONG: For sure it's been a lot of fun.  I played this two times before and I didn't win any matches.  I lost in the round of 64.  Being able to win some matches, definitely it's a lot fun.
I know what to work on with my game, what I'm good at and what needs more work, so it's definitely very helpful.
Q. What do you have planned for the rest of the summer?
JAMES SONG: I'm playing Wyndham Cup, which is like the AJGA thing right after this, and the U.S. Am at Pebble.
