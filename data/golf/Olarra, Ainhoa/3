Q. How was it when you finally got to tee off this morning?
AINHOA OLARRA: How was it?  It was actually really nice.  We had so much fun yesterday.  We went to Augusta, had dinner, activities, and even the Opening Ceremony, we had so much fans.  Everything is so well organized, amazing.  I guess this is Augusta, so what can I say.
Q. Do you do any shopping last night?
AINHOA OLARRA: We did.  We did.  We did a lot of shopping.  There was a man asking if I need help, I'm like, I just like everything.  I don't know what to do.
Today it was a nice round.  It was really different.  The course was like really different from yesterday because it's like pretty dry today compared to yesterday.  We were wearing so many layers yesterday and nothing today.  It was just a joy.
