 Q.  How good did it feel to see that putt go in?  
AINHOA OLARRA: It was really good.  I felt really good, actually.  Also because I made double on my round today, that hole, so it just was a nice way to finish.   
 Q.  What was your mental talk getting on that tee with a 4-iron in your hand, knowing what had just happened in regulation?  
AINHOA OLARRA: It's because today, on that hole on 17, when I was playing -- we took the wrong club.  So we knew that that was the right club this time, and I was aiming a little more right, but I pulled it a little bit and it ended up really well.  So I mean, I was nervous, but not maybe as nervous as SEC maybe.
