Q. 1-under, still a good effort from you for today.
RICHARD T. LEE: Yeah, pretty pleased with how I played.  I just made one unforced mistake on the last hole on number 9.  I just made a funky swing on my second shot and my hand slipped and it went in the bushes, so I made double.  And other than that, I had a good round.  I was pleased.
Q. That error is nothing to do with you, I mean those sort of things happen.  But are you still happy the way you're playing, the way you're controlling your game?
RICHARD T. LEE: Yeah, I'm hitting my shots really good today.  Putts, I could have made a few more out there, but those will go in at the end of the week.
Q. Just goes to show how much you like playing on this golf course and gives you the momentum heading into the next three days as well.
RICHARD T. LEE: Yeah, anything can happen.  I can go out and shoot another low one tomorrow and another low one and I can still be in contention.  So, it's just staying patient and just doing what I have to do.
Q. It is your birthday today.  So you must be happy.
RICHARD T. LEE: Yeah, 25th birthday.  Yeah.  I don't know how to celebrate it, actually, to be honest.  I just am looking forward to this tournament next week and this week.
Q. Are you going to practice or going to try and find a place for a nice dinner?
RICHARD T. LEE: Probably have a nice dinner with my girlfriend tonight for my birthday.
