Q. Today was really close and there was never more than an two-hole difference.  What was your mindset during the whole match?
JOE HIGHSMITH: Yeah, I mean, we were both playing well.  I definitely made a lot of birdies and he was just hanging in there steady making pars every hole.
This is my fourth one and I was just trying to keep composure.  Definitely felt more comfortable considering the experience I've had here.
Q. Awesome.  And what is your mindset going into the round of 32?
JOE HIGHSMITH: I think I'm going to have to play a lot better, but I had good stretches and bad stretches today.  I think if I can just keep plodding along I think it'll go well.
Q. Do you tend to play more to the course or to 0 your opponent?
JOE HIGHSMITH: Today I honestly don't even know because you always try to play to the course, but it's difficult to not make adjustments based on what your opponent is doing.
I think tomorrow if I more so play myself versus anything else I'll play well.
Q. Awesome.  And then you birdied 8 and 11.  Take me through those two holes.
JOE HIGHSMITH: Yeah, No. 8, par-5.  Actually didn't hit a great tee shot; hit a decent layup; hit a pretty poor wedge shot to 25 feet and ended up making that one.
Then 11 was kind of the same thing:  hit a decent drive and good layup, and then hit a good chip and made another long putt.  My putting kind of helped me today.
