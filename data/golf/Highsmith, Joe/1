 Q.  Okay, so talk to me a little bit about your round.  You never really look ever took the lead, but you were hanging in there the whole time.  
JOE HIGHSMITH: Yeah, I wasn't playing great.  I was playing solid, but obviously Michael is a great player and he's still playing well.   
It's kind of hard to come back if you're not making birdies.  I feel like I hung in well and made a couple bad swings and he made some clutch shots down the stretch.   
 Q.  Is this the furthest you've made it in match play?  
JOE HIGHSMITH: Yeah.  This is my fourth year playing and this is the furthest I've made it.  I've never gotten past 32 before this week, but I feel like I played well as a whole so I was happy about it.   
 Q.  So this is your last year of eligibility to play...  
JOE HIGHSMITH: Yeah, last one.  It's actually my last junior tournament so it's a little bittersweet, but I enjoyed it.  I've had a great last couple years.   
 Q.  What's next for you?  
JOE HIGHSMITH: I go to the Pacific Coast Amateur actually tomorrow.  After that, I have Western and then U.S. Am, so it's busy summer, but hopefully I can keep playing well.
