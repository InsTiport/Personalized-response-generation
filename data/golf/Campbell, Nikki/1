 Q.   What was working really well for you on your first nine holes today?  
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   My putter worked pretty well and I had a lot of good iron shots.   I had a lot of chances.   I think I hit 17 greens today, and the one I missed I was putting, anyway.   So it was pretty good tee‑to‑green.   
   
 Q.   You were playing really solid on the front nine, as well, just not as well.   What happened?   
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   I just had two 3‑putts.   One was from off the green but it wasn't very far away.   Just misjudged the pace on both of them which is disappointing but I did hole a few putts.   All in all it's probably worked out about right.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about your position at the moment?   
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   I don't think I did that well here last year.   I think I made the cut, but didn't do that well so it's nice to have a good first round.  
   
 Q.   Does it help to have played last year?  
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   Yeah, definitely this year, it's been nice to have actually played them previously, because you sort of know where certain pins are going to be, and sometimes where you don't want to hit it.   So it's definitely better having played here before.   
   
 Q.   So this is the final tournament of the year, have you got any hopes, expectations?   
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   I've had a pretty good year so just want to have a good tournament to finish off and go home for Christmas and relax.  
   
 Q.   What are your plans?   
NIKKI CAMPBELL:   We're probably going to go to the beach for Christmas because my husband's family is from the coast.   We're going to do that and just relax.   I'll play the Aussie stuff but probably won't start until end of January, so I'll have a bit of time to rest up.
