Q. Comments about today's round?
NICOLE WHISTON: I think I was a little bit nervous in the beginning because I felt like people were expecting a lot from me because I'm the No. 3 seed. I had a little trouble early, but after hole 8, I started getting settled down and I felt comfortable after that. At the end, I didn't play like I wanted, but I still got it done.
Q. How did it help having your sister caddie for you today?
NICOLE WHISTON: We definitely have chemistry because we're so close, so it helped.
Q. What did you have to do to close out the day?
NICOLE WHISTON: I had to just keep concentrating and not think about the match, or winning the match, or how much pressure it was to win, but rather, just to focus on each golf shot.
Q. What did you do well today?
NICOLE WHISTON: I hit my irons and wedges really well. On the par-5s, I had a lot of birdie chances.
Q. Looking ahead tomorrow, what do you have to do to keep advancing?
NICOLE WHISTON: I think I just need to focus on each shot and each hole.
