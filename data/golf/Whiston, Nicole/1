 Q.  Down one going into 17, talk me through those last two birdies -- or not birdies, but --  
NICOLE WHISTON: Yeah, on 17 I was just focused on doing -- just sticking to the normal routine and stuff, so keeping in my mindset.   
And then on 18 I had kind of a weird shot since it kind of stayed up on the bunker hill thing.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
NICOLE WHISTON: So I had to come out and I was just us trying to like clip it and take it out clean.  Then ended up good, so, yeah.   
 Q.  How long was the birdie putt on 18?  
NICOLE WHISTON: It was probably like four feet.   
 Q.  Okay.  Heck of a second shot there.  
NICOLE WHISTON: Thank you.   
 Q.  Quarterfinalist in the U.S. Girls' Junior.  Round of 32 might have been previously the furthest you got.  
NICOLE WHISTON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell me about being a quarterfinalist and what means to you?  
NICOLE WHISTON: It kind of means a lot to me since my sister played three years ago and got into the quarterfinals and I was caddying for her starting in round of 32.  So it was really special to me that we were kind of like connected that way, that we both made quarterfinals.   
 Q.  You think some of that experience you had here helped give you a little bit of an advantage?  
NICOLE WHISTON: I think a little bit.  Like I've played match play before in USGA events, so I made it twice for Girls' Junior for match play.  I played some other tournaments match play, so I think that's helped, yeah.   
 Q.  What was your favorite part so far this week?  
NICOLE WHISTON: You know, I can't say, but the course is in really great condition.   
 Q.  Yeah.  What's the mindset going into tomorrow now?  What's it going to take to keep this momentum going?  
NICOLE WHISTON: I think it's just to keep focused and in the moment.  Like I know when you're playing match play one on one the other person could get into a streak or something.  Just stay calm and keep doing what you're doing, so...
