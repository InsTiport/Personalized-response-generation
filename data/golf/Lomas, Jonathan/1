JONATHAN LOMAS:  Obviously a tough day for everybody and it was so tempting to take on shots but you couldn't afford to in the wind. I kept to my plan and that's what I've tried to do every day. If you drop shots early on it tempts you to try to go for pins you should be taking in and I tried to resist that temptation. I hit towards the fat of the green and it seemed to work. I missed a lot, even a 12-inch putt at the third hole and had to stay cool. There are a few birdie chances out there and I am surprised I'm in second place. The golf's in good order and I will sit down with my caddie tonight and plot our way round on the final day. We will have a chat and look at the wind chart and try to work things out. It's a course where you do well by eliminating the mistakes.

That's a great round of golf by Thomas. You could see him behind us and he was knocking it close and made a few putts.
