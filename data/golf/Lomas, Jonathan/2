Q. Just one bogey in two rounds is tremendous around here, what has been the key?
JONATHAN LOMAS: We made a plan before we started the tournament and we have tried to stick to it as much as we can. It has felt more comfortable with what is ahead of me and I have tried to stick to that so I knew what to expect out there. It seemed to go back through my game to my swing and made calmer swings and I have happened to play a bit better as well. I planned my way round a bit better.
Q. You have said you have been practicing less but thinking more?
JONATHAN LOMAS:  You have to question yourself if you are over practicing and why you are doing it, are you insecure about your golf swing? I am comfortable with my swing so I am trying to concentrate more on the golf course. I think a lot of my errors in the early part of the season have come through not making the right sort of move and hitting the wrong clubs from not knowing what is out there. I've looked into that and it seems to be paying off.
Q. All four rounds at Pinehurst, contention last week, playing well again this week, are you tired at all?

JONATHN LOMAS: I was very tired after the Open Qualifying at Sunningdale on Monday. Maybe I should have pulled out but I don't like to give up, so I gave it a go there, but Tuesday and Wednesday I was really tired but a couple of good night's sleep really helped. I feel back to normal now, but I was tired.
Q. How do you rate your chances over the weekend now?
JONATHAN LOMAS:  Well, I'll sit down with my caddie, John, and see what we think and maybe make another plan and just go through it again. If the wind changes direction we might think about something else so there is nothing of a surprise there. But we'll wait and see.
