 Q. Talk about your overall experience here at Oak Hill the whole week. 
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: I'm fine now that it's over. 

 Q. Just your impressions of the course?
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: It's challenging, unbelievable. I had fun. I was shooting a million, but it was fun, I enjoyed it. 
 Just playing it in these conditions, the quickness of the greens and the muff around them it's hard to play. If you have been playing well it's hard, and if you haven't been playing a lot then it's even harder. So that's the way it goes. 

 Q. What did you specifically think of your round today?
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: Oh, I had a bad stretch in the middle of the front nine. Terrible. But then other than that I played about par. Played about 5-over in the middle, 4, 5, 6. But I played about par. And that's good for me around here. That's all I can expect.
