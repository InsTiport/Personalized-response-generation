  Q. How did it go out there today?  
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: The back nine I played okay. The front nine was terrible. I hit a few good shots and made a couple birdies and hopefully it will be better tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How did the course layout and the conditions affect your play today?  
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: It was real challenging. I thought -- the main thing that hurts a lot of club pros is they play pretty good, but they don't play in this kind of rough. And when you get in there you just slash at it, you try to get it out.   
  
  Q. What are you going to try to tweak for tomorrow?  
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: Oh, just slow down and see if I can get the knack of it. I just don't have the knack of it. But I enjoyed playing, it's been a great tournament.
