 Q. Tell me about your round today. The weather factor?
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: Oh, it's a heck of a hard golf course in real nice weather even. And in this kind of weather it's too much for me. 
 Some guys, I guess they have a lot of game. It's very challenging, but it's fair.

 Q. What do you expect to do better tomorrow?
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: I'll have to shot maybe 1-over, 2-over. I don't know. Make the cut. And try to improve from there. 
 But it can get away from you fast out there. Real fast.

 Q. Anything else to add about how you played today?
 DAVID LUNDSTROM: Oh, I'm just trying to, on the back nine, I bogeyed the last two and I would have been even otherwise. But it's tough conditions. It's hard to get up-and-down out of this rough when you're not used to playing in it. Real hard.
