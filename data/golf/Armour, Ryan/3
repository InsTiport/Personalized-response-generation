 Q.  A pair of 68's out here on this golf course.  It doesn't seem that great, like at the pro-am day when the pins are all in the middle of the greens.  But this golf course has got so many tough angles, doesn't it?  
RYAN ARMOUR: This golf course, if you get out of position, will absolutely eat you up.  You bring doubles and triples in play with one mis-hit, and I mean, I'll tell you what, four 68s around here with the new greens, as firm as they are, and they're just not quite settled right now.  They're rolling so pure that I'm having a tough time seeing lines.  I felt like I could have made some more putts, but they're rolling good, so it's not the greens' fault.   
 Q.  Just like on the last hole, you hit it right where you wanted to, didn't you?  
RYAN ARMOUR: I did.  It just snapped, and I didn't see it going -- the left-hand turn there at the end.   
 Q.  The greens are brand new and they are smooth, but they need a couple sets of top dressing to really get smooth.  They're not bumpy, they're just wiggly, right?  Is that a fair way to say it?  
RYAN ARMOUR: Yeah, they kind of -- what's the right word?  They all feel like you're putting up to the hole, and if you don't keep your pace up, they're not going to go in because they all kind of just want to go off the sides.  For me, I like to die putts.  That's the way I grew up, up north, on very fast greens, and here you've got to putt with some pace.   
 Q.  Lots going into the weekend, it's going to be a fun one.  
RYAN ARMOUR: Yeah, this place is hard, so I'm going to try and drive it in the fairway, hit greens, make putts.
