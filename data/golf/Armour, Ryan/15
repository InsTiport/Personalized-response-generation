 Q.  I know you didn't get off to the start you wanted, but could you talk a little bit about being here in your hometown or playing on your home course.  
RYAN ARMOUR: Well, I mean, it's been a long time since this was my home course.  Went through a redesign in '03 that -- I mean, that's probably the hardest part.   
You want it to be home but it's not.  I don't know anything out here anymore.  I don't know the reads, the lines off the tee.  It's great to be home with family, friends, ex-teammates, coaches, and that stuff, the Ohio State Nation.   
But from a golf course perspective, it's nowhere near what it was when I played.   
 Q.  Because you do travel so much for work, what is the feeling like when you come back?  
RYAN ARMOUR: It's good.  Columbus is a neat town.  It's a very big city that becomes very little when it's associated with the university.  Being an athlete here it was a special time.  You carried that with you.  You're part of a fraternity that very few people were.   
It's just special.  Really no other way to describe it.  The fight song was playing the other day.  I got goosebumps.  It's just a special place.   
 Q.  Lastly, playing tomorrow, what do you take from today?  Do you go practice?  
RYAN ARMOUR: Oh, yeah.  Not much is going to change for me.  Going to try and drive it straight and putt it well; today I didn't do either.   
That's what I need to go work on.
