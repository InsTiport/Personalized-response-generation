Q. Ryan, if you could, just kind of take us through 18, off the tee, into the trees.
RYAN ARMOUR: I pulled it.  I don't have the length to cover where most of the guys are taking it.  So I was trying to play out to the left there, to the right bunker there, and I pulled it about six, seven yards.  And I don't have the power to get over those trees, and it clinked back, way back in the fairway.  I had to hit probably a 40-yard hook to get it on the green, and I only hooked it about 20 yards.  And just had a really, really poor lie in the rough.  It was sitting way down.  It wasn't very deep.  It was kind of nestled into one of those holes that you get.  And I didn't have much from there.  It is what it is.
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the consolation, if it is one?
RYAN ARMOUR: Yeah.  I mean it is.  I mean mission accomplished.  The job was to get back to the TOUR, and that's what happened.  I already have a start in Napa.  So that is something that you can take as a positive, and old Scarlet here, I mean she's tough, and I finally got a little piece of her.  But the old girl is a really hard golf course.
