Q. So you opened up the day with a birdie.  I saw you save it there at the end.  How do you think you played today?  How did you feel?
GREG KRAFT: I played really good.  I think I could have done a little bit better, just every time I missed the green, I had nothing.  I mean, I had -- first nine, I shot 1 under and missed one green just on the edge and had a lot of good chances.
So I played well.  I mean, 70 is always nice.  It's also nice to know that I could have played a little better.
Q. How did you think the course played for you today?
GREG KRAFT: I think it was great.  It's a great course.  You're awarded for good shots, and you're penalized for bad ones.  It got tricky there at the end because the wind picked up quite a bit.  You know, playing 8 as a par-4 and it's regularly a par-5 green, it was a real difficult hole, straight into the wind.  But fair.  So, yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.
