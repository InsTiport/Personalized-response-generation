  Q. Talk about your round today compared to yesterday.   
 ROBBIE THOMPSON: Didn't drive the ball as well. And the club selection on a few holes wasn't very good. And that's kind of, that caused my score to go up a little bit.   
  
  Q. What do you think was the biggest challenge?  
 ROBBIE THOMPSON: I think that I could have made some more putts I would have had a decent round. I just couldn't make anything out there.   
 I made one birdie out there. And it wasn't probably more than a 10-footer. And then I had a lot of par putts and some decent birdie putts, but I just didn't make anything all day.  
  
  Q. What are you going to have to do tomorrow?  
 ROBBIE THOMPSON: I need to drive the ball better and I need to go figure out something on the putting green.   
  
  Q. Anything else?  
 ROBBIE THOMPSON: That's it.
