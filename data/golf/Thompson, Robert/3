 Q. Can you talk about your experience at Oak Hill, your impressions of the golf course?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Great golf course. Very penal with the rough. And the greens are very challenging. A lot of subtle breaks and overall really, no question, very much a championship golf course. 

 Q. Talk about your round today and what did you see out there?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: I thought it played a little bit easier today because the wind laid down and I just couldn't take advantage of it. I shot 7-over. 4-over on the front and 3-over on the back. 
 And I drove the ball pretty well, but just the greens I think three or four times I missed from the fairway and that really hurts out here. You have to take advantage of it when you're in the fairway.
