  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Front side ate my lunch again. I think I'm 14-over on the front and 2-over on the back for the championship.   
 So I need to do a little better job on the front side.  
  
  Q. What do you think is the biggest problem on the front side so far?  
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Getting it in the fairway, one, and then my club selection.   
  
  Q. What are you going to look to do tomorrow?  
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Just go out and try to have some fun.
