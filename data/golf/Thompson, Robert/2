 Q. Just tell us how your round went today, some positives and some negatives, things you can work on tomorrow?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: It's pretty much all negative today. 

 Q. Was the course tough?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Every time I drove it out of the fairway it was pretty much a bogey. And I didn't read the greens very well. 

 Q. They playing hard and fast?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Not too bad. I left a lot of my putts short. I thought that they seemed like they slowed up to me a little bit today.
