 Q. How were the conditions? 
 ROBERT THOMPSON: They started off pretty tough with the rain and then they got a little bit better. And that's just -- I got a little bit better on the last nine, but it's a little tough judging the wind. It seems like it swirls a little bit on the golf course. 

 Q. How do you feel about your round?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Played one good nine and one terrible nine. 

 Q. What kind of things will you go work on now?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: Just driving. Just most of the bogeys came from when you miss the fairway, you just got to pitch it out. 

 Q. The rough's murder right now?
 ROBERT THOMPSON: The rough is extremely penal. Yes.
