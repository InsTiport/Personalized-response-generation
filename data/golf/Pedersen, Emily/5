Q. It was about the start of the match, Lizette started really strongly, put some pressure on.  Did that affect the match at all?
EMILY PEDERSEN: I don't know.  She played well.  But I felt like we kept on fighting and we kept on giving ourselves chances.  And they didn't really fall in in the beginning.  And obviously we came off to a bad start.
But, I mean, personally we just didn't make enough birdies to keep the match going.  And both Angel and Lizette played very well.
Q. And at the beginning, did it shift the momentum, the fact she had like three birdies in a row to start?
EMILY PEDERSEN: Yeah, but then we had a birdie on 4.  So kind of kept it in.  But I feel like we had trouble keeping our momentum going a little bit.  But, yeah.
Q. What are you going to go do now?
EMILY PEDERSEN: I'm going to go practice, and I'm going to go get ready to play better tomorrow.
