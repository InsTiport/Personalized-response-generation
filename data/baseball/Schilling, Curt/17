Q.  With you and Randy going in games one and two, there had to be a confidence factor.  How difficult is it you guys losing these two games?
 
CURT SCHILLING:  It's tough, no question.  We got outplayed, though, you know.  Certainly didn't expect to leave here down 2-0.  It is what it is.  We're going to have to find a way to right the ship.  48 hours to get this thing going.  They've come out and done what they had to do.  
 
Q.  Are you ready for Game  5?
 
CURT SCHILLING:  I'll be ready for Game  5.  
 
Q.  You look like you had everything you wanted today.  Would you talk about your stuff a little bit?
 
CURT SCHILLING:  Well, I felt good.  Today my best wasn't good enough.  You know, it's disappointing.  Felt like I had all my pitches.  Felt like I had good command.  The ball that JD hit out was a ball I've gotten him out with quite a bit.  I made the pitch I wanted to make.  I still got beat.  I was talking to Koppy in the ninth.  I said, "It doesn't make it any easier, but sometimes you do your job here and still get beat."  It's part of competing at this level.  You know, doesn't make you feel any better, but that's life.  The bottom line for me was, you know, this came down to fundamentals.  I had a chance to move a runner over, get a bunt down.  They ended up driving in a run.  We would have been up 2-1 going into the ninth.  They got the bunt down, got the runner in.  You saw it last year in Game 7 of the World Series, fundamentals win and lose games.  I thought today was an example of that.  
 
Q.  With some of that talk about tipping pitches, the fact that Rolen would have benefited, any  intent in that pitch?
 
CURT SCHILLING:  No, absolutely not.  
 
Q.  Have you tried about everything you can with JD Drew? 
 
CURT SCHILLING:  I think he's like three for his last nine or ten off with seven strike-outs.  The home run in St.  Louis, I missed my pitch.  The home run that he hit last year in Game  5 was a split that I left in the middle that he didn't put a great swing on.  But he's got so much power.  You know, I haven't seen the replay of the one today, but everybody said he was out in front.  He's so strong.  He's such a good hitter.  He got that ball elevated.  That was all he had to do with that pitch.  I mean, I made my pitches for the most part.  Today, like I said, I made the pitch I wanted to make in that situation, but I got beat on it.  
 
Q.  What is your mood, what is the mood in the clubhouse right now?
 
CURT SCHILLING:  Disappointed.  We're down 2-0.  Our next three games, hopefully three games, will be elimination games.  You certainly never want to leave home any worse than 1-1.  Like I said, it is what it is.  We're going to have to find a way to come out and get a game here Friday and get Randy back on the mound and go from there.  But we're down 2-0.  Got to find a way.
