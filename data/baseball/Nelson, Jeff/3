Q.  It looked by the replay that the runner could have scored.  What do you think? 
 
JEFF NELSON:  In my judgment the runner would not have scored.  And even looking at the replay again, I'm 1,000 percent convinced of that.  
 
Q.  So you've seen the replay? 
 
JEFF NELSON:  Yes, I have.  I feel very good about it.  
 
RANDY MARSH:  The fact that there was obstruction does not give that runner the right to keep running another 45 or 50 feet and to think I'm automatically going to be called safe at home plate.  You put him where he would have actually obtained the base had there been no obstruction in that situation.  Jeff used excellent judgment and Santiago did not score that run.  
 
Q.  What did Dusty say to you? 
 
JEFF NELSON:  He just asked about the play.  Just asked what I had.  
 
RANDY MARSH:  He's a pretty fair man.  
 
JEFF NELSON:  Yeah, he was really good.  Dusty's good.
