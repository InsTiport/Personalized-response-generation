Q.  When did you find out you were coming in to the game? 
 
ERUBIEL DURAZO:  Well, I was riding the bike getting ready.  You never know being a pinch-hitter.  I was riding the bike.  He said, "You got to get in the game." I was getting ready, stretching to hit.  That's what I do.  
 

Q.  Can you go over the at-bat and how it progressed?
 
ERUBIEL DURAZO:  Well, I was watching the game, all the game, on TV and live.  So I was looking for something outside because they've been pitching to a lot of lefties outside.  I was looking for a pitch I can drive to the opposite field.  That was the pitch I was looking for.  
 

Q.  Obviously you'd prefer to start.  Any player would.  Does this feel like a reward, getting the game-winning home run for the pennant? 
 
ERUBIEL DURAZO:  Yeah.  I think so.  I got a lot of frustration during the year.  I didn't play for a long time.  I had concussion.  I think this thing is paying for the whole year.  It made me so happy and my family, too.  
 

Q.  When you got hit in the head, did that mess up your season? 
 
ERUBIEL DURAZO:  Yeah, I think so.  I was great in the season.  I got hit in the head.  I couldn't even see it.  I was dizzy like for two weeks.  It happened to me.  I think that made me strong in the season.  
 

Q.  You never faced Glavine before.  What was the approach you took going up there? 
 
ERUBIEL DURAZO:  Well, I was talking to hitting coach Murph (Dwayne Murphy).  He told me, and I watch the game too.  He been throwing a lot of pitches outside.  It's like Maddux, pitch a lot outside.  So you got to be looking for a pitch outside.  That's what I did.
