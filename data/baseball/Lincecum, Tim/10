 Q. How do you feel? 
 TIM LINCECUM: Hot and sweaty. Other than that, just nerves and a lot of anxiousness. But that second inning, I was able to calm down and just chill out and throw better pitches. 

 Q. What were you thinking about, just being out there amongst everything, what just happened beforehand with the first pitch and all the pomp and circumstance? 
 TIM LINCECUM: This whole ceremony that's been going on this weekend, it's a lot to take in, but it's definitely something that every baseball player out there wants to be a part of, and I'm the same way. 
 I'm just trying to enjoy this and at the same time I'm definitely competing and I'm very serious about it, but just trying to have fun at the same time. 

 Q. Obviously this is a huge honor, but not having the three days off that the rest of the league has, how will you catch up with your rest and get back to the grindstone?
 TIM LINCECUM: I don't know how we are going to come out of this, the All-Star Break with what we are going to go with in the starting rotation. This is just one of those things I've got to wait and find out.
