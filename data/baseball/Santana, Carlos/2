THE MODERATOR: Questions for Carlos Santana.   
 Q.  Just the obvious question, Carlos, when you hit the home run, what were you thinking?  And how happy were you to be contributing?  
CARLOS SANTANA: Excited, excited.  Especially like with the first run in the game, and I feel the energy and very positive with the team.   
 Q.  How far did you think you hit that thing, because obviously the wind got a part of it?  
CARLOS SANTANA: I mean, announcing early the wind is in to the field, but I'm making good contact and I know, and I'm getting the home run.   
 Q.  Having a three-games-to-one lead over the Cubs, your thoughts going into tomorrow's game?  And how optimistic the team is being able to maybe clinch the World Series here?  
CARLOS SANTANA: I mean, we're confident, especially like we win tonight this very tough game.  The series is 3-1, we're here tomorrow.  Lester, he's throwing very good baseball.  He has experience in the World Series.   
So I mean, we're fine.  We're fine.  We'll worry about tomorrow and try to win the game.
