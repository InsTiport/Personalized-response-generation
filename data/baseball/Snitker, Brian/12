THE MODERATOR:Questions for Brian Snitker?
Q. Just how much did Martin's injury change the course of action in the game and what you had set up?
BRIAN SNITKER: A lot. We had the whole thing set up right where we wanted it. It's exactly what we were working towards throughout the whole game was to get us to those two guys. And that was a big blow.
Q. You kind of saw the best and the worst of Ronald Acuï¿½a tonight. Obviously he had a great day at the plate. He made a play or two in the outfield. And we also saw the other side of it. Could you maybe take us through a couple of things he did tonight, first of all, in the first inning was he stealing on his own?
BRIAN SNITKER: Yeah, he had a green light. And he picked a breaking ball. And he picked it and threw him out. But he was on his own.
Q. In the fifth or sixth inning we have the long ball that was a single. What was your thought on that?
BRIAN SNITKER: That he should have been on second. And we're kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to see that happen.
Q. Did you talk to him again?
BRIAN SNITKER: I haven't had a chance to talk to anybody yet.
Q. You mentioned setting it up for Martin. Was there any thought of bringing Fried out another inning based on the work he had done or did you --
BRIAN SNITKER: No, it was kind of where -- the game was right where we wanted it right there. I mean it was into the heat of the -- the meat of the right-handed lineup. Actually if Fried would have got to Goldschmidt I would have brought Martin in on Goldschmidt then.
It actually lined up just like I wanted it to. It's just a shame that he got hurt.
Q. The Braves have always come from behind most of the year and they've done it again tonight. Did that surprise you at all?
BRIAN SNITKER: No, I mean that's kind of how these guys are. I wish we got started a little earlier in the evening, honestly. But it's good. We still came back, had the tying run at the plate when the game ended after getting down really good.
It was just a situation where you talk about how the ball bounces, and there were some balls just inside the line over the course of the game. And that's the way it goes.
Q. Did you think that the Cardinals might walk Swanson to force you to pinch-hit for Melancon?
BRIAN SNITKER: I thought that might have been possible. I like Dansby up there in those situations. He's gotten a lot of big hits in those situations. But I thought maybe that could have been.
It's kind of like -- I was prepared for it if they would have.
Q. A lot of people might focus on the two rallies in the eighth and ninth, but how much did Goldschmidt's home run change the complexion of the game for you, do you think?
BRIAN SNITKER: Anytime you can cut the lead to one, I think that's huge. That's a big at-bat right there. When Martin went down, I just hoped that maybe Luke could get us through three outs and get the ball to Melancon.
And the guy is so dangerous. You're always aware where he's at in the lineup, and it's big. Anytime you get something like that to get you a run closer that's huge in a game like that.
Q. How big or how short is Mark's leash in the ninth?
BRIAN SNITKER: Melancon? No, you know what, again he was victimized by some balls that were just hit just right. His leash is pretty good right there. Kind of where we're at in our bullpen and how it's been set up. He's been our guy in the ninth inning, and it's those guys at this time of year are probably going to have a little longer leash than normal.
Q. How do you personally handle nights like this, albeit the postseason being different, but you've been doing this long enough; it's there; it slips away and you almost get it back?
BRIAN SNITKER: You have to put it behind you. Tomorrow's a new day. We're going to come out, do everything we can to win tomorrow. I know it's the postseason, but again it's baseball. We've been through this a lot. We've lost a lot of tough games, came back and rallied and had good runs and we'll have to do the same tomorrow.
