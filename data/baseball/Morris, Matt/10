Q.  How are you physically? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   I feel great.  You know, I had a little spout on the DL, about fifteen days there, in the season.  It kind of through me out of whack, just being on time, rhythm and stuff, but I was able to throw a good three games and get it back.  I believe it was a blessing in disguise.  I feel, fresh so I'm excited. 
 
Q.  What did you learn pitching in the playoffs last year that you can use this time around? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   Well, I know not to hang a curveball to Sanders anymore.  That kind of hurt me.  I'm coming back into the same environment, a lot of familiarity is around.  So I'm looking forward to just the day before.  And all of the anticipation up to the start is what makes me nervous; once I get out there and start making pitches, it's all the same. 
 
Q.  Would you talk about that extra gear that you may have reached for in a situation like this? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   Well, I think, for one, there's nothing beyond this.  It's not April, when you've got six months to look ahead and kind of pace yourself.  This is all she wrote here.  I don't know about finding an extra gear.  I think everybody's adrenaline will be pumping.  The competition will be there.  I think it's about going out there and making the same pitches in April that you got guys out with.  They are going to get out tomorrow, too.  You're not really doing too much.  You're not searching for that extra level as far as putting more pressure on yourself.  I'm going to go out there and be focused and be calm and just focus more on my physical ability. 
 
Q.  What will it be like facing this lineup without Gonzalez and Counsell?
 
MATT MORRIS:   I'm sure it's going to be difficult, anyway.  These are professional hitters.  It's a great team.  You know, losing Gonzo is a big blow to them, obviously right in the heart of their lineup.  It allows us to pitch to more guys and pitch to some key guys.  Counsell, everybody knows his post-season heroics from Florida and on.  And you hate to face a team when they are down, but every team is dealing with adversity throughout the season, as we know.  It's unfortunate, but we are able to go after some more guys.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the match-up between yourself and Randy Johnson?
 
MATT MORRIS:   This is my first time facing Randy, or actually squaring off.  I get to see what his fastball looks like up close.  But as far as that goes, I'm looking at our offense to really worry about Randy and I'm going to try to worry about their offense.  After nine innings, hopefully we have one more point than they do. 
 
Q.  Considering 2001 was a break-out season for you, what were your expectations for 2002, and are you satisfied with this year? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   Well, last year, having the 22 victories and some well-pitched games in the playoffs, but this year was an up-and-down year for everybody from the beginning.  You know, our team goal was there and we accomplished it, and that's the bottom line.   This year has been a little different.  I just look forward to tomorrow's competition.  
 
Q.  What do you recall about the playoff environment in Bank One with the way this ballpark holds the noise?
 
MATT MORRIS:   We were out there stretching before, and Robinson brought up it was sold out and I don't think it was sold out for the first series there.  There was some spots open and they were talking about that.  They mentioned how loud it was.  I don't think it matters if they are missing 5,000 people or whatever they are missing.  I think it's unbelievable; I think it just vibrates off the tin around here or something.  
 
Q.  Do you think the Cardinals are better this year than last year? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   That's tough to say.  We've got a lot of different guys, obviously.  Rolen helps us a ton.  Pujols playing the outfield puts another right-handed bat in our lineup.  I think mentally, we are a lot tougher, just from the up-and-downs.  I think when push comes to shove, we'll be able to grind it out.  
 
Q.  Looking back on Darryl Kyle's death, how has his death affected you and is it still affecting you?
 
MATT MORRIS:   I think it affected everybody.  Each person handled it their own way.  I think the beauty of it was they came together and helped each other out.  I think now I've turned it into something where I almost use it as a motivation for me.  You know, he was a great friend and a great family man and just a good person to know.  I think about him every day; say something he said, and that's helped me for a while.  Shortly after his death, I kind of shut it off.  I was in shock and didn't really realize the severity of it.  You know, now, like I said, we all are hoping Fynn (ph) comes around, his wife, for these games.  She's supposed to make it out for tomorrow and that would be nice to see.  The whole DK thing, I'm sure even when the season ends, I'll think about him from here on out.  What he did for me was tremendous, as far as making me a professional player, and I appreciate that.  But also, in turn, when I go out there tomorrow, he's not going to want me putzing around.  He's going to want me out there battling.  That's some of the motivation I've been using for the season.  Without a doubt, it was hard for all of us. 
 
Q.  How much of the staff and you have taken on a leadership role for the team?
 
MATT MORRIS:   I try to go out between the lines and do my job, say a little here and there, but Woody Williams and Chuck Finley and Andy Benes, besides coming back and pitching the way he has, he's kind of been a leader for the club.  It's like after that happened, there were three or four guys that changed their attitude on it, and came out and really picked us up and helped the team, even when they were down.  We all appreciate them for that.  
 
Q.  If it were the other way around and you were on the mound facing the Cardinals' lineup, Rolen, Pujols, Edmonds, what would be going through your mind?
 
MATT MORRIS:   I might drop the ball and walk off.  I get to watch these guys every day.  It is so unbelievable.  You know, like you said with Rolen added in there and Tino and his experience and Renteria, it seems like we have Gold Glovers all around, besides guys that can hit the heck out of the ball.  I had not thought of that.  I'm glad I'm wearing the same uniform.  I think Randy has got a challenge against them. 
 
Q.  When Chuck Finley came to your team, things were a little bit at odds, which way he was going.  What has he meant to your team?
 
MATT MORRIS:   He's a true professional.  What has he got, 18 years in the big leagues?  You would never know it by the way he walks around.  But just his presence in there is great for the rest of the pitchers, his work ethic, going out there, stretching, doing the regular things that all of us do, and just being part of the team, I think it's so much rejuvenated him and he's just excited to be here as we are to have him. 
 
Q.  What impact has Jason Isringhausen had on the bullpen and overall? 
 
MATT MORRIS:   He came out and did a heck of a job as a closer.  Nowadays, closers are these hard-throwing guys who are short in the game and that's exactly what he does.  Izzy comes in, he has great stuff; a great mental makeup as far as a closer, and he shortens the game and that allows us to let some of our lefties come into the eighth inning and even shorten more.  And I think that's important come playoff time. 
 
Q.  If everything works out, and the Cardinals become World Champions at the end of this year, how emotional do you think it will be?
 
MATT MORRIS:   This whole year is emotional, so I don't think it's going to stop any time soon, even clinching the central was emotional for all of us.  It was our goal.  But it was unbelievable, what we've been through.  I hate to look ahead that far, and even if  -- even if it was the regular season and everybody was healthy and we won the World Series, it would be quite emotional.  But, obviously, there has been some things that went on this year, people look at us and say, "Oh, a team of destiny," but it's not always a fairy-tale ending in the end.  We'll go out and battle.  Some of that stuff we've been through during the season is going to make us tough.  I'm just looking forward to it, especially some revenge from last year.  
 
Q.  Given where you were two starts ago and the things you wanted to improve on, where are you both physically and mentally?
 
MATT MORRIS:   I think I'm right where I need to be.  I'm excited.  The body feels great, excited about pitching here.  I've got, like I said, some familiarity about last year, and it could have been a blessing in disguise, that little break, to continue on in the playoffs and be a little more fresh than some of the guys who have 230 innings.   
 
Q.  Can you talk about the destiny issue?  Is that a distraction or can it be beneficial, the destiny thing?
 
MATT MORRIS:   The destiny thing, I don't think it's a big distraction, as to some of the distractions we've had and handled this year.  We are going to take it one game at a time.  It's a clean slate for everybody.  We accomplished our first goal that we are going to set out.  It's about winning a series, it's about 25 guys coming together and battling and trying to win three-out-of-five games.  We'll see what happens in the end.
