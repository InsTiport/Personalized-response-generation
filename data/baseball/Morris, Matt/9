Q.  Talk about the run support you got this year compared to last year. 

MATT MORRIS:  That was today's game, was our offense.  Every one of the position players battled every at-bat.  You know, to score 12 runs in a game like this on the road is tremendous.  I went out there early with some adrenaline flowing.  You know, we jumped ahead 2-0.  I almost gave it back to them.  They tied it up.  Then we came right back and scored some runs.  You know, I totally attribute the offense for battling against probably the best pitcher, you know, for a long time.  Randy has been out there battling.  You know, it's exciting for all of us.  It's definitely a good day for our offense. 

Q.  After pitching so well last year, finally getting your first post-season win, how do you feel about that?

MATT MORRIS:  Oh, I feel great, to start off the series on the road.  LaRussa handed me the game ball, which I haven't had in two years.  You know, it's all exciting.  Now we've got to focus back in for Wednesday and see what happens, whenever it is (laughter). 

Q.  With this lineup that you're facing, all their injuries, do you take a more aggressive approach, especially at the bottom of the lineup, the fact they're missing Gonzales?

MATT MORRIS:  They're all dangerous.  Missing Gonzo is a huge piece for them.  I'm able to pitch around some of the guys in the middle there.  But I think with me it's a key to almost relax out there and stop being so aggressive, because when I'm too aggressive, my ball seems to get up in the zone.  Once I locked it in, after the fourth or so, I was able to get some groundballs, be more aggressive with some runs on the board, throw some more change-ups and things like that.  You know, when you're up 10 runs, it's easy to be aggressive. 

Q.  Do you consider it a fluke that Randy's slider would be that flat and his fast ball wouldn't be able to locate?

MATT MORRIS:  He threw me six sliders in two different at-bats.  I couldn't bunt it.  Flat to me, I didn't think it was flat.  I think our offense took a great approach and really studied tape.  You know, we got a lot of desire and a lot of heart.  You know, it seemed to pay off today. 

Q.  Was there a point where things clicked tonight or was this a matter of pitching tonight without having your top stuff? 

MATT MORRIS:  I think there was a point where it clicked.  But having the runs, of course, made it a little easier.  But I think from the fourth or fifth on, I was able to locate some fast balls and kind of settle down.  I felt like I was getting a little stronger.  But, you know, again, the offense gave me a nice cushion.
