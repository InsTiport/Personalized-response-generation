  Q.  The Red Sox are celebrating here on the mound you just came off of.  Did you think it was out?   
 JON PAPELBON:  It took all 25 of us to get this job done.  It's just phenomenal, man.   
  
  Q.  Really two one-run games against this Rockies team.   
 JON PAPELBON:  Yeah, this team did everything they could to stay in it, and we had to do everything we could to keep the lead.  It's just a phenomenal team.   
  
  Q.  You talked about the river dance Red Sox fans said they want to see.   
 JON PAPELBON:  I'm going to do that, too, believe me.   
  
  Q.  Just a thought on the way that this team rallied from being down 3-1 against Cleveland.   
 JON PAPELBON:  I think that was the turning point in this entire postseason for us.
