Los Angeles Dodgers 4
  Philadelphia Phillies 5

 Q. Yesterday you talked about turning the page, forgetting that loss and looking forward to tonight to tie it. Now that the team is down 3-1, can you talk about your team's patience and your approach and the team's resiliency moving forward?
 JOE TORRE: Well, I thought we fought back in this game, down 2-0 early. They'll show up -- we're going to show up here day after tomorrow, there's no question. They'll be ready to play. It's obviously a tough one to get past, but you know, that's our job. They still have to win four games. 

 Q. Could you possibly have had this game set up more to your liking, Kuo and then Sherrill and then Broxton?
 JOE TORRE: Well, we sort of stretched it a little bit because we don't normally go to Kuo in the sixth, but he for the first time all year came back and pitched that next inning, and I thought that was really a key for us to be able to do that. You know, and we knew once we got to the eighth inning that Brox, when it got to Werth, that that was going to be his man. 
 But it's one of those things. They're a very tough lineup to go through. You try to be careful. He almost dug himself out of that last inning. 

 Q. The fashion of these last two losses, the blowout last night and just how difficult this was, does this series feel like it's slipping from your hands somewhat with them having another game here and Lee coming up in Game 6?
 JOE TORRE: We can't be trying to figure out percentages because that wouldn't work on our behalf, so we have to go out there and play baseball and win one ballgame. That's what we need to do. One ballgame and we go home. When you're in the post-season you certainly have been capable of winning three games in a row. Our mindset is playing one game at a time.
