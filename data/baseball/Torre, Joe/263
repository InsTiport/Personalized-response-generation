JOE TORRE:  Well, first off, I just want to say how proud I am of our ball club.  I know we've had success, but this year our club has gone through a lot.  They showed up tonight.  I'm really proud of them.  To beat a club like Oakland, I mean, Arty Howe should be proud.  I know he is of this team.  They had every reason to roll over and die yesterday and they didn't.  They had every reason to today and they didn't.  Billy Beane and Art Howe did a great job.  I'm glad we don't have to see them till next year.  I mean, it's such a team effort every time you go out there.  The guys were fired up right from the get-go.  Probably the toughest thing we had to do last night was get on that plane because we really didn't plan on it.  Then to come out here and have Andy do what he had to do, and tried like hell, and left his heart out there on the mound.  Then to have Stanton come in.  Our bullpen has been maligned all year.  To have Stanton and Nelson do what they've done, they did tonight, and El Duque give us an out that we needed, and of course Mo has been a machine.  As I said, I'm very choked up about this.  You know, we're looking forward to the next round.  I guess it starts in a couple days, but we really don't care right now.  Thanks.
