Boston   5
  Detroit ‑ 2

Q.   Can you just talk about the emotion of this series, and it's finally over?
JOHN FARRELL:   Well, first of all I just want to congratulate Jim Leyland, the entire Tiger organization.   They have a great team.   This series had a little bit of everything, comeback wins, unbelievable starting pitching, particularly on their part.   Tonight we finally broke through on Scherzer who's been so dominant against us.   This is the third time he started against us in I think the last six weeks, and it's been a matter of the most two runs, except for that seventh inning, where Victorino, finally we were able to break through. 
You couldn't have asked for a better series.   It tested everything we had, and just want to congratulate them on a great year.

Q.   You got the big hit tonight from a guy that's been scuffling in this series, can you talk about Victorino?
JOHN FARRELL:   He's come up big a number of times this season, tonight no bigger.   And there's been a lot of pushback on a couple of guys in our lineup that have had some struggles, both he and Stephen Drew.   In the seventh inning, Stephen makes a great play that shuts down an inning, and Vic, probably the last thing we're thinking of that he's going to hit a ball out of the ballpark and thankfully the curveball stayed. 

Q.   And then talk about the bullpen again. 
JOHN FARRELL:   I think coming to the postseason, there were a lot of questions circling around our guys to bridge it to Koji.   And they couldn't have pitched anymore consistently, more effectively, you know, what Bres and what Taz have done, Workman tonight, outstanding inning plus on his part.   Pedey is going to come up with big plays seemingly every time we walk on the field.   He makes a diving play to his glove side.   And this was a win, you point to any number of guys, Xander Bogaerts, that comes out of the Minor League system, and gets on base three times, no bigger than the 3‑2 double to give us the first run.   But just a great overall approach.

Q.   You just answered two of my questions, but that's okay.   Bogaerts, this is a kid who looks like he's been in the League ten years, standing against Scherzer, a great at‑bat and the key walk. 
JOHN FARRELL:   You know, in the first walk he lays off a 2‑strike slide that was just off the plate.   And it was a moment where you saw ‑‑ I think Avila might have said something to him, he looked at him and nodded his head, that he saw the pitch, took it, worked a walk.   But much like we've gotten all reports all year long from our development staff he's beyond his years, he's got a bright, bright future.

Q.   You had two shots against Scherzer, one you just missed a foul ball by inches and the top of the wall with Gomes later on.   Was there any part of you wondering, it maybe just wasn't destined to go your way tonight?
JOHN FARRELL:   When those opportunities come and go, there was one in the sixth inning, and Salty has a popup to the infield, against great pitchers such as him, those opportunities that are fleeting, you're wondering if you're going to get them back.   But it's been the characteristic of this team that we're able to build that into the end.

Q.   Can you talk about St. Louis. 
JOHN FARRELL:   You're way ahead of the gun, here.   We're probably going to take 12 or 24 hours to let this one sink in.   But watching them last night, they've got a fantastic team.   And a lot of young power arms that will walk to that mound.   By the time Wednesday rolls around we'll be prepared, but not right now.
