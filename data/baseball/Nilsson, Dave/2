 DAVE NILSSON:  Well, I don't know who is pitching just now.  You will have to speak to a manager.  As far as our -- my expectation, you know, I think that it was the same against Italy, it's going to be the same against Dominican Republic, is that we perform good and that we compete. 
 Once again, the disappointing thing about tonight is we just didn't really compete with them.  They kind of overshadowed us from the get-go.  So I would assume that we would compete a lot better against Venezuela. 
 Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 DAVE NILSSON:  Once again, we just want, as a nation we want to be consistent at the top end with our performances and this is just a tough pill to swallow.  So there's no one specific thing we're trying to gain, apart from just, as a nation, consistently getting better and consistently performing at a high level. 
 Q.  Surprised? 
 DAVE NILSSON:  Yeah, very surprised.  Yeah. 
 Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 DAVE NILSSON:  It's disappointing for us but on the other side, they played great.  They swung the bat well and played well.
