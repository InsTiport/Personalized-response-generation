  Q. Robinson, as that 8th inning is unfolding, at what point did you think you would be able to come up there with the tying run or go-ahead run?   
 ROBINSON CANO: After we get a single -- sorry, after I hit my home run, thought we would start one here, but we came up in the eighth and scored five, and especially that guy, he was so good the first six innings.   
  
  Q. How important is it to you personally to do big things in the playoffs, because it's been kind of one of the big things that's missing from your career.   
 ROBINSON CANO: Well, I don't have those years in the playoffs, but I know myself and my teammates, too; everybody wants to be doing good in the playoffs. But it's always good when you have a team like that that wins the game.   
  
  Q. You guys have come back so many times, but the way those first seven innings went, was it surprising, given the way things had gone so far to that point?   
 ROBINSON CANO: Well, we had not seen a pitcher in five days, and especially facing a guy like Wilson, he's just great the whole season, especially the way that he pitched against Tampa and against us today. Those are the kind of things -- but we never have no doubt in our team. We always say that they have to make 27 outs.   
  
  Q. Have you always been this comfortable against lefties?  
 ROBINSON CANO: I would say, you know, it's not that I don't feel comfortable against lefties. Sometimes you're going to face tough situations when you go through your career. You're not going to be so successful against lefties.   
 I would say this is a year I've been -- everything's been together against lefties and righties.   
  
  Q. Can you just -- the at-bat, you seemed like a sideline to Rapada, what are you thinking when he's coming in and what do you try to do in that at-bat?  
 ROBINSON CANO: Well, I'm not trying to do too much. I'm trying to get a pitch that I can drive to tie the ballgame. Good thing he threw me a fastball on the first pitch.
