 Q.  Is the caliber of play that you've seen both from your opponents and yourself what you expected, is it lower or how is it different? 
 MARK SACCOMANNO:  So far it's exactly what I expected.  It's competitive.  The guys that pitched against us today were good pitchers.  There's no credit, it's not due to them, they did a good job.  I'm sure they would like to have done better, but I think we were just excited and we got a good lineup. 
 A lot of people don't really, they're not really expecting to us do a whole lot in this tournament.  I think that we're fighting like underdogs and going out there and doing what we're capable of doing.  And it's a lot less pressure on us we feel.  We're not expected to win, so. 
 Q.  What do you hope is going to come out of this for baseball in Italy? 
 MARK SACCOMANNO:  Hopefully it will -- they have got baseball over there.  From what I hear, from what we have seen, we saw about 2 or 4 of them come over.  I went to the tryout they had.  It's competitive.  There's good players over there.  Hopefully this will fire them up even more and get baseball going a little more. 
 Q.  Do you hope that there will be an international league? 
 MARK SACCOMANNO:  I don't know how far that will go.  Obviously they all have their own kind of leagues. 
 This is kind of a way of bringing it all together, this World Baseball Classic.  And I think it's a great thing for baseball.
