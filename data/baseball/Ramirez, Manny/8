Q.   There was a lot of embracing after you hit the home run.  Talk about what it felt like for you.  It had been a tough series for you.

MANNY RAMIREZ:  I told Zito he was going to make a mistake and I was going to be waiting.

Q.   Any predictions for the Yankees series?
 
MANNY RAMIREZ: I'm just happy to go back home.  My friends, they are there and they're going to be happy.  It's going to be fun. 
 
Q.   Are you surprised you got a fastball in that situation?
 
MANNY RAMIREZ: I wasn't surprised.  I just go out there with my plan, I see the ball and hit it.  As long as I know I'm trying my best, that's what matters to me.
