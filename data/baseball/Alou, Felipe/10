Q.  Are you devastated? 

FELIPE ALOU:  No, no, I don't like the word "devastate."  For me, does not exist.  I never be associated with devastation.  We lost a game that we should have won.  That's it. 

Q.  How does this game affect your plans for tomorrow? 

FELIPE ALOU:  Well, you know, haven't had time to talk to the pitching coach or GM or anything.  But I express my desire or the possibility I'm going to pitch Schmidty tomorrow. 

Q.  Is it good or bad that you have a quick turnaround with an afternoon game tomorrow coming after this? 

FELIPE ALOU:  Yeah, I guess so.  The problem is that in the heat of the battle, we don't really have time to analyze.  I mean, the game was over just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, obviously we got to win now.  The loser is going to be put against the wall.  That's where we are.  Other than that, is not much else I can say.  I can say a lot about this game tonight, but about tomorrow, not a whole lot I can tell you. 

Q.  From your vantage point, what happened with Cruz and the fly ball? 

FELIPE ALOU:  I believe only Cruz can explain that.  He's a Gold Glove type of outfielder all year.  He dropped a fly ball at home on a real tough windy day.  But today the ball didn't do anything, no tricks.  I don't know.  Maybe he was a little down because he didn't drive his runner in, you know, when we had the bases loaded.  Yeah, so many things go through the mind of the player, but only the player can tell you that.
