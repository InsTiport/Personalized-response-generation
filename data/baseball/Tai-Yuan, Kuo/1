Israel - 15, Chinese Taipei - 7
Q. The starting pitcher actually he worked very closely with the catcher.  I would like to know, why you had Cheng Da hong as the catcher?
KUO TAI YUAN: Actually, we don't think that's an issue.
Q. There were some key moments in this game.  Could you talk about the deciding point?
KUO TAI YUAN: I don't think there's any critical point or any single critical moment.  I think the starting pitcher did not have good command of his pitches, but that's the key issue.  And of course, we allowed a home run, and also several base hits.  We probably need to reveal how we can adjust our pitching staff.
Q. Could you talk about the pitchers for this game, especially in the first inning, and the seventh inning?
KUO TAI YUAN: Well, the starting pitcher had some difficulties in his control of the pitches.  That's why we allowed four runs.  And in the seventh inning, I think there was one error in our defense.  That's also a defense problem, not the pitcher's problem.
Q. We just lost the game.  Will you make any adjustments to the lineup?
KUO TAI YUAN: Do you mean the hitting orders, batting orders?
Q. I mean, the pitchers, and also the starting lineup.
KUO TAI YUAN: Well, we still can have some of the pitchers pitch in the coming games, and we will reveal the starting lineup.
Q. We watched the Korean team, and you also played with Team Israel, so what do you feel about the Israel team?
KUO TAI YUAN: Team Israel has a very strong pitching staff.  Yesterday it was a different game.  Yesterday it was a pitcher's game, but today, we see they are very good in batting.
Q. For tomorrow's game, Kuo Chun lin (ph) will not play, so do you have any plan for that?
KUO TAI YUAN: We will reveal that later.  Probably Sung Chia hao.
