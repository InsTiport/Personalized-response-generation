Q.  When Bobby Cox was in here earlier, he mentioned that you had been swinging the bat much better the last few weeks.  Would you comment about the way you have been coming on? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   Yeah, I've been having like a wrist injury that's been nagging me all year long.  The wrist is strong now, so I've been able to drive the ball well now.  
 
Q.  How important is it to get out of this, come back and get this victory tonight and get out of here 1-1 instead of being down 0-2? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   That's very important.  You don't want to go into San Francisco like that.  It's a great win today.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about Kevin Millwood's performance tonight? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   It was outstanding.  He throws the ball great.  He's been pitching the whole year like that.  It was a great performance today. 
 
Q.  Was there a difference in how Rueter was pitching tonight, as to the way he was pitching in the regular season?
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   No.  He's a good pitcher, too.  We capitalized on some of the mistakes he made and we were able to hit the ball hard.  
 
Q.  Going into San Francisco 1-1, how confident are you with Maddux on the mound in the next game? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   We are pretty confident.  We know we have a great ballclub, and going to San Francisco with great pitching, it's a great feeling to have Greg on the mound in the first game in San Francisco.
