Q.  Dusty Baker said Aybar has had success a little bit of success going after you in a spot like that; do you remember when you faced him and what you did against him? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   I've faced him before.  He threw me a lot of sliders before.  I don't know how much I've hit off him, but in that particular at-bat, I was really focusing and know that he was going to throw off-speed pitches.  He threw one that got on the bat and got a base hit.  
 
Q.  Will you be playing winter league ball this year? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   I don't know yet.  
 
Q.  In the first inning on that double play, did you move into that position because you thought they were running or would you have gotten that anyway?
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   No.  I was covering the bag, if Kent was taking off from third base.  I didn't know if he was going to go or not go but if the ball goes through, it could score two more runs right there.  
 
Q.  This was a big sixth inning for your team.  Have you had a lot of big innings this year? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   I don't remember how many runs scored, but our team, we never give up and keep trying until the last out.  
 
Q.  How do you like playing on the Braves?
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   I love playing on the Braves; it's a winning team.  Everybody in the clubhouse has only got one thing in mind, and that's winning.  
 
Q.  How confident were you when you went to bat in the sixth inning? 
 
VINNY CASTILLA:   I was very confident.  Like I said before, I know he throws a lot of pitches to me and I was very committed for that  -- he fooled me a little bit, but I got the hit.
