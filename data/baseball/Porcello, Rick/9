   THE MODERATOR: Take a few questions for Rick Porcello.   
  
  Q. Rick, just talk about going 22 pitches earlier in the series and how you feel now and how you expect to feel tomorrow relative to that?   
 RICK PORCELLO: I feel good. My arm feels fresh. I feel like the ball is coming out of my hand better now than it was earlier in the year. I'll be ready to go tomorrow, and physically everything will be there.   
  
  Q. Rick, how much have you learned from pitching on the same staff as Verlander the last couple of years, and then with Fister also being kind of a sinker baller, how much has he kind of helped you this year too?   
 RICK PORCELLO: Just watching the way Doug goes after hitters. He doesn't do anything crazy. It's just he just executes pitches and gets guys out quick and pitches deep into games and just watching him and his competitive nature out there as well as something that definitely trying to pick up on a little bit. It's been fun watching both of them.   
  
  Q. Rick, can you compare the two lineups, the Yankees that you faced in the DS and the Rangers lineup you're facing this series?   
 RICK PORCELLO: I think the Rangers' lineup is a little bit deeper, I think. 1 through 9 they have guys that can hurt you. You really have to be on your game, and you have to focus on every pitch, because they got guys that can hit the ball out of the ballpark.   
 You make one mistake, and it could be the difference. It's a tough lineup. It's a good challenge. You have to be on your game for these guys.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
