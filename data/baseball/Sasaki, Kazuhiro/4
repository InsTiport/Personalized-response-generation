Q.  Can you compare the way you felt when you played in the Japanese World Series compared to today. 
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI: There's really no comparison.  The atmosphere here was so much different than it was in Japan and so you can't really compare the two.  
 

Q.  This is your 64th game that you threw in this year.  Are you tired or do you have any pains?
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI: No, I don't.  We're in a spot where not many teams are in, and so I just want to be able to perform and do my best.
