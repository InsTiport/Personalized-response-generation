Q.  It's an amazing ending to the game.  How did you feel about the way it all ended?  
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI:   I'm just relieved that everything went okay, and that it came out okay.  
 
Q.  How difficult was it coming out to throw strikes, end of the All-Star Game and the fans?
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI:   When I was warming up in the bullpen, I was really wild, and so I was really nervous about if I could throw strikes on the mound.  But when I actually got to the mound, I was relaxed and everything went okay, so I was really very relieved.  
 
Q.  What was it like to have your first American All-Star experience? 
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI:   It was very fun to be able to talk to the players and to, I guess, get to know the All-Stars.  But most importantly, the way the game went, we were able to come out with a win and everything went okay.  So that was the experience.
