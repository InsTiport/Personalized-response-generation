Q.  Could you just talk about the biggest differences between the playoffs in Japan and the playoffs here.
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI: In Japan, you play a seven-game series and that's it.  Here, you have to play five, seven, seven to win the World Series.  That's the biggest difference, the length of the series.  
 

Q.  Can you comment about the bullpen's success in the series thus far?
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI: The pitchers that are throwing ahead of me have done a great job, and I'm just continuing to do what they're doing and they are taking me along with them.  They all have great talent and they're doing well right now.  
 

Q.  The manager, Lou Piniella, said you've gotten much better as the year has progressed and your fastball has gotten better.  What have you learned throughout the year that's made your fastball get better?
 
KAZUHIRO SASAKI: I had surgery about a year ago, and so the way I trained was a little bit different.  Since it's been a year, it's gotten stronger.  So there's definitely improvement.
