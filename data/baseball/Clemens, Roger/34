"I have been advised of the fine.  And under the rules, I have seven days in which to decide whether or not to appeal it.   "I want to stay focused on the task at hand, helping my team win the World Series, so I do not intend to consider the question of an appeal or respond to questions about the fine or the incident itself until after the Series is over."
