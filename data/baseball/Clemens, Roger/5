Q.  Could you talk about how you feel?

ROGER CLEMENS:  I had the problem in the second inning, and fought my way through that inning, got through that inning.  I came up here and as quick as I could to take my sleeve off and have them check it and see if there was anything I could do so I could continue.  And the fluid already started to build up in the -- in my leg.  So they gave me some medication and I'm going to treat it and that's all I can tell you from there.
