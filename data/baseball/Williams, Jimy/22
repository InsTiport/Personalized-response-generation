 Q. How did Pedro hurt himself? 
 
 A. Mid-back strain is what I was told. I'm not a doctor, so that's what they told me. 
 
Q. How did he do it, covering first?   
 A. No. He did it on the last pitch to Thome.  
 
Q. Do you know what his situation is for the rest of this series or is it too early,
Jimy? 
 
 A. The old adage day to day, certainly is probably one we could use here, but we'll see
how he is tomorrow, see what the doctors say is probably the best way to go at it. 
 
Q. Do you think the weather played any part in this? People talked about the cold and
the difficulty keeping warm. 
 
 A. No, none whatsoever, I really don't. It wasn't that cold. It's cold but I don't
think it's that cold.  
 
Q. Is this a terrible jolt to you? 
 
 A. We have a team. We rebound. We have other good pitchers and we bounce back from
other situations, challenges during the course of the season; so we come out here and play
hard again tomorrow. See what happens. We've got Saberhagen going.  
 
Q. Did Pedro ask to come out of the game? 
 
 A. He mentioned that he had a problem in his back and so with that in mind, him saying
something, because he never really says anything and he really likes to pitch, which we
all know, he likes to pitch and compete, for him to say something, that meant something to
us, so we felt we should react to his statement and make a change.  
 
Q. Jimy, is this the first time he's ever had any back spasms or pains of this type? 
 
 A. See, it's not his shoulder. Maybe to answer your question yes or no, I'd have to say
yes. 
 
Q. How did you like his performance up to that point in time? 
 
 A. He had four goose eggs up there. That's pretty good. I mean, it's a tough lineup
over there, but I think that one pitch is probably what did it to him because his velocity
fell off after that.  
 
Q. How much pressure does this put on Saberhagen going into tomorrow? 
 
 A. You know, pressure is the fear of failure. You've got to believe in yourself when
you play this game. That's how we got here. There isn't any such thing like that in our
clubhouse regardless of what happens. Saberhagen has pitched big games before and he's
going to go out and compete the best he can tomorrow.  
 
Q. Would you talk about Nomar's play. He was outstanding today. 
 
 A. I think his wrist is okay.  
 
Q. Would you give your view of the error right before the home run. What did you think
of that play?
 
 A. Maybe more important, Thome took advantage of it. He got a big hit in a crucial
situation. There are certain things that happen during the course of games that are part
of the game. I've never seen anybody in my life ever try to make an error. They happen and
unfortunately it hurt us. But Thome is the guy that deserves the credit.  
 
Q. Would you just talk a little bit about Bartolo's performance tonight. Much was made
of the pitching match-up.
 
 A. His last pitch was 100. That's pretty impressive. This kid pitches hard out there.
He really competed and from the standpoint of a big game, he helped his team win that
game. You know, he knew who was pitching against him. To me, Lowe pitched outstanding for
us, too, but he's a premier pitcher with that kind of stuff, that kind of arm.  
 
Q. If Pedro is healthy, with the low pitch count tonight, could he go if you get to
game four?
 
 A. You got to remember what I said about the questions, what if? We've got to wait.
We've got to wait for the doctor and feedback from the young man himself. So it's really
difficult for me to answer a question like that.
