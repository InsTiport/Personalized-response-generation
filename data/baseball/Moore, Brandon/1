THE MODERATOR:   Dave, an overview, please.   
COACH VAN HORN:   You've got to give credit to Montgomery.   He pitched a great ballgame.   He kept us off balance with the changeup away and threw that breaking ball a little bit.   Would bust the seam with that fastball when we started thinking about getting out over the plate, trying to get on that changeup.   He just did a great job.  
They made a couple of really nice plays on us, and we made a couple of really good defensive plays as well to stay in the game.   But that was a big play there in the eighth.   That ball gets down the line, it might have got exciting there.   
But just give credit to Walker.   He made a great play.   So we play again tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   Dave, what was the difference in Montgomery from the last time you faced him in May to this time?   What was he doing any different?  
COACH VAN HORN:   I think he was just spotting it a lot better, especially the fastball.   He threw a lot of fastballs in and he just did a better job.   He's a better pitcher.   He's a little older.  
He just had a really good ballgame.  
   
 Q.   Coach, who will you throw tomorrow?  
COACH VAN HORN:   We'll throw DJ Baxendale and anybody else that's available.  
   
 Q.   Coach, I know you guys have had some success against Roth over the last couple of years and also against David Starn, another lefty, maybe the same kind of mold.   Why do you think you couldn't solve him?  
COACH VAN HORN:   You know, I don't know.   I thought basically out of the same mold.   I just think he did a little better job.   We just didn't swing the bat good.   It's really hard to say.  
But, again, I'm just going to give the credit to him.   He just pitched really well.   He got the ball inside.   We hit a lot of balls in the middle of the bat.   We weren't driving the ball.   And hit some balls off the end of the bat on changeup.   He just did a tremendous job.  
   
 Q.   Brandon, when you come into a game like this, down, knowing that you need to hold them, what are you thinking about when you come into the game?  
BRANDON MOORE:   I was thinking about coming in, throwing strikes, letting the defense work.   I was just taking it pitch by pitch.   I wasn't trying to think I need to go five, six innings.   I was just taking it pitch by pitch.  
   
 Q.   Coach, can you speak to Brandon Moore's effort?  
COACH VAN HORN:   Well, Brandon did a great job of keeping us in the ballgame.   Goes out there, throws one pitch and gets a double play ball, we're in the dugout 2‑0.   And that was a great start.  
And he worked his way out of a couple of other jams.   We made a mistake or two behind him defensively and he hung in there.   And he did what he's been doing all year, and that's coming in and throwing strikes, throwing fastball, sinks a little bit, a little slider, gets ground balls, and he gave us a great opportunity to catch up.  
We just didn't do it.   
   
 Q.   Matt and Brandon, how does the feeling now compare to after Game 1 of the Super Regionals and Baylor, knowing that tomorrow is win or go home?  
MATT VINSON:   Tomorrow we've got to come out.   I mean, we have a shot to play for the national championship if we win that game.   
And I felt like our team came out a little bit flat today and we'll come out a lot more excited tomorrow and play with a lot of energy.  
BRANDON MOORE:   I agree with Matt.   It's win or go home.   But it's really no different than any other game.   We have to come out and play with energy.   And we'll come out a lot more intense tomorrow.
