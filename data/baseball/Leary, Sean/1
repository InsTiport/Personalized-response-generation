THE MODERATOR:   Justin, I know you're a senior.   Why don't you talk a little bit about your career.   Talk a little bit about your season. 
JUSTIN PACCHIOLI:   Well, we were just happy to be here.   We had a great year.   It didn't start off the way we wanted it to in the beginning, but to win the Patriot League and to get a chance to come down here and play in front of 10,000 people at LSU, it was an experience that as a senior I'll remember for a lifetime. 
THE MODERATOR:   Coach, a few comments. 
SEAN LEARY:   Well, first of all, on behalf of the senior class Justin is representing this evening, this is a special group.   Any time you finish your season in a regional out of state for us, and we say they're sad moments, but when sad moments are the end of May, early June for us.   Again, others that are more often ‑‑ for us, this is the way we want it to be.   This is a situation where we're competing against the best in the country, and his group put us back in the position where we were there last year in our Patriot League finals and this year to the regionals, so I'm grateful to them, and just awful proud of how they competed.   I thought their effort didn't change even when the result wasn't what we anticipated today.
