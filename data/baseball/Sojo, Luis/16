 Q. (No microphone.)
 LUIS SOJO: Good arms in the bullpen. The guys, you know, they're trained to do the job. Our main concern is they get ahead of the hitters. They get behind, and when that happens, you are going to get hit.

 Q. We got Enrique for the next game?
 LUIS SOJO: That's going to be determined by tonight's game. We'll be looking at tonight's game. If Italy wins, we start with Enrique, and then we follow with Ramon Ramirez. 
 If it is the opposite, I am going to start with Ramon, because they've got a lot of lefties, and Ramon's got a great change-up.
