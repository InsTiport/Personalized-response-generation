San Francisco   6
  Cincinnati   4

Q.   First off about the grand slam, what did you see and what were you expecting there in that pitch? 
BUSTER POSEY:   Well, I was trying to just make sure I got that run in from third.   I chased a pitch 2‑one and really just told myself to see the ball.   I was able to get a pitch in the zone and got the barrel on it and good things happened. 

Q.   Did the lead ever feel safe after the grand slam? 
BUSTER POSEY:   You know what?   They scored two really quick and especially in this ballpark with their offense, no, it didn't feel safe. 

Q.   In the dugout before the last three games, Pence has rallied you guys.   What did you learn about him the past few days? 
BUSTER POSEY:   Haven't had a chance to play with him for too long, but I do know how passionate he is and he plays this game because he loves the game. 
Without him and his want and will power I'm not sure we would have done this.   He rallied us.   He was our rock that Game 3 and he wouldn't let anybody stop believing.   He just did a tremendous job. 

Q.   You double‑clutched on the attempted steal there, did you lose the grip or surprised he was going? 
BUSTER POSEY:   Couldn't get the grip to start with. 

Q.   What did you tell Sergio there in the 9th inning as all that hoopla is going on?   You know how intense he is. 
BUSTER POSEY:   He had shaken me off a few times, and I wasn't sure on which pitch he wanted so I wanted to make sure we were on the same page.
