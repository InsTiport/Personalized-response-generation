Q. Paul, when is the last time you played left field? Could you talk about that?

PAUL O'NEILL: As soon as I was traded over here, Tartabull was here, playing right
field. I played left field for a while. Seemed like about 20 years when we went out there
tonight. Jokingly Joe told me to go to left. I asked him if he could tell the pitchers to
keep the ball out. I played there. I didn't come in on the ball real well because I wasn't
real comfortable. But, as soon as I got it, I had a little momentum going to the plate,
basically threw it as hard as I could, it ended up in the right spot.

Q. The light air helped that throw carry home?

PAUL O'NEILL: I'm sure it didn't hurt. I mean, I don't know if it has anything to do
with it. I haven't played here, so I don't know. You know, anytime you come into a game,
only get up at bat a time or two, a play or two, make a play where you can help do
something, it makes the game good, and when you win, it was a fun night.
MODERATOR: Couple more questions.

Q. I came in late. I'll probably repeat a question. Paul, why did you go home with the
throw instead of, say, to second?

PAUL O'NEILL: Well, like I said, I didn't -- it wasn't a ball that was a sure hit. I'm
sure the guy on second had to hold up a little bit. But when I got the ball, I saw that he
wasn't around third, so I figured I had to play. I just threw it. It was low enough I
think where it kept the guy from going to third. I don't -- it was no big brainstorm. I
basically took the ball and threw it as hard as I could.
MODERATOR: A couple more questions. Anything?
PAUL O'NEILL: Very good, thank you.
