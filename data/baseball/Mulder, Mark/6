Q.  Did you feel any pressure today and was this a large responsibility for you?

MARK MULDER:  I knew it was a big game.  I didn't try to do anything extra, I didn't try to do anything special.  I mean, for the most part, I think lots of times I was overthrowing a little bit, but I made the pitches when I had to, and I didn't want to try and do too much and try and strike everybody out or anything like that, I was just trying to throw a few mount pitches and get pitches and get quick outs. 

Q.  You said you felt like you were overthrowing, but you didn't walk very many people.

MARK MULDER:  I was leaving a lot of balls up.  I mean, they took a lot of them, but I was too worn on a lot of guys, I was falling behind, but then I would come back, make a good pitch and get the guy out.  I was getting a few more fly balls, but we had a lot of long innings with our hitters up there, and I was just  -- I was not  -- I was kind of losing my focus a little bit, and I couldn't quite get in a rhythm out there, which is why I came out after six innings.  Every inning it seemed like I was sitting down for 20 minutes, or whatever it was, and after a while it took a toll on me and I just didn't quite feel real comfortable out there.

Q.  Will having thrown only 90 pitches help you to come back on three days' rest if necessary?

MARK MULDER:  I mean, with the run support that I got and the runs that those guys scored, I think it made it easier for me to come out right there, and obviously, I didn't throw as many pitches, so working on three days, hopefully, it will be to my advantage. 

Q.  Is Chavez's demeanor any more intense?  He is off to a great start.

MARK MULDER:  Not really.  Chavy is very laid back, he is the same way all the time, but when it's time to go, he came out to play this series, and he has been doing a good job so far, and that homerun really let me relax, as far as a pitcher, and focus on making my pitches.  When Chavy needs to, he can step it up a notch, and he has done that so far in these first two games. 

Q.  How did you deal with not winning Game 5 last year and how do you feel about pitching this year in a Game 5?

MARK MULDER:  It obviously feels good knowing he has the confidence in you.  After that Game 5, that was a tough loss, I didn't have my best stuff, we didn't exactly play all that well.  But, you know, it happens sometimes.  You are not going to come out with your A game every time, and, you know, he obviously  -- I mean, it feels good.  I mean, that he is going to put me in that situation again if it comes down to it, and I will probably be a little bit more prepared than I was last year. 

Q.  How difficult will it be to come back on three days' rest and when did you last do that?

MARK MULDER:  There were times in college I would start our Friday game and close the Sunday game, so, I mean, it's not that big of a deal.  I mean, that's one of my sides  -- I mean, two days from now I will throw a side and I feel fine then.  Coming back on three days is not a big deal, you just limit a few of the pitches you throw in between, and, I mean, I will be fine by the time I need to go again.

Q.  How big was it for you to shut them down, especially in the early innings?

MARK MULDER:  I think when we score runs like that, I mean, I got to try and do my best to put up a zero the next inning.  It's very important.  You can't let them think they can get back in the game.  And our defense played great.  Ellis made a few great plays, all around, we did a very good job, and that's very important for me because I got a lot of ground balls, so I got a couple big double plays.  You know, those are the things you need to do, and besides the homer, I think I made some good pitches, got some quick outs, but, I mean, you don't  -- just like Chavy got the homer, I really tried putting up a zero that next inning.

Q.  Do you guys have any concerns about the noise in the Metrodome?

MARK MULDER:  No.  I mean, we know it's going to be loud, but, you know, that's why it's played between the lines.  What happens out on the field, I think  -- I mean, I think a lot of us, if we can't handle Yankee Stadium being loud, I don't see why we wouldn't be able to handle this.  I don't think it's going to be that much different.

Q.  Was there any urgency for you at all today to try not to fall in an 0-2 hole?

MARK MULDER:  Being down one, we needed to win today, it was a very big game.  I mean, now we have put ourselves in position where, I mean, we have Barry going in Game 3, which is probably the most important game right now, so when you have your best pitcher going in Game 3, like we do, we have a good chance now, and  -- but like I said, we needed to win today.  We couldn't afford to lose this game and the offense really stepped it up.
