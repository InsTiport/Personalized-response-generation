Q.  You got six runs on the board early?

MARK MULDER:   It was a good time, Huddy was already getting all over me, telling me I'm getting too much run support, so I got the 6 runs in the first so that was fine. 

Q.  We talked about what a great offensive lineup the  National League has; aren't you glad you don't have to face these guys?

MARK MULDER:   I'm very happy about that. I just didn't want to walk Bonds so everything was a good night tonight.
