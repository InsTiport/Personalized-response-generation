Q.  Can you just talk about what it means to get a chance to pitch again another game 5 type of situation.
 
MARK MULDER:  Well, it's going to be a challenge.  You know, they played a good game today, they took advantage of our mistakes and, you know, this is my second chance for this, kind of to redeem myself.  Didn't give as good of a performance as I would have liked to have last year, and I will get another chance this year, so it's going to be fun. 
 
Q.  Mark, do you think three days' rest, you guys have pitched with four days' rest all year, all of a sudden now you are pitching with three days' rest, and it seems like the two guys who have pitched with three days' rest haven't done that well.
 
MARK MULDER:  I don't have a problem with it.  You know, I don't know how Huddy felt today, but by the time tomorrow rolls around and, you know, with the adrenaline that gets going for the playoffs, it's not going to make a bit of difference whether that's two days or three days or four days.  If you can't get up and feel good for a game like this, then there is something wrong. 
 
Q.  Do you think a loss like today psychologically in any way makes it tough on you?
 
MARK MULDER:  Pardon?  
 
Q.  A loss the way it was one-sided, does that make any difference in tomorrow?
 
MARK MULDER:  No, not at all.  We just made some mistakes.  It wasn't like, you know, we played a great game and they whipped us, you know, we made a bunch of mistakes.  They played well, they scored a whole bunch of runs that inning, and that was really about it.  So, you know, we forget about it, move on, go to tomorrow's game. 
 
Q.  How much experience do you have pitching on three days' rest and how much does it change your routine in between?
 
MARK MULDER:  I haven't done it in the big leagues.  I mean, in college, I mean, I would pitch Friday and close on Sunday.  But that's college, you know, and I  -- all I did was eliminate one side.  I mean, I still threw two days after I pitched.  I pitched three days ago, yesterday I threw a side, took today off and I will pitch tomorrow, so it's really not that big of a deal. 
 
Q.  Mark, can you talk about the fact in your position as a pitcher, do you have more of an advantage seeing a team this quickly again or does the batter perhaps have a better opportunity against you this quick a turnaround?
 
MARK MULDER:  I don't know if it makes a difference.  It can go either way, because when you  -- during a regular season, I mean, I might face Minnesota two starts in a row, one in Minnesota, one at home, so I don't think it matters, they are going to make adjustments to me and I am going to make adjustments by watching some tapes and learning what I learned pitching against them the other day, so I really don't think it makes that much of a difference. 
 
Q.  What are you expecting for an Oakland crowd?  Do you think they will show up tomorrow?
 
MARK MULDER:  I hope so, I hope they will show up tomorrow.  We had day games on weekdays when school is in last week, so this is going to be a Sunday afternoon, I believe it's at 1  o'clock, so hopefully, they will all come out and they will be there strong. 
 
Q.  Mark, you mentioned get game 5 last year.  What do you think you can learn from that experience that may help you out tomorrow?
 
MARK MULDER:  Well, just being a little bit more prepared than I was last year.  Well, last year was different, though.  We got in at 3:00 in the morning and I pitched that night, so it seemed like everything was such a rush.  This year is different.  We are going to get back, the time change, 7:00, 8:00, whatever it is, and then it's a day game, I can do normal stuff, get to bed, what I need to, so that makes things a little bit easier, also.
