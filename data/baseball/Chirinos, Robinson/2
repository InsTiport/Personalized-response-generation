MODERATOR: We'll take the first question for either Yovani or Robinson.   
 Q.  Robinson, what does it mean for your team to win Game 1 in Toronto against David Price?  
ROBINSON CHIRINOS: It mean a lot to the team, I think, to come to Toronto to win that first game.  A great pitcher, it's big for us.  You have to give credit to Yo, he keep us close in the game and give the team a chance to win.   
 Q.  Robinson, you caught David Price a couple times when you were in Tampa.  Does that give you any kind of advantage in facing him on the home run?  
ROBINSON CHIRINOS: Yes.  I know Dave since 2010 when I got traded to Tampa Bay.  I know the way he pitch and how he like to attack hitter.  I was taking that first pitch and looked for fastball middle in.  I was able to square and hit it out of the ballpark.   
 Q.  Yovani, that's five pretty good innings.  How did you feel about your afternoon?  
YOVANI GALLARDO: Well, we won, so it should add to it.  I feel good, the first couple innings I was falling behind guys, the ball was up in the zone a little bit, but we stayed with the game plan that Chirinos and I had going into the game and got some ground balls whenever I needed to and limited the damage.  I think it's very important against a team like this and give the guys a chance to come back and swing the bats like they did.   
MODERATOR: Thank you, thank you both.
