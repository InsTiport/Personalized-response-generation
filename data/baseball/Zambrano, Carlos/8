Q.  Carlos, Dusty said it was going to be an offensive day because the balls were flying out.  What was going through your mind on that third inning with the Marlins getting three home runs?
 
CARLOS ZAMBRANO: Yeah, I wasn't very good today.  They hit a lot of pitches, they made the adjustment and they hit it out of the ballpark.  And like you say -- just forget about this, this is a seven-game series -- the best of seven games, and just go get it tomorrow and -- what has happened is in the past. 
 
Q.  Why are they such a tough team to put away?  They just keep fighting.  Why are they so difficult to put away?
 
CARLOS ZAMBRANO: Well, they play good and they have good players, pitching.  But we will continue, this is not over yet.  They started the playoff losing one game, and they came back and win the series.  We will try to do the same, tomorrow we'll just keep fighting.  This is the beginning. 
 
Q.  Carlos, what kind of adjustments will you make the next time you face this line-up?
 
CARLOS ZAMBRANO: Well, you know, I have to use more of my breaking pitch.  I know now they are ready for the fastball.  And mix the pitches.  My slider was good today.  But next time we'll try to use more of my slider and my spin, those are good pitches, too. 
 
Q.  What were your emotions like early on, given this was the opening game of this championship series, and there had to be a lot of emotion going through your mind.  Do you feel you might have been a little too fired up, too excited because of the moment?
 
CARLOS ZAMBRANO: Actually I don't feel anything that -- it was like a regular season game.  I don't feel nervous, I don't feel scared.  I feel normal -- I think I will get my next start, I will do a better job.
