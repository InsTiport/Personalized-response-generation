   THE MODERATOR: To begin, we're going to ask manager Ernie Whitt to make an opening statement.  
 ERNIE WHITT: I didn't know I had to make an opening statement. I think everyone saw it was a well-played game. You know, we kept the crowd involved, we had our chances, and we just came up a little short.   
 So I thought our pitching was good, our hitting was good. I mean, I guess we had five hits, but, you know, I think our team is capable of more hitting, other than the guy to my left. He had a pretty good day.
