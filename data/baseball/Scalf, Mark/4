THE MODERATOR:   Ryan, complete outing.   Talk a little bit about your outing tonight.   You got in a groove there in the fifth, I think you retired 11 in a row there from the fifth to the ninth.   Talk about that, please.   
RYAN FOSTER:   Yes, sir, got into the stretch for several innings, gave a few hits, walks, but was able to get into a groove and pitch out of the wind‑up, and I filled up the strike zone and guys behind me kept making plays for me, and we kept getting outs.  
THE MODERATOR:   Luke, big night at the plate for you, three hits.   Talk about your night offensively, please.   
LUKE DUNLAP:   Just trying to go up there, see good pitches, start this regional off right.   When you've got a guy like Ryan pitching the game he did, it's easy to get on a roll back in the dugout quickly and just able to put some good at‑bats together.   
THE MODERATOR:   Coach, the fourth inning there when you scored the seven runs with two outs, a little bit about that?   
MARK SCALF:   Yeah, tremendous job, I thought, by our guys, maintaining the approach at the plate.   We had five two‑out hits, and in this game of college baseball, two‑out RBIs tend to demoralize the opponent, and fortunately for us, we had five guys in a row go to the plate and put at‑bats together.   We got a little bit of a break in the middle of that with a strikeout and a wild pitch that kept the inning going, and then Stupienski and Dick rolled right behind them, Stupienski, Dick and Luke, three straight two‑out hits, and to tack on three more runs.   
THE MODERATOR:   All 10 runs coming with two outs.   Do you remember a game like that this year?   
MARK SCALF:   We've had a couple games where a lot of our runs have come with two outs but not every one of them.   The first inning, big hit by Gavin with Shields moving on the pitch, and it certainly helps when you've got some foot speed, and Zach was able to push it around the corner and score right there, and then Luke came up with another big two‑out knock, doubled to drive in Gavin.  
THE MODERATOR:   Can you talk about your pitching plan for tomorrow?   
MARK SCALF:   Right now, more than likely we'll go right‑handed with Evan Phillips.   Evan had a very solid performance for us in the conference tournament, and at least without talking with Coach Williams at this point, I would say that's who we'll start.   Coach Williams a lot of times trumps me since he handles all the pitchers, but what a tremendous job by Ryan tonight.   Phenomenal.   Kept hitters off balance, stayed out of the middle of the zone.   I think he only had one inning where he gave up two hits in an inning.   Like he said, he filled it up and trusted his defense and let those guys play behind him.  
   
 Q.   What did that do for your pitching plan for this thing, to have him go nine tonight?   
MARK SCALF:   Well, certainly helps, no doubt about it.   Any time you don't have to get in the bullpen the first day‑‑ for us, I don't really know how to handle that because we haven't done that all year.   But you know, it keeps us fresh in the bullpen, gives us some options hopefully come night if we need them to match up during the course of the game or to show some different looks.   It's certainly a plus for us.   
   
 Q.   Ryan, he mentioned finishing strong there.   How did that fourth inning change the way that you were kind of looking at inning to inning there?   
RYAN FOSTER:   Well, any time your offense is able to put together a big inning like that and jump out to a pretty good lead, it's comforting and allows you to go out there and keep the tempo that you want to keep, fill up the strike zone, not have to be too fine, and from there keep guys off balance when you get ahead in the count, not trying to be too fine early.   It's definitely a huge comfort when your offense‑‑  
   
 Q.   What was the biggest difference for you compared to last time out?   
RYAN FOSTER:   Just some adjustments that I made over the past week or so, getting back to what I do, what I do successfully.   I think I got away from some of my keys that I focus on last week, but I was able to get back to it this week.  
   
 Q.   Luke, how did you guys approach Duester having seen him before?   
LUKE DUNLAP:   Well, honestly, most of the guys didn't really remember him because they were talking about this guy pitched against us before, and we had seen him, but we knew that he was going to be a lot of off speed, runners in scoring position.   He's a fastball slotter guy, changeup to lefties, and going to the plate, knowing that scouting report, that's what we went off of.  
   
 Q.   What was that fourth up there for you, getting a chance to get up there a couple times and get on base?   
LUKE DUNLAP:   Like coach said, getting two‑out RBIs, two‑out hits is a big, big plus for us.   It puts us going in the right direction, gives us a lot of confidence.  
   
 Q.   Have you done that?   When do you think was the last time you got up twice in an inning and got two hits?   
LUKE DUNLAP:   Off the top of my head, I can't really remember, but I'm sure it's happened a couple times before.  
   
 Q.   What do you think that doing that to start this thing does for you guys?   
LUKE DUNLAP:   Like I said, it gives us great confidence.   A great pitcher like that, being able to square the ball up, have quality at‑bats like we always talk about and put runs on the board like that really gives us a lot of confidence.   
MARK SCALF:   Besides that it puts us in the winner's bracket, it's pretty simple, and keeps us undefeated, so we get a chance to play tomorrow night.  
   
 Q.   Now you can look ahead to LSU.   How do you look at that challenge?   
MARK SCALF:   It's going to be a heck of a challenge, absolutely.   They've been right there all year.   They've got one of the best clubs in the country, if not the best, and you know, it's just going to be a matter of us coming out, and we've got to play extremely clean.   We've got to be able to pound the strike zone, the bottom of the strike zone, and we have to compete at the plate tomorrow night.   We're facing one of the best arms in the country in Lange.
