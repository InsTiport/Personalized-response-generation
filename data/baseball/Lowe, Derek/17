Q.  Derek, talk about the pressure; not only are you pitching an All-Star game, but starting; how much pressure was that on your mind?

DEREK LOWE:   I think once you get out there you're fine, but the build-up was something that I had never experienced  before.  I pitched in the 2000 All-Star Game, but just an inning, I think it was the seventh inning.  I tell you what, it was a lot of fun.  By far, the toughest lineup I'll ever face.  But I'm trying to take it all in, but on the other side you don't want to go out there and embarrass yourself.  Now I can sit back and enjoy the game and wish everyone else luck.

Q.  Talk about Hunter's catch?

DEREK LOWE:   I've seen it so many times on TV.  It was amazing.  I've never pitched here before, so I had no idea where that was going to go, how far, if it was going in the park, out of the park, and he makes a fantastic play.  That's what people come here to see, and it was just a great play.  Hope he doesn't do it against us.

Q.  Were you moved by that pregame ceremony?

DEREK LOWE:   Yeah, we actually had a really nice ceremony back in Boston and they are going to continue to keep having them.  It's just a great day.  They don't do anything wrong here.  It's a first-class operation and I think that's why everyone wants to come back year-in and year-out. 

Q.  Talk about Milwaukee, how it's treated you and how you've treated Milwaukee?

DEREK LOWE:   They have treated us great.  Every city that they have these in, they do a great job.  You know, you don't really get to see, unfortunately, a lot of the city.  They have us doing stuff all the time, which is fun, but I just look forward to hopefully getting back here again. 

Q.  What happened on that balk? 

DEREK LOWE:   For some reason, I was under the impression that we were just going to use one sign the whole time, because they are not going to steal signs in an All-Star Game.  I think probably what he said is, "We'll just go for a sign."    So I saw the first sign and went up to pitch and then he kept going and there it was; balk.  When was the last time there was one in an All-Star Game.....who knows.
