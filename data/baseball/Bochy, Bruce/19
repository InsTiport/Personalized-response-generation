Q. Boch, what was your thinking on not using any of the three Cardinal pitchers tonight?BRUCE BOCHY: Well, I had talked to Mike and I know with Rosenthal, he's fine.  We just want to give him a break.  We told the other two that they would be our long guys.  We had a 3-2 ballgame.  We were saving our starters in case we went extra innings.  So they knew that that was the plan.  That's really why I didn't use them.
Q. How big of an impact was that leadoff home run?BRUCE BOCHY: It's big.  It gets them going.  You always like a leadoff homer to get you on the board early.  Trout, tremendous player, great player.  Looked like a decent pitch, too.  It's not a real big ballpark here, so he got enough of it to get it out. I'm sure it got them going.  We came back and tied it on the blooper, so we were doing okay at that point.
Q. On Trout, do you think that we someday see him in the kind of ceremony that we had today?BRUCE BOCHY: Oh, sure.  This is a tremendous talent.  He's got the whole game.  He can run, good defender, good hitter, power.  He's got the whole game.  It's great to see these young players, like Trout and Harper.  They're great faces for our game, great ambassadors.  He's going to be standing there, I think, with the guys we saw tonight.THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Bruce.
