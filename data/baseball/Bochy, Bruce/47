THE MODERATOR:   Okay, questions for Bruce.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, could you walk through the decision to let Peavy pitch to Carpenter and taking him out with runners on base the next innings and the whole sequence‑‑  
BRUCE BOCHY:   What is that?   
   
 Q.   Peavy pitched to Carpenter and then you pinch‑hit for them and the sequence of the way you use the relievers tonight.  
BRUCE BOCHY:   You know, Jake, he was a little off tonight, you know.   He didn't quite have his good command, but you know in that situation, he's done such a good job for us.   I had confidence that he could get a big out for us, which he did.   As far as the other question.  
   
 Q.   Your pinch‑hit for him in the‑‑  
BRUCE BOCHY:   Well, we had second and third.   We're trying to get back in the game and put some runs on the board.   And I told Jake, I said, If we're in a good situation where we can make him put a run or two on the board, I'm going to go for it here and go to the bullpen.   And we'll get a run in, which was a big run.   
And as far as the other things, we used our bullpen pretty much how we wanted.   Machi, we wouldn't be here without him.   He's had a great year for us.   He made a mistake.   Strickland, since he's come up he's done a good job, he made a mistake.   And of course Romo.   
It's a good ballgame.   These guys battled back a couple of times.   We were just missing a hit to put the game away.   We had our chances, but the long ball got us tonight.   
   
 Q.   And Affeldt?  
BRUCE BOCHY:   Jeremy, what a great job he did.   We're trying to stop momentum there and he gave us two great innings.   He gave us a chance to come back.   
   
 Q.   I think maybe you answered that, do you feel you were in a heavy weight fight, the way you keep punching.   They punch, you punch.  
BRUCE BOCHY:   Like I said, a great game, two good teams going at it.   We had couple of good comebacks there.   The long ball got us.   Another hit there, it was a good ballgame.   We were just missing that.   
Great job in the 9th inning.   I thought our guys threw out some good at‑bats and we had the right guy up there.   But they got a big out.   A hard‑fought game.   It is going to be a hard‑fought series.   Two teams played really hard tonight.   
   
 Q.   Boch, when the bullpen, when the game gets to the bullpen, do you feel pretty comfortable at that point?   
BRUCE BOCHY:   Yeah, they all did such a great job.   They are the reason we're in this situation, and you give them credit.   They threw out some good at‑bats and we made a couple of mistakes and they took advantage of them.   
But they have always done such a great job for us and we have all the confidence in all these guys that we put in tonight.   And I didn't get away with any mistakes.   
   
 Q.   You had chances today obviously, but still in the overall scheme, you leave St. Louis with a split.   The next three games are in San Francisco.   How do you feel about your ball club?   
BRUCE BOCHY:   We feel good.   We come in here, get the first game.   You want to get greedy and get the second one.   We were close to doing it.   This isn't going to be easy.   We are playing a very good club.   
And they did a good job of coming back on us.   And come in here and get a game, that's a good thing.   The last thing you want to do is lose two.   And you're hoping to get greedy, and we are close to getting two here, just came up a little short.   
   
 Q.   With Strickland giving up home runs now to four leftys or three leftys, difficult leftys, are you going to have to rethink strategy there with him?   
BRUCE BOCHY:   Well, we'll see the situation that we're in.   At that time, I didn't have another lefty and he has great stuff.   This kids's just going to be just fine.   And the power arm and he makes some mistakes, and he'll learn from them.   
So if you have another option, yeah, sure, he may rethink it.   But these guys again are the reason that we're in this position.   
Strickland came up, he's done a good job.   I know he's given up some home runs and I am sure he would like to have that pitch back, but we had a couple of other mistakes in that game, too.   
THE MODERATOR:   That's it, thank you.
