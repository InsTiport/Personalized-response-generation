 KATY FEENEY: Questions for Bruce Bochy. 

 Q. Bruce, can you talk about Lincecum's game? Could have been one of his best games. 
 BRUCE BOCHY: It really was, he was on tonight, had everything workin' and we needed it. They pitched well. Lowe pitched well, their bullpen. So we needed that effort, and, you know, it's one of the best efforts I've ever seen. And what a great job that kid did. He's tough. If he's on and he had all of his pitches workin', he's going to be tough. 

 Q. Bruce, in late August when Tim was struggling, could you envision that he would have a night like this? At what point in September did you realize he was back to being Tim Lincecum? 
 BRUCE BOCHY: I could see Timmy having a night like this. We never lost confidence in this kid, and I've said this many times, we all have our up's and down's, and he was searching there for a little while, but he found it. And he's been on a nice roll here. And he said some -- he's had some rest, and it showed tonight. And he went out there and pitched as fine of a ballgame as you can pitch. 

 Q. Bruce, any hesitation in sending him out for the night? 
 BRUCE BOCHY: No, he was on, the way he threw in the 7th and 8th, there is no question that he was going back out unless he said, you know, something to the affect that he was a little tired or whatever. But came in, had that look, so he went back out and had a great 9th inning. 

 Q. Bruce, I see the hit-and-run with Posey running there. Since that was his first career stolen base, was that his first hit-and-run? 
 BRUCE BOCHY: It's a 3-2 count, so we put him in motion, and Lowe gets a lot of ground balls, and we hit a lot of double plays, so it went to 3-2, we put him in motion hoping for contact, and it didn't happen. You give Buster credit, a lot of times they don't break off their lead to get the base, but he ran hard and ended up being a big stolen base for us. 

 Q. Back to Timmy just for a second. When you mentioned "that look" that you noticed, is it a facial look or --
 BRUCE BOCHY: He was fine, you know, "I'm good," you know, "I'm good to go out there," you know. And there was no doubt in my mind he was going back out unless I heard that he had enough. Pitch count was good, 8th inning, he was okay and well and had all of his pitches working so we sent him back out. 

 Q. Coach, can you talk about Cody Ross? Mid-season acquisition, question he was going to make the playoff roster and comes in with that big hit in the 4th inning. 
 BRUCE BOCHY: He's a good player, great player, that's why we got him. And he's good on both sides of the ball and made good contact there. We probably got a break, but in a game like this, you take it. We missed some other opportunities there and couldn't add on, you know. That's where you're hopin' your pitcher is on top of his game, which we had the right guy out there. 
 But when you're in a 1-0 game, you're always hoping to get insurance runs there. But Cody threw out some good at-bats, he has the last couple of weeks, and that's why he was out there tonight. 

 Q. Bruce, before the game, we talked about how big game one's are in a 5-game series. To have your pitcher do so well and go up against Lowe, is there added significance to this? 
 BRUCE BOCHY: Well, it's a big game. We knew he was pitching well, and he did tonight, and we needed a good effort from Timmy. We thought this would be a low-scoring game. And I didn't think it would be 1-0. But, sure, there is a lot of baseball left and it's a great way to start. 

 Q. Did you look at Buster's stolen base? It looked from the TV replace that he was out from the replay?
 BRUCE BOCHY: It's hard to tell from the dugout. I haven't had time to look or anything.

 Q. You were talking yesterday that you were in favor of instant replay. If there was, that might have been a call to go against you guys. 
 BRUCE BOCHY: In certain cases, but, no, plays like this, no, I'm not. You keep the game moving. But I talked about balls maybe down the line, maybe a play at the plate. But, no, you start to slow the game down when you start reviewing every play. 

 Q. Bruce, this was a tight game in the 6th inning, Bobby Cox brought Jonny Venters in to turn Pablo Sandoval around when another -- was there another thought --
 BRUCE BOCHY: No, there was not a thought. 6th inning, I didn't want to take Pablo out. He's a good bat. He's not an automatic out from the right side. He's a tough pitcher, Jonny Venters. Righties have a lot of trouble with him, so there was no thought there. 
 KATY FEENEY: Thank you, Bruce.
