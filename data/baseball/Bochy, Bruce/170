Q. Describe what Dave Stewart has meant to this team and how much of a leeway do you
give him on making any pitching changes?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, I think Dave has made a huge impact on this ballclub. I think he has
helped pitchers. His intensity, his knowledge to this ballclub, and as far as Dave and I
how we work together, I lean on Dave. He is the pitching coach and there are times when I
talk with him, especially about changes before the game we talk about what the game plan
is. And he keeps me informed on how the pitchers are, how they are doing and that is his
job as a pitching coach. I have all the confidence in the world in Dave and when he tells
me something, a lot of times I will go with it.

Q. Kevin Brown said last night after the game that he had a sinus infection and wasn't
feeling well. How is he doing today? Were you aware before the start how sick he might
have been and will this affect whether he will be available in Game 4?

BRUCE BOCHY: The doctor was looking at him just right before I came here, so, I know he
has a temperature and he did before the game yesterday. No, I was not aware of it, but I
knew something was up because just looking at Kevin, he didn't look well. You could tell
he wasn't his normal self. So about the 6th inning I caught wind of it, that is why we
were keeping close on it. Plus he took that ball on the shin. We said if he got in trouble
in the 6th, we would go get him. He had a good 6th inning. I was talking to him, he said
he was okay to start the 7th. I said, hey, if he gets in any trouble, I am going to go get
him because he just was not feeling well. Plus he had a huge knot there on his shin where
the ball hit him. But he gave us all he has and he always does and he had gone far enough
there. But I think he is going to be fine. Hopefully he will get over this in the next day
or so with antibiotics.

Q. How different a pitcher is David Cone now from when he was in the National League
and what will you tell your team about an approach to facing him?

BRUCE BOCHY: Dave is not pitching until we get to San Diego, so to be honest, we
haven't talked a lot about David. Right now we have to concentrate on Hernandez. Those --
as far as how he is different, I think he is a guy that uses all his pitches. He always
has. But we just haven't talked a lot about him. Right now it is not time to. After we get
through tonight's game, sure we will talk about Dave Cone and how we want to approach him.

Q. A multi-part question about your bullpen. Last week when you brought in Brown in
relief seemed to indicate that you had lost confidence in your bullpen. First part, how do
you feel about your bullpen, and especially after last night, Wall giving up the home run,
and another part is, you haven't used Miceli since he gave up the grand slam to Galarraga,
is that indication of how your confidence in the bullpen is very low?

BRUCE BOCHY: I think last night was indicative of how I feel about my bullpen. I have a
lot of confidence in them. That is why we stuck with what got us here. Donne Wall, he was
the guy that we brought in in that kind of situation. That is what we wanted to do for
this series. Dan Miceli normally pitches the 8th inning and Myers is there to help him out
depending on who is coming up. So I still have confidence in these guys. They have done a
good job. They are a big reason why we are in this situation and I don't want them to get
down. Sure things didn't work out last night, but you have to put tough times behind you.
This club does a great job of it. Donne Wall needs to do that. I still have confidence in
this pen. As far as Dan Miceli, he did have a little arm fatigue there in the Atlanta
series, so instead of breaking him out last night in that situation, Donne, you know, had
felt good all along, so, we went with Donne there. But Dan Miceli is fine to go. Again, I
have all the confidence in the world in him.

Q. What has been the biggest difference between Sterling in the postseason this year
and in the regular season?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, I think where Sterling really turned it around was out of spring
training. He did not make our rotation and we put him in the bullpen. Just seems like it
woke him up a little bit, maybe, but more so than that, it just got him more aggressive,
really I think all season he did a good job for us and he pitched some of our finest games
and he has carried that into postseason and he just has shown, I think tremendous mental
toughness out there going against the kind of pitchers and clubs that he has pitched
against.

Q. What is Tony Gwynn's role in the club and in the community after all the years that
you have had with him?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, I mean on the ballclub as far as on the field it is obvious he plays
a huge role. We feel like we have a guy that is going to go down as one of the greatest
hitters of all time. He has a very calming influence in that clubhouse, a positive
influence, and does a great job working with the other guys in helping them out. It is
incredible how much he gets out in our community in San Diego. I have said this before,
the best thing I could say about Tony Gwynn is that he has not changed since I have known
him since 1983. He is the same guy. He still gets out -- he signs autographs all day. He
gets out in the community and helps out. That is why his nickname is Mr. San Diego because
of what the people and the fans think about him there.

Q. Two parts, what was your input on the Greg Vaughn trade last year and when did you
come to realize it not happening was a blessing in disguise?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, any trade that is made, Kevin Towers, he will confer with me and ask
my opinion and but as far as that trade that is up to Kevin Towers. That is his decision
and you know at that time we had Ricky Henderson. And the trade came about because we were
trying to free up the situation that we had there because of what we think about Greg
Vaughn, we wanted him to get his three or four at-bats and sometimes the trade that is
never made is the best one. That is how we feel about this. We are lucky that that trade
did not happen. It was not a case where we were down on Greg Vaughn. It was just -- it was
crowded in the outfield. I hate to think where this club would be without Greg Vaughn this
year because he has done a great job of carrying us at times. I really again -- I think we
have to consider ourselves lucky not to have made that trade because he has done so much
for us this year.

Q. Can you talk about the confidence level in Randy Myers and did you consider using
him last night when you went to Langston?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, we have said before all these games even postseason that Randy would
be more the 8th inning guy or even 9th if we needed help there with, you know, Hoffman, if
we had to make a change there. But Langston has been doing a good job. I mean, he almost
retired in late August. We said, hey, how about pitching in the bullpen. Let's see how it
looks. His arm has been responding well and he has been doing well. So we have confidence
in him. It was that part of the order where we felt like Mark would get the job done and
he made some good pitches. The wild pitch hurt us that inning. We had two outs, man on
first, and he threw a breaking ball in the dirt and that put us in a tough situation. We
ended up walking Williams and had to pitch careful to Chili Davis and then he got in a
tight jam there with Tino and got a ball up. But you have two lefthanders, you use them
both in that situation we both -- we thought that was Langston's role.

Q. Talk about Hoffman 9th inning, Myers 8th inning; do you think teams have gone
overboard in slotting pitchers into just one inning? It used to be the closer would pitch
one or two innings --

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, sure, I think sometimes. If you look at Trevor Hoffman we used him
in the 8th inning I think 15 times this year. We don't hesitate to bring him in the 8th
inning. I have used Myers in the 7th inning, but that was more a case where we didn't have
another lefthander. Again, that is confidence in Mark Langston being out there. He has a
lot of experience. I know Randy Myers does. You didn't feel like that was the time to take
out one lefthander and bring in another one because I do have confidence in Mark Langston
and Randy Myers did a great job pitching out of a jam. We ended up having him later. So
but sure, I think you could move guys around. We have done that. Sometimes you have a game
plan before the game and you stick with it.

Q. How difficult of a challenge is it for you guys to get something going with Rivera
in the game?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, it is a challenge. He has got great stuff and he is pitching very
well now. I think he has got to be considered one of the best closers in the game,
especially the way he is throwing now. But we did have a pretty good situation up there,
Finley was up with the bases loaded, but he made some good pitches there. So any time you
go against a closer like Rivera, sure, it is tough. We know that. We feel the same about
our closer.

Q. Why the decision to D.H. Vaughn tonight? Was it his leg or --

BRUCE BOCHY: His quad was bothering him just a little bit yesterday. He was getting
worked on during the game. This allows us to keep him off his legs a little bit being a
D.H., and with the day off tomorrow, hopefully this thing will clear up because once we go
back to San Diego, we'd like to have him available in leftfield.

Q. After a tough loss last night, do you try and gauge the mood of your team today or
does morale not really matter for a Major League team?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, sure, I think the morale of the ballclub matters. But you get to
know your ballclub and we have had some tough losses all year. We had some in the
playoffs, and you know, there is no question in my mind that this club is going to be
ready to play tonight. If I thought there was, I might say something. But I have seen this
club rebound too many times, and I think it is a very resilient club. I just think that
they will be fine. Sure it is a tough loss when you have a 5-2 lead in the first game of a
World Series, but they will put that behind them.

Q. With Brown's health, will he still be a possibility for Game 4?

BRUCE BOCHY: Sure. Again, we will keep an eye on him and see how he makes progress here
the next couple of days. But no question, he is a strong possibility for Game 4.

Q. Have you seen the 2-2 pitch to Martinez on the replay and if so what did you think
about it?

BRUCE BOCHY: Well, I saw the pitch. I think what is important is that we put that pitch
behind us. That pitch was a ball and we can't dwell on that. Sure, it would have been nice
to have that call. It was a pretty good pitch, could have gone either way, and being on
our side, we would liked to have had that pitch. I mean Mark felt like he threw it where
he wanted, but what is important now, hey, the pitch was a ball and we can't think about
that. It is over and we just need to turn the page.
