THE MODERATOR: Take the first question, please.
Q. What was your take on Samardzija's night overall?  And he thought he had that foul or struck out on the fourth pitch of the game.  Did you see anything concentration wise or emotion wise that might have had an impact?
BRUCE BOCHY: I don't know.  I think it's fair to say that he was a little bit off tonight.  Getting the ball where he wanted to, mixing a couple soft serve hits, too, that hurt first inning.  I agree with you.  I thought we had him struck out.  I haven't seen the pitch.  But he made some mistakes, so that's fair to say, and just couldn't limit the damage.
The ball Hendricks hit, he bloops that in, that scores two, now it's an uphill climb for us.
And guys did a good job coming back scoring two to get back in it, but their pen did a good job on us, they were tough.  So, it's tough to lose two here, but it's a case that we have been down this road before, it's never easy with us, so we're hoping to get one here, but now we go home and you keep fighting.  That's all you can do.
Q. Speaking of that, you guys have been in this position before.  How much confidence does that give you especially since you have so many guys who are a part of that team?
BRUCE BOCHY: It gives you a lot of confidence, the fact that you've been in this position before.  You got to win three now.  You're hoping at least split here and that didn't happen, so now we have our work cut out.  But the fact that we have been in this position before, we're going home, and hopefully we can get things rolling here.  But we do need to get this offense going a little bit.  I do think we had some good at-bats early.  Guys were doing a pretty good job there, but Jeff was just off a little bit tonight.
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Thank you.
