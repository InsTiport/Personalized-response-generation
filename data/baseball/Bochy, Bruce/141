 KATY FEENEY: Questions for Bruce Bochy.  
  
  Q. Bruce, how do you guys bounce back from this one?   
 BRUCE BOCHY: You have to, that's how you do it, because it's part of the game. You know, they came back on us. And, you know, that's a tough loss, no gettin' around it, but you have to bounce back.  
 And they fought hard, we had a couple of chances there to add on, their pen shut us down. But we travel to Atlanta now. We've got to bounce back and win a couple games.   
  
  Q. Bruce, can you explain the rationale of bringing in Brian Wilson so early in the --  
 BRUCE BOCHY: Game was on the line there. You know, they had some good pinch hitters up there, and once you got a couple of guys on, we got a day off tomorrow, Wilson hasn't pitched in a while, and we've got five outs from them, but at that point we want to stop them.   
 The infield hit hurt us. That kept the rally going. But held 'em there, and we just couldn't get another run across the board.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the play of -- how Pablo played today?   
 BRUCE BOCHY: How Pablo played?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 BRUCE BOCHY: I mean, he played hard. He didn't get any hits, but I don't know what else to say about that. He's out there tryin' and they pitched well against him.   
  
  Q. You got to view the series now as wide open. What is your plan as you move forward now? You pretty much know you're going to have a Game 4.   
 BRUCE BOCHY: Right now the plan is to focus on Game 3. We go to Atlanta, and we know we're facing a good pitcher. They have a good staff there, and we're going to do all we can to win Game 3. That's where our concentration is now.   
 As far as the other games, we'll worry about that after Game 3.   
  
  Q. When will you pick a starter for Game 4?   
 BRUCE BOCHY: We travel tomorrow, we'll talk about it and decide what we're going to do.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts on how Cain pitched.   
 BRUCE BOCHY: I thought Matty threw the ball well. He did a nice job. He left the game with the lead. He gave us everything he's got, and I thought he did a real nice job out there. We just couldn't hold it.   
  
  Q. Bruce, how shaken up were Posey and Sandoval on that collision?   
 BRUCE BOCHY: It was a pretty good collision, scary moment. They came out all right, and they played the game. We'll check on them tomorrow and see if there is any soreness that we have to be concern about, but right now they're fine.   
  
  Q. Freddy was okay after getting hit by Farnsworth?   
 BRUCE BOCHY: Yeah. He finished the game. He's another guy we'll check on tomorrow we'll see how he's doing.   
  
  Q. You've gotten five-out saves from Brian, but not any six-out saves. Any hesitation given that?  
 BRUCE BOCHY: Sometimes the save can be in the 8th inning, and he was fresh, and, you know, we're trying to stop it then. At that point, we're going with our closer to try to get out of the 8th.   
 And I have no concern with Willie going two innings. He had a good 9th inning, he gave us two good innings actually and threw very well in the 9th.
