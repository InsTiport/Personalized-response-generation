St. Louis Cardinals   9
  Washington Nationals ‑ 7

Q.   What did you think when Carlos led off that ninth inning with that double? 
DANIEL DESCALSO:   Well, you know, down by two, we needed somebody to get on base in order to bring the tying run to the plate, so that's a huge at‑bat there by Carlos to give us a chance to at least tie the game. 

Q.   Can you describe the mood in the dugout, starting from when the Nationals went up 6‑0 and you started to claw back and claw back all the way to the 9th, the environment, the atmosphere and your attitude in the dugout? 
CARLOS BELTRAN:   You know what, when they were able to score all those runs early in the ballgame, you know, as a team, we feel that we have a good lineup.   So we were able to put good at‑bats and able to get them one by one. 
That was a great game.   There's no doubt they are a good team, young team.   They are going to be playing for a long time. 
DANIEL DESCALSO:   You know, if you would have told me that Adam Wainwright was going to give up six runs in the first three innings, I wouldn't have believed you.
We knew we had a lot of game left after they scored six.   Nobody went up there trying to hit a six‑run homer.   We needed to scratch and claw and get ourselves back in the game and get ourselves back in striking distance and get some big at‑bats down the stretch.   Our bullpen pitched fantastic today and kept us in it and gave us a chance to come back. 

Q.   Carlos, looking back, what were your thoughts about joining a World Championship team and knowing the challenge that comes with that, trying to repeat on a team that you were not on in the first place?   What Drew you to the Cardinals and what have you seen since you've been here? 
CARLOS BELTRAN:   Well, for me, when I made my decision this off‑season, that was based on trying to have the opportunity to be playing in these type of games. 
You know, the Cardinals, after Pujols went to Anaheim, I thought that they were going to be able to come look for a bat and I was available, and those guys were able to agree on terms.   When I showed up to spring training, it was fun.   The attitude that these guys have when they take the field, they believe in themselves.   And at the same time, it's a good team.   We feel that we were able to fight during the regular season and to get to the point where we are right now, it's a great feeling.   So I'm very, very happy with my decision. 

Q.   When you reached that point when you finally do break through, what's it like in the dugout?   Is it shock, awe, euphoria?   What is it like, that moment? 
DANIEL DESCALSO:   When I hit the tie, I was on first base, all fired up, and I looked over at the dugout and the guys were going crazy and got fired up even more out there.   When Pete got that big knock to put us ahead, it was chaos in there.   I mean, that's an awesome feeling; to share that moment with these guys after coming back, you know from a 6‑0 deficit like that, it was just awesome. 

Q.   For all of you, we've been asking you this all week, but what is it about this team that every time you face an elimination game, you face the most pressure you can possibly face, it brings out the best in you? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Well, I think it's just the kind of people they are.   They believe in themselves.   They believe in each other.   It's been this style of team all season long.   They just don't quit, and I think that just says a lot about their character. 
You can't say enough about the experience they have had in the past, too, where they have had their back up against the wall and they realize that no matter what is being said out there, no matter how many people count them out, they control their destiny.   We were down six runs, and I think it brought out something better in them. 
Every inning, the guys were just constantly talking about, hey, we are going to do something special here, and it wasn't just a bunch of cheerleading.   They believed it. 
It's just a special group of guys, and it's pretty incredible night, really almost hard to get your head around. 

Q.   What are your thoughts about that? 
DANIEL DESCALSO:   It would have been easy for us to go down 6‑0 and sort of roll over and let the crowd take us out of it and just let them have the game.
I've been telling people, we have got baseball players in that clubhouse, guys that are going to grind out at‑bats and grind out innings.   We took it upon ourselves to individually have the determination to have good at‑bats, and the bullpen carried us those last six innings, and there's a never‑say‑die attitude in the clubhouse.   The guys took great at‑bats.   We beared down on defense, and the pitchers made their pitches and we just gave ourselves a chance to come back and be within striking distance.   And the 9th inning was pretty remarkable.

Q.   We talked about your rookie relievers, but can you just speak to their poise tonight and their ability to keep you in the game and the work they did all series and how bright their future is for you guys? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Yeah, we have some good arms in this organization.   I think it all usually begins with leadership, and the guys on the back end of our pen have been very consistent for us.   Picking up Edward Mujica and Motte and Boggs have been really consistent in setting the framework for the younger pitchers to come in and feel comfortable in their position. 
For Joe Kelly to come in and close in a situation early in the game and an opportunity to eat up a couple innings, and then for Trevor Rosenthal to do what he did; those are not easy situations. 
But these guys, once again, the experience that they have had in being through this before really gave them a good idea of what they need to do, and that's just go out and do your job and keep grinding, like Danny said, keep making pitches and just play the game.   When you do that, good things end up happening.
