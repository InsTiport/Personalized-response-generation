 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Charlie.  
  
  Q. You all had not been playing all that crisp and the Giants sort of had. Did you feel this turned a little bit and the breaks in the game went back in your way a little bit?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: We did exactly what we had to do. We won the game. Going back home we have Oswalt going the first game and Hamels the second, and that's kind of how we got it, and you're like we're going to have to like it. I do like it.   
 I figure if we get back home and the way we play, I figure we definitely kind of changed things around a little bit.  
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about the Halladay bunt? It looked almost like it was a foul ball and he didn't run. What happened there?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: First of all, I think he didn't know what the umpire called when the ball was close to him. And from where I was at, it kind of looked like it got right out in front of the plate, but I don't know what it hit or nothing. I know it hit the bat, but it was hard for us to tell. It was close to the plate there, but it was kind of -- looked to me like it was kind of off to the right here a little bit on the plate.   
 And I didn't know exactly what it hit. I mean, it hit something and died, whether it hit the plate or the dirt or whatever.  
  
  Q. Ryan Madson threw 32 pitches last night, strikes out the side, the heart of the order tonight. How good was he and how big were those outs in the eighth?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: It was big. We needed that. And Madson was able to go in there and pitch, like you're right, he's been working a lot. And like we've had to use him.  
  
  Q. I'm not sure I totally understood you. Are you confirming Oswalt will be Game 6 starter?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: Yeah, he'll be the Game 6 starter, yes.  
  
  Q. Halladay wasn't as crisp as he can be tonight. But seemed like he really battled his way through. Kind of your impressions about his performance.   
 CHARLIE MANUEL: I felt like -- I feel like I've got to tell you; somebody will say something about it anyway. Second inning, Halladay, he had a mild groin pull, his right groin. And he pitched like -- of course, he stayed in there. He was determined he was going to stay in there. Once he got up to 108 pitches and once he got us to a place where I felt like our bullpen could definitely have a chance of saving him, that's when we got him out.   
 I don't know if you noticed the velocity on his fastball kind of fell off and he was having a hard time pushing off the mound and he used a lot of change-ups and cutters.  
  
  Q. What play did he hurt it on, and did you ever think about taking him out?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: He wasn't going to let us take him out. He wanted to stay in. But he said that he hurt it when he tried to really hump up on Posey in the second inning.  
  
  Q. He came right to you guys?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: He came to the dugout. Dubee and trainers. He went to them. He was determined that he was going to stay in the game. He said -- when he came back he said he wanted to try it. He said he wanted to keep going. And we kept kind of confirming with him between innings. Once we got to the sixth, I took him out. Or through the sixth.  
  
  Q. Is that why you had Contreras warming up in the fifth? And considering that, how would you rate the performance by Halladay?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: I think he gutted it out. And I'll tell you something else, not only that, but that was really big, and we needed him to. That was very big for us.  
  
  Q. Just back to Halladay, does he have a prognosis going forward? And if you needed him out of the pen in Game 7, would he be available?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: I said -- right after the game I was kidding with him, I said: When are you going to be available, next year? He said: Five days.   
  
  Q. Will he pitch in Game 7 if you needed him to out of the pen?  
 CHARLIE MANUEL: Maybe. Yeah.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Charlie.
