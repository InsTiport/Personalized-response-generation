CALIFORNIA   6
  OREGON   3

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by California Head Coach Diane Ninemire and student‑athletes Jolene Henderson, Britt Vonk and Jace Williams.   Coach, an opening comment.
COACH NINEMIRE:   I just want to say I thought tonight was a really great game.   Jolene did a great job tonight.   Six out of seven of the off‑hitters she was able to retire.   We had great timely hits tonight.   Britt did a great job tonight, bunting, slapping, getting on. 
Jace Williams came through with a great three‑run home run.   And then Danielle Henderson had the hit down the line, and that enabled Britt to get a single to right side for two more RBIs.   And then the home run by Victoria Jones.
I think the play of the game just kind of showed the heart of this team was the play that Victoria made at home getting the runner out at home plate. 
So really proud of this team and their will to win, and hopefully we'll have a great game tomorrow like we did tonight.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Jolene, can you talk about the Oregon batters?
JOLENE HENDERSON:   I was going with the approach, just stay calm and we're going to win.   And my team behind me today was nails.   They made plays.   They were making diving plays, and that's as much as a pitcher could ever ask for. 

Q.   Jace, can you talk about your home run and how that was able to help kick start the team? 
JACE WILLIAMS:   I was trying to have a good at‑bat.   I feel like that's been my approach is just go up there and swing at good pitches and just have a clear attitude about everything and not think about previous at‑bats or anything on the field, just to move forward and stay positive and just swing. 

Q.   Coach, the team hasn't lost back‑to‑back games this year.   Do they just have that mentality that this time of year, it really shows?
COACH NINEMIRE:   They've had that mentality all the way through this year.   They've just had tremendous heart, great will, and they've just been really resilient.   And that's their character.
And that's what made them the team they are this year, and hopefully they're going to come out tomorrow and be more resilient.

Q.   Jace, can you talk about that sixth inning, how Oregon was able to get back into the game, what it took for you all to regroup and make those plays at the end?
JACE WILLIAMS:   Oregon, I knew they were not going to just go quietly.   They're a tough team.   They never give up.   We know that from playing them in the Pac‑12 season.
They're just that type of team.   They put the ball in play.   Great coaching staff.   So we knew that they weren't just going to lay down and die.   So we knew that we were going to have to regroup and cut the bleeding and just make outs.

Q.   Britt, your whole team struggled a little bit offensively yesterday and you come up with two big hits in your first two at‑bats, talk a little bit about your day at the plate. 
BRITT VONK:   Like Jo said, we really came together after that game yesterday.   And we just all tried to step it up.
And the only thing I tried to do was get on base because I have so many good hitters behind me to score me, and that's what happened today.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
