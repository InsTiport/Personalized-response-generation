Q.  Can you please talk about the decision to leave Pedro in, both to start the eighth, and then to pitch to Posada after he had thrown 118 pitches?

GRADY LITTLE:   Pedro Martinez has been our man all year long and in situations like that, he's the one we want on the mound over anybody we can bring in out of that bullpen.  He had enough left in his tank to finish off Posada.  He made some good pitches to him, squeezed his ball out over the infield and there's nothing we can do about it now.

Q.  What did you ask Pedro when you went to the mound?

GRADY LITTLE:   Pedro wanted to stay in there.  He wanted to get the job done just as he has many times for us all season long and he's the man we all wanted on the mound.
