 Q.   I know you'd been out of the game for a while after the point, but what's going through your head as you watch how that game finishes up?  
JOE KELLY:     Hoping we would score.   I was watching on TV, so the feed is kind of slower than actually when you're out there.   But I'm just happy we came out with a win right there.   
   
 Q.   You're known for your athleticism, but pitchers aren't supposed to catch the ball with their bare hand, what happened on that play?   It turned out well for you.   
JOE KELLY:     That's just a reaction.   I mean, it's the World Series, you want to try to make every out you can.   And usually I've had plays like that during the year where I go out and bring it back.   I just decided not to bring it back and try to make a play.  
   
 Q.   How would you assess your performance tonight?   You got the early two runs in the first and you kind of held them obviously to two runs, as well.   Overall your first World Series, how did you feel you pitched tonight overall?  
JOE KELLY:     I think I did pretty good.   It was definitely one of the best experiences of my life, and I had a great time out there, having fun, just to get a chance to pitch in the World Series.   It kind of sounds clichÃ©, but it's definitely a childhood dream.   I was just out there having a blast.  
   
 Q.   Not just the ending, but the whole flow of the game, do you get a game like this with a designated hitter at an American League park?   The way the whole game played out, is it just kind of a ‑‑ do you get this game if both teams have designated hitters with all the different back and forths and strategic twists and things that were in the game?  
JOE KELLY:     I'm not too sure about that.   Obviously with a designated hitter in the American League in their park the pitcher doesn't hit.   So I'm not sure if that many switches go on.   I would just say that they don't.   But it's the World Series, you might be throwing guys in out there in a key situation, even if it's in an American League park.   
   
 Q.   Just curious, early on you were getting a lot more swings and misses than you usually do, what was working for you and what was allowing that to happen?  
JOE KELLY:     Just attack the zone with some fastballs, and just trying to go after these guys and keep my pitch count down, and mixing off‑speed pitches over the plate for a strike.   I wasn't trying to get too pumped up or too hyped up.   I was trying to throw strikes at that point and it seemed to be working.  
   
 Q.   For Trevor, what was your view on the last play of the game?   How did you see it?   
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   Not sure how it happened.   I just know that we won.   It was a great play by Allen, obviously, with the condition that he's in, putting in that effort for the team.   And happy it worked out in our favor.   
   
 Q.   The bullpen has been pretty much lights out.   You guys obviously got hit up a little bit in the eighth inning, can you take us through the eighth, and also in regards to you going an inning and a third tonight, how you'll feel obviously with no off days between now and Monday, if you're going to be okay to go both Sunday and Monday.   
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   It was a tough inning.   Carlos did a great job coming in and battling and giving us a chance.   That's all I want to do.   The thought is to leave his runs out there and pick him up.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to do that.   I was happy to keep it close and give us a chance to win.   With our offense, there's a good chance we were going to be able to score some runs if we kept that approach.   
And, yeah, I feel good.   And in these games I never know what's going to happen.   I'm just going to keep myself available unless told otherwise.  
   
 Q.   You have a win and a save here in the World Series.   What's this experience been like considering you were just in the minors not too distant time ago?   
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   It's been surreal.   I had the opportunity to play in some championships in the leagues I was in, in the Minor Leagues, and that was fun.   But this doesn't even compare as far as the stage and the experience and getting to see our guys perform, guys that have been here and been on this stage and how good they are, and their team, as well.   And some pretty talented guys over there.   And just having the opportunity to even be a part of it, it's really a privilege.   It's a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   Going back to maybe all the way to your Little League days, have you actually ever seen a game end on that kind of call that happened this evening?  
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:     Baseball is a crazy game, and anything can happen.   And I don't know, it's hard to say, I haven't seen ‑‑ I don't know exactly what the rule is or what the rule book says about that, but it seemed pretty evident that there might have been some obstruction, and just happy that it worked out in our favor tonight.   Baseball has a way of evening things out, and hopefully that was just making up for something earlier in the year.   
   
 Q.   You've never seen that?  
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   Never seen that.   
   
 Q.   The bullpen has been a very cohesive unit, you guys are also very young.   Can you address just having to really face like the big stage and all of these things that happen, and coming out as a cohesive unit and sticking together.   
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   It's been something that's been talked about all year with these guys, coming up and really performing in big situations, and especially now in these opportunities and coming through.   I think we're all just such great competitors, and obviously the talent is there.   And I'm starting to believe, maybe, that we're just young and don't realize the stage that we're on.   And hopefully we can stay that way, stay locked in and just come every day ready to win.   
   
 Q.   Being from Kansas City, what's it like for you to be closing out World Series game for the Cardinals?  
TREVOR ROSENTHAL:   Yeah, it goes hand in hand with even being ‑‑ having the opportunity to be here, it's surreal.   It's great being close and having my family here and having the opportunity to watch these games and support me, which they've done throughout my whole life.   
But, yeah, it's just a weird experience and hard to describe right now, I can't put words to it.   I know one day I'll look back and realize the history getting to play the Boston Red Sox in a World Series.
