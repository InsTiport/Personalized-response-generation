Q. Can you talk about some of the things that you learned from Greg Maddux and what it's going to be like opposing him in a playoff game? 
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   There's nothing really in particular that you can go into when you are talking about learning from Greg Maddux.  It's just kind of things you go through on the mound yourself as a pitcher.  Really can't go into detail on it.  I've faced him in the past during the regular season a few times, so it's not like the first time going out there facing a Hall of Famer of his caliber.  I've been there against him before.  It's still a privilege being in a playoff situation against a guy like that.  
 
Q.  Why have you been better at Pac Bell?  Is it more than Pac Bell being just a better pitcher's park?
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   To tell you the truth, I didn't know that I was any better at Pac Bell.  I think it's just kind of the way that it's worked out this year. I pretty much have to go back over the whole season to really look into it myself to give you an honest answer.  I know coming off the DL at the beginning of the season was a little bit rough.  If I had to guess, I would say the majority of those games were on the road at the time.  I've seen some big games on the road.  Obviously, Pac Bell is a pitcher's park so I think anybody's ERA is going to be lower there.  Not a lot of balls fly out of there, so it is kind of a given in that aspect. 
 
Q.  You flew back early; what have you been doing the last couple of days getting ready for this big game?
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   Not doing anything different than I do any other start.  Not that it's just any other start.  Obviously it is a big game.  But just approaching it like I would during the regular season.  Just go out there and do your homework on certain guys and prepare mentally for what you've got to do.  
 
Q.  Is facing your old team an issue at this point? 
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   That's something I'd like to address, definitely.  I've been hearing a lot of stuff about people saying, you know, somewhere I stated I was supposed to be nervous against facing the Braves in the past.  I'd like to hear anybody that heard me say that comment because I don't remember ever saying that.  That's never been an issue.  Half that team is a lot different than when I was over there.  I think, yeah, emotions are definitely under control.  That's not really a factor as far as facing them.  I've always loved pitching in Atlanta; now I'm pitching at Pac Bell, so it's really not a factor.  
 
Q.  There was a report that when you were first called up Greg Maddux took you in.  We've seen what he's like at home, but what's he like at home?
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   He's a normal guy.  He's a normal guy just like any other.  He's not a slob.  He's a normal guy.  He's a great guy.  That's definitely not something I'll ever forget.  I stayed there for about a week until I got a place to stay in Atlanta.  We got a chance to sit down and watch some games with him.  He showed us some different things he looks at when watching films and things like that. It was just a great experience.  
 
Q.  Did you take some notes with a tape recorder right in front of him and then just keep it on for about a week?
 
JASON SCHMIDT:   Probably should have.  Looking back I probably should have done that.
