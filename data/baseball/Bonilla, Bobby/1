 Q. Bobby, give us the latest update on your hamstring and whether you'll be able to
play tomorrow?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Yeah, it feels pretty sore, but I've been through a great deal, it's
taken me a great deal to get here and I don't plan on missing it. 
 
Q. Orel is known as a big game pitcher, how much confidence would you have in Livan
going into that situation, and what do you think about him doing well in that situation?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I don't see it as a problem, I think he can come up with a big game.
Can't get into any bigger than the 2-2 game he pitched. 
 
Q. Bobby, you and Edgar are the only two players that understand Spanish, what will be
your step in order to help Livan understand?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I'm pretty much the one that goes to the mound. I wouldn't let Edgar go
out there at all, because he probably would be thinking the same thing Livan is thinking,
so I would just say -- it all depends on what the situation is. I might say something in
Spanish that might crack him up, it all depends on how I'm feeling, what the situation is.
 
 
Q. The game that Livan struck out 15 players of the Atlanta Braves, you came to the
mound a lot?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I came to the mound the very first time, it was in the 1st inning, after
the triple he got behind to Lockheart, and I just didn't want him being too careful. I
wanted him to make sure he was aggressive and he stayed aggressive. He got the triple and
that was that, and if the run scored that was okay, too, but I wanted to make sure that he
was aggressive to the plate. 
 
Q. Did you say something -- what would you say to him in Spanish?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: We've got a lot of pressure going. This is for my Latin counterpart. It
all depends, honestly. It's what I'm feeling at the time, you know. Really, I can
literally -- it might be something that Larry might say that I've heard Larry say over and
over and over. Or I might throw out something funny. It really depends. 
 
Q. Cleveland's last six wins in the postseason have been one-run games and they didn't
score a lot of runs like they did in the regular season. Any qualities that team has that
you look at to come into this series that got them here?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I don't really know what went on this year, I know a great deal about
what happened last year. I know they have a great hitting baseball team. And I know
they're able to put up a snowman ( a lot of runs) in a heartbeat. You have to really
approach it just like you would Atlanta. We have to have great pitching performances from
our guys and we have to take it from there. 
 
Q. Why is your image so much better here than it was in New York?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Because I'm not in New York (laughter.) That's basically the bottom
line. 
 
Q. Bobby, I know you beat Atlanta, do you have to swing the bats better to continue to
win?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Bottom line is you have to pitch. You want timely hits. I don't know if
you can necessarily go out in postseason and hit .9000. For some reason I keep hearing we
hit under .200. But I didn't think the Braves were hitting over .400. It makes no
difference. The bottom line is you have to pitch well, you really do. You have to keep us
in the game in order to do something and have some timely hits. 
 
Q. Did you get a chance to take any ground balls today? 
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: It was a little wet out there. No, I did not take any ground balls. 
 
Q. Are you going to wait until tomorrow?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Yeah, I'll wait until tomorrow. 
 
Q. There were some allegations during the ALCS --
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I had nothing to do with it, nothing, so I'm going to leave right now --
is this a New York guy? 
 
Q. From Orel Hershiser about wetting the ball various ways?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Stuff like that really doesn't bother me, I just like to consider him a
crafty veteran, very crafty. 
 
Q. Bobby, is your hamstring going to be a day-to-day kind of thing?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Yes, it will be day-to-day. 
 
Q. Bobby, they're talking about rain tomorrow night. Would you less likely to play, and
when you get to the cold weather in Cleveland, would you more likely to DH?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I had an opportunity to DH in a couple of games and I still didn't do
it. I'm going to try to avoid that at all costs.  
 
Q. After coming to close as you alluded to earlier, can you express what it means to
you and also what it means to make it to the World Series with Jim Leyland?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: It means a great deal to me, of course, it means a great deal. This is
something I've thought about a very long time. This is actually what you work for, putting
all the other crap that you hear aside, and just being able to participate in a World
Series is pretty much everything. But again you do want to win. And making it with Leyland
is, of course, it has a little extra to it because we've come so close before in
Pittsburg, and I had an opportunity with Baltimore last year to make it to the World
Series and that didn't happen. So to be together with him under the circumstances was very
nice. 
 
Q. Bobby, obviously having good players doesn't always translate into having a good
team. Can you talk about the process of how this group came together as a team and Jim
Leyland's role in that?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Well, getting Jim Leyland, of course, was very important. I think that
was a big, big step. But for some reason in Spring Training everything just clicked. I
thought that is when everything kind of came together. People aren't going to say that. We
went out and -- you don't go to try to do anything in Spring Training but get ready, but
things fell into place. A lot of things happened that were successful in Spring Training.
We knew something special was going to be thereafter coming out of Spring Training. And
Leyland said we were pretty much set up for a big kill, so to speak, because we went out
and spent a lot of money on some players. If we didn't do it, there was a lot to write
about. So I felt it came together in spring. 
 
Q. What's the sign outside the locker?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: Just stay out of there. Because somebody was looking in my locker, I
felt it was like going in my desk. You people bring that up, it's amazing. It isn't meant
to stay out of it, not talk to me. Somebody happened to be looking in my locker when they
shouldn't have been. And he's lucky I didn't have money in there, I might have really been
nasty. 
 
Q. Bobby, what in your mind makes Jim Leyland a real good manager, what are his
strengths?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: In my heart it's the ability to communicate with everybody, regardless
of who are you, whether you're Gary Sheffield, he has this ability to talk to you. Don't
get me wrong, he doesn't volunteer any information, because he is with management, of
course, and we all understand that. But if you need to go in there and you need to know
where you stand, you're able to talk to him. 
 
Q. Do you have any -- given the uncertainty of the ownership situation do you wonder
which of you guys will be back next season?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I don't think anyone in the clubhouse has really thought about anything
like that. Again, it's an unfortunate situation. We'd really like for them to keep the
ball club, he's a tremendous owner. But again, I don't know what the situation is or what
he plans on doing. 
 
Q. How will it affect you?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: You know, again, it wouldn't -- I have a -- I don't have a no trade
clause. And I figure someone is going to pick me up it will be in a winning situation. So
it really didn't bother me in the least to have one, so it wasn't important to me, so I
wanted to be able to get to the World Series, and if that's what it took, that's what it
took. 
 
Q. Bobby, can you talk about what it meant to you for the Florida media to vote you the
"Good Guy Award," do you recall if you ever won that in New York (laughter)?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: First of all, I know they don't have that in New York, at least I can't
recall them ever bringing that to my attention or I'm sure Jay would have worked on my
image a little better in letting me get that award or working on that possibly. It
actually took me by surprise, because we have some tremendous individuals. I can go from
CJ (Charles Johnson) to EZ (Jim Eisenreich), to anybody. You don't want to leave anybody
out on the team, but those two really come to mind. And I didn't know that the award
existed. But actually it was a nice compliment. And the first thing I said is this is
pretty funny, I said, wow they're going to have fun with this in New York. That's all I
can think about. I was just thinking, the Mad Dog and LaRussa over there, they're going to
tear this up. Have fun with the cartoonists in New York that are having fun with that. As
well as Marty Noble will probably have some fun with that, too. 
 
Q. How do you feel when teams want Sheffield to go after you?
 
 BOBBY BONILLA: I don't have a problem with that. I'm not afraid to swing the bat. If
they elect to pitch to me, I'm going to swing. I'm not as picky as Mr. Sheffield. I'll
swing at something over my head.
