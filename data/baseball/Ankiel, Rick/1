 KATY FEENEY: Questions for Rick Ankiel.   
  
  Q. Did you get a shaving cream pie?   
 RICK ANKIEL: I did. When I came in, the guys were all over me. We celebrated as we normally do and it was fun.   
  
  Q. How does it feel too hit a home run in such a big game?   
 RICK ANKIEL: It's hard to describe or put into words. The biggest homer of my career by far, and to be honest with you, I wanted to go from the batter's box to the dugout. I didn't want to run the bases.   
 I wanted to be with the guys. But what a cool way to win.   
  
  Q. You were 2-2, describe that bat.   
 RICK ANKIEL: He's tough. I feel like he likes to use the split along with his fastball. So I tried to get a good pitch to swing at, and I got a good fastball. I put good wood on it and a good thing happened.   
  
  Q. You waited a long time and worked really hard since you made your postseason debut. How sweet is it to have people remember this as your performance in the postseason instead of what they may remember from the past?   
 RICK ANKIEL: It's been a long, fun journey. And I appreciate everything that's happened. And I appreciate the Braves bringing me over here on the deadline. And what a fun thing, what a cool thing to be a part of, from Bobby retiring to all the way here. I mean, I can't put into words how it feels.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about Matt Cain and Hanson after going down 4-0 allowing you guys to come down?   
 RICK ANKIEL: What's that?   
  
  Q. Can you talk about Matt Cain, the way he pitched tonight and then Hanson keeping you guys in the game, allowing you to come back from 4 runs down?   
 RICK ANKIEL: They're both tough pitchers, I think where credit is due is to our bullpen, Hanson stayed in thereafter giving up the big Homer and our bullpen shut it down so you got to give credit to those guys.   
 KATY FEENEY: Thanks.
