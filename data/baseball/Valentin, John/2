Q. You still on an even keel tonight?

JOHN VALENTIN: Well, tonight was a special night for the Red Sox. We came out swinging
the bats pretty well today, and we knew we had to because Colon was, you know, he shut us
down in Cleveland in Game 1, and we basically had to be ready for him. And, you know, it
was a good night.

Q. Can you put into words, John, the atmosphere in the clubhouse? Are you guys just
pumped going to Cleveland?

JOHN VALENTIN: Well, there's quite a bit of excitement in the clubhouse, but
everybody's seemed to put everything in perspective. Tonight was a special night. A lot of
guys played really well in a big game, and, you know, like Sandy said, it's going to be
0-0 tomorrow when we play, and we got to do it again.

Q. Just anxious to go after a game like this? Just anxious to get on with it now?

JOHN VALENTIN: No, not really. I need some sleep. But today was very exciting. It was a
great day for a lot of players. They basically, you know, hit balls all over the place,
and tomorrow we face a tough pitcher in Nagy, and we're basically going to try to get some
more hits.

Q. Certainly had a tough season, and you're not known as a cold-weather hitter, but
this has got to be great for you given the season you had and your reputation not being a
cold-weather hitter, you have to feel good.

JOHN VALENTIN: Well, these are big games, and, you know, doesn't really matter what
type of weather it is. You got to show up. And basically, you know, I didn't get any hits
the first couple games, they pitched me pretty well. And I was just trying to get a little
bit more focused and try to contribute.

Q. What did you eat for dinner last night? (Laughter.)

JOHN VALENTIN: Thank you.
