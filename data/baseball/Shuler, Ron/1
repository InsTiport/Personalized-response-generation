  Q.  With all the trouble you had establishing a starting catcher, why didn't you protect Fabregas?   
 RON SHULER:  As a system, and an organization, we decided that we had a lot of young pitchers, a lot of young position players.  I think you'll see a little change in our ball club this year that we're building around Frank Thomas, Albert Belle, Robin Ventura, and we will be playing a lot more kids. The fact is we did not want to lose these prospects. George did a great job when we got him in the trade, but by trade or free agencies there are other catchers available.   
  
  Q.  How much had you shopped Fabregas before a list was submitted?   
 RON SHULER:  We had talked to a couple of clubs.  We were under the understanding that there's a chance that he would be taken.  We just felt ââ we went through our organizational meetings a few days ago, and we just felt there's a couple of catchers out there that fit what we're looking for, and you'll probably see more movement lately, a few days, a little later.   
  
  Q.  What more of a defensive catcher ââ or what are you looking for?   
 RON SHULER:  I would say, yeah, with the young pitching that we will have out there this year, you'll see more of a guy that will handle the staff rather than an offensive catcher.
