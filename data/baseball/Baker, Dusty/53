 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Dusty.  
  
  Q. How does your team respond to that? How do you bounce back?   
 DUSTY BAKER: Well, I mean, you have no choice. It still counts as a loss, but that was a very dramatic loss. That is the best pitched game I've seen since I've been going to the playoffs and the World Series. You have no choice but to bounce back. You've got to put that one behind us. Figure we got beat by a great performance tonight.   
 The thing about it is, you know, I don't think he threw anything down the heart of the plate, everything was on the corners and moving. I don't know what his percentage was, but it looked like he threw 90% for first pitch strikes. Any time you do that with the stuff he has, then he can go to work on you after that.  
  
  Q. What can you do to tell your batters to try to get them off rhythm at all, whether it be stepping out, whether it's taking more pitches? What can you do to get them more rhythm?   
 DUSTY BAKER: When a guy's dealing like that, they were stepping out and it didn't seem to faze him. If he took a pitch, it was a strike anyway. If he swung it was a low percentage pitch to hit. So tonight it was like a situation where you're almost helpless because the guy was dealing. Next thing you know it was the sixth inning, seventh inning, and then he starts mellowing , and it's the second time this year since he's done that against two pretty good hitting teams, our team and then the Florida Marlins.   
 Like they say, good pitching beats good hitting, and that was great pitching tonight.  
  
  Q. As you're thinking about the first time in seven years and the franchise coming back, and you're thinking about all the different ways this could turn out, could you ever think of this particular scenario?   
 DUSTY BAKER: No, if I was thinking of this scenario, it would be like a nightmare, and I don't like having nightmares. This is the last thing on my mind.   
 You know, last time I think we hit him pretty good in Cincinnati. He made the proper adjustments. He was working very quickly. No, like I said, you don't want to get beat, number one, and you hate getting shutout, number two, and even worse, no hits.   
 One thing's for sure, we're due to get a lot of hits after this game.  
  
  Q. As a man who has seen so many great pitching performances over your playing and managing career, when in a game do you know that you're facing a guy that has exceptional stuff?   
 DUSTY BAKER: Well, you knew probably in the third or fourth inning, I think when you saw his command. I've been on both sides of no hitters. The deeper the game goes, you can tell they were feeling it. You can look over in the dugout, and nobody was talking, nobody was saying much. The fielders were on their toes. You can tell the way Jimmy Rollins was in the proper position on a couple balls there. Actually, the best ball we hit was by Travis Wood to right field, by our pitcher. That was the best ball we hit all night.   
 Boy, you just got to act like this one never happened, because you certainly can't bring it back.  
  
  Q. On a slightly different note, can you talk about the at-bats Shane Victorino had against your starter and how effective that was in chasing him?   
 DUSTY BAKER: Well, it was real effective. The at-bat of the night, I mean, Shane had a good night. He started it off, and then he got the bases loaded blooper out there. But the bat of the night was by Roy Halladay who got the hit, the two-out hit. Then Jonny Gomes came in and made a great effort on it, and after that the walk to Jimmy Rollins, and then the hit by Victorino.   
 So they're a great ballclub. They've got a lot of guys that can hurt you over there. But tonight the main hit that hurt us was by Roy Halladay, it was his night.
