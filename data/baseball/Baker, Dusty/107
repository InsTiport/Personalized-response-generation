Q.  You had numerous opportunities today to score, runners on base, what was the difference in the game? 

DUSTY BAKER:   Well, like you said, we had a lot of opportunities today.  You know, they got out of trouble numerous times, and early in the game, you know, we gave them a couple of runs, too, which got them on the board.  We were fighting back and fighting back, and they kept holding us off and holding us off.  You know, we just couldn't get that big hit today. 

Q.  What was the difference between Ortiz today and Ortiz in the Division Series? 

DUSTY BAKER:   Well, he really theoretically only gave up two runs, the two solo home runs.  One was on a wild pitch and the other was Fernando Vina's ball that was hit a lot harder than most of us thought it was hit.  Really, it wasn't a whole bunch of difference.  The main thing is, I think that one inning getting out of trouble with two runs took a lot out of him, I think.  Other than the two solo home runs, I think he threw well.

Q.  Would you comment on the Cardinals bullpen?

DUSTY BAKER:   Well, they did a great job today.  They shut us down through the last, whatever it was, five innings.  But like I said, we had a bunch of opportunities, they just managed to get out of trouble.
