DUSTY  BAKER:  Well, last two games guys usually go deep into the ball game.  We didn't get there.  Livan started out throwing the ball excellent, then that leadoff walk to Eckstein started things off like he usually does.  It was a tough night for us.  They were hitting.  They've been hitting the last two games.  I don't know, hopefully they hit themselves out, I hope.  I don't know, just a rough night for us.  Those pair of fours made it a very tough deficit.  I think in the third and fourth inning, any time you get a pair of fours like that, it makes it extremely tough.
