THE MODERATOR:   Texas is here representing the Longhorns.   Pitchers Morgan Cooper and John Curtiss.   Shortstop C.J. Hinojosa, and possibly centerfielder Mark Payton.   Opening statement from Coach Augie Garrido.
COACH GARRIDO:   We all saw the game.   It was imperfect by both teams, but both teams battled.   Really gave it everything they had.   I have absolutely no negative comments about any types of plays or batting or pitching or fielding or why it all happened.   Simply, they got one more run than we did.   And they get to move on because of it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   You guys had a few opportunities I guess earlier in the game and weren't able to cash in on them.   Obviously the fifth inning comes to mind.   You had the bases loaded there.   How big of a spot, C.J., do you think that was from a momentum standpoint?
C.J. HINOJOSA:   New pitcher came in and he did his job.   He threw a good pitch and I'm not sure who was batting.   Tried to put a good swing on it.   Aggressive at‑bat.   It just didn't go our way.

Q.   Augie, talking about what did you say to you the guys after that kind of finish and what was your message to them?
COACH GARRIDO:   That they had experienced one of the most important years of their life; that we talk about this being a life‑changing experience, and it is.   And the pain that goes along with taking the risks that they did to go all in and put everything they had on the line for each other and for the team is emotionally very difficult to deal with when you don't have a lot of experience with the downside of it. 
But 300‑something teams start and 290‑something leave with broken hearts.   But at the same time, this group is the best team since 2005 at the University of Texas, in my opinion.   And they have every reason to treat themselves like champions, and I think they had life experiences here. 
They'll never want to finish second again, and I think it will help them later on, whether they choose to compete in business, whatever they choose to be.   To go all in, take the risks it takes, to be the best, because they've experienced it.   And they no longer fear failure because it isn't failure when you do your best, and they did that, when you give your all to the team, and they did that. 
Once the grieving stops, and it will take place for a while, then they need to recognize clearly what they've won.   And they've won a hell of a lot more than they've lost.

Q.   C.J., your ball in the top of the 10th, can you just comment on where it was headed and if you thought it had a chance to get over his head?
C.J. HINOJOSA:   Squared it up.   Probably the best pitch that I saw all day.   Probably the best swing I had all day.   And off the bat I did think it was over his head.   He's a good outfielder.   He tracked it well and made a great play on it.

Q.   Augie, I know Mark is not up here but are you able to put in words what his return to Texas and Nathan's return meant to you all in the program?
COACH GARRIDO:   I think there's five guys that provided the leadership that really started this team becoming a brotherhood.   We toss around those words a lot, but seldom is it really true.   But it is for this group. 
Think of what they accomplished.   They finished fifth in the league and here they are third in the country and played the top‑rated teams in the country, right down to the last inning.   The separation in the last inning, C.J.'s ball gets caught, prevents the run.   They hit a ball, don't square it up, and they beat it out at first with the bases loaded and that's the difference.   So it's hard to explain, man.   It's a cruel game. 

Q.   John, can you talk about the 9th and just the importance of how it all unfolded and especially hitting that batter to load them up?
JOHN CURTISS:   The 10th?   Well, I got the first few guys out, and then I had hung a slider that I got lucky on for the second out.   And then they got a hit, which I wasn't too upset about, and then I walked a guy and then I hit the guy and then I went 1 and 1 and I gave up a game‑losing infield single.   That's the way baseball goes.

Q.   Augie, kind of gets lost in all this, but talk about the job that Morgan did after Parker came out to at least give you a guys a chance in this game?
COACH GARRIDO:   Yeah, he put us in position to win the game.   That's what he did.   He pitched real strong innings, and that's not out of character for him.   He's done that all year long and that isn't a cliche either.   He's been nails all year long.   He's got a good fastball.   He locates us.   He's fearless. 
Good breaking ball.   And once again he put us in position to win. 

Q.   Morgan, what allowed you to have so much success and how valuable is this experience for your future at Texas?
MORGAN COOPER:   Well, I have to give a lot of credit to Skip and what he's taught me, coming here.   He told me just one pitch at a time.   Whatever happens, happens.   And when you look at it that way, it simplifies it and allows you to just pitch. 
This year's really given me a lot of confidence and moving on it should help me in the future, but all in all you have to credit the seniors and the leaders on this team that have helped me throughout the whole year, the coaches, everybody, we're all behind each other and that's been the strongest point of our team this whole year is everyone is for everyone on the team.   Nobody's selfish. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
