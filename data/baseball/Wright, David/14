   DAVID WRIGHT:  I got a lot of practice last night.  So after practice last night, got a pitch I could handle my first at-bat.   
  
  Q.  You are having fun, playing with a guy who got voted for National League shortstop, Jose Reyes, unfortunately got hurt, your thoughts?   
 DAVID WRIGHT:  He's an outstanding player; I love him.  We came up together and now we are both in blue and orange.   
 He's a great guy and very energetic.
