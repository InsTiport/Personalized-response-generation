THE MODERATOR:   Well, give us an overview, Ray.   
COACH TANNER:   I thought a big key to that game was what Konner Wade was able to do for Arizona on the mound.   He was outstanding.   
We just couldn't get in a situation to do anything offensively.   He kept making big pitches when he needed to.   And they played solid defense out there.   And we tried to make a run at them.   
Our pitching staff did a pretty good job.   I think it was four earned runs on the night.   We kept hanging around, turned a couple of double plays to stay out of too much trouble, but we were never able to do anything offensively.   
And you gotta give Konner Wade credit for that.   He was outstanding.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   You guys have been in this position before with your backs against the wall, but yet you won three straight to get here.   Is this situation obviously similar, and how do you plan to approach tomorrow's game?  
EVAN MARZILLI:   A couple of days ago in the same situation.   You know, it's no different.   You gotta go up there, gotta take one pitch at a time.   Can't get ahead of yourself.  
They did a great job tonight.   But tomorrow's a new day.   So we have to come out tomorrow and pretend like nothing ever happened and go out and hopefully get a win.  
GRAYSON GREINER:   It's the best of two‑‑ best of three game series for a reason.   We have to come out and fight tomorrow.   We were in the same situation a few days ago.   They've got to beat us twice to win the championship, and the best team will have to win two games.  
And that's what we've gotta do tomorrow.  
EVAN BEAL:   Arizona's a real good team.   They can swing it, as you can see.   But I don't think it's anything really insurmountable to go out there and at least force the Game 3.   
It's going to be tough.   But we gotta get back on our game tomorrow and we gotta get some runs.  
   
 Q.   All the players, along those same lines, you guys obviously get together in the dugout after the game.   And initially there who kind of spoke up?   Did anyone kind of say anything as you guys start to try to respond to this game, and what was said?   
EVAN MARZILLI:   I think it's just an overall team attitude.   We knew it was time to put it behind us and come out tomorrow.   There's no feeling sorry for yourself after this one loss.   You have to go out there and forget about it real quick, especially in this series.   
That's what we've gotta do.   There's no thinking about it anymore.  
GRAYSON GREINER:   Yeah, our captains gave us words of encouragement after the game in the huddle, Ralph and Adam Price, our three captains.   And they just told us they've been in this situation before and they know what they've gotta to do to get us back to Game 3.  
   
 Q.   What was Konner Wade able to do to keep you guys off balance?  
EVAN MARZILLI:   His fastball was moving a lot.   He kept it in the zone.   He was good at working both sides of the plate.   He didn't force any‑‑ he didn't give up any walks or anything like that.   
He was on his game tonight.   And we weren't able to capitalize on some of those situations we had.   And that's just how it went.  
GRAYSON GREINER:   He had a lot of good sink on his fastball.   And we got runners out there, but he made a big pitch when he needed to make a big pitch.   
And you have to give him credit for that.   He pitched a great game and got them the win.  
   
 Q.   Evan, would you assess the way you pitched tonight?   And, Coach, what did you think about the way he pitched?  
EVAN BEAL:   I feel that‑‑ I mean, if you were to ask me, I feel slightly disappointed with the way I pitched, just gave up too many hits and spots to the runners in scoring position.   
But I just tried to minimize the damage as best I could and just get the guys back in the dugout and try and swing them.   Keep getting outs and getting back in the dugout is the best I could do.  
COACH TANNER:   Evan did a great job battling for us when he went out there, gets five innings, what was it, one earned run when he was out there.   So the results are really good.   I know he had three or four walks.   
But he competed for us.   He kept us in that thing.   We were able to turn a couple of double plays behind him to keep it going.   And because he battled hard for us, gave us a chance to come back.  
   
 Q.   Coach, obviously Refsnyder had a pretty big game for them.   Do you feel like that throw he made there in the seventh inning took the wind out of your sails a little bit?  
COACH TANNER:   It was a big play.   No question about that.   Before we get to that play, how about an opposite field home run in this park?   That was ‑‑ when hetouched that ball off, I said, That ball's been hit hard.   But I expected it to be maybe off the warning track, one hop to the fence or something.   But that was impressive.   
That's why he's one of the better players in the country.   He's able to do things like that.  
But that was a huge play.   Adam gets a base hit.   K. Martin comes up right behind him, runs the ball through the 4 hole, and Adam was aggressive trying to make a play.   
I wasn't sure he would throw the ball with the score, the time, 4‑1.   I thought maybe he would throw it to second.   He had to make a perfect throw to third.   He did.   
And it's one of those things when you're trailing you probably should have held up there, but sometimes things happen in baseball.   And he made a great play.   Couple hits with his bat tonight and big play with his arm.  
   
 Q.   Ray, did you sense any signs of a hangover after the three games and 30 hours?   Anything at all that‑‑ problems or guys just being tired or anything like that?  
COACH TANNER:   No, not at all.   I don't think that's an issue at all.   I think tonight, you know, we get‑‑ Pankake runs a ball by the third baseman there beginning of the game, Marzilli hits a pretty good shot up the middle, hits that ball hard, and Alex makes a great forehand play and turns it into a double play.  
So we could have been first and third with no outs right there and they made a big play.   
But I just felt like the difference in the game was Konner Wade.   The guy pitched‑‑ I think he struck out three maybe.   He strikes three guys out.   And he's out there for a complete game.   Very, very impressive.   He used both sides of the plate.  
He kept us from doing too much offensively.   And they did what they needed to do offensively.   So I felt like we were zoned in.   We were ready to go.   We didn't make anything happen.   
But I think you give credit where credit's due, and that's with Konner Wade.  
   
 Q.   Ray, does Roth get the ball tomorrow?   Will Tyler Webb be available?  
COACH TANNER:   I think Webb's probably got a max of two tomorrow.   He said he felt pretty good today.   I wasn't going to do that.   But he'll probably be okay for a little bit tomorrow.   He'll probably be okay for a little bit.   
And Roth told me, surprisingly, he said:   I was pretty close today.   He said it was‑‑ he feels pretty good.   So more than likely he'll go tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Ray, your guys hit a lot of fly balls tonight, I think 12 or 13 fly ball outs to a guy that likes to keep the ball down.   Did you see anything in their approach that led to that?  
COACH TANNER:   You know, a couple of those balls I thought were hit pretty well.   But you have to hit them better than pretty well in this park.   
But that's part of it.   Maybe they got pitches to hit because he was sinking it a little bit.   But you weren't able to get anything going out there.   So I thought, again, I'm not selling out our hitters tonight.   I give more credit to Konner Wade for the results.  
   
 Q.   Your team only made one error in the first five games of this series and you have two tonight.   Do you feel maybe that was a reasonthat might have been that Arizona got that early lead and maybe tried to do a little too much to the defensive side?  
COACH TANNER:   No, I don't think so.   It was just one of those situations I think Pankake kind of had a ball up the middle where he didn't make a play on.   Greiner had a ball he blocked in the dirt, threw it to second, and then got away, and that was the second error.   
So I don't think anything too much about that.   We played pretty good to this point.   But that didn't lead to us getting beat tonight.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you mentioned yesterday it was going to be hard for you to win only scoring one or two runs.   But on the flip side with Forest, what did you see maybe wasn't working for him out there?   When he came off, was he in any pain with the elbow or anything?  
COACH TANNER:   No, I thought he was throwing the ball pretty well.   He did okay.   I know the ball Refsnyder hit, that was impressive.   If you try to approach him any particular way, you'd say make him hit it the other way, and he did.   He hit it a long way.   
But Forest battled when he was out there, and, like I said, Evan came in and gave us a chance.   We just didn't make enough things to happen on the offensive side.  
   
 Q.   Coach, first time in the championship series you're down 1‑0.   You still take the same approach that you've taken all year?  
COACH TANNER:   Well, it's been pretty good.   It got us here.   So we're not going to do anything any different.   
The only thing I really want to happen now is what these guys talked about.   This is a get over it.   Let's go back and regroup.   And somebody would have said two months ago:   Hey, you're going to be in the championship series but you're going to be down by a game, will you sign for it?   Absolutely.   
I mean, it's not where we would want to be today.   But, you know, we're still playing.   And you win tomorrow, you even it up and get a little momentum going in the third game.   
Is it going to be easy?   Absolutely not.   They're really, really good.   But this is no time would have, could have, should have.   
Let's get back on the horse and try to get a win tomorrow.
