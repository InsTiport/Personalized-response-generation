 Q. (No microphone.)
 SHUICHI MURATA: (Indiscernible) and keeping an eye on how the pitch is going to deliver and such, judging from all of that. 

 Q. The starting pitcher last time, it was 1-0. Expect it to come back? 
 SHUICHI MURATA: Yes, beaten once. They just recently played (indiscernible), left-handed pitcher and right batter, something has to be done as a whole. Something will be done within that realm, if I can do my own job. 

 Q. You are defending and practicing together with your coach (earlier), and the coach, it was as if giving you a sign of approval. 
 SHUICHI MURATA: No, no, no, not quite there yet.
 This nice opportunity has been given to me to play in such a place. In defending, there are things to be learned. In that sense, little by little, I am growing. 

 Q. Much is expected out of you, whether you are defending or at-bat. 
 SHUICHI MURATA: Thank you.
