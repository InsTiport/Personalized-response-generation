Q. Talk about Ricky, he just continues to be an offensive catalyst for you guys, what
he is doing at 40 has to be amazing?

BOBBY VALENTINE: This entire year has been a magical and a fantastic year for Ricky.
Every time someone thought that we have seen it all, he turns it up and gives us more and
has given us more with excitement and flare and speed and home runs. Pretty impressive.

Q. Given Mike's injury and some of the pre-game controversy, whatever you want to call
it about the comments in the magazine, how do you think the team responded tonight?

BOBBY VALENTINE: You saw how they responded to it. Like I said before the game they
don't care about any of that nonsense. They care about Mike and they played during the
regular season, I would think, about 20 games or so without him starting behind the plate
and every game we felt we had a chance to win. I think that is how we started this game.

Q. After all it took to get, you are one game away from the next step here. Do you feel
like something is accomplished or almost accomplished?

BOBBY VALENTINE: I think we have accomplished 2 out of 3 and we need 3 out of 5 and I
understand that totally and I know the team does too.

Q. Rick Reed, can you compare to the last game obviously that --

BOBBY VALENTINE: I think he was right with the last -- I thought his stuff was the same
as last game. I thought that you know, there were a lot of close pitches from both sides
that both pitchers made but they were all quality pitches that Rick was making. Even the
ball that Ward hit I had thought it was a pretty good curve ball down in the zone.
