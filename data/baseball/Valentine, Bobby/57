Q. Coming to this ballpark on the road and beating their No. 1 pitcher, what does it
mean, Bobby?

BOBBY VALENTINE: It means we have one game under our belt. He's a very good pitcher,
and without a doubt, if it goes five, we'll see him again. But we wanted to get this one.
We had an opportunity to win the first game of a playoff before. So guys came out swinging
and had great -- I thought they were just great at-bats tonight; John Olerud chiming in
with Alfonzo were big. And Robin got a couple hits off Randy -- I think four hits
left-handed. And that's determination. That's what that is. That's reaching down and
wanting it. 

Q. Were you surprised to see Randy come back out for the 9th inning?

BOBBY VALENTINE: No. No. He got back into his pitch count. We had him over his pitch
count there in the 3rd, 4th and 5th, but we hit some first pitches, and he got back into a
situation where he was in what I'm sure their limit is for him. So he was mowing them down
there at the end, and they had momentum, and he's a guy that captures momentum, usually. 

Q. What do you think of Alfonzo's performance so far?

BOBBY VALENTINE: Well, last couple nights he's hit really big home runs, but over the
last few years, I think Alfonzo has been a fabulous baseball player who is one of the guys
in this league who has kind of a star quality, but he's improving. He's learning about
himself every day that he goes out there and gaining confidence, and with confidence comes
performances like you saw tonight.
