Q.  Tell us your overall feeling about the game. 

BOBBY VALENTINE:   Well, I'm still collecting it.  It was one of the highlights of my life.  It was sort of, I was with a great group of guys.  To see Cal get a standing ovation and step in and hit a first-pitch homer is one of the most amazing feats I've ever seen.  We battled, but came up short, but I think everyone gave a great effort and enjoyed the hell out of this game. 

Q.  Did Coach Stern pay you to sub Lasorda in there in the sixth inning? 

BOBBY VALENTINE:   Yeah, we were trying to get some runs.  Thank God he didn't get hurt, but sure brought some laughter.  Laughter is good for the heart. 

Q.  Just a little hard to get anything going against their staff collectively?

BOBBY VALENTINE:   That's what it looked like.  We didn't put any hits together and guys were not seeing the ball very well in the shadows there and came back complaining a little about it.  When you have one at-bat to adjust, and that's what most of the guys had, some of them had two, it was a tough thing for the hitters, and their pitchers made really good pitches.

Q.  What did you think about Cal's performance? 

BOBBY VALENTINE:   Well, I already said that seeing it would be hard to believe it; seeing it live and being a little part of it is a real special thing.  You know, when he stepped out and tipped his hat I thought maybe he would take a pitch, because he had a good adrenaline flow, but he hit it over the fence.  That's Cal and that's why we honor him today.

Q.  You've seen a lot of players.  How storybook is that for you to see that? 

BOBBY VALENTINE:   It's not quite the ending, but it's the ending of the All-Star chapter, and how could it be a better ending, for someone as deserving, most deserving, as Cal?
