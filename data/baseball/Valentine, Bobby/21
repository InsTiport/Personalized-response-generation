Q. You knew the Cardinals with the team they had coming in down 0-2 weren't going to lie down. 
 
BOBBY VALENTINE: Yeah, they're a real good team.  We knew that.  
 

Q.  Did Benes do anything different today?
 
BOBBY VALENTINE: He threw really good pitches when he had to.  The time we had them on the ropes, we couldn't put them away.  He was hitting corners, off speed pitches when he was behind in the count.  Worked his fastball both sides of the plate, played Andy Benes.  
 

Q.  Reed struggled right from the start.  He seemed uncomfortable out there at the beginning. 
 
BOBBY VALENTINE: Well, he wasn't  -- didn't have his fastball tonight.  Didn't locate the fastball.  When he made a good pitch, he wasn't making it consistently, he didn't get it called.  Got it called a few times there to get out of the first inning, then just wasn't as consistent as he was or usually is with his fastball. 
 

Q.  Did Rick express to you that he was not getting the corners, especially on the call with Lankford, where Lankford got the hit in the third inning? Did he express to you he was not getting in the corners?
 
BOBBY VALENTINE: No.  Not really.  It was a close pitch to Lankford.
