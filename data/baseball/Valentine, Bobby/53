 Q. Give you the thinking since Hershiser pitched Sunday and Leiter pitched Monday; how
does it work that Game 4 tomorrow Leiter will pitch?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: I don't know about Monday or I have never mentioned the word Monday,
so Al is pitching tomorrow which is Saturday. 
 
Q. Last Monday?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: I am sorry. Last week? 
 
Q. Right. In other words, --
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Okay last week we had -- we had the game here which was Orel's normal
day to pitch with normal rest; to pitch Al on that day which was Sunday, I believe, would
have had Al coming back on short rest. It would have been short rest plus the half day and
I didn't want to do that, even though I took him out of the game with 100 pitches I didn't
want to do that. I didn't see the necessity. 
 
Q. Here's what I am after. I guess I am not doing too well. Leiter pitches tomorrow.
Hershiser pitched last Sunday. Leiter pitched last Monday. What is the thinking that
Leiter goes tomorrow rather than Hershiser?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: The thinking is just simple that this is Al's normal day to pitch. So
we are going to keep him on the normal rest and have him pitch. Basically using Orel in
the bullpen in this series. We are not using him as a starter. 
 
Q. How is Al's knee?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: His knee is feeling good. 
 
Q. Was that any concern? Is that why you didn't want to announce it early just in case?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: No. 
 
Q. Is there anyway that Al won't start tomorrow?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: No, there is no way Al won't start tomorrow. Unless that negative
sentence just meant a yeah -- Yes, there is no way he won't start tomorrow. 
 
Q. Does that mean if there is a Game 5, Yoshii will start Game 5?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: More than likely, yes. 
 
Q. When Rick pitched against Arizona earlier, way back in May and they did a good
number on him, but he is a different pitcher now, do you expect that he can go against
them tonight?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: I hope he pitches differently tonight. Can't throw them out in other
words in the books. That is what he did and you know, we are expecting him to come up big
and pitch the way he is capable of pitching. 
 
Q. How is Mike doing, Bobby?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Mike is not doing that good. He can't move his finger so he is not in
the lineup today. 
 
Q. Left thumb?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Yes. 
 
Q. It's not broken; it is just badly swollen or bruised?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: It is not broken. Took X-rays. It is just badly swollen and stiff. But
he will take batting practice and we will see if it loosens up and gets any better before
game time. But right now he is in the training room and it is not very functional. 
 
Q. Is catching the bigger problem or hitting?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Yes. (Laughter.) 
 
Q. If he is not in the lineup does that have any effect on the team mentally if he is
not there in such a big game?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Team is pretty strong mentally. I think -- no not having him in the
lineup is something that -- the team has been used to for about 143 of the games that we
played this year, but in the other games Todd Pratt has done a wonderful job and we played
very well when he has played. 
 
Q. When did this happen to Mike?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: I should go back and look. I am pretty sure it was about the third
inning. 
 
Q. Second game?
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: Yes. 
 
Q. Does Daal going tonight, no playoff experience, do you add any of that in? I mean,
he has done pretty well against you guys this year. I think he is 2 and 1. But do you add
any additional pressure on the road.....
 
 BOBBY VALENTINE: I don't know the guy that well individually. Always seemed like a real
good competitor and rather seasoned like Matt Franco so I think he is okay.
