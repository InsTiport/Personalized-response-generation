Vanderbilt   6
  UC Irvine - 4

THE MODERATOR:   Representing UC Irvine, Head Coach Mike Gillespie, outfielder Kris Paulino, and third baseman Taylor Sparks. 
Coach, an opening statement.
COACH GILLESPIE:   This game was surprisingly a close score, because, I promise you, it felt like a root canal. 
We got out everythinged.   We I think ‑‑ particularly once Buehler came into the game, he pitched like a first rounder waiting to happen.   If Taylor Sparks is not going to be using me as his agent, I'm going to be Buehler's agent. 
I think Vanderbilt was very impressive up and down their lineup.   They executed.   And I think the score just wasn't indicative of the difference between the two teams tonight. 
So we'll show up on Wednesday, try to give a better account of ourselves on Wednesday. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Coach, I think they had five stolen bases tonight.   Their speed obviously gave you guys fits.   How do you defend against that next time if you play these guys again?
COACH GILLESPIE:   Well, I mean, I'd have to go through one by one.   I think certainly‑‑ I mean, I know for sure that one came on a ball‑‑ they were running, pitches in the dirt.   Didn't give ourselves a chance to throw. 
We pitched out at least once when they were running and couldn't execute the throw.   So now we're talking about three.   And I'd have to go through‑‑ look, I'm not overly alarmed by that, I'm really not. 
They do run.   They run really well.   I mean, typically the numbers don't lie on this.   We don't‑‑ giving up the stolen base has not been a problem, not an issue.   We're typically quick to the plate.   Our catcher typically throws well. 
So I think that what you saw here tonight was not‑‑ if we were to play them again, that would‑‑ we know we've got to deal with how well they run.   But that would not be the number one thing we'd be concerned about.
I think we can handle ourselves pretty good on the running game. 

Q.   This is for the players.   You guys seemed to be able to capitalize, get some clutch hits when Beede was in the game, but once Buehler came in the game he got you off your game.   What were you seeing from him and what was he doing to keep you off balance?
KRIS PAULINO:   I think we had a good approach against Beede.   He tends to be wild, and we were disciplined.   And Buehler came in the game, he pounded the strike zone.   He was throwing pretty hard.   He had good command of his off speed, too.   I don't know.   He was on.
TAYLOR SPARKS:   Once Buehler came into the game, he executed.   We just didn't play the way we usually play and our at‑bats just weren't what they usually are, especially from Beede to Buehler.   We chase a lot more with Buehler.   He executed pitcher's pitches against us.   And we just didn't execute as well against Buehler.

Q.   Kris and Taylor, you guys are a pretty energetic bunch.   After you guys got the lead, you guys seemed like you were going crazy in the dugouts.   Did it feel like after they re‑took the lead, what was the energy like in the dugout?   Did it feel like it was as a bigger deficit than it was like Skip said?
KRIS PAULINO:   Yes, after the four‑run inning, we were pretty fired up.   I think we had a couple of innings where we got a couple of lead‑off hitters on.   We scored on some opportunities, and I think the momentum started to shift and there might have been some‑‑ a lull of energy in the dugout, and we had some long innings on defense. 
I think if we had quick innings and kept the energy up, we would have had more fight.
TAYLOR SPARKS:   The energy was of course the best after the four‑run inning.   After that, like Kris was saying, the long defensive innings took a bit from our momentum.   It took us a bit to get fired up in the dugout.   Took more energy to get in the dugout than obviously it would be if you had the lead. 
But I think the energy just wasn't what it was through the whole game and the momentum just wasn't there for us. 

Q.   Did you guys feel like you had a bigger hole than you necessarily had when you're down by 1 then play their two runs?
KRIS PAULINO:   I think we felt pretty confident, and then for us to go back down again 1 and then two runs, it seemed like it was going to take a lot, especially Buehler was going to start to throw well and you felt he was on a roll, and there was just a lack of momentum. 
But I think if we played them again, we wouldn't have a problem coming back.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
