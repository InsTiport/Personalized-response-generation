Q.  When you came in with the bases loaded in the eighth, what was going through your mind? 
 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM:  Nothing.  
 

Q.  What were you thinking when you faced Lopez? 
 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM:  It was the most exciting moment of the game.  I threw the ball where I wanted to.  I got the double-play ball.  I threw the ball as hard as I could and got the results I wanted.  
 

Q.  Do you think the bullpen has been unfairly criticized or portrayed by the media during the playoffs? 
 
BYUNG-HYUN KIM:  I really don't care what they're saying.  I don't agree with them.  I don't read the papers, but I don't agree with the media saying the bullpen is weak.  If the bullpen hadn't done the job all season, the team wouldn't be here in the playoffs.  Starting pitchers did their job during the year.  The hitters did their job.  The bullpen did its job.
