  THE MODERATOR: Questions for Hiroki.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about the honor of receiving the start in such an important game?  
 HIROKI KURODA: I feel very honored to be the third starter for this important game. And I would like to pitch my best and perform as well as people expect me to perform.  
  
  Q. With the team being up 2-0, is there somewhat less pressure to be perfect right off the bat? Do you feel like you have a little bit of cushion to work with?  
 HIROKI KURODA: I don't feel less pressure, per se, because no matter what kind of game I pitch, the approach to the game is pretty much the same, whether it's the post-season or regular season. I've always felt pressure during the regular season. So it's pretty much the same.  
  
  Q. Have you learned anything from the performance of the two Dodgers starters who controlled the games against the Cubs so well?  
 HIROKI KURODA: I was able to learn a lot from these two games, but not only that, during this whole season, I was able to learn a lot from those two great pitchers. And I like to perform so that what I gain from them could be realized in my pitching tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What is your impression of the Cubs' lineup, and are there any things that you have to be cautious about the Cubs' offense?   
 HIROKI KURODA: I faced them twice during the regular season, and I was able to pitch well on both times. But it doesn't really mean that I'm going to pitch well again during the post-season.   
 As far as the things that I have to be really cautious about this team, everyone, everyone in the lineup, because they're a great team and I have to be really careful with everyone that I face.
