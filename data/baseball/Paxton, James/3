Q. Any thoughts about being switched from Game 1 to Game 2 for this playoff series?
JAMES PAXTON: No, I'll take the ball whenever they give it to me. I'm just excited to be here in the ALCS and going after it.
Q. What kind of special challenge do the Astros present besides having really good hitters?
JAMES PAXTON: I mean, they're a good team. They're really good. It's going to be a good challenge. Just got to go out there and execute pitches against them.
Q. You've had past success against this team before. Is that something you can carry into a postseason start or do you look at it as a separate situation?
JAMES PAXTON: Yeah, I mean, having past success against them is great. Obviously that can help build some confidence. But tomorrow is its own day, and I'm going to have to go out there and do my thing and execute pitches, like I said. They're a really good team so I'm going to have to do what I do and not leave anything over the middle for them.
