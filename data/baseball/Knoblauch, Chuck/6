Q. Would you talk about the three-run game-tying homer. Do you feel like the weight of
New York has been lifted off your shoulders?

CHUCK KNOBLAUCH: It was definitely a big hit for our team. I got ahead in the count
2-0, and I was looking for a good pitch to hit. I wasn't trying to hit a homerun. Just to
hit something solid. I got some air under it, and it went out.

Q. Was there a feeling of redemption?

CHUCK KNOBLAUCH: Not really. In this game there are days up and days that are down. You
just try to stay consistent. You have to face the facts, answer the questions, be a
standup guy and that's all you can do. Tonight's a great feeling. We won the ALCS and we
got to this point. It's a great night tonight.
