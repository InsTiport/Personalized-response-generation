THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Tennessee Co‑Head Coach Ralph Weekly and student‑athletes Ashley Andrews, Raven Chavanne and Ellen Renfroe.   Coach, an opening comment.   
COACH RALPH WEEKLY:   Well, first of all, I'd like to thank the host, the NCAA and ESPN, for a tremendous tournament once again.   
We lost two very close ballgames.   Our kids gave it everything we had.   We just couldn't hit in the clutch.   And we're hitting the ball pretty good in DP and hitting the ball pretty good yesterday, and that happens at times.  
And it's really not anybody's fault.   There was no lack of effort out there.   And we just got beat both times.   
And I have to give credit to Oregon.   They had a great game plan, and their pitcher did well.   We hit a lot of ground balls.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   Raven, I think this is like maybe the third time all year you didn't reach base.   
RAVEN CHAVANNE:   Was it?  
   
 Q.   I think so.   Yeah, the third time this year.   What did Moore have going for her on the mound to keep you guys off balance?  
RAVEN CHAVANNE:   She's an All‑American pitcher.   She did a great job and she was just hitting her spots.   
I feel like hitters, myself included, I swung at pitches I shouldn't have swung at.   And I kind of played into her game.   It's just a learning experience.   You know, you live and you learn.  
So she did a great job, though, so you have to give her credit.  
   
 Q.   Ellen, first inning, lead‑off home run.   The slow start.   Yesterday you kind of set out and pitched well.   Seemed like you set a little bit in this game, but coming out, what was the problem?  
ELLEN RENFROE:   Just trying to find a strike zone can always be tough just coming out.   Having the first start in the World Series, for me, it can be nerve racking.   But as a pitcher and as an athlete, you have to learn to settle down and find that strike zone and keep battling for your team.  
And I don't think I did a good job of that today.   Just continuing to battle.  
COACH RALPH WEEKLY:   Mike, I think Ellen is a great pitcher.   And what she's done for us over the last two years is unbelievable.   And, again, it was her first start in the World Series, and I'm sure it won't be her last.  
   
 Q.   For both Ashley and Coach Weekly.   Ashley, tell me about your season as a whole and your thoughts on how it went and just sum up the whole year for the team.   
ASHLEY ANDREWS:   We had a good year.   Our goal at the beginning was to make it to the World Series.   And once you get here, your goal is to definitely go far and hopefully win the World Series.   But that didn't happen for us.   
But the whole year we battled.   We got in close games, and we never stopped fighting.  
And that is, I think, just the identity of our team.   And just all of these girls on this team will always have a special place in my heart.   And I just wish them the best of luck next year.  
COACH RALPH WEEKLY:   This has been a special season.   And it's been a great group of kids.   I mean, you might not be able to tell it sometimes on the field, but the chemistry was outstanding.   
We didn't have any disciplinary problems all season long.   The kids worked extra hard.   
And I just think that what happened in the last two weeks‑‑ because again, if you checked the stats, we were two percentage points behind Alabama in SEC hitting, I think we went into a team‑hitting slump at the wrong time.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
