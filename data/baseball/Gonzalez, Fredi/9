 Q.   All the two‑out hits tonight, it's kind of something you've done all year, but how good do you feel about how you bounced back from last night?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   Well, we had a couple of them, the big ones.   I think Chris Johnson had the very first one, and we had some good at‑bats.   We really had some good at‑bats.   I think we were able to tag on runs, or add on runs later in the game, was big.   
I thought defensively today we played‑‑ we turned three double plays.   The last one with Avilan, first and third, PFP, you see a lot of that play end up in center field.   But he made a nice toss to Simmons, and Simmons turned it pretty good.   
We played good defense.   We played good defense.   Mike was outstanding, gave us a great opportunity to win the game.   And it was nice to shake hands, especially at home after the game last night.   Come out and play a really, really good baseball game, and hopefully carry a little momentum going into LA.  
   
 Q.   Mike gave up that RBI double in the first inning and then he seemed to settle down.   Was there any concern right out of the box there?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   No, usually when he settles down like that he's going to give you a good opportunity, he really is, and that's something that he's getting better.   He's maturing as a pitcher.   I thought he was terrific, I really do.   
   
 Q.   I know you don't look at it like this going in, but now that the game is over, was that pretty much a must‑win for you guys?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   Oh, there's no question.   You don't want to go into the next‑‑ into LA down two games.   
But now our goal over there is to win one, maybe split the two games there and come back home.   But you're facing Greinke after facing Kershaw last night, and it was a big win, and the guys stepped up and they played tremendous defense and got some add‑on runs, and we really, really pitched well.   
   
 Q.   I know you've spoken a few times about if you have three No.1s, three No.3s, whatever.   How long did you struggle with who to start in Game 1, who to start in Game 2?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   Not very long.   I think Roger and I sat down and I think Medlen's last five, six starts really solidified it.   You could have gone either way.   You could have gone Minor first, Medlen second.   I think the way the season ended fell perfectly with not giving anybody too much rest or not enough rest juggling that stuff.   But anyway, I think for me, either or, we could have gone either or with those two guys.   
   
 Q.   You have a tough team, obviously Heyward coming back from a broken jaw to play the hero tonight.   Were you concerned?   I know yesterday you said the team was a little amped up but didn't play a good game.   Did you feel the team would be able to bounce back or was there some concern?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   No, not at all.   Yesterday there was a lot of firsts for a lot of guys and a lot of first appearances, a lot of first at‑bats in the Division Series, a lot of first managing the first game in the division, too.   I was right in the middle of all those things.   
We had four pitchers come out of the bullpen last night for the first time to pitch in a playoff game, and I think that was good to get them in there and get them settled in.   And then Simmons hadn't played and Gattis and you go on around the horn.   I think yesterday was good for them to get their feet wet and kind of settle them down a little bit.   But today I didn't think there was going to be any residue from last night.   
   
 Q.   How about just to get those two insurance runs late in the game, and then also Carp bouncing back from the two‑run homer with those two strikeouts?  
FREDI GONZALEZ:   Yeah, I can't wait to see the home run that Hanley hit becauseI think he one‑handed it.   But you're right, Heyward getting the homer there and getting us a two‑run lead because stuff like that can happen.   The Dodger lineup is a pretty talented lineup.   That was big.   Those add‑on runs late were big.   
And then Carpenter settled down and got two big strikeouts.   We walked a couple of people, extra too many people there in the eighth and ninth innings, but we got out of it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
FREDI GONZALEZ:   Well, he's a young kid, and we've seen him for 162 games, just keeps getting better and maturing with experience, and I think we've just seen the tip of the iceberg with him.   I think he's going to be getting better and better.
