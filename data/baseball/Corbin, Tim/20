THE MODERATOR:   Representing Vanderbilt, head Coach Tim Corbin, starting pitcher, Tyler Beede, and outfielder, John Norwood.   Coach, if you'd begin with an opening statement? 
COACH CORBIN:   Well, Waddell threw a heck of a game.   You have to give him a lot of credit.   He basically suffocated our offense for most of the night, particularly as the game went on.   He looks like a winning pitcher to me.   It's the first time we've been able to see him up close outside of what we saw on TV.
I thought our guy did a nice job as well.   I thought there were some plays that we may have been able to contain.   They were big at the moment, and the inning got a little bit loose.   They had a big inning there with the three spot.   I thought there were a couple of defensive plays we could have controlled.   But they did a nice job of hitting and running and advancing runners.   They were aggressive at the time, and it seemed to work out for them because they found areas in the field that we weren't able to defend.

Q.   Coach, your pitching staff has had a little bit of a rough go over the past couple days.   What is your level of confidence going into this Game 3, and what is your plan going forward? 
COACH CORBIN:   Fine.   We're playing a good team.   Playing a team that has a very high plus‑minus.   I mean, they don't strike out.   They walk.   They put the ball in play.   They have very good approaches at the plate.   It's a tough team to pitch against, but I have no issue with our pitching.   Not an issue.   None whatsoever.

Q.   Tim, can you circle that fourth inning after the Norwood double, what happened there as possibly a bad omen the rest of the way? 
COACH CORBIN:   The breakdown in bunt you're talking about?   Didn't get a bunt down and we got picked off so the inning crashed. 

Q.   From your perspective, what was it that Waddell was able to do tonight to kind of keep you guys from ever getting into a groove offensively? 
COACH CORBIN:   Change speeds and pitching to the defense.   I thought he did a very nice job of that.   They defended us well.   We were making early contact and hitting into the teeth of the defense, and didn't really make a good adjustment with him.   Now, it's not easy, obviously.   The kid's throwing a good fastball.   He's throwing it both sides of the plate.   He's decelerating the baseball with a changeup and throwing the breaking ball.   He's a three‑pitch, four‑pitch guy.   You have to be on, but you really, really have to be able to use and stay inside the baseball and use the other side of the field.   He didn't allow us to do that.

Q.   Tyler, you got through their lineup a couple times there pretty effectively.   What, from your perspective changed the third time through? 
TYLER BEEDE:   I think just execution was a little more poor the third and fourth times through the lineup.   Certainly was only working with two pitches there fastball, changeup.   So it was kind of 50‑50.   But like I said, could have executed better.   They were finding holes, and certainly a talented hitting team.   Like Coach said, Waddell pitched sugar again.

Q.   Coach, do you know who you're planning on starting tomorrow, and are there any guys out of the bullpen that right now you can rule out? 
COACH CORBIN:   No, everyone's in.   I mean, it's the last game of the season.   Everyone's going to pitch, so I don't have any problem with that.   Who is going to start?   I'm not sure yet.   Our intentions will probably be Fulmer; I'm sure he'll fight to take the ball, so we'll see though.   That's not official.

Q.   (No Microphone)?
JOHN NORWOOD:   (No Microphone).

Q.   The little dust‑up on third base with Papi and Tyler, does that carry over to tomorrow? 
COACH CORBIN:   No way, no.
