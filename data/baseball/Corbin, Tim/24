 Q.   Coach, from your vantage point, what was making it so hard to hit Thornhill out there?   
TIM CORBIN:   I think he was expanding the plate pretty well.   It seemed like when he was getting a call on the outer half of the plate he was able to go back out there again and maybe a couple inches more.   I didn't have the vantage point that someone else would have that was sitting behind the plate, but to me he was utilizing the zone, and good for him.   That was smart, and our kid was, too, Brian did the same thing.   But I think he just took advantage of that.   When you chip the ball up in the air there's not much you can do.   We didn't have much success and you can't applaud fly balls here, and unfortunately we hit some of those today.   
   
 Q.   Coach, when did you find out today that Xavier would be unavailable to you, and what does Tyler kind of bring to the table filling in his stead there?   
TIM CORBIN:   Tyler did a nice job I thought.   Tyler jumped in right away, told him last night that he was going to play.   Third base position for us was either one or two guys, and he's been a kid that's waited very patiently and worked hard to keep himself on balance in case he had to play.   I thought he came in today and gave us a shot in the arm, stayed inside two balls, drove them to right center play, made a great glove play.   I'm happy for him.   I told him last night this is a great opportunity for a kid like him, and he went in there unaffected and played well, so he'll get that opportunity again.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, along those lines could you talk about keeping yourself ready playing in the World Series and then come out and have a day like you did today?   
TYLER CAMPBELL:   I think I credit that just to how we train every day.   I mean, coach keeps us ready.   The guys who don't play in the games, we have a lot of game‑like situations that we're competing in every day, and so keeping a competitive edge isn't tough while training.   
   
 Q.   Tim, Texas only gets five hits, gets four runs out of that.   How would you describe Texas' offense and how you plan to stop them tomorrow?   
TIM CORBIN:   Well, I thought we did a good job of stopping them for the most part.   I mean, they can hit.   I credit our pitcher.   Those are good hitters, and they've been exposed to very good pitching in the Big 12, obviously, and this is our first opportunity to really play them.   
I would say they were dangerous.   You know, we helped them a little bit.   I don't say that in a negative way.   I mean, we put some guys on base for them, and you know, that's just tough.   You don't want to be playing uphill early in the game like we did.   But they scrapped enough.   They pushed the ball around with guys in scoring position, Payton's bunt.   They're going to make you pay if they soften the defense.   They have some ways to cross the plate when guys are at third base.   
   
 Q.   Coach, you've got some great arms left.   How does this loss affect you pitching‑wise going forward and how do you like your chances?   
TIM CORBIN:   We don't.   We just move forward.   It's another chance to play another baseball game.   We're in great shape.   I pretty much think that Carson will throw tomorrow, but we're in good shape, got a lot of arms past him, and there's a lot of kids that are wanting to pitch.   I don't worry about that.   Just another nine‑inning ballgame.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, like you said, you stayed ready, but staying ready in practice is a little different than playing in the College World Series.   What was going through your mind before today's start?   
TYLER CAMPBELL:   You know, the main thing was just trying to fill in, play solid defense.   I wanted to see a lot of pitches at the plate, swung at the first pitch that last at‑bat, but for the most part I just wanted to play solid defense and try and have good at‑bats.   That was my mentality.   
   
 Q.   Tyler and Brian both, you guys have been in a good situation pretty much the whole time you've been here but now you turn around in 24 hours and have an elimination game.   Just talk about what the mindset is for you guys as a team in the locker room and how you rebound in such a short time period.   
BRIAN MILLER:   Yeah, I mean, we faced a very similar situation at Stanford, and I can tell just coming off the field that it's a very similar mindset, and we just know that when our backs are against the wall, we're going to come out really aggressive and strong just like we did against Stanford, and it's definitely going to be fun to play in tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Coach, I know for the team that starts 2‑0 there's always a little bit of a challenge of trying to stay sharp for three days off.   Do you think that affected your team's rhythm?   And also, Tyler, was he just too amped up early on?   
TIM CORBIN:   Obviously so, just couldn't handle the moment at the time, and that's too bad because that kid deserves better.   He works very hard, and he's got great stuff, and you didn't see Tyler Ferguson today unfortunately, but that's okay.   There's opportunities.   I know Nick said elimination game, but for us that would be glass half empty.   This is a game to move on.   That's all it is.   It's another nine‑inning game.   
But as far as what happened today, I don't know.   I mean, I guess you would say the way we played maybe so, but I really think you've got to give some credit to Thornhill.   I thought he pitched well.   That ERA is low for a reason, and he's a senior, and he knows what he's doing.   He's very composed, and he's pitching for Texas.   He did a nice job.   I think you've got to give a lot of credit to that kid.   
   
 Q.   Coach, how much impact do you think the ball that hit off the umpire had?   Looked like it could have potentially been a double play to end the inning.   
TIM CORBIN:   It could have, but it may have been a tough double play, too.   That's just anyone's guess.   He's just got to work on his agility a little bit so he can move.   But I don't know what would have happened had the ball gone by him.   We may have gotten a break, I don't know, but there's nothing we can do about that.   
   
 Q.   Brian, as far as pitching to Clemens coming in like you did, talk about how hard that was to do, and then the two triples, what kind of pitches did they hit, next inning?   
BRIAN MILLER:   The situation against Clemens, I mean, you kind of come in there in a‑‑ I've been put in that situation several times, and I know coach has confidence in me there.   Just going up to the mound and kind of feeling that confidence.   It's very comforting.   
As far as the two triples, the righty, I forgot his name, but that was kind of just a fastball that ran a little too far over the middle of the plate, and he just got his hands out and right into his barrel.   I thought the pitch to Brooks, the lefty, I thought that was a good pitch.   It was down, it sunk, he just kind of snap hooked it right over the first baseman's head.
