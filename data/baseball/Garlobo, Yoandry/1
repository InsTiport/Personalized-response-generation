 YOANDRY GARLOBO:  It's a game that we fought a lot for, but unfortunately things went better for them and they won the game. 
 Q.  How do you think the people back home feel about this game? 
 YOANDRY GARLOBO:  They know that we tried our hardest.  They know that we fought until the very end, but the other team won.  They fought for it and they won and they deserve it, deserve the victory. 
 Q.  What do you think of today's game? 
 FREDERICH CEPEDA:  Baseball is a game.  We went and fought for this game just like every other game in this tournament, but Japan also went out and fought for this game.  They took advantage of the first inning when they scored those runs.  We tried to get back on top, but they played better than we did and they deserve the victory because they played better? 
 Q.  Do you feel happy about your performance?  
 FREDERICH CEPEDA:  We're happy with the result, but we're not satisfied because we made it all the way to here.  We could have fought more and gotten the win, but that's baseball.  It's one more game, and I personally don't feel right because I'm not okay with losing. 
 There will be another championship and we'll keep moving forward.
