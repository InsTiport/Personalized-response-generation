MÃ©xico - 11, Venezuela - 9.   
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: Good evening.  Well, right now we are in a discussion with MLB because before the game, they were asked about the rule, the clarification.  The language doesn't specify a third, it doesn't specify outs.  It says innings.  We played the ninth inning against Italy, so we asked them for a clarification about that rule before we started the game.   
The game, we told them more than 10 times to come.  We're in this situation right now so that our fight is that clarification had to have been done before the game.  Right now we're arguing that rule and awaiting the results.  For the time being, right now, MÃ©xico and Venezuela haven't advanced.  We're talking to the Commissioner for that question.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: At this point, the only thing is Italy.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: Right now the person that -- there hasn't been a decision.  Right now they are in a room trying to clarify -- they need to clarify the rule.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: In this media, we're trying to -- they published that Mexico had advanced, so did people from MLB, like they said on TV, if they scored one run and it went to 10 -- we needed two runs.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: MLB is John Morris.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: We have to clarify the rule.  If one is counting on it, a clarification about what they are saying.  We need that point clarified.

 Q.  (Indiscernible) what would be your (indiscernible)?

 Q.  (No microphone)?  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: They are supposed to clarify the question, but they didn't specify.  I wanted a clarification.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?

 Q.  (No microphone).  
KUNDY GUTIERREZ: That's what we're arguing.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?
