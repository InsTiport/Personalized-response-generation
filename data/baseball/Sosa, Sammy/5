Q.  What were your impressions of Seattle and Ichiro, specifically?

SAMMY SOSA:   First, you know, to get here, and especially the way the Seattle team is playing, is unbelievable.  To see Ichiro and the rest of the guys, he came out, and it's nice  -- always nice to play, like, with Ichiro, coming from a different country and coming to the United States and having the performance he's been having is unbelievable.

Q.  It seems every All-Star Game provides a memory.  How much will you remember what Cal just did?

SAMMY SOSA:    Wow.  It's like a dream come true, especially, you know, everybody was on his feet and clapping and after that, he came in with the home run.  It doesn't get better than that as a human being.  That's a great feeling, especially he announced his retirement and came and put a shot like that, that's amazing.  He is the man.  He is the man. 

Q.  After this game here, you know, the lead has shrunk to three, what do you think about the second half?  What does your team have to do to go to the World Series?

SAMMY SOSA:  Pretty much continue the intensity that we were before.  We don't have intentions to stop, and we know what we have.  So getting ready for the second half, a chance for us to win the division and go to the World Series, that's what we are going to go for. 

Q.  Was it hard hitting out there with the sun and shadows and all of that kind of stuff?

SAMMY SOSA:    The first couple of innings, yes, you don't pick up the ball really good.  It's nice to come here and do the best you can and, you know, you have the possibility to do so. 

Q.  You mentioned you liked Seattle.  Did you get to try any seafood while you were here?  Did you enjoy any of it?

SAMMY SOSA:    I just ordered a lot of room service.  (Laughter.)

Q.  What was your feeling of the people on the National League bench when Cal hit that home run? 

SAMMY SOSA:   The people in the National League, the whole world and the whole stadium here today was something that, you know, you've got to be there to see how unbelievable it is, especially with Cal Ripken, one of the greatest players, and to see him alive, and he came out like that  -- but it's going to take time.  I wish him the best.
