Q.  Can you talk about your first hit as an All-Star and what a relief that might be? 

SAMMY SOSA:   That was a great feeling, I guess.  I've been an All-Star for six years, and really, that was the first time that I got a hit.  I would have asked for the ball but I forgot.

Q.  Looked like you were trying to make the most of it, trying to round third, were you being waved around or was it an instinct?

SAMMY SOSA:   Instinct on my part.  I saw he caught the ball and slipped a little bit and I thought I had a chance to make it to third base and I tried for it and they got me out.

Q.  National League has had some problems in these games of late, but you guys are off to a 4-0 start.  Are you happy about that? 

SAMMY SOSA:   Very happy.  We always heard that the American League always wins, but I think tonight it's going to be something that's going to be for the National League, the performance in the couple innings that we were up there, and it's a sign there that we have a chance to win this one.

Q.  What did you think about the pregame ceremony and all of the stuff that went on? 

SAMMY SOSA:   That was great.  That was a great moment the.  Cal Ripken was there, Hank Aaron, all of the All-Star players, it's a great motivation.  It's great enthusiasm for any young player that wants to be an All-Star, going to be superstars.  It's a great feeling to see all of the beautiful things that happen to people.

Q.  Aside from this being either in the Windy City, or in Wrigley and Comiskey, this is like a home game, and there was crowd support for you; so in a sense was it nice to have a nearby-hometown spirit for you rooting at the game here in Milwaukee?

SAMMY SOSA:   No question about it.  For a moment I thought I was playing for Milwaukee.  (Laughter.)

So many fans here supporting me, and the way that they clapped for me, they showed me the appreciation; that was something that I'm never going to forget.  You know, it's a great feeling.  It's a great motivation for me to continue, to make people happy, and doing my job.

Q.  You don't play now until Friday.  Is the club going to be ready to be refreshed and turn things around?

SAMMY SOSA:   No question.  They have got to be ready.  The second half, it's something that there's no tomorrow.  What we don't see in the first half we are going to see in the second half.  I think the second half, we are going to go out there strongly and we are going to have a couple of meetings before we start, and probably Thursday and Friday we are going to have a couple of meetings and be ready to go.  I think there's no question about that. 

Q.  What did you think of Hunter's catch?

SAMMY SOSA:   Unbelievable.  I really, for a moment, I thought he was Michael Jordan, my God.  You know, that kid impresses everybody like a Superman right there, comes out from nowhere and jumps like that and got the ball.  If he didn't catch that one, Barry would have another homer.  I was impressed.  I give the best to him, because, I mean, I see him making catches, but not up close, so now I know, he's the man.
