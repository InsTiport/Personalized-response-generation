Q. How is your wife?

SAMMY SOSA:   She's doing great.  Thank God everything went perfect.  She got surgery already and she's home. 

Q.  Which hand? 

SAMMY SOSA:   Right.

Q.  Can you tell us what happened, how did she hurt herself?

SAMMY SOSA:   She fell and she had a glass in her hand and it caught her right thumb, but deeply.  They got a couple of stitches, and then today they had surgery, so everything is perfect, thank God. 

Q.  Can you tell us about, you weren't there when everything happened Friday with Don (Baylor) and Bruce coming in.  Tell us your thoughts about Don and what happened. 

SAMMY SOSA:   Well, after he took the job the first day, he come out as manager of our team.  It was a little inconvenient but after that, everything went well.  He was a great manager for me.  He would do everything that he's supposed to do.  Kind of surprised me when I heard the news.  Really, was like it didn't happen; I don't know what was the reason why.  Also, the team that we had was a great team.  We was supposed to be 10 or 15 games out of first place before when we put our team together.  So probably that was one of the reasons why.  I feel bad for him.  For me, he was a great guy.  You know, things happen, and he called me, said goodbye to me before he left that day. 

Q.  Did you ever wonder about the way he approached the offense?  Obviously you guys were not scoring runs; you played for one run a lot.  Did you notice that? 

SAMMY SOSA:   Well, I don't know the detail, but every game that we played, really, sometimes we lost by one or two run, and it's not because of the manager.  It's not because of the pitching.  Good pitching is going to stop good hitters.  I think that was a decision that they had to make.  The decision was made.  Nothing else we can do about it.  Got to move on. 

Q.  What are your thoughts about the Home Run Derby tonight?  You won it a couple of years ago.  How much fun do you have with this contest?

SAMMY SOSA:   I have great fun, to come here and have the opportunity to be with all of the other great players, and especially participate in the Home Run Derby tonight, it's going to be a thrill.  I know I have a lot of people here from Chicago, which is only an hour and a half, two hours from Chicago.  I hope that I can go out and put on a great show for the fans and all of my friends and all of my family that are here today.

Q.  Do you think you might be a little rusty after three days away? 

SAMMY SOSA:   I don't know.  Let's find out.  (Laughs).

Q.  They said you called Bruce on Saturday; is that right?

SAMMY SOSA:   No.  He called me.  He called me and he really spoke, I didn't have time to spend time together with the new manager.  I think he knows the kind of player that I am.  I don't think he needs that much of a report about me.  Hopefully when we have a practice Thursday, I'm going to go to his office and sit down with him one-on-one and find out what they want me to do for the team. 

Q.  Do you like the idea of Jim Hendry becoming the general manager with Andy having a lot of duties with the players and negotiations for a new contract? 

SAMMY SOSA:   No question.  I'm very happy for Jim Hendry.  He's been working so hard for that moment to come true.  He's very happy.  He's a great person to deal with.  For him to become a GM is a great move for a lot of guys that was hoping he was the one that took the job.  He's very happy, and he will do a great job down the road.

Q.  With all of the talk about steroids in baseball lately, do you think people are going to look at the Home Run Derby contest a little differently this year? 

SAMMY SOSA:   I don't know.  I wish I had that answer.  I really know that I'm here tonight and I'm going to go out there and do the best that I can. 

Q.  Who is going to be the biggest challenge to you tonight?

SAMMY SOSA:   Myself. 

Q.  Do you want to win this title bad, Sammy? 

SAMMY SOSA:   If it's meant to be for me to win, I'm going to win.  Like I say, I haven't been swinging the bat for three days, three and a half days, but that's no big deal.  Hopefully with a little bit of luck, I'll put on a show anyway.  If I don't win, somebody will. 

Q.  Who do you have pitching for you? 

SAMMY SOSA:   Benny.  Benny Calajere (ph).  I don't want to make another mistake.  (Laughs).  I've got my own pitching.  I've got my own.

Q.  You always say you're not a general manager, but what do you expect from the team in the second half, and is it realistic to think that you can still compete?

SAMMY SOSA:   No question about it.  We've got a great team, a great ballclub, a great group of guys.  We need to put it together and pick it up a little bit more.  I think that was a good break, now that we are going to have, and make sure that all of the players recharge their batteries and come back for the second half.  We'll go out there and try to finish something that we start.  It's kind of sad, talking about in spring training when we put this thing together, we said that everything will be  -- by that time right now, we would be in first place.  Always in spring training, no matter how good of a team, we still have to go out and show that we have a great team.  Hopefully in the second half, everybody will go out there and pick it up and finish the way that we are supposed to be finishing.

Q.  With the possibility of a players' strike coming up, and many of the fans we have talked to in and around the ballpark have said that they won't come back again.  Obviously you and Mark had a big reason last time with your home run season, but what's your feelings on potential players' strike, and can baseball afford another work stoppage? 

SAMMY SOSA:   Well, that's a great question.  Everything that's going to happen is not in my hands.  I think that what happened in Chicago or what they have on the table right now is something that they are going out there right now and trying to discuss what needs to be done.  Hopefully they can come out with the right resource.  From my side, if it's going to happen, I've got to go with the union.  Whatever they decide to do, that's what we are going to do.  I don't regret what's going to happen.  Hopefully nothing happens.  Hopefully we can come out to the conclusion that everybody will be happy, both sides.
