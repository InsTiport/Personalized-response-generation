THE MODERATOR: Get Coach Graham to give us an opening comment.   
WAYNE GRAHAM: You saw it.  It was ugly.  We feel like we could come back.  We've come back before a lot.  Earlier in the year, we had games like that, and I think they know that we can come back.  We'll do everything we can to get ready to play.   
THE MODERATOR: Left fielder Dayne Wunderlich, 3 for 4 with two RBIs, a home run which tied the score, I believe, in the fifth inning.  Is that correct?  Yes, two-run Homer.  Maybe talk about that at bat.   
DAYNE WUNDERLICH: Well, I got down in the count pretty early.  My mindset was to keep the rally going.  Just try to put the ball in play and keep the rally going.  And try to get the walk or another base hit.  I got it to 2-2, I believe.  I saw a curveball up and got lucky with that.   
THE MODERATOR: Because we're late, we'll take questions for both player and coach.   
 Q.  Wayne, you guys had like seven errors on defense.  You're not going to win many games with that kind of defensive effort.  Was it the ball -- or just the guys kind of losing focus on some of those balls?  
WAYNE GRAHAM: I think it's just one of those games where everything that could go wrong defensively did go wrong.  Canterino threw a ball into the back of the runner, and we had a play where, I think, the ball got lost in the sun on a pick-off play, I think.  And some people that can play very good defense just didn't do it today.   
I told them to go home, look in the mirror, and figure it out and get ready to play tomorrow.  Fortunately, we get to play tomorrow.   
 Q.  Coach, pitching plans for tomorrow?  Do you have a starter?  
WAYNE GRAHAM: Yeah, Esquivel will pitch tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  Okay, guys.  I know it's been a long day.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.
