Q. I have a card here of when you were playing baseball. It says you batted .318 with
four home runs and 25 RBIs. It looks like you had some potential. Have you given any
thought of what your career would have been like if you stayed with baseball?

JOHN ELWAY: Yeah. I mean, there were always times, especially my first couple years
here in Denver because it was so bad. There were times I thought I made the wrong
decision. But, you know, I think the bottom line was I enjoyed playing baseball, and
baseball was a lot of fun. I think playing the position of quarterback, that's what I
wanted to do. The situation for me to play was going to be a lot quicker in football than
it was baseball. I'm still a great fan of baseball. I'm still glad I made the decision I
made.

Q. Too much golf yesterday, a little tired today?

JOHN ELWAY: WTP.

Q. Warning track power today?

JOHN ELWAY: I was not expecting to get one out. I was just happy in batting practice,
hit a couple good in batting practice. That made me feel pretty good. I got a little
anxious. Probably should have laid off some of those inside pitches I was hitting. It was
fun. It's been a long time since I hit a baseball.

Q. John, did you go to the cages or anything before today?

JOHN ELWAY: I didn't have time. I was playing in the golf tournament the last four
days. Running around, was out of town two weeks ago. I had plans on doing that, but just
never got over there.

Q. Were you nervous at all?

JOHN ELWAY: I think you get a little bit anxious. It was a lot of fun to be out there.
A lot more fun to hit one out.

Q. Will this be the single greatest disappointment of your athletic career?

JOHN ELWAY: I think it's fourth, after the other Super Bowls.
