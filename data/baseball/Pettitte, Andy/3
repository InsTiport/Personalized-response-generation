  Q. What happened on the pitch to Hamilton?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: It was just a bad pitch by me. I hung a cutter, left it on the inner half. I was trying to get it down and away, and, you know, he hit it out. And at the time you don't think that's going to win the ballgame. You know, have all the confidence in the world in my guys, and especially here at the stadium, just feel like, all right, you've got to shut them down and we are going to win this ballgame. Unfortunately we were just not able to get it done.   
 Cliff was great tonight, to say the least. Just he was -- he was just outstanding. You can't say enough about what he did tonight in this ballpark, to be able to do what he did is pretty impressive.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised by the offense, especially in the 8th inning when they kept scoring those runs? What went through your mind?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: Were you asking me if I was just surprised at our offense?   
  
  Q. Of the Texas offense.   
 ANDY PETTITTE: Was I surprised about them as far as --  
  
  Q. Like in the 8th inning they scored four runs. Were you taken aback by that?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: I think they scored -- yeah, that was -- you know, I was surprised that they blew it open. Is that what you were asking me? That's surprising, because again, you feel like if you can keep that game close that we have got a shot. If we can get a baserunner on; if we can keep it at 2-0. It's definitely surprising they were able to blow it open as wide as they did.   
 We feel as though we have a very strong bullpen. Robby made a couple decent pitches, some groundballs that got right through the infield that could easily have been double plays. That's what happens when you get down there.  
  
  Q. Do you keep expecting the offense to break loose, as effective as they were the regular season?  
 ANDY PETTITTE: Oh, I definitely did. I just think we are going to get a guy on and he'll make a mistake and we'll pop one out. To tell you the truth, it's just what you expect here. You just come to expect it. I hate to say that.   
 Unfortunately sometimes that doesn't happen. You know, but again, like I said, you've just got to give them credit. He came in here and he pitched a great game. I haven't seen many games thrown like that at Yankee Stadium. I know Josh Beckett beat me in the World Series, I believe, 2-0 when he shut us out at Yankee Stadium. I'm trying to think of performances like that; that was, again, like I said, you've got to give him a lot of credit. It's pretty impressive to see.  
  
  Q. The pitch to Hamilton in the first, did you want that more outside?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: Yeah, I was trying to go away with a cutter and I left it inner half. And I mean, he just dropped the head on it. He didn't even hit it that good, caught it out front. And if you catch a ball and hit it on the barrel at this stadium, it's a home run, unfortunately.   
 Literally, it hurts. You wish he would have fouled it off or something because I threw probably a couple, two or three other pitches the whole game where I didn't want to, and it ended up costing a ballgame. But when you have a guy over there throwing like Cliff is, that's what costs you ballgames right there.  
  
  Q. It seems like the fans might have been saluting you, maybe thinking this might be the last time they see you here, does anything like that ever cross your mind when you're coming out of this game?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: I would say, you know, when I'm out of the game, sitting in the clubhouse, you kind of think about that. But then there's a lot of baseball to be played, left. And I feel real good about our team and about the club that we have.   
 And we plan on coming out here and winning, you know, the ballgame tomorrow here, and hopefully we can do that.   
 Like I said earlier, we didn't think this was going to be an easy series. We knew these guys were good. They are tough. They can pitch. And when they can pitch, it makes for a hard series. They are an all-around good team. Hopefully we'll have a few more starts besides this one.   
  
  Q. After tonight, what is your feeling about possibly coming back on three days' rest?   
 ANDY PETTITTE: You know, like I've told y'all, I'll do whatever they tell me to do. I can do whatever they want me to do. I mean, whatever.   
 I got tired out there tonight, I mean, but I haven't thrown more than 88 pitches I don't think, 87 pitches, in probably a month and a half or so. I was running on fumes but I was able to give us a decent chance, it felt like. But outside of that, whatever this organization wants me to do, I'll do, and I'll do the best I can.
