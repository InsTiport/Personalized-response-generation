Q. Andy, with what happened to your dad earlier in the week, did that somehow make you
refocus, relax you?

ANDY PETTITTE: I really don't know. I know that like I said earlier, the first two
games at Yankee Stadium I really wasn't even thinking about the games. The guys were
getting excited and jumping up and down, and it was almost like I was putting a show on.
But I think that it did definitely help me, my father called me today, and he was able to
go home, so I think it definitely helped my mind to be clear even more, when I found out
that he was doing good, and was able to leave the hospital today.

Q. David Cone said this reminded him a lot of Game 5 in '96 with you and Smoltz?

ANDY PETTITTE: Very much so. It was a pitcher's duel in '96, and the only difference
was this time is it was for the championship, and that one was to send us back to New York
up one. But they were definitely right there together.

Q. What were you thinking about during the last inning when Rivera getting the last few
outs?

ANDY PETTITTE: I think that obviously I was just trying to pray for him, and just pray
that he would have the focus he needed to get through that inning, and just really
thinking about everything that's happened this year, from us having our second child, and
almost thinking I was going to lose him. And then what happened with my father, and he
wasn't able to be here. And just the up-and-down season I had. And even in the playoffs in
my last start. I tend to think about the bad things, instead of the good things a little
bit too much. So this was definitely very gratifying for me.
