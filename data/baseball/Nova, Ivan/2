  Q. Ivan, you said yesterday you wouldn't be nervous when you were actually out there, the crowd, noise, everything else. Were you nervous at all?   
 IVAN NOVA: No. No. The first thing I was so excited, my first postseason start. I could not believe it. I was really excited. After the first inning, I came back normal, I was more confident and I slowed down everything. So it was good.   
  
  Q. You said you were excited. The first inning you pitched eight pitches, be able to get through that quick inning, did that help you calm down a little bit?   
 IVAN NOVA: Yes. Yes. When you throw an inning like that, quick inning in a situation like today, you know, that lets you know that everything is the same. It's the same game. A little bit more the pressure, of course, but it looked the same for me.   
  
  Q. Ivan, Joe said he thought you didn't have your best stuff tonight. What did you think you had tonight?   
 IVAN NOVA: At the beginning, I mean, nothing was like -- only my fastball. I had command at the beginning. After everything went well. I think I got everything today for me. That's the way I feel. I only throw one change-up, but everything for me was working fine.   
 THE MODERATOR: Umpire Tony Randazzo was taken for X-rays as a precautionary measure.
