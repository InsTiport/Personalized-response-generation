 MATT McKENDRY: Questions for Scott Kazmir.   
  
  Q. You were surprised at the time, but given how well you've pitched with the Angels and the concern you've had to be in the postseason again, how would you say the trade worked out?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: Very good for me (laughing). I'm excited for being here at the very beginning of the trade. When it happened, I was very excited just knowing that I was going to be in the playoffs again and being with this team.   
 You know, I've watched these guys over the last couple of years and knowing that their whole team is designed on winning, and just winning. I'm just glad to be a part of it.   
  
  Q. You knew what the standings were when you got traded. Did you sort of anticipate you were going to face the Red Sox at some point in the postseason game?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: Sure, realistically, yes. They're always going to be in the playoffs. They're always going to be in contention, so you know you have to go through them to get where you want to go, and that is the World Series.  
  
  Q. You've had pretty good success against them in your career. Is there one common denominator to those games for you?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: There really isn't. I can't put my finger on one thing that really gave me success. I just went out there, pitched my game, stayed relaxed and, you know, just ended up having some good outcomes. I just have to attack the strike zone next time I'm out there. Just have good defense behind me. I know I'm going to have that, so I've just got to attack the strike zone and make them put the ball in play.  
  
  Q. Based on the stats, it would seem that you like pitching at Fenway. Do you like pitching there? Do you like the atmosphere?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: I do. I like the atmosphere. It feels like I love being on the big stage. I really just get amped up for games like that where you have a crowd just all over you and just kind of just being in a territory that you're really not comfortable in. I really like being in that stage.  
  
  Q. These two games that John and Jered pitched, I know they're right-handers and everything else. But can you take stuff out of watching these last two games that you can apply for your start?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: Sure, sure. I mean, I have my game plan on what I want to do, but at the same time I watch them, watch their approach to certain hitters and just see how they react.   
 No matter what, no matter if it's lefty or righty, attacking the strike zone, and throwing certain pitches in certain counts are effective lefty or righty.  
  
  Q. Is the fact that you guys held under one run, does that help you at all in terms of your confidence going into Game 3?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: Sure, sure. You just see how Weaver and Lackey pitched those guys. They really attacked the zone and just used every one of their pitches. You know, you kind of see who chases a little bit more. You just get a good idea for all the hitters, so it really helped me out.   
  
  Q. Along the same lines of what he was saying. With you pitching this big game at Fenway, does it feel like deja vu? Does it feel like this is why the Angels acquired you?   
 SCOTT KAZMIR: It really doesn't feel like deja vu. It feels like a new year. Being with the Angels, everything feels different. It feels like we're going Sunday to finish out a series. That's what we're trying to do.   
 MATT McKENDRY: Thank you, Scott.
