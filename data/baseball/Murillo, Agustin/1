  Q. How are you doing? You haven't had a lot of activity. You haven't seen a lot of activity.   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: I know, but I'm ready for when they need me.   
  
  Q. Is it just like you imagined it would be, with a Mexican team being at a World Classic? Is it better?   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: It's like I imagined. I had already met several players, so I've had the privilege of being at several events with them.  
 And it's a lot of fun, and I'm very happy to be here.   
  
  Q. What have you learned during these days?   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: I've learned a lot, honestly. I've worked a lot with Adrian, with Valentino, with Venicio, he has counseled me. And I am now waiting to put all of this in practice and have a good season with Arizona, and God willing, end up on top.   
  
  Q. So you are preparing for what's coming?   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: Yes. This type of event goes straight to your resume. It goes to your curriculum. And I think that after a good season, good things can happen to you.   
  
  Q. So what's immediately coming for you? Going back to the Diamondbacks?   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: Yes, I'm going back to spring training, I am going back to spring training with trip pep-A. And I'm hoping to finish strong, to finish well, to finish healthy and be ready for the season.   
  
  Q. So triple-A called you?   
 AGUSTIN MURILLO: Yes, they did. They talked to me before I came here. They said that I should come here without any worries, that the Triple-A third base was mine, and that I should only wait, you know, and go back and be ready with the right mind-set for the season.
