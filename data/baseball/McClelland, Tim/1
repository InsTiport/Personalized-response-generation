 THE MODERATOR: Tim, whatever you want to say.  
 TIM McCLELLAND: As far as the two calls that I had at third base. The first one with Swisher leaving too soon. In my heart I thought he left too soon.   
 On the play with Cano and Posada, I thought Cano was on the base. I was waiting for two players to be on the base, and when there was never the situation where both of them were on the base at the same time.  When he tagged Cano, I thought Cano was on the base, and when Jorge touched the base and continued and tagged Posada out, I thought Posada was out.   
 After looking at replays, I'm not sure I believe the replay of the first one. I said in my heart I thought he left too soon. But the replay showed that he didn't. We go in and watch replays regularly after every game, even during the regular season. That's part of our procedures.   
 Then the second one it showed that Cano was off the bag when he was tagged. I did not see that for whatever reason. So obviously there were two missed calls. Obviously, or not obviously, but there were two missed calls. And I'm just out there trying to do my job and do it the best I can. And unfortunately there was by instant replay, there were two missed calls.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Tim. Thank you for coming up.
