Q. Any doubt in your mind that you'll be able to play tomorrow night?
AARON HICKS: No.  I feel good.  When I woke up today, things are just going well.  When I was walking around, everything felt pretty much normal.
Q. Could you just go through what the last few days have been like for you.  What have you been doing to get this behind you?
AARON HICKS: We've been doing a lot of things.  We've been trying to get me hydrated.  So every single day I've been peeing like crazy, being hydrated.  I'm kind of testing it out, see how it feels.
I've been pretty much eager to get on the field and playing these games.  These are meaningful games, and I want to be out there with my team.
Q. What kind of a lift the last two postseasons have you guys gotten from the Yankees Stadium crowd?
AARON HICKS: I mean, huge lifts.  Our fans are amazing, especially in the postseason.  I hear guys all the time say how hard it is to play here.  For us to be on the other side kind of getting excited about our games and getting some energy towards playing, it just helps us play better.
Q. Give us your thoughts, if you wouldn't mind, on Nathan Eovaldi and what has allowed him to enjoy some success this year against you guys.
AARON HICKS: I think his cutter this year has probably been the main reason.  You know, when he was here, he didn't have that cutter.  He was more of a fastball/splitter guy.  That cutter that he throws from 88 to 94 miles an hour, it's a big jump, and that's kind of something new for us that we've never seen him do before.
