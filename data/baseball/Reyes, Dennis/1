  Q.  What's your feeling about giving up a record tying or record breaking homerun?   
 DENNIS REYES:  Well, if he's going to make a homerun ââ I don't know, maybe it's going to be ââ in the future I can tell my children that he won the record from me, but I don't want that to happen to me.   
  
  Q.  What do you hear in the clubhouse or talk about in the clubhouse about the possibility of who will be on the mound?   
 DENNIS REYES:  Well, it can be anybody.  He can hit the homeruns in one game, he can hit one each one, you know. It could be anybody.   
  
  Q.  Since the game doesn't have any pennant ramifications, do you plan to pitch to Mark?   
 DENNIS REYES:  I'm just going to pitch to him like I pitch to everyone.  It's going to be my best pitch.  I'm going to pitch like I normally pitch.   
  
  Q.  Are you worried about going too far inside and hitting and injuring him?   
 DENNIS REYES:  No.  Like I say, I don't want to treat him like something different.  He's going to be like another hitter.  I'm going to try to get him out; throw my best pitch to him.   
  
  Q.  Who do you pick for the homerun title, Sosa or McGwire?   
 DENNIS REYES:  Well, I think both are great hitters, and it could be either one.   
  
  Q.  Are you excited to be part of this?   
 DENNIS REYES:  Yeah.  I'm pretty excited because I want to be on the ball club when it happens, and I want to see what he's doing.
