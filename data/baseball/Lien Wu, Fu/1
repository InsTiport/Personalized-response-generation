Korea - 11, Chinese Taipei - 8 (10)   
 Q.  I would like to know why you are here.  
FU LIEN WU: Because Kuo Tai-yuan was ejected from the game in the sixth inning.  I'm here to answer your questions.   
 Q.  Another loss for Team Chinese Taipei and it went into the tenth inning.  So could you evaluate the performance of these two teams?  
FU LIEN WU: Team Taiwan and also Team Korea suffered two losses, so we really wanted to win this game.  And in the innings, in the first half, of course we tried very hard to catch up with Team Korea, and we also mobilized seven pitchers, almost all their pitchers in our bullpen pitched in this game.  In the ninth inning, I think we had a very good chance.  However, the closer of the Team Korea performed really well.  He is an outstanding pitcher.   
So we did our best, and it is a pity that we missed the opportunity.  Of course, Team Korea scored three runs in the last inning.   
 Q.  I don't know whether this is an interpretation or this is because of your answer.  Can you explain again why the manager is not here?  
FU LIEN WU: He actually does not feel well and he asked me to apologize to you, and I think he has the flu.  I also have a cold.  I think we are all exhausted.
