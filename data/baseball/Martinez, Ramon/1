Q. You did pretty much everything humanly possible to put your team in the position to
win. How frustrating is it then that you finished on the short side?

RAMON MARTINEZ: Well, we had our chances. We got a man in scoring position and we can't
come up with the base hit that we wanted. I mean I didn't want to come out in my situation
of the game but I had to come out, but it was a great game. It was an exciting game and I
could keep going.

Q. Were you surprised that you had enough strength to throw so many pitches?

RAMON MARTINEZ: No. I can go farther than that, than what I did tonight.

Q. Could you talk about what kind of pitches you threw? It didn't seem like you threw
too many breaking balls.

RAMON MARTINEZ: No, I was just trying to get location of my fastball then use my other
breaking pitch in a situation where I can -- I was just involved, but I was trying to get
location of my fastball.

Q. 120 pitches was the most you have thrown in a long, long time. How did you hold up
to that and how much longer do you think you could have gone?

RAMON MARTINEZ: I mean, I feel fine, when I come out of the game I was just normal. I
don't feel any kind of pain, tired or anything.

Q. Is this the first time that you faced the Yankees; what is your opinion of them?

RAMON MARTINEZ: This is one of the greatest teams. That is the reason why they are
here. I know that I am going to have a tough game. I did the best that I could.

Q. What did you throw to Knoblauch? What did he hit?

RAMON MARTINEZ: It was a change-up.
