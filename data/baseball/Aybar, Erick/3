  THE MODERATOR: Questions for Erick Aybar.   
  
  Q. Erick, can you just talk about coming from 0-2 to win this series, and going to extra innings to win this game and the way you guys won it?   
 ERICK AYBAR: That's what we're looking for. It's big because we're able to come back.   
 And the pressure, as you mentioned, that's what we're looking forward to do from here on, and to see the team do it that way really means a lot.   
  
  Q. How much better are the Angels than they showed in the first two games?   
 ERICK AYBAR: We're always together. We're a very confident team. We knew that as I asked him about the first two games. He said the pitching has been good, and we knew the way to stick together to make it positive for us, but never in doubt in terms of confidence and sticking together and playing a good game.   
  
  Q. Could you describe where you're playing from yourself?   
 ERICK AYBAR: I thought for sure that Howie had the ball, that he was going to catch the ball. That's why I retrieved back to the bag. And whatever happened, happened. But I thought he had it for sure, that's why I went back to the bag.  
  
  Q. Could you have caught it?   
 ERICK AYBAR: Yes, I could have, but since I saw him under the ball, I didn't want to create more confusion. That's why I returned and got out of there.  
  
  Q. That play resulted in three runs. How big was it to get the homer that you got from Mike Napoli, not just that one but the later one as well?  
 ERICK AYBAR: It's really big to have that happen for Mike Napoli. He's a very good player. The first home run and then the second home run was even bigger. But he's a guy that we count on and a very, very good player.
