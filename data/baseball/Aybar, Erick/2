 MATT McKENDRY: We have Maicer Izturis, Erick Aybar, and a translator, so please be patient, and we'll get started. Questions? 

 Q. Can they both just talk about the big hits in that inning and what pitches they hit? 
 MAICER IZTURIS: In the first at-bats I was trying to pull the ball too much in that situation with the big hit, I just tried to hit the ball back up the middle, and I hit it curveball. 
 ERICK AYBAR: The same thing. The first at-bat I was fortunate enough to see enough pitches in the big at-bat that I had. I saw a fastball right down the middle, and fortunately I was able to connect. 

 Q. Any thoughts about playing at Fenway as compared to playing here at home? 
 MAICER IZTURIS: It's a short series. We've played there before. We're going to -- we've played there before, and we know that we're going to continue playing aggressive just like we've been playing so far.
 ERICK AYBAR: Same thing. Two very good teams on Sunday. We're going with the same kind of fate and continue to play the same kind of baseball that we've been playing. 

 Q. Can Erick just talk about what the big difference has been in your hitting this year? Such a big improvement?
 ERICK AYBAR: I've been coming to the ballpark earlier. I've been getting a lot of advice from Bobby Abreu, Torii Hunter, and Mick Hatcher. 
 And I've been watching a lot of videos from the opposing pitchers, and that's been paying on off for me. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.
