Q. Does this experience invigorate you?

KEN GRIFFEY, JR.: It's an opportunity to trade stories, you know, trade stories, see
how everybody else, Larry, is doing. It's a chance to really talk to the guys that I don't
see during the season.

Q. You know everybody here predicted this would be a home run contest. There is good
hitting on both sides, but not a home run hitting contest?

KEN GRIFFEY, JR.: You have some great pitchers on the mound. When you have great
pitchers, the ball doesn't fly much.

Q. It doesn't?

KEN GRIFFEY, JR.: No, no matter where you play.

Q. I have to ask, because everybody else has. Are you tired already of the home run
talk?

KEN GRIFFEY, JR.: I don't worry about it. Just, you know, whatever happens happens. I'm
not in a position to say anything. I mean, we're still 24, 25 away to even catching it.
It's a long season.
