  Q. How tough an out is Youkilis right now?  
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: He's tough. He's tough.   
 You know, all night long it was tough.   
 And, you know, these guys are making good swings. So you have to think about every single player.  
  
  Q. What is it about him in particular? I know he's done okay against you in the past; what is it about you that makes him so tough?  
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: You know, he fights every at-bat. He can't strikeout so easily. You know, the home run he get you see how many foul balls he do it. So it's not really easy player.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: Yeah, I was inside. Is it daunting when that line-up is facing you, and, you know, guys are going to be in it, there's no let up.   
  
  Q. Is it difficult to think about having to face that line-up when there's no let-up? Every single guy in that line-up is a major leaguer; that's not the case for every team in this tournament.   
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: Well I am a big league pitcher so, you know, it's what I do every five days, face every big-league hitter. You know, it's a little tough, but it's what we do.  
  
  Q. What about the other guys who maybe aren't big league pitchers?  
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: It may be a little bit tougher for these guys because they don't have the experience.  
  
  Q. What did you think about the way you pitched against probably one of the better line-ups in the tournament tonight?  
 ARMANDO GALARRAGA: I pitch good, you know. I make a little mistake in the last inning, but I feel good. I feel good on my part. My breaking ball's getting better and better.
