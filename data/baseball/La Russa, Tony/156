Q.  What did you think of Lima?  What were the pitches that Morris threw to Green? 
 
TONY LaRUSSA:  Well, I mean, he pitched nine innings against our club and shut them out.  It's an outstanding pitching performance.  He did what he had to do, made all the pitches, didn't throw too many down the middle.  We had a lot of trouble getting to the top of the ball, made a lot of outs in the air.  But he did a very good job.  I think all three hits that Green got were all fast balls.  
 
Q.  It seemed that Morris' game turned on that splintered bat ball by Finley. 
 
TONY LaRUSSA:  I thought he pitched a strong game.  Two runs, it's a tough two to give up.  It hits the batsman, ball in front of the plate.  Then pitches to Izturis and Werth, almost out of the inning, you break a bat.  That's baseball.  You know, the first baseman hit a couple balls out of the park.  So I think overall, Matt gave us an excellent chance to win.  We just got out-pitched and out-played.  
 
Q.  On the bunt play, did you think it was a foul ball or it hit the runner? 
 
TONY LaRUSSA:  Well, from my vantage point, most of the guys in the dugout, we thought the ball had made contact with the bunter, so it's an out.  That's what I went out and said that I saw.  But they did, you know, what you want them to do:  they went and discussed it and they didn't see it.  You can't call it if you don't see it.  At least they made the effort to review it.  Sometimes they just tell you to get lost.  That drives you nuts.  But they reviewed it.  They just didn't see it so they didn't call it.
