Q.  What do you think of the Hampton's performance tonight?

TONY LA RUSSA:  I thought that he pitched an impressive game.  In fact, I thought he and Darryl both pitched impressive games.  We had some chances with men in scoring position.  He made quality pitches.  So I mean, our guy gets the loss, but I thought they were both impressive, tough to hit.  I just like the way we played.  I didn't like the score.  The 9th inning got away from us.  I saw a lot of good at-bats, defense on their toes.  I liked the starting pitcher.  It's just Hampton and the Mets were a little better.


Q.  If Dunston got on, was Big Mac going to hit?

TONY LA RUSSA:  Yeah, he was hot a couple of times, just couldn't get -- I didn't want to -- I mean, obviously, when he is the tying run, it would  have been a good time to use him.  Couldn't ever get it going.


Q.  When you had two on in the 7th, did you think about bringing him up?

TONY LA RUSSA:  Well, I mean, I am not going to hit him for Renteria or Edmonds.  I mean those are two of our best clutch hitters, and that is not how I think it is the best way to use Mac.  Plus we already had -- Polanco had to leave the game with that hamstring.  I didn't think it was a good move.


Q.  How is Polanco?

TONY LA RUSSA:  Ouchy.  You know, he felt like it was getting -- started to get tight on him and grabbing a little bit, so..... Little concerned about him.
