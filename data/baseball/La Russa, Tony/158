Q.  Talk to us about us about how this game is being managed differently? 

TONY LARUSSA:   I think most of it has to do with personalities and the philosophies of Dusty and Mike.  These guys are competitors and winners; they don't want to lose.  I think both of them are really thinking about the pride of the League.  I think all it adds an extra edge, but I think if you were playing this thing with no one watching, these two guys are going to manage hard.

Q.  Were you yourself in favor of the change? 

TONY LARUSSA:   Well, I'm not sure  -- I think home field is a significant advantage.  I'm not sure if winning the All-Star Game is the best way, but anything that adds to the competition, competitive feel is very good and it helps the managers because they are trying to promote it. 

Q.  When was the last time in an All-Star Game you saw a manager come out and argue a play like Mike did? 

TONY LARUSSA:   That's a good example, Mike, he wants to win this game.  I guarantee you it would have been vice-versa.  These two guys, they are great competitors and I think it adds a lot to the flavor of the game.
