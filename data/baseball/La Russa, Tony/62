 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tony La Russa.   
  
  Q. Just talk a little bit about the game and what you saw.   
 TONY LA RUSSA: Well, I just think that we got beat. I mean, they were sharper in just about every area. I thought we went about it the right way. I loved the play Albert made at the end, the rally there, the guys on base, couldn't get a big hit. Just had a big miss in the first for just a one run.   
 But they were sharper than we were in every area.   
  
  Q. In the fifth when Carpenter's spot came up in the order and you guys had a guy on second and two outs and you let Carpenter hit, can you explain what went into the decision to keep him in there rather than taking advantage of a run-scoring opportunity?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: Well, I thought we still had four innings of outs and Carpenter has a well-deserved reputation for fighting through days when he's not quite as good and never lets us down. I thought we had enough game to give up that out.  
  
  Q. Talk about Pujols and his performance tonight, how he was stopped?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: He got on base twice, didn't he. He really wasn't stopped. He chased a bad pitch the last inning. He could have walked the third time there.   
 Sign of respect. Joe and the Dodgers, I respect them. They should. But we've been through that now since the last two or three months, and with Matt around, it isn't successful very much, so it worked today.   
  
  Q. What was your opinion of Carpenter's outing? He did give up four earned runs which is a little unusual for him. Can you evaluate how you felt he did today?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: I don't really get into a lot of detail because I don't believe in scouting reports. But his command as times was not as sharp as it usually is, and they didn't miss it many times. They got some good swings when he didn't make a great pitch or a good pitch. They got the barrel on it.   
 So he wasn't quite as sharp as he usually is. He never quit competing. Didn't let them blow us out. I think it's a credit to their hitters, and you tip your cap to them.  
  
  Q. Seeing the Dodgers playing tonight, what kind of adjustments do you think you need to make, some of the key variables for tomorrow?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: That would be really foolish to talk about that, wouldn't it? Tell them what adjustments we're going to make. That would not be -- the game is hard enough without telling them what you're trying to do.   
 But you pay attention to what worked and what didn't work, and I'm sure they'll do the same thing. They have less adjustments to make than we do. But we'll look at everything.   
 We had a couple of opportunities. Their bullpen shut us down. Their bullpen really came and did a good job. But I thought we had a lot of good swings. We had a bunch of hits. So I like the life of the club, not the way we competed, we just got beat by somebody who played better.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
