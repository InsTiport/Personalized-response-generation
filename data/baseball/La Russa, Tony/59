 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tony La Russa. 

 Q. How difficult an inning is that?
 TONY LA RUSSA: Well, I think it's about as tough a loss as you can have, except we still have an opportunity to play Saturday. Thinking about the Tigers and Jim, and you lose a game like that and you're done. 
 But we have another opportunity. So it was a tough loss, very tough loss. Very disappointing. 

 Q. Can you talk about the job Wainwright did for you all and particularly in getting out of the eighth in that jam?
 TONY LA RUSSA: The quality of that was so good it's almost impossible to describe under the circumstances. We kept making enough contact we thought we could get some runs. We couldn't get anything to fall. He had very little to work with. And he just -- outstanding. He made quality pitch after quality pitch. The lineup saw him several times. He kept making adjustments. Outstanding.

 Q. With the series moving to St. Louis now, are you guys feeling confident that you can pull it out, win the two games at home?
 TONY LA RUSSA: Right now we're feeling disappointed, like I said. But we're not discouraged. There's a big difference in the two. We can win a game, so we have to wait until Saturday. 
 But right now I think it's important to get upset about the game that got away. We did a lot to win that one and didn't win it. Turn the page too quickly, means you don't care.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Tony.
