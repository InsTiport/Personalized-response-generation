  St. Louis Cardinals 1 
   
  Q. Would you give the Dodgers credit for the job that they did?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: Oh, yeah, this was, I think, closest that they came to getting beat, the first two, but today from the getgo they beat us to the punch all night, so give them credit.   
  
  Q. What did you see from Pineiro tonight, and was he up?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: More anything else, he had quite a few pitches he got up.   
 It's a tough way for him to pitch, a lot of balls that did damage that were up, and it was just one of those things. We didn't do anything with their guys. He pitched well.   
 Congratulate the Dodgers. It was a hell of a series, so congratulations to them.
