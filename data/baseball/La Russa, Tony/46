  Q. How huge was Jaime (Garcia) today?   
 TONY LA RUSSA: He was outstanding. I mean, outstanding. He made one mistake, and the guy hit it out of the park. Usually that doesn't happen. And he rose to the occasion. He'll be proud of himself forever for what he did tonight.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the decision to keep Jaime in there instead of a pinch-hitter?   
 TONY LA RUSSA: Well, it didn't work, so that's bad managing. I'm watching him pitch, and was really pleased, and I believe they had trouble centering the ball on him, and even the lead off double, I saw what they did to Polanco and Mayberry. He just -- I thought he was the guy to continue pitching. And I knew the match-ups were in our favor. Francisco has had not had a lot of success against him. But it didn't work.   
  
  Q. I think it was after the Mets loss a couple weeks ago, you said our mindset doesn't change. Does the fact that you guys have pretty much been playing without much margin for error going into tomorrow and possibly a Game 5 help you guys out here going forward?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: I mean, that's probably the easiest mindset that we have for tomorrow, because we have been literally facing this, even if it wasn't the last elimination, we knew if you lose this game or this series, and the club has responded. I can just speak for myself and the coaches and the people around our club. I can't speak for our peers, the media, our fans. But the heart and guts that this club has demonstrated rallying like they did is just off the charts, and there's no doubt in my mind that you will see it again tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about the decision to intentionally walk Ruiz?  
 TONY LA RUSSA: Well, if you follow our club with Ruiz over the years, he's gotten as many big hits as the guys in the middle of the lineup. He just terrorizes us, and he's already hit two balls hard. The match-up we liked, I liked. I made the decision. Francisco has had a tough time with Jaime, so it really wasn't a tough call.
