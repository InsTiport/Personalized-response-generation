Q.  Just your mindset as a manager given what your club has done all year, going into this situation tomorrow? 
 
TONY La RUSSA:  Well, we actually practiced this game over six months; we weren't cranking the first couple as well. But a lot of times when we are in a series, we would tell ourselves we're in the seventh game of the World Series.  A lot of times if you don't win a bunch of series, you don't get to October.  So we put the must-win situation on ourselves a bunch of times. 
 
Q.  How did you do? 
 
TONY La RUSSA:  Damn decent (smiling).  
 
Q.  How different a pitcher is Matt (Morris) from his 20-win season? 
 
TONY La RUSSA:  Well, potentially he's better because you had -- he had two dynamic pitches.  Now he's got four or five that he's developed, been a little erratic.  I think he'll get better and better as he keeps using them. But potentially, he gives hitters more looks.  Once they got to see him a little bit, they could subtract one, sit on the other one.  Even if you sat on it, sometimes you didn't hit it.  But now, he gives them more to worry about. 
 
Q.  If you're not able to win these next two games and close it out, how much would that take away from your 105 wins in the regular season? 
 
TONY La RUSSA:  That's a question that doesn't have to be answered now, and I hope doesn't have to be answered later either.
