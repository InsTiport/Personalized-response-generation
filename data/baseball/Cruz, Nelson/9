 THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. Nelson, the play in the eighth inning where you throw Cabrera out at the plate, can you sort of detail how that play went? The angle you went to the ball, how you were able to get the throw off?   
 NELSON CRUZ: That situation when I get behind to the ball, thanks God I make a really good throw one hop. Throw it to Napoli so this time he can stay with the ball.   
  
  Q. Mike, just your perspective of that play, kind of bracing yourself there for Miguel coming in from third.   
 MIKE NAPOLI: I know in that situation there's probably going to be a collision at the plate or it's going to be a close play. Crucial time of the game. Nellie gave me a good throw, gave me enough time to where I can brace and get low and just a great play.   
  
  Q. Nelson, you had big home runs. You had a good postseason last year. But I think you're topping yourself in this series. You're the first person to ever hit two extra-inning home runs in a postseason series. Can you talk about your 11th inning heroics in both games?   
 NELSON CRUZ: Like I said, thanks God because he gave me the chance to perform in that situation. It's not easy, like people ask me if it's that easy. I guess if you can swing good results are going to come.   
  
  Q. Mike, in this series you've had two extra-inning victories and the other win that you've had over Detroit was a one-run decision. I wonder if you can give me an overview of how you've seen the series against the Tigers to this point?   
 MIKE NAPOLI: It's been a great series. If you don't like baseball, you probably like it now watching these games. We expected a tough series, and we've been able to come out on top. And it's been fun.   
  
  Q. Mike, besides the collision, throwing out Austin Jackson, how important has it been to play defense and to play catcher and be that part of the team?   
 MIKE NAPOLI: I'm glad I can do it on the defensive side. Like I said before, I kind of got labeled as not too good behind the plate. And I'm glad I can show it and be myself behind the plate and just help us win. It's been great.   
  
  Q. Mike, as the play in the eighth unfolded where you get the double play at the plate, when the ball leaves, are you saying to yourself I know Nellie has a strong arm, he's going to give me a heck of a shot here?   
 MIKE NAPOLI: Yeah. He has one of the best arms in the game. He came up firing and gave me a good one hop. Like I said, he gave me enough time to be able to get low and make the play.   
  
  Q. Mike, you played with a pretty good player in the Angels in Vlady. How do you compare this guy?   
 MIKE NAPOLI: They're two great players. Nellie has done a great job for us. He had a tough situation when he was hurt and coming back and he didn't have any rehab assignment. He's been finding his swing and getting his timing down. He's been huge for us.   
 NELSON CRUZ: Together.   
 THE MODERATOR: Anything else?   
  
  Q. Nelson, people know you for your bat. How much pride do you take in your defensive ability?   
 NELSON CRUZ: I mean, Gary (Pettis) make sure we work every day. We throw to the bases every day. We take fly balls every day, make sure we know the ballpark, we know any situation we can be involved in during the game. When you prepare, everything comes more easy.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you both very much.
