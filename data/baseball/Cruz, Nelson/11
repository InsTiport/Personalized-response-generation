 Q. Nellie, 2-0 count when you were up there. Were you looking for a fastball at that point? 
     NELSON CRUZ: Yeah, one of the at-bats, I don't remember if it was Mike or Adrian, 2-0, he threw a change-up. It was a change-up. I was trying to be aggressive. First at-bat he threw me some pitches out of the strike zone. 
     So I tell myself just to be patient and wait for the right pitch to hit. 

 Q. Nelson, you've been through this before, and being back here the second year, it seems like you were just waiting on that moment that time, you hadn't been hitting the home runs like you had been wanting to. What was on your mind tonight? 
     NELSON CRUZ: Definitely important to get it going. As soon as I hit the homer, I thought it should be good enough, the way C.J. was throwing. And with the bullpen we have, we were lucky enough for it to be enough, two runs.  And Wash did a really good job mixing the pitchers bringing in everybody in the right time to face the hitters.

 Q. Nelson, despite two rain delays, still a ton of fans in the ballpark even after having to wait. What does that say about your guys' fan base? 
     NELSON CRUZ: They're the best fans. Two rain delays, it's almost 12:00. It shows how good they are and how special they are. We always enjoy the fans the way they support us all year. 

 Q. Nelson, in a situation like this, how hard is it to keep from pressing and keep approaching every at-bat the same and have results like you did today? 
     NELSON CRUZ: Definitely the last few games I feel like I swing the bat well. I was lucky enough -- but the situation, playoffs, you don't care about what you do. You want to do the results there by where you are. That's the way I take the approach. 
     THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Nelson.
