  RANGERS - 7

 Q. For both, after last night's, what could have been a very demoralizing -- well, I'm sure it was a demoralizing loss, did you guys discuss any of that among yourselves, or was there any kind of a mind-set before today's game about just trying to get that loss eradicated, and the way you guys came out today and were a totally different team after that eighth inning last night? 
 COLBY LEWIS: No, we didn't get together and talk or anything like that. I think we just knew what we needed to do. We had two games here at home and we needed -- after last night, we just needed to come out today and split it and go back to their place, plain and simple.
 I don't know if you want to use the world demoralizing. I think that's a pretty harsh word. But I think we just had one rough inning, and I think, you know, we scored a lot of runs last night and we scored a lot of runs today. That's what kind of team it shows that we are. 
 NELSON CRUZ: We have been doing that all year long, you know, after a tough loss like last night, we come out strong and we showed that tonight. 

 Q. How important was it for you to get the early lead there? 
 COLBY LEWIS: Well, I mean, Elvis got on, and basically took three bags. That was huge for us, I think, to come out, and for me to get some quick outs and get back on the board again and get right back to what we were doing last night. 
 So they did a great job. I mean, they put up seven runs for me and made it real comfortable and easy to go out there and continue to pound the strike zone. 

 Q. Could you just completely put last night out of your mind and not have any -- how do you avoid having a hangover from what happened yesterday? It was a tough, tough loss. 
 NELSON CRUZ: It was hard. We got the win -- we needed just six more outs to get the win.
 Like I say, you've just got to get over that. We believe in the bullpen. They have been doing it all year long, and I think that they are doing it in the post-season, also. 

 Q. After going back and forth between the Minors and Majors for a few years, what does it mean to you personally to have this type of success for the Rangers this year in the post-season? 
 NELSON CRUZ: It's great. I always thank the Rangers, they have always given me an opportunity. I like to play this kind of game. I think the experience you get in winter ball, maybe playing in top series in winter ball, Caribbean Series, it helps right now. 

 Q. Did you pitch your best as you hoped for? 
 COLBY LEWIS: I mean, I think I felt the best I probably felt in the last couple of weeks. Today, definitely, from the previous start, a lot more nerves were gone for sure. I felt like, you know, I was just going to go out there and do my job, and felt like a regular-season game.
 I felt like I commanded a lot of pitches, and was able to get some quick outs. And a little disappointed that I couldn't go deep in the game, but you know, it was definitely relaxing for those guys to go out there and put up the runs they did today. 

 Q. What did the double steal do that got you that run quickly in the first inning, after last night, to have a double steal and pull off that? What did that do as far as the momentum of the team? 
 COLBY LEWIS: I think I answered a little bit earlier, it was just to get right back on track of what we were doing last night. Get ahead early and kind of put the pressure on them. 

 Q. Are you saying that you were nervous in the playoff game last week? 
 COLBY LEWIS: No, I wasn't nervous. I definitely felt more relaxed. I think that's the key word -- yeah, today, for sure. 
 I think, you know, I mean, for my first playoff game against Tampa, I was kind of more in awe, the stuff that you see on TV, and you never really get to experience post-season with the rally towels and all that stuff. It felt like a regular-season game today where I needed to go out and do a job and get us back on track, and like I said, these guys did the job for us today. 

 Q. Were you just as focused the whole game, or was there any inning that you could enjoy pitching? 
 COLBY LEWIS: No, I mean, you have to stay focused the whole time. I mean, for sure. So I think the focus didn't change for any inning.
