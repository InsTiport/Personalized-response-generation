Q.  They say the triple is the most exciting play in baseball.  How are you so good at hitting triples? 

JOSE REYES:   The big thing for me is always hustling.  Every time I see the ball hit into the gap, I'm always thinking three and I'm hustling for the triple. 

Q.  Do you see this as another step up the Mets organization? 

JOSE REYES:   Definitely, this is nothing but good for me. 

Q.  You were in spring training this year, with the Major League team.  What did you learn from the guys that you met there, Alomar and Ordonez? 

JOSE REYES:   They taught me patience.  Patience is very important, especially at the plate, and just to be more patient and always play hard, and always have control during the game. 

Q.  Today you played out of position.  Would you consider that in order to speed things up, moving up in the organization? 

JOSE REYES:   I'm not really sure about that.  I felt okay at second base, but I'm a natural at shortstop and I feel a lot more comfortable at shortstop.

Q.  When did you start switch-hitting and what has your progress been as a left-handed batter? 

JOSE REYES:   I started switch-hitting one month before I signed my first professional contract.  Ever since then, I've just been working really hard at it in the cage, and I feel pretty comfortable from the left side. 

Q.  You said you see this as a step in the right direction.  Do you keep your eye on the Mets organization; do you set any kind of goals as far as when you'd like to move along, progress and hopefully join the club?

JOSE REYES:   I keep an eye but I don't really put much emphasis on the big league team.  I'm more about working hard day-to-day right now, and just finding ways to keep making myself better, and the rest will work itself out.  I can't worry about what's going to happen in the future.

Q.  Before today, what was the biggest stadium you've played in and the biggest crowd you've played in front of? 

JOSE REYES:   AA, Reading, Pennsylvania, 9,000 people. 

Q.  What do you feel like playing in front of this crowd? 

JOSE REYES:   I was very happy, very happy to play.  (Smiling).

Q.  Were you nervous at all? 

JOSE REYES:   No. 

Q.  Who are some of the players that you've watched and wanted to perhaps be like, and will you get a chance to meet some of those in this thing? 

JOSE REYES:   One guy is Alomar.  He's someone that has taught me and I like the way that he works hard.  I admire his work ethic.  That's one guy that I really try to emulate. 

Q.  Jose, you made the jump from Class  A to AA this year.  How is it different? 

JOSE REYES:   So far, I have not seen much difference.  I've been there 16 days. 

Q.  Can you just talk about the situation with the bases loaded, did you feel that it might be a game-breaking situation, your first real good scoring chance in the game? 

JOSE REYES:   In that situation, I knew the count was 3-2.  I knew I would be getting a fastball, it came into my zone inside.  That was the pitch I was looking for.  You know, I was happy to make good, solid contact and turn it into a triple. 

Q.  Three years ago in this game, Alfonzo Soriano was the MVP.  What do you know about him? 

JOSE REYES:   I don't know much, but I know that he's an excellent major league ballplayer right now, and playing here at the Futures Game really helped him. 

Q.  Talk about the thrill of having the game-winning hit, and just the overall experience of being in a big league park and the All-Star Futures Game. 

JOSE REYES:   I'm extremely happy, and I've never really felt this way before.
