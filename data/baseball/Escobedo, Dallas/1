    THE MODERATOR:   We are now joined by Arizona State head coach, Clint Myers, and student‑athletes Dallas Escobedo, Alix Johnson, and Haley Steele.   We'll start with an opening comment from Coach and go to the floor with questions.   
    COACH MYERS:   I think it was a pretty good softball game.   I thought Texas executed.   Unfortunately, we didn't execute as well as we should have.   We didn't have timely hitting.   I thought we swung it a little better.   I thought we made a change.   No excuses, we got beaten.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, you guys face a tough challenge from this point on.   What was your message to the team after the game to try to keep their spirits up?   
    COACH MYERS:   Spirits are up.   It's a situation where we've got to come out and play Arizona State softball.   Had we done that tonight, we probably would have won.   We just didn't make it happen.   Again, no excuses.   I mean, you get what you sow so to speak.   It has to be pitch better, hit better, field it better, throw better.   We did make some adjustments, and we faced a very good pitcher, but we made some adjustments and so we were moving in the right direction.   We just ran out of time.  
   
 Q.   Dallas, obviously the wind was blowing out a little bit.   Did you try to do anything differently knowing that it was blowing out?   I mean, you've obviously given up a few home runs.   
    DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   I mean, those hits that I did give up, I thought they were just pop‑ups, but knowing the wind was blowing out, I should have looked at it a little more.   But I still stuck with what I was going to throw with my plan.   I could have done better throwing between the wind.   When it slowed down I could have thrown.   But sometimes it blows over the fence, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   Did they make any adjustments off of you?   You gave up no hits through the first four innings and then both teams started to swing the bats pretty well.   
    DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   In the box I don't think they did, but seeing the pitches better, maybe they were trying to get more on top of my rise ball, but I kind of stayed with what I was throwing and was fine.   But there were a select few that did, but the majority didn't.  
   
 Q.   Alix, you were the only one to get on base in the first inning and then you got the big double.   Did you see anything better off of Luna than your teammates?  
    ALIX JOHNSON:   I personally was he seeing the ball very well tonight.   I was just trying to stay in my zone because that's how I get myself out sometimes.   Especially facing a good pitcher like Luna, I focus on getting the ball in the zone and good things happen when you see the ball that well.   
   
 Q.   After that ball went off Liz's glove for the home run, what did you guys talk about?   What did you say to her?  
    ALIX JOHNSON:   I said it's okay.   It's okay.   She was obviously a little upset because it hit right off her glove.   That type of stuff happens.   As they were saying earlier, the wind was blowing pretty hard.   It was a tough play to make, and I just said, shake it off.   You've got the next one.  
   
 Q.   Dallas, you always do a good job of bouncing back after a home run or when the other team scores.   In a situation like that when it's out of control with the error and the ball off your glove and the wind blowing out, how tough is that to bounce back in that situation?   
    DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   I mean, I thought it was going to catch it all the way.   I thought it was fine.   But to see it go all the way kind of shook me.   But kind of just getting back.   I mean, it's a home run, so shake it off.   The wind, you can't control some things, so being able to control the controllables is what I was trying to do.   They just got us tonight.   That's all I can say.  
   
 Q.   Coach, in the sixth, they had three out of four lefties coming up at the bottom of their lineup, and I know Popescue usually fairs well against lefties of the did you give any thought to bringing Makis back in to start the sixth?   
    COACH MYERS:   We did.   We did.  
   
 Q.   What was the conversation like between the two of and you Dallas, perhaps?   
    COACH MYERS:   No, Dallas wasn't involved in the conversation.   It was just Chuck and I, and we did talk about it.   Dallas had things in hand pretty well.   At the time, it seemed like a good idea.  
   
 Q.   Coach, how tough is it to come out of the loser's bracket?   You guys haven't been in there before.   
    COACH MYERS:   Yeah, we've been here before.   Remember, this is our seventh trip here.   So we've lost the first one a couple times and have fared okay.   I mean our goal is to play Texas again.   I mean, that's what we want to do.   We play we play the loser of the game going on right now.   We're watching that, and then we have to take care of business.  
    So, I mean, there is some softball yet to play.   Don't count the Devils out.   Again, this is a good ballclub that has the capability of playing very, very well.   When we play that type of softball, the Arizona State way, we're very tough to beat.   So don't count us out yet.
