 Q. You've been part of a couple big trades in the last few years. I know it's always disappointing to be traded, but do you also look at it as a positive that you're a valuable commodity?
 CHRIS SNELLING: Any time you get traded it means basically that somebody else wants you. That can't be a bad thing. You've got to look at it like that.

 Q. Now, you were with the Phillies this past year. What did it teach you being even a small part of a World Series team?
 CHRIS SNELLING: I don't know what else to say other than that was probably the best team I've ever played on, on the field and as far as talent and quality people in the clubhouse, definitely the best team I've ever played on.

 Q. Now, as a guy who's had a decent amount of time in the Major Leagues, what do you kind of tell the other guys here?
 CHRIS SNELLING: See ball, hit ball. Keep it simple, don't think too much or things start to go haywire.

 Q. You were batting third in the lineup. You're a guy that doesn't strike out very often. Are you looking to wear out the pitchers a little more by taking pitches, or as soon as you get a good one, just whack it?
 CHRIS SNELLING: See ball, hit ball. That's my philosophy. If it's there, I'll swing at it, or if I think it's there, I'll swing at it. That's about it.

 Q. What are you personally hoping to get out of the World Baseball Classic?
 CHRIS SNELLING: Nothing. I want to win. That's it.
