   JIM BEATTIE:  Good evening.  I think Bob Gebhard already went over the details of our trade with Mike Lansing.  We received Jacob Westbrook, Rockies rightâhanded pitcher John Nicholson, the Rockies No. 2 '96 pick, and outfielder Mark Hamlin.  In addition to that we traded Pedro Martinez for rightâhanded pitcher Carl Pavano of the Boston Red Sox and a player to be named later.   
  
  Q.  Would you give your thoughts behind the Martinez trade?   
 JIM BEATTIE:  Well, obviously both of my trades were dictated by the economics of the time. We're a team that's trying to look forward to a possible new stadium in the year 2001.  Both of these players are premiere players in the National League, obviously Pedro winning the Cy Young Award.  It's a difficult trade when you trade great players, and I think both of them are.  We are looking further down the road.  We do not intend to win next year, but to build a club that will be competitive a few years from now, a championship club by the time we move into our  new stadium in 2001.  We think Carl Pavano will probably fit into our starting rotation next year. He's a guy with what we consider a very high ceiling. That was my key to a trade with Pedro is not to go out and get four or five more players, but guys that will be impact players at the Major League level and that's what we thought we got with Carl Pavano.
