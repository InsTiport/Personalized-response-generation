 Q. Bartolo struggled with three days' rest, or at least it appeared that way. Are you
concerned with yourself going into the same situation?
 
 CHARLES NAGY: No, not really. I'm a different type of pitcher than Bartolo. He's a
power pitcher so when he gets more rest, he's stronger out there. Myself, I'm a sinker
ball guy. That's what they say anyway, the less rest you have, the better your sinker's
going to be. We'll see tomorrow. 
 
Q. The Red Sox in full gear, will your approach to pitching Game 5 be any different?
 
 CHARLES NAGY: Not really. I mean I can only go out and make my pitches. You know, I
can't change the way I pitch or how I'm going to pitch them. I'm just going to go out and
be aggressive and throw strikes and make them hit my pitches. If I do that, we'll be all
right. If not, I get the ball over the plate, they're swinging the bats -- well right now
and who knows what's going to happen. 
 
Q. Are these the kinds of games that as a baseball player you relish?
 
 CHARLES NAGY: I mean, in this situation, you know, it's do or die. I mean we win
tomorrow, we go on. We lose, we go home. So, you know, it's great to be, I mean it's not
really great to be in this position, but there's nothing else I can do about it. I've
pretty much prepared for the game tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be
a lot of fun.
