Q.  Would you talk about this experience for you after not going through it last year? 

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  I feel good about it.  I had playoff experience in the minor leagues.  I feel pretty good going into it.  

Q.  Bob Brenly talked about how pitching and defense will make a difference in this series.  Do you agree?

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  It's definitely true.  In the post-season, pitching and defense is what it's all about.   We're going to have to minimize our mistakes out there, make the plays.

Q.  How do you compensate for the loss of Gonzo and Craig Counsell?

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  Everyone is going to have to step up and do their job.  We have a deep bench.  Anyone can go out there and fill in.  Well, you can't fill Gonzo's shoes.  It's going to take a team effort.  Everyone is going to have to step up and do what he can, hitting and running, doing the little things to basically get over the hump.  It's going to take all nine of us out of there to do the job - all 25 to be exact. 

Q.  On that subject, can you talk a little bit about Quinton McCracken, what he brings to the team?

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  He brings so much.  He's part of our success this year.  He stepped in, just done an unbelievable job this year.  He's definitely a talented ball player.  He's a veteran player.  He brings so much energy, sparkplug.  He can hit in any situation.  It's definitely a plus.  He brings a defensive glove.  He's a good ball player. 

Q.  How many times have you faced Matt Morris?  What kind of a challenge does he bring for you?

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  I faced him once this year.  He's a power pitcher.  He reminds me of Schilling.  He's going to come right at you.  He has good stuff.  It's going to be a challenge.  It's going to be a fight.  So I'm just expecting to bring a hard fast ball.  Going to have to be ready to hit. 

Q.  How do you compensate your excitement, even though you've been in Minor League playoffs, this is the Major Leagues, with playing your game?

JUNIOR SPIVEY:  Stick to my same routine.  I'm not going to try to change anything.  I mean, I'll do whatever got me here, up to this point.  I'm just not trying to get caught up in the hype.  You know, it's a ballgame.  You approach it the same.  Basically you just have to bring up your level of concentration and focus.  That's the key components for me as a ball player.  That's the way I'm going to approach it.
