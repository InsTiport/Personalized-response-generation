   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chad Billingsley, Game 5 pitcher for the Dodgers.   
  
  Q. Being down 3-1, does that change your approach at all for Game 5?  
 CHAD BILLINGSLEY: It's pretty much do or die. We've just got to come ready to play. Tonight was a tough loss.   
 I mean, tomorrow we've got a day off. And just come ready to play on Wednesday.   
  
  Q. What do you do tomorrow to just kind of regroup?  
 CHAD BILLINGSLEY: Tomorrow is going to relax and just kind of get away from it and just clear my mind a little bit, and when I wake up in the morning on Wednesday, start preparing.  
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Chad.
