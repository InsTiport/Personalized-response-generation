Q. In your opinion success against the Braves or the Padres when you pitch the National
League.

DAVID WELLS: Hopefully San Diego. That is where I am from. That is where I grew up, and
it would be exciting for me and a challenge for me as well. So I am pulling for the
Padres.

Q. The Yankees were up 6-nothing before the Indians came back 6-5; then you guys went
ahead 9 to 5. Even though your team won in advance, is there a sense of vulnerability in
the Yankees?

DAVID WELLS: I don't know. It is something that anything can happen in any given time
and when they came back within one run, this is something that, you know, they just were
in a situation where you go out there and you try to make a good pitch and something
happens like that. But no, nobody is -- I guess anybody is vulnerable for whatever it is
worth. But to me I just think that we were just fighters and regardless of that one inning
we were still up 1 run and it is something that we came back and we scored a few more and
just got put in a situation where guys made things happen.

Q. Boomer, say in San Diego, right, you pitch Game 1, are you looking forward to Game 5
pitching in your hometown?

DAVID WELLS: Hopefully we can wrap it up in four. That would be the best thing to do.
But, no, just getting the first one would be great. Whatever happens after that happens,
and I will be ready for the challenge.

Q. Are you going to have enough tickets if you pitch in San Diego?

DAVID WELLS: I will beat a couple of guys up, take the tickets from them. But hopefully
I will get as many as I can and just hope for the best.
