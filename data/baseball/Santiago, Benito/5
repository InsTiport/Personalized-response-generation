BENITO SANTIAGO:   That was a huge mistake for me, and the only thing I'm going to say, don't step out there, don't try to do that in your game.  You know, you try to get in under the ball and make the best catch you can make.  That was so hard for me, missing that ball, and the second one they hit, let me tell you something, if this ball was in the stands, I was going to jump that fence and try to catch this ball. 

Q.  How did you feel after the walk, to catch the ball to Barry, that you came through with the big hit? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:   Let me tell you something, they have been doing that all season long.  I feel great.  All the time, I hit behind this man, so I know I'm going to have a lot of pressure on me.  But at the same time, I've got a chance to do some damage out there, and that's what I'm trying to do, just concentrate and get a good pitch to hit and make good, solid contact.  But the bottom line is this, you know, I don't want to see this guy be walking.  This is one of the best hitters we've got.  I want the guy just to put the ball in play so he can put better numbers up there. 

Q.  Facing Sheffield in the ninth inning, did you think at all back to the pop-up? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:   Let me tell you something, I think about everything right after I miss that ball.  (Laughter.) And everything comes up in my mind.  If this game is tied, it's not going to be a good feeling for Benito Santiago to go in the clubhouse and everybody look him and say, "hey, he dropped the ball."  That was a bad play.  I make it better tomorrow. 

Q.  After the game is over and you have the victory, did anybody give you a hard time about that ball? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:   Let me tell you something, it was only one, and guess who, my backup catcher.  (Laughter.) The guy came to me and told me, "I always get good advice from you, but this time, I'm not going to talk to you." 

Q.  Coming back, making your comeback from the auto accident, how did it feel for you to be back in the post-season again? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:   Well, it's exciting, especially sitting right here and talking to you guys.  That was quite an experience, but I keep on calling the guys at the hospital in Florida and just keep talking to the doctors.  At one point they told me my career was over and I was shaking my head saying, "No, it's not over yet"; I'm going to try the best I can and try to do the right things I can to come back and be where I am right now.  But I give this one to all of those doctors over there, my family that were very close to me.  Things are working out great. 

Q.  Has this happened to you before, a missed pop-up like that? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:   I have a long story on this.  This is my second one.  The first one, I remember, I kept in my brain.  I was playing against New York, and he hit a home run.  So I missed that one and  -- my God, it's not going to happen again.  So I'm two for two at it. 

Q.  Was that the New York Mets or Yankees? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:  New York Mets. 

Q.  Why were you guys able to Glavine? 

BENITO SANTIAGO:  He's one of the top pitchers out there and I respect everything he is doing out there today.  The Giants are swinging the bat very well right now and we are playing good baseball.  Regardless about who is going to be up there pitching, we've got our game plan and the game plan is to beat those pitchers.  So, we have got to keep playing the way that we are playing today and the way we've been playing in the last two months, and continue to win some games.
