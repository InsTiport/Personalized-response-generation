Q.  Why Mike Jackson and not Dotel? 

LARRY DIERKER:  If I said I put in Dotel, you'd say, "Why not Mike Jackson?" Check the record. 

Q.  What about Miller?  Three days' rest.  You have to be happy with his performance. 

LARRY DIERKER:  He pitched a great game.  He should have been the winning pitcher. 

Q.  How hard is it going to be for the team to regroup now? 

LARRY DIERKER:  Nobody knows. 

Q.  What do you tell the guys after something like this? 

LARRY DIERKER:  I don't tell them anything.  They don't want to hear it. 

Q.  After your success in the post-season, at this point are you concerned a loss like this will be pretty tough for them to take? 

LARRY DIERKER:  Yeah, it is. 

Q.  Do you think it could have a negative effect on the rest of the series? 

LARRY DIERKER:  Not really. 

Q.  Can you tell us where Roy Oswalt is, what his status is?

LARRY DIERKER:  He's fine.  He should pitch on Saturday. 

Q.  Does it surprise you the type of success this franchise has had in the last five years that they haven't been able to sustain that into the playoffs? 

LARRY DIERKER:  It's, you know, that's baseball.  It's only a matter of 10 or 15 games.  It's pretty hard to take 10 or 15 games and decide who's the best team in the league.  This year, Minnesota and Seattle would have been the greatest teams in the world after 10 or 15 games.  You can't just go out there and win a game on command. 

Q.  I assume it was the same thing with Wagner, the numbers, Chipper Jones was 0-8. 

LARRY DIERKER:  Wagner against Chipper Jones, we had that come up a couple times lately where somebody has been absolutely helpless against a certain pitcher, we put the pitcher in and the guy gets a hit.  That's the kind of thing that happens. 

Q.  With the pressure situation you're under right now, did you ever consider putting in Vizcaino over Lugo in short because of his experience in the playoffs? 

LARRY DIERKER:  I considered it.  But Lugo's been a better player this year.  Vizcaino's played well for us, but Lugo's played better.
