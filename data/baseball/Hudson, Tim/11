Q.  Tim Hudson is here.  We are going to get started.  I hope we will have more than two questions for Tim.  Anybody?  The microphone doesn't work -- Tim, what have you taken from game 1 and 2 that you can learn from tomorrow?
 
TIM HUDSON:   Obviously, I need to make a little better a justments.  I think I was really over hrowing my last outing and that was a big reason why most of my pitches were up all day.  And I think if I can just make that adjustment, instead of missing up, I can miss down, and I can get some ground balls instead of those deep fly balls that I was getting the last time out. 
 
Q.  Does the three days' rest be negated by the fact you only threw 37 pitches the other day?
 
TIM HUDSON:   I don't think it's going to be that much of a factor.  Obviously, coming out of the game as early as I did will help out a little bit, but I think being a sinker ball pitcher, I don't think it's going to bother me much, at all.  If anything, you know, as a sinker ball pitcher, the more strong you are, the worse off you are a lot of times.  So I think coming back a day early, you know, hopefully it may help me out a little bit with some of my sinkers and keeping the ball down in the zone. 
 
Q.  Tim, do you feel any different now that it's the day before your next start?  Physically do you feel the same as you usually do?  Did you do anything different presentation-wise?
 
TIM HUDSON:   physically I feel fine, the same as I have.  I have cut back some throwing this week, I threw a bullpen yesterday and I felt great yesterday in my bullpen, so that feels fine.  It's just mentally just going out there and  -- a day early and knowing that you have to get the ball one more day early, so that's all it is. 
 
Q.  Mark was saying that, you know, day four for him is a day he is usually doing nothing anyway.  Is that pretty much how it is for you?
 
TIM HUDSON:   Yeah.  You know, four days in between starts, there is a lot of down time usually.  So normally I usually throw two bullpens in between starts, so what I did this time around is cut it down to one, threw a bullpen yesterday, you know, I would be off today just playing some catch and doing some treatment and stuff, and I will be ready to go tomorrow.  
 
Q.  Tim, have you ever thrown off of three days' rest, and if you have, how did you fair in that performance?
 
TIM HUDSON:   The only time I came back a day early was last year in the playoffs I came out of the bullpen in relief in game 5 in New  York, and felt like I had as good or better stuff coming out of the pen in New  York as I did when I started, so that's really encouraging coming into tomorrow.
