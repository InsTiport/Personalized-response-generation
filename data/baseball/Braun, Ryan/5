 Q. You and Prince can be game changers quite a lot, but is that as quick as you guys could do it, one pitch each and the whole game changes?
     RYAN BRAUN: Yeah, I think so. We have an offense that's not necessarily dependent on the home run, but at times in the year we've relied on it, and I think whenever offensively you have multiple guys that can hit home runs it can happen quickly. 
     Garcia was throwing the ball great. Corey had a great at-bat. Hairston had a great at-bat. And so it definitely happened quickly.

 Q. You said yesterday not to overanalyze the home field advantage. Is it the same comment that Greinke winning every game he pitches at home?
     RYAN BRAUN: I think that's overstated with him. I think the second half of the season he pitched great on the road. I think early on he probably wasn't back to a hundred percent and seemed like he was making probably three or four of his first 5 or 6 starts, came on the road before he was back to being a hundred percent healthy. 
     Obviously we're aware of how well he's pitched at home. But I think the second half he really threw well at home, as well.

 Q. The flip side of that is even when he doesn't pitch well at home, you guys seem to win games. What's happening there that you guys can overcome his poor starts?
     RYAN BRAUN: I don't know. That's one of the things you don't question, you just accept and hope it continues. We're obviously confident whenever he's on the hill. We're confident whenever Yo is on the hill or any other starters, we feel like we're going to find a way to win. And again, that's one of the things you hope continues.

 Q. How fast did Prince's get out? You thought you hit yours hard, what did you think of his?
 RYAN BRAUN: That was one of the hardest hit balls I've ever seen. I'm always worried when I'm on first base and Prince is up that he's going to top spin one at me.
