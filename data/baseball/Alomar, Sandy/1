 Q. Bartolo, after John hit a breaking ball -- were you having trouble with your
breaking ball?
 
 BARTOLO COLON: He made pitching against Valentin. Valentin pulled the ball, he felt
like this is a tough ballpark to throw a lot of breaking balls to right-handed hitters. If
they pull it, it's going to be a home run. 
 
Q. Did you feel like you just couldn't get into a rhythm, pitching only on three days'
rest?
 
 BARTOLO COLON: He say that he felt good, but he try to throw like he throw in
Cleveland, but he didn't feel the same. 
 
Q. Sandy, how does the team handle the loss tonight? Do you laugh at it because it was
so out of hand, or does it really affect you and embarrass you at that point?
 
 SANDY ALOMAR: Well, it was embarrassing. It was humiliating, but the good part about it
is none of those runs mean anything tomorrow. Tomorrow is 0-0. We're not playing in this
ballpark. They are a good hitting team in this ballpark. It seems like they try to hit the
ball to left field. They are very good hitters here. Not taking anything from them, they
hit the ball well anywhere else, but they really know how to play the game. Like I say, it
wasn't over when it was 2-0, so this is a great ball team. They really play us good during
the regular season, and we'll see tomorrow. 
 
Q. If you could have made the decision yourself, would you have preferred to just pitch
with four days' rest and not pitch with three days' rest?
 
 BARTOLO COLON: He say that if it was up to him, he would have pitched on four days'
rest, like, you know, at the Big League level, if you don't make a good pitch, the guy's
gonna hit it hard like Valentin did with the breaking ball. So that's the way he feels.
