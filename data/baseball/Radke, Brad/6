Q.  Your Honor, how big will this game be?  Will this be as big a game as you have ever pitched in your life?

BRAD RADKE: I think so.  It will be definitely bigger than 
game 1, but I am going to go out there and pitch like I did during game 1.

Q.  How did you feel like in your game 1 out there?

BRAD RADKE: It felt good.  I thought it was a pretty good outing for me, just went out there and threw strikes, kept the ball down and kept them off balance, for the most part.

Q.  One more question.  Is that a tough ballpark to pitch in?

BRAD RADKE: During the day it's pretty tough, being the high sky and the bright sun, and all that, but I just got to go out there and pitch my game and go with my strengths.

Q.  With all the contraction off-season that the team has gone through, do you feel almost that not just the team on your shoulders but maybe you have got the weight of the state on your shoulders as you pitch game number 5?

BRAD RADKE: It's going to be, you know, live or die.  It's going to be a deciding game, of course, but I can't let that get in my head, I just have to go out there and take the same approach as I did in game 1.

Q.  With everything that's riding on the line game 5, what challenge is it going to be to keep your adrenaline kind of in check, maintain a good level of composure out there, not getting too wrapped up, it's game 5, it's game 5?

BRAD RADKE: Just go out there mentally thinking, you know, it's just a regular  -- just like a regular season start.  That's what I did during game 1, and I like that approach, I think it worked, and, you know, I know we are going to play a better game than we did during game 1 tomorrow, that's for sure.

Q.  Brad, this has been a tough season for you with all these injuries and all this stuff, now you got a chance to  -- this is a big one.  If Anaheim beats the Yankees tonight, you guys come back here and play.  Do you feel a lot of pressure?

BRAD RADKE: Do I feel a lot of pressure? 

Q.  Yeah.

BRAD RADKE: Yeah, but no.  You know, I know it's  -- it's the deciding game, but I don't want to look at it that way, I just want to look at it just like a regular start.  I know there is more  -- there is more to it than just a regular season, but that's the way I just have to look at it.

Q.  This was the first time for most of the team, really getting a taste of the Metrodome crowd in a playoff frenzy.  What was it like sitting there during that fourth inning today, the crowd going nuts?

BRAD RADKE: It was nice.  Yesterday's game was very exciting, too.  We know we really didn't give the fans to cheer a lot about yesterday, but today was awesome.  The fans out there were great.  I am just glad that we played a better game today than we did yesterday.

Q.  Did you expect that level of noise, or was it what you expected?

BRAD RADKE: Not really.  I mean, it's kind of tough being in the dugout, you don't get the full effect sitting in the dugout than you do on the field, but it was pretty darn loud, and it definitely makes everybody pumped up out there.

Q.  Did you learn anything that will help you pitch against them a second time in five days?

BRAD RADKE: Not really.  I mean, I am just going to do what I have been doing, just go with my strengths and just see what happens.  For the most part, I just have to keep the ball down.  When I get the ball up, that's what I start getting in trouble.
