THE MODERATOR:   A couple of questions for Mike. 

Q.   Mike, just wonder if you can talk about lining up before the game, standing next to Derek as everybody came out.   Did anybody say anything special, touching, how was that moment for you? 
MIKE TROUT:   No, nothing too crazy, but just being a part of it, last year with Mariano, just very blessed to be a part of it.   And, you know, for him going out that way, it is pretty special. 

Q.   Mike, a lot has been put upon you in terms of the broader picture and beyond holding a steady job in the Big Leagues at 22.   But the whole passing the torch and things like that with Derek.   Does it ever feel like a burden to you? 
MIKE TROUT:   No, it's‑‑growing up, watching him on TV, the way he plays, growing up I was setting goals to myself that when I get, if I ever get the chance to get to the Big Leagues, that's how I want to play.   And the way he carries himself on and off the field, how he respects the game.   Always hustling, it doesn't matter what the score is.   If they are down 10 runs, he is always running the ball out.   That's how I want to play. 

Q.   Mike, was Derek joking with you a little bit when you came out of the game?   Something about saying you are 22, that's all you got, something like that? 
MIKE TROUT:   He said he wanted me to play nine innings (laughter).   He said I am 22 years old coming out of the game, it is the sixth inning, I should be playing nine.   He is messing around with me.   It's all fun.   It's special for me.   Chills, goosebumps, you name it.   Everything was running through my body. 

Q.   Did Derek address the team or you guys before the game?   What did he say? 
MIKE TROUT:   Yeah, he just wanted to thank us.   You know, we should be thanking him.   What he brings to the game and, you know, just tells us it goes by quick and for us to enjoy every moment of this, with being together with the best in the league.   And just enjoying every minute of it. 

Q.   Mike, what was it like choosing between the Stingray and the truck and how did you decide on that? 
MIKE TROUT:   When they came out and told me I got a choice, I was pretty pumped.   I got my dad a truck a couple of weeks ago, so I probably would have chose the truck if I hadn't done that.   But I have to go with the sports car and with the 'Vette.   It's pretty funny, it's a 'Vette, because our bench coach, Dino Ebel, he loves 'Vettes and we keep talking day in and day out of getting a Corvette, me getting a Corvette, and now that I have one I am going to rub it in his face, for sure. 
THE MODERATOR:   Okay, thank you very much.
