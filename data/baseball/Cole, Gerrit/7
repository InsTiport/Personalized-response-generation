Tampa Bay - 4, Houston - 1
Q. Gerrit, knowing you'll take the ball in game 5 at Minute Maid, where you just had a fantastic start, what are your thoughts entering the situation and knowing the obvious, it's the ALCS or the season's over?
GERRIT COLE: I mean, my thoughts are kind of just, I guess, the same as they always are. We got a flight tonight. Just need to prepare and recover as best I can and just give my team best chance to win. And we'll go from there.
Q. You guys have talked all season about how much you respect the Rays. What have you seen this series, two home games, two games here, seems like both teams are evenly matched and can both do damage in a lot of different ways?
GERRIT COLE: Yeah, I've seen a lot of good at-bats, I've seen a lot of fight. A lot of credit to them for their preparation and putting themselves in this position. Certainly think they've earned it. And played really good defense. They've played calm, cool, and collected.
And like you alluded to, we know they're a good team. We've known for a long time. To win that many games in the American League East, without Blake Snell for most of the year, without Tyler Glasnow for most of the year, maybe a couple other guys, is really impressive and now they're here at full strength.
So it's been a good battle so far, and it will continue on Friday.
