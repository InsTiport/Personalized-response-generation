Chicago Cubs - 2 - New York Mets - 5
Q. Can you explain sort of what your thinking was on the stolen base?
YOENIS CESPEDES: My thinking was just I was confident I would make it, and with just one out I just felt like I knew I could put us ahead.
Q. How have you felt about your postseason so far as a whole, and do you consider tonight the way you played tonight a big game for you?
YOENIS CESPEDES: I think overall the team is doing really well.  I think every player goes through some rough patches and obviously I've had some rough patches in the previous games, but I'm trying to make up for that now.
Q. Can you take us through the play where you scored from third on the wild pitch?
YOENIS CESPEDES: I was preparing myself for the ball to hit the dirt.  It happened one other time before, but I wasn't able to go ahead yet.  So I just in my mind I was trying to be prepared for anything that could happen.
Q. When you get out of a rhythm as a batter, as happened in the previous couple of games, what do you do in particular to try to get yourself back into a groove?
YOENIS CESPEDES: I just put some work in the batting cages every day.  I have exercises that I go to in case I'm having a rough time, that's kind of what helps me get through and out of them.
Q. What sort of exercise?
YOENIS CESPEDES: I don't know how to explain it, you just have to be in the cage to see what it is I do.
Q. You have a wonderful chance tomorrow to close this thing out.  How important is it not to give them life?
YOENIS CESPEDES: I think the team right now is really high on confidence, however that does not mean we're going to go out there tomorrow assuming that it's good to go for us, but we will go out with confidence that we're going to win this thing.
