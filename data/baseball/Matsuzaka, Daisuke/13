 Q.  How excited are you to be in this position? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  After the last few games I believed I was going to have a chance to throw again. My teammates kept insisting I would have another chance. So I'm going into tomorrow very excited. 
 Q: Can you equate this to anything else - the WBC finale - or the high school tournament you starred in 1998? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  I can't make a simple comparison to those other games,. but I just hope that I can pitch the same way as I did in those other opportunities. 
 Q: Curt Schilling spoke to you for some time in Cleveland about fastball command and some of the tips he uses to throw strikes with his fastball. How helpful was that to you? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  It's nothing very complicated. It's really very simple what we talked about. I just need to apply that in a simple way to my pitching. 

 Q: You seemed very upset after the last game, were you upset at yourself, the results or both? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  Whether or not we had won or lost, immediately following the game is a very important time period for me, although I might have appeared very upset, I wasn't as upset as everybody thought.  

 Q.  So tomorrow you'll be starting the seventh game of the ALCS.  How do you feel now? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  After the three losses that we had, I believe that I will have another opportunity to pitch, and everybody in my team told me to be ready for the next chance that I will have, so I was waiting for my turn to come. 

 Q.  During tonight's game, at what point did you know for sure that you'd be pitching tomorrow? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  Until the very end of the game I didn't feel that way. 

 Q.  How was the atmosphere at Fenway Park tonight? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  It will give great strength to me tomorrow. 

 Q.  So tomorrow you will be pitching with five days' since your last outing. 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  It doesn't affect how I pitch. 

 Q.  Was it difficult for you to prepare yourself psychologically when you're not sure if you'll have another chance to pitch? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  No, it wasn't difficult at all. 
 Like I said before, I believed that I would have another chance to pitch, and I did everything I could to be getting ready when my turn came. 

 Q.  Is your switch turned on psychologically? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  Emotionally it is on.  I don't know if the term "switched on" is the right term or the right way to describe, but I am all on for tomorrow. 

 Q.  Did Schilling say anything to you today? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  Yes, he did. 

 Q.  If possible, could you share that with us. 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  Yes, he did talk to me. 

 Q.  Victor Martinez is really hot and hitting very well.  Do you have any strategy for facing him? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  I know he's a really great batter.  I will pitch as well as I can. 

 Q.  Offensively the Red Sox have really gotten better.  How do you feel about your teammates offensively, how they're playing? 
 DAISUKE MATSUZAKA:  I would hope they would do well tomorrow, too.
