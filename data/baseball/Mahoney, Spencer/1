COACH WOODSON:   First of all, I want to say thanks to everybody in Bloomington.   The experience we had last year when we weren't ready to host a regional, it was well done this year.   So my hat is off to everybody for that. 
Secondly, I'm ecstatic about our season, how we performed here.   I think a lot of people, we were fortunate to play all three teams and all three were one‑run games so I'm very proud of what our guys did and I'm excited for what we have got to continue on starting next year again. 

Q.   You guys jump out to the lead, how comfortable did you feel to be in that position the way the weekend has gone, back and forth for you?
TANNER VAVRA:   I feel any lead is not really save.   You always want to add one run here or there when you can because you're never satisfied and next thing you know, it's gone.

Q.   Tyler Rogers comes in, one of the better closers, what's your approach? 
SPENCER MAHONEY:   You're really just looking for‑‑ he puts good sink on the ball and he moves it in and out well and you're just looking for something that you can barrel up, and like you said he's a very good pitcher and he pitched tough against us today.

Q.   Where does he rank? 
SPENCER MAHONEY:   We faced good pitching all year long and we have had a lot of guys that have thrown a little bit harder, but the arm angle was definitely something that we had not seen a ton this year.   Not going to put a number on where he is but definitely a very, very strong relief pitcher. 

Q.   Can you just talk about the triple in the first, and what was your approach going into that? 
TANNER VAVRA:   I got a fastball up over the other half and it was what I was looking for and it basically what I was trying to do, looking for the gap and as soon as it left his feet I was thinking three.   Luckily this guy is pretty quick and able to score. 

Q.   Were you guys looking for a fastball most of the time? 
SPENCER MAHONEY:   Yeah, absolutely.   That was our approach at the plate, any time we got a fastball over the plate, look for something to drive, especially early in the count, early in the game.   I think he did a good job mixing it up after the first couple innings.

Q.   Did you think about a patient approach coming into today? 
TANNER VAVRA:   Any time you look at a pitcher's numbers, you're sitting on that one pitch until youget two strikes.   You're looking for a ball and something that you can do something with he's not in that spot; that's a patient approach that we were kind of looking at today. 

Q.   In the seventh inning when you guys got a runner at third and one out and didn't score, did you feel like the momentum of the game changed? 
TANNER VAVRA:   I thought we were going to win until the third out was called.   It's a one‑run ballgame and we have runners on the first and second in the ninth and I didn't have any doubts that we were still winning that ballgame. 

Q.   Indiscernible. 
COACH WOODSON:   We tried to get as much matching up as we could.   We have a number of guys with decent changeups but every one of these guys are good fastball‑hitting teams so I don't have enough of those guys to run around. 
Like I said we faced all three teams, and thought we threw cutters and breaking balls well enough against India in a and yesterday against Florida we kept them off balance.   It was a matter of before long, we were going to run out of pitching that we were able to keep up with the three teams that we were here.   They were good‑hitting teams. 

Q.   Did he give you what you wanted today? 
COACH WOODSON:   Absolutely.   Freshman, and he's just not scared and he goes out and he's got three pitches but did not have his changeup.   That was not his good changeup today.   He got by with two pitches, basically.   He can be dominant if he's got all three. 

Q.   What was your feeling when you jumped into the lead? 
COACH WOODSON:   Keep adding on.   I tell them that, we have a tendency to score runs, we did it twice in our conference, we scored three in one game in the first and didn't score the rest of the game; we won 3‑0.   We scored five against Milwaukee and ended up winning 6‑4.   That's been our problem all year is we tend to have a little bit of a lull and you've got to step on their throat.   You have to continue scoring, pounding and we just don't do that enough. 

Q.   How disappointing was it when you have bases loaded, one out in the 7th and you don't get one across? 
COACH WOODSON:   That's another, left on base, that all year.   So that's probably been our Achilles' heel and we have got good hitters but just a little bit of‑‑ just a tough situation but you've got to be able to get those.   As a player, you should be able to thrive and you want to thrive under those situations. 

Q.   Can you just comment on the character of your team and your feelings on your guys? 
COACH WOODSON:   Yeah, and we are a smaller school, it's a family atmosphere.   When I recruit, it's a family atmosphere.   My family is heavily involved in this program and my wife and kids are just about every weekend we go, over tournament, and she works academics with our players. 

Q.   Went over to third on the bobble, would you say that was the turning point of the game?
COACH WOODSON:   Not really.   I thought he was out but it was really too close but I'm not going to argue myself, if it's bang, bang like that.   Tried to catch him with a glove, I think he keeps him at second.   I can't really remember what happened after that, might have tried to get him over on that.   Man on third, he's probably going to score, he's pretty fast.
