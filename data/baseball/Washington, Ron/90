 Q. Can you talk a little bit about the way C.J. pitched and then the position that you guys find yourselves in for the first time in the franchise history? 
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, you know, he really showed maturity out there today. He stayed within himself, he used all his pitches. He went around the strike zone with it. He never really got shaken. You know, he bent a little bit, but he didn't break, and that's exactly what we needed. We needed him to go out there and give us a good outing, and he did. 
 You know, being up 2-0 is huge, especially winning two on the road. But we still haven't accomplished anything yet. Our goal is to get as far as we possibly can, and we're just going to take it back to Texas and come out and try to play as hard as we can again, and after nine innings see if we've got the lead and got the win. 
 But nothing is won yet. We've still got to go out there and play baseball. That's a very resilient team over there. They're not going to lay down, but we aren't, either. So it's nice to be going home. 

 Q. The last time you were in here and you got swept, you said it would be a different result the next time you come in. I mean, is it some sort of prophecy that you knew something nobody else did?
 RON WASHINGTON: No, I just know my ballclub. We had the first game won, and things just fell apart there, and the momentum shifted. We're very confident in our ability to go out there and play baseball. It's not always the best team that wins, it's the team that plays the best, and for two games we played pretty good baseball. Right now that's all it is, two games. But I know my team, and we weren't healthy. I wasn't making any excuses, I was just making a fact. 
 It's the first time in a long time we've had all the guys together. Yesterday one group of guys picked us up and today another group picked us up. That's what our lineup is all about. But more than anything it happened on the mound. Cliff Lee gave us a great outing, C.J. gave us a great outing, Ollie came in and finished it all off, so that's what it's all about. 

 Q. Can you talk about what you saw on Michael's check swing? 
 RON WASHINGTON: You know, the umpire said he didn't swing. If he would have said he swung, I don't think we would have argued about that, either. It was a judgment call, and those things happen in baseball. Sometimes they work in your favor and sometimes they don't. They worked in our favor today.
