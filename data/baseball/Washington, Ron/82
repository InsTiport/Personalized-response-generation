  Q. Would you just start off and tell us how big Cliff Lee was tonight?  
 RON WASHINGTON: He was as big as you get. We needed him to go out there, because we knew that it was going to be a tough battle, and if it only took two runs we needed someone out there that can take it home, and he took it home.   
 I'm so proud of my team. I want to thank the -- I want to congratulate the Tampa Bay Rays on the season that they had. I'm just at a loss for words because those guys in that clubhouse were so resilient. We needed Cliff Lee to do what he did, we certainly did, and we certainly played the type of baseball that we're capable of playing. Every part of the game that you can think of, we did. We ran the bases, we pitched, we played defense, and at the end we showed some power.   
  
  Q. The Rangers scored three runs, the first three runs, without getting the ball out of the infield, and you seem to have stolen a page from the Rays' book as far as using your legs and creating situations. Was that part of the two scores that you have on the ground outs?  
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, I think what happened out there tonight is you got a chance to see what the Texas Rangers can do. We didn't steal a page from anyone. That's the way we play. You just haven't seen it until tonight. We have run the bases before, we steal bags. We may not have stolen as much. We have a very aggressive team, and tonight we took advantage of some things, a ground ball double play Vladimir. What else do we have to do but come around the bag and keep running? If it's a double play, the inning is over anyway.   
 Elvis, he was stealing the bag. It was a slow roller, threw it to the pitcher, he had a full steam ahead, and he just kept going.   
 Nelly, he stole third a few times this year. Opportunity was there, we took advantage of it. You know, Shoppach threw the ball away, we ended up get another run.   
 But that's the type of game we play. There's nights when we've got to power our way through it and there's nights when we do it that way.   
  
  Q. Did you think about taking Cliff out in the 9th inning?   
 RON WASHINGTON: No, when he came off the field, I'm standing right there in the dugout where he comes in and he looked at me and said, I've got this. He didn't say it in words, he just nodded his head, saying, I've got this.   
 We had people behind him just in case, but Cliff, once you give him a lead, he takes it to the finish line. That's the type of pitcher he is.
