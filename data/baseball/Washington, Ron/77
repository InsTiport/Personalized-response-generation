 Q. Obviously it was a big turnaround for your team today. Just wondering, did you guys have any kind of a talking last night or a meeting last night or before today's game, just to kind of get less night's disaster kind of washed away?
 RON WASHINGTON: No, we didn't. It was no usual than any other game. Go to clubhouse and talk about the positives, and those guys have always bounced back. And they did it today. So I'm not surprised. 

 Q. Could you take us through your thinking on the double steal, because it seemed to set a tone for the whole game. 
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, had speed. I had Hamilton at first and I had Elvis at third base. Opportunities seemed right, so I took a chance. That's the way we play. It worked. Got us going. 

 Q. Did you hope to sort of get a spark there, as well as a run? 
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, you know, as I said, I'm looking at opportunities, and it presented itself, or that's the type of game we play. I took a chance that the throw would be made to second base. If he faked it, wouldn't have happened. But he didn't fake it. So we executed. 

 Q. You were saying you hoped your bullpen would get almost the same exact opportunity as they had Friday night today. How do you feel about the way they pitched in the eighth inning there?
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, I feel good. That's what they have been doing for us all year. That's how we got to this point. 
 As I said last night, we didn't get it done. We didn't make any excuses about it. We took the whipping. We took a shower, and came back to play a ballgame today. And every game presents different circumstances. That's the way my team has always been. We just come to play baseball, and whatever the day introduces, we try to play to it. 
 That was it. I was going to give the ball back to those guys; if it presented itself, it presented itself. They did a great job. I expected it.

 Q. What did Colby give you today?
 RON WASHINGTON: He gave us exactly what we needed. I always said, if he can command his ball, keep them out of too many offensive counts, that he would do well. And he certainly did. 
 Once again, got to the sixth inning there, he just ran out of gas. Started losing command, and that's when we knew that it was time to go get him. 

 Q. Can you coach resiliency? Your team has been resilient all year. Is there anything that you do? 
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, I don't know if you can coach resiliency, but you can give them a mind-set and the mind-set is the day you're playing. If you come and play baseball the way the game presents it to you on each single day, and each day is different, you get different circumstances; and that's the mind-set I try to portray and my team has taken it on. Every time things look bleak, they show up and they showed up today.

 Q. It's a long season, it's easier to be resilient -- is it harder to be resilient in a short series like this?
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, I don't know. I think someone else will have to answer that. I know we are resilient. We showed it today and we came back and we played. I didn't see any effects of last night. 
 When you get to this point of the season, you can't get one night affect the next. That's what it's all about. And these guys have done it all year, and they don't expect anything less. We don't expect anything less. And they went out there today and they played good baseball against a pretty good team. 

 Q. Are you happy that you won't have to answer questions about winning at home any more in the playoffs? 
 RON WASHINGTON: (Laughing) Well, I had a feeling it would happen. My ballclub is a totally different ballclub. We can win ballgames in many ways. I think the world is beginning to see the Texas Rangers. You know, we was locked in. We won the West. We didn't win as many games as everyone else, but I have a bunch of guys that come and play the game of baseball, and whatever comes, they take. They make mistakes, but they get over it, and you have to have that type of attitude to perform in this game, because this is a very humbling game. And we just play baseball.
