  Q. What did you see in C.J. Wilson that led you to take him out at that point?  
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, you know, he had worked awfully hard. He had done a good job to that point. Gave up the infield single, double, Alex coming up -- I mean, Swisher and Teixeira coming up and I felt like I needed to let him leave right there and bring in the bullpen.  
 If Holly comes in and throws strikes, it is a different story, throw strikes. O'Day comes in best ground ball guy I have, got the ground ball, got past Michael. So I bring in Rapada to get Cano, gets the first pitch and Holland comes in and gets us the three outs we needed. Just a bad eighth inning.   
  
  Q. Is the way that the bullpen performed tonight going to change the way that you use them down the road here in this series?   
 RON WASHINGTON: No. Those are the guys I wanted in there. I mean, Darren Oliver has been nails for us. Just walked two guys back-to-back. Wasn't Darren Oliver. Just didn't happen tonight, that eighth inning just killed us out of the bullpen.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like this is one that you gave away, with the 5-0 lead?   
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, I don't know if we gave it away. We just didn't execute. You know, and when you face a team like the Yankees there, you've got to execute. We didn't execute. It certainly was our ballgame, especially when you just need six outs. We didn't get them.   
 So I guess in a sense, it got away from us. But gave it away? No. We just didn't execute.   
  
  Q. This is obviously an extremely difficult loss, but your club has no recovery time for this; is that maybe a good thing in this circumstance?   
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, it is. They usually recover when things go bad. You know, we had the winning run out there and once again, we had the guys at the plate we wanted up there and Rivera got them.   
 But, no, we'll go to sleep tonight and come back tomorrow and fight just as hard as we did today. Hopefully we'll get different results.   
  
  Q. We have seen Mariano come in and get six-out saves in the playoffs so many times. Did you give any thoughts to Neftali coming in for six outs?   
 RON WASHINGTON: No. He's never done anything like that. I wouldn't do that. I had the people I wanted in the game. They didn't get it done. It happens.   
  
  Q. What, if anything, did you say to the team after the loss, or did they seem down?   
 RON WASHINGTON: Told them to keep their heads up. They played the last out, and we live to fight again tomorrow. That's it.  
  
  Q. Do you think that a loss like this has sort of a hangover effect in the next game?   
 RON WASHINGTON: My team, they bounce back. They are very resilient.   
  
  Q. Your team is still looking for a home playoff win in this playoffs; two losses to Tampa and now the loss to the Yankees. Any pressure? Does anything change?   
 RON WASHINGTON: No, I don't think it's pressure. You know, Oliver's been around a long time. Those two walks right there is unlike him and just didn't happen. But we'll be back tomorrow. We'll fight just as hard. And tomorrow could be our day. But you know, you've got to be able to put this behind you and come back, and those guys have all been able to do that, and I expect that again tomorrow.
