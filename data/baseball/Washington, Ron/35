Detroit Tigers  Â– 5
  Texas Rangers - 2

 THE MODERATOR: We're going to get started in the interview room. Ron Washington is here. 

 Q. I was very curious, in the fifth inning you had runners on -- the Tigers had runners on first and third, Cabrera is coming up, Martinez on deck. I'm curious if you gave any thought at all with the open base to A, either walking Cabrera, or pitching around him? 
 RON WASHINGTON: I'm not going to take another runner and put him at second base -- the winning run is already at third base. I'm not going to do that. 
 We tried to make a pitch. Colby didn't get it there. Cabrera caught it. 

 Q. Can you talk about the night Colby had and how dominant he was early, and then the Tigers sort of kind of whittled him down with the home runs. 
 RON WASHINGTON: He throws strikes and every now and then he's going to give up some long balls. I thought it was a pretty good ballgame, 1-0, then 1-1. 
 Then Cabrera caught an up and away fastball that was supposed to have been out of the zone. Just didn't get it there. And from that point on, you know, he just -- they just like you said, whittled them down. 
 But he kept us in the ballgame. It was Fister that did the job out there tonight. 

 Q. Wash, was it a difficult call to keep Beltre in the game after he fouled that ball, off his knee I think it was? Are you concerned about his status for tomorrow? 
 RON WASHINGTON: He's getting an MRI. We'll know more about it tomorrow. It wasn't difficult. Beltre said he could play. 

 Q. You mentioned Fister. What did you see in him? 
 RON WASHINGTON: Same thing you always see. Good sink, good breaking ball, good command. He came out. The first nine or ten pitches he threw in the ballgame were strikes. That's him. He attacked the strike zone. He's going to make you put the ball in play. He did a good job tonight. You have to tip your hat. 

 Q. On the ball that you said was supposed to be away to Cabrera, up and away, with Martinez on deck looking hobbled, did you think about really pitching around him there to get to Martinez and see if he could swing the bat? 
 RON WASHINGTON: That's what we was trying to do. 

 Q. Ron, how concerned are you about Michael Young's struggles and are you maybe considering moving him out of the four hole? 
 RON WASHINGTON: No, Michael struggled before. I don't think there's a baseball player that's playing the game that hasn't struggled. No, I'm not concerned. Michael will figure it out. 

 Q. Ron, back to what was asked about pitching around Miguel. The count was 0-2. So can you talk about what was supposed to happen versus what did happen? 
 RON WASHINGTON: Well, the ball was supposed to be out of the zone. He didn't put it there. That was what was supposed to happen. 

 Q. Wash, you talked about Fister and your respect for him. Would that explain Andrus bunting in the first inning? Or was he on orders to do that, or did he do that on his own? 
 RON WASHINGTON: He didn't bunt in the first inning. 

 Q. He tried. 
 RON WASHINGTON: That was on his own. That was on his own. He was bunting for a base hit right there. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks for coming in, Ron. 
 RON WASHINGTON: You bet.
