 Q.  Your last game against Cuba was kind of a tough challenge for you.  What kind of adjustments have you made and what sort of impression do you have of the American lineup?  
YOSHITOMO TSUTSUGOH: Let's see, everybody, we heard all the members are in order, and very strong lineup hitting team, I heard.   
 Q.  I would like to ask everybody, finally it's the semifinal.  The game starts finally, but, please, how do you feel right now, everybody?  
YOSHITOMO TSUTSUGOH: Finally it's here.  That is the strong feeling I have right now.  We've done everything we can, so I would like put out a good performance today.  I'd like to spend the day and be prepared for tomorrow.   
NORICHIKA AOKI: Let me see, finally it's here, that's how I feel.  Here we have to do something here, that's how I feel.  Tomorrow is the semifinal, we'll win it somehow and advance to the final.  That's what I want to do.   
TOMOYUKI SUGANO: Really, it's finally here.  That's how I feel.  Tomorrow, for sure we'll win and advance to the final, that's how I feel.   
 Q.  The WBC coming to America, is there a big difference when you're playing at home versus playing on a different country where the fans aren't necessarily going to be cheering for you as much as they were in Japan?  Is there a different pressure to being on a different stage?  
NORICHIKA AOKI: For sure, I feel it's a way.  But here there are a lot of Japanese fans here as well.  So I'd like many of them to come see the game.  But Americans, I feel it's in the United States, and I feel it will help bring out our best performance as well.  So in that context, I'd like to do the best I can.
