Q.  Could you tell us about your view of Kenny Lofton's bunt in the fifth inning. 
 
MIKE SCIOSCIA:  I thought it was fair by a while, then it was teetering back.  I haven't had chance to see a replay.  Troy thought it was just off the line or on the edge of the line when he picked it up.  It was close.
