YANKEES  Â– 6
  ANGELS - 7

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Mike Scioscia. 

 Q. Did you ponder leaving Weaver in for the ninth? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Yeah, I think we talked about it. If it was a one-run game especially with some of the match-ups coming up with Johnny Damon and Tex, we would go with Fuentes. If we scored a couple more we were going to let weave go until we got to the left-handed slot after Alex.

 Q. Was it always the intention to walk Alex in the bottom of the 9th? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Well, obviously if they've got some action in front of us, you've got first and second, or a runner at first, we probably would not have, but in that situation you just want to keep Alex in the park. 
 Obviously it got a little bit too congested at the end of the game, but, you know, we just felt it was better to take our chances with some of the lefties following him.

 Q. And just the way the team came back. We've talked about the resiliency of the team, and a lot of great teams have resiliency, the Yankees have come back. You were nine outs away from elimination, and the way this team came back? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Well, they hit pretty quick in that inning to get the six runs. You know, we bounced back and answered with three. You know, I think in the dugout guys in between innings were, you know, still pumped up. They knew we'd get a guy on, we had the tying run at the plate, and just some real good hitting with guys in scoring position. Some key hits from Vlad and Kendry, and we were obviously able to get the lead and hold on.

 Q. Lackey was so good over the first six. Did you see him losing it quickly in the 7th? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Couple things. Do I don't know if it was as much of John losing it? Maybe he still looked like he maybe had a little bit left in him. In making that move I just with my heart said, hey, leave John in. 
 My head said let's try to turn Tex around and get out of that inning right there. I think I just have a lot of confidence in John. He might have had enough to get in there and get Tex out, but I thought to turn him around at that point was the move. Obviously, it didn't work.

 Q. With Howie's hit over the last few games, can you afford to not have Mathis in the lineup on Saturday? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: We'll look at a couple things. We're going to absorb this one. We'll talk as a staff and see where we're going to go. 
 But Jeff's playing some terrific baseball, that's for sure.

 Q. How difficult is it that you've got a game which you have won for six innings, and they score six runs and you guys bounce right back. Did you see that coming? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Did I? 

 Q. The comeback on your part. 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: If I saw the six runs coming I would have made a different move if I saw that.

 Q. No, the comeback on your guys' part?
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Well, yeah, we're in a situation where we know what we're up against. We have to play good baseball. We have to keep playing all the outs. It's not a forgiving team over there. So when they got the leads we need to keep playing baseball. Got us two key hits, a good bunt, and we were able to take the lead in the bottom half of that inning.

 Q. Have you ever wanted to go to New York for a weekend more than tonight? 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Oh, this is going to be a good trip, and we still have a huge challenge in front of us. But, you know, you're still in the game. You know, we're going to come out and hopefully have a good game Saturday and, you know, we'll just take it one step at a time, obviously.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Mike. Safe trip. 
 MIKE SCIOSCIA: Thanks.
