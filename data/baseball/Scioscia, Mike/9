Royals   4
      Angels   1

Q.   What was your sense of the guys after this loss, and did you have any sort of message for them?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   Yeah, we got together and talked about a couple things.   You know, naturally, it's not the position we want to be in.   Nobody has their head buried in the sand, and we need a three‑game winning streak, and that's really what we need to do. 
    But our guys are determined.   We're going to take the travel day and exhale a little bit and get out there and get after it on Sunday.

Q.   How much is your offensive problems self‑inflicted, and how much of it is the Royals pitching and defense?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   I think there is all of that in the mixture, no doubt about it.   There are some guys that right now aren't attacking the ball where they can for various reasons.   There is not one cure‑all that's going to get everybody swinging the bat. 
    We've got a big hit tonight from Albert, but couldn't keep capitalizing on it.   On the offensive side, we haven't done a lot of the things we've done during the season, and we put a lot of pressure on our pitching staff. 
    Our pitching staff has been incredible.   You lose a couple games late, and everyone's going to point to what happened in the 11th inning.   These guys have been pitching their butts off and doing a great job, and we just haven't been able to get what we need done on the offensive side.

Q.   For a team that's struggling to score runs right now, what did you think about the play in the 8th inning where Collin Cowgill got doubled up at third?   Did he go on his own, or was he sent by DiSarcina?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   No, he went on his own, and that's a great play by Collin.   He's aggressive.   He made the read.   Dyson made an incredible throw.   The ball maybe died a little bit as far as when it was hit by Chris.   Looked like he was going to carry far enough to get over.   Dyson covered a lot of ground and made a great throw. 
    But if that would happen again tomorrow or Sunday, I'm hoping Collin's going to go.   That's a huge base to get, and there is no doubt you want to pressure them in that situation.   Dyson just made an incredible defensive play, and we saw it again tonight.

Q.   I realize that Iannetta hasn't had too many sacrifices?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   He answered your question, Jeff.   He answered the question.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   Right there, we talked about Chris and what we need defensively.   We're going to keep him in the game.   At that point we didn't have the guy, the situation up there to get a bunt down.   So you're going to let Chris swing the bat.   Hopefully he can draw a walk, get a base hit or move him over.   You know, he got the ball in play, got it airborne up there.   Just Dyson made a great play.

Q.   What did you think of Ventura?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   That was some electric stuff.   You know he has a good arm, really threw some really good breaking balls, and you know, we had first and second, and a big double‑play ball on David Freese.   Made some pitches when he had to, but he's got a great arm, and he brought that stuff on to the field.   He matched Matt Shoemaker or Matty matched him pitch for pitch.   It was a heck of a pitcher's duel.   We just couldn't get it done late.

Q.   When you look at the Royals in the series, is there any feeling that they're here for the first time?   They're just having fun, relaxed and right now you're drawing a really tough opponent?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   We touched on this a little bit the other day.   I think our guys are relaxed.   I don't think it's anything about not being relaxed while they're performing.   Those guys are playing the way they played all season.   They have some things in their game that does not go into a slump. 
    The way you can run the bases does not go into a slump.   The way you can put the ball in play, that's usually not going to get into a slump.   Our club is really on that batter's box offensive side right now, and we need to start scoring some balls up better. 
    But I don't think there is anything in what we're doing on the field that gives us any indication that our guys are playing tight.   I think they're playing loose.   We're just not executing some things the way we need to.

Q.   I know it's only been two games, but are you surprised that Trout, in particular, has yet to get a hit?   Are you seeing anything in particular that he's doing?
    MIKE SCIOSCIA:   I think it's unfair to focus on one guy in looking at us.   We haven't scored many runs this series, but it's more than just Mike.   There are some guys in our club who just haven't squared balls up yet.   He's definitely, obviously, being pitched very tough, and he got a couple walks, but he'll work his way out of it. 
    I don't know if there is anything‑‑ like I said, there is one thing, Mike's going to adjust and start squaring the ball up.   I think he just needs to get in that box, see the ball, and eventually he'll start hitting the ball hard again.   We need him, no doubt.
