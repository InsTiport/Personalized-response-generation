 Q. Question for Roger, everything you've accomplished in your career, particularly this
past week with the All-Century Team, where does this rank?
 
 ROGER CLEMENS: Well, this is what everybody said it was all about, and I think I
alluded earlier that I finally know what it feels like to be a Yankee. And I remember, I
think I talked -- a talk that Skip and I had in Seattle. He called me in his office and
said you kind of need to be yourself and just let loose. I think all year, even when I
walked into spring training, I just wanted to kind of fit in with these guys. I definitely
wanted to fit in given their situation. I appreciate the opportunity Mr. Steinbrenner gave
me in getting together, getting me over here, whatever it took to get me over here, I just
knew we could do it with this team. These guys from day one, I said it before, even after
they were presented their championship rings on the field, they walked in the clubhouse, I
was sitting there watching them on TV receive them, they said, "we're going to get
you one." Every one of them told me the same thing tonight. So Mo's going to design
this one for us, too. It might have a crack in it. The way you bust them bats. 
 
Q. Roger, you said that they went out and told you they would get you one. You threw
strikes tonight. You knew you had control of your own destiny. You went out there and
threw strikes. Will you take some credit this time for what you did?
 
 ROGER CLEMENS: I don't need to take credit. Like I said, I heard people talk about how
I could be rattled and things like that. Nothing, I don't get rattled. Maybe earlier in my
career, big games. What are big games? I pitched a big game tonight and I put pressure on
myself tonight to rise to the occasion. Again, I don't know, to be honest with you, I
don't know if I could have pitched tonight if I was in Paul O'Neill's situation in his
shoes. I don't know how he went up to the plate, up there trying to hit a 90, 95 mile an
hour fastball. Same thing with Luis Sojo coming back to join his teammates. I'm telling
you, if it was my mother in that situation, I just don't know. You're talking about heavy
hearts and guys that are warriors and make it exciting. I just feel very blessed to be a
part of this and the way the fans were tonight. And, you know, those guys got me well. I
was scuffling a little bit, like three or four other guys were scuffling and we ran it out
there and got it done. 
 
Q. Roger, Elway and Jordan went out on top. Any thoughts of doing the same thing? 
 
 ROGER CLEMENS: Wait and see. Like I said, this was one night where I had more pressure
than I could stand. There was a phone call and those two big guys up there and the two
little ones I had at home were telling me dad you have to be home for trick or treat.
There was no pressure except to get that done. I had to be home for that. You're talking
about pressure, that was enough pressure for all of us. Talk to this man. 
 
Q. Mariano, in '96 it was John Wetteland closing the show. Last year it was you. This
year, obviously even more. Can you talk about how much this meant and has it meant more
than the other two?
 
 MARIANO RIVERA: To me, it means the same. Different than when I won the MVP of the
World Series last year. We won the World Series. Personal, the whole thing was MVP. Roger
pitched tremendous. He was -- I mean the way he pitched today, he was -- everything he
has. Everything he has, he did it today. That's the guy that I always see pitching that
way. And I knew he was trying so hard during the year. It's been tough for him. But today
he stepped up and he did it for us. As I say, the MVP thing, we all were MVP. The whole
thing; manager, coaches, the 25 guys that were on the field. 
 
Q. Just talk about this being back-to-back Championships if you can. Talk about what
this means to this club being the "Team of the Decade?"
 
 MARIANO RIVERA: Last year, it was the best team in baseball they talked about. Nobody
said nothing about this year, you know, everybody would say, "Oh, Yankees..."
They don't have the same numbers we had last year. Of course. Last year was tremendous. I
think those years only happen once in 100 years. It's impossible to repeat those kind of
numbers. And it's not done. I mean we won the American League. We won the Division. We
were the best team in the American League. I don't see anything different last year than
this year. We won the World Series. I mean, we swept Atlanta; one of the best teams,
obviously the best team in the National League. To me, it means a lot. It means a lot to
win back-to-back World Championships. 
 
Q. How do you feel, you know, second year, you've gotten the last out both years. How
do you feel?
 
 MARIANO RIVERA: I said I feel good about it, I just feel tremendous to be there. I want
to be there, when this happens. I was there, and I was the guy throwing the last pitch.
And I had the last out. It feels tremendous.
