Q.  Talk about your pitching performance tonight.
 
MIGUEL BATISTA: I mean, I just went out there and tried to keep my team in the game.  We ended up winning.  That's the whole story. 
 
Q.  Were you nervous when you started the game?
 
MIGUEL BATISTA: Of course I was nervous.  I mean, I never feel fear, I've never been brave, because I never defeated anything, and there comes a point in time in your career when you don't feel the butterflies in your stomach, when you're not willing to compete because it doesn't mean anything to you. 
 
Q.  What did you throw to Edmonds on the home run ball?  Was it just a bad pitch?
 
MIGUEL BATISTA: Is there such a thing as a bad pitch?  I was just trying to make him hit the ball on the ground.  I was down and away, down and away, and he just got the best part of the ball.
