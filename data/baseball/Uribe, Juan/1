 Q.   Donnie was just in here talking about your at‑bat in the 8th inning and after the two bunts he was asked what do you expect of you, and he was thinking I've already screwed this thing up, what am I going to do now?   Can you walk us through that at‑bat, the bunt attempts and then getting the slider?     
JUAN URIBE:   You know, when they gave me the bunt sign, I'm thinking this is a good time to have a bunt, and I had to bunt I and I had to try.   I'm thinking, hey, I need to do this thing and move the run.     
So the one thing is the pitcher they can't beat me.   They can't beat me and I need to do my job.   Try to move the runner and they gave me a hanging breaking ball, see the ball, and hit it.   
   
 Q.   Can you just take us through that feeling right after you hit it?   You obviously knew.   Can you take us through that feeling?     
JUAN URIBE:   You know, I feel like just to wait for my teammates in this moment I'll never forget.   This moment today I'll never forget.   You know, I see a lot of people are watching this game, and I feel great.   I feel good for myself.   I feel good for my teammates.   We wanted the win today.   
   
 Q.   You clearly have a flair for the dramatic.   You thrive on these moments.   Don talks about it a lot.   What is it about Postseason baseball that get us fired up?     
JUAN URIBE:   You know, for me I never like it.   A lot of people told me you have a couple times Postseason, but I don't think like that.   For me, this game and the Postseason game, I try to do the same thing.   I don't try to do too much.   I try to play this like the same game like before.   I think this will happen, and have a good time in the playoffs.   
   
 Q.   What were you thinking as you rounded the bases for your home run?     
JUAN URIBE:   Oh, you know everybody said I'm going to hit that ball?   It was a good moment, it was a good moment for me.   Good moment, too, for doing my job.   I know how I can hit the ball, and I can win the game.   I don't think it's only me.   I think it's all 25 guys doing a good job today like Crawford.   To catch up three day, like today would be a day off.   Like sixth inning, like doing a good job.   
   
 Q.   When you missed the first two bunt attempts, does it maybe relax you a little bit that I've just got to put the ball in play?     
JUAN URIBE:   I tried to like‑‑ I don't think I pull the ball.   I tried to go right field, and I think that's why I've got time to see the breaking ball.   You know, I tried to go right field to get the run.   I'm thinking that's why they helped me so I can see the breaking ball better.   
   
 Q.   Would you say this is the best moment of your career especially after having a tough last season and now coming through in this big time moment?     
JUAN URIBE:   Oh, yeah.   Oh, yeah.   This moment today‑‑ this is what I tell my teammates.   A lot of people want to be in the moment that we have right now.   And this moment we'll never forget.   Today, what we did today I'll never forget this moment.   I think a lot of people feel like that.
