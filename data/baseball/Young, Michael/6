  Q. What would you say about the check swing call?  
 MICHAEL YOUNG: You know what, it was 2-2, threw a good slider, kind of bit out of the zone at the last minute, I checked, if he had rung me up, I would have walked back to the dugout and focused on defense like I usually do. I got the call in my favor and just tried to lock in on the strike zone at that point.   
  
  Q. After that call did you see the pitcher lose his concentration at that point because of everybody jawing against the umpire?   
 MICHAEL YOUNG: I doubt it. I mean, he's a good pitcher, they have a good team. They had the best record in the league, so I doubt that's a characteristic of their team. Either way, that's really not my business. My business is my playing, focusing on what I have to do at that point in order to help the team win.   
  
  Q. Two games and six or eight guys have already come up really big. How confident are you right now in your teammates?  
 MICHAEL YOUNG: My teammates have done great. I just think that we've had a great mentality these first two games. We're really not thinking about some huge, grand picture here. We empty the tank for the game we're playing that day. We emptied the tank today for Game 2; we're going to empty the tank for Game 3. We just push them all in and play as hard as we can.   
 Our pitching has been great. Cliff and C.J. did great, and our bullpen was awesome today. We got in a bit of a jam in the 7th, and they got out of it. So my teammates have been great.   
 I imagine when you get in the post-season play that the good teams are the ones that have complete, total team efforts, and that's what we're getting right now.   
  
  Q. What do you think when you see Josh Hamilton making diving catches and running into the wall and doing all that stuff?  
 MICHAEL YOUNG: I hope he catches every one of them. The injury stuff is on the back burner now. I'm pretty sure everyone is going to go no matter what at this point.   
 Like I said, when I say we're going to empty the tank for every game, we're going to do that. If we're a little banged up or a little hurt, we're pushing them in and we're going. We're playing too talented a team to sit there and relax or say this guy is banged up or he doesn't play or this guy is banged up, he gets pulled out. That's not going to happen. We're going to go all out every pitch, every inning, every game, regardless of what might happen to us physically.   
  
  Q. What was the home run pitch and what was location, and also, how gratifying is it for you to finally get to the post-season and have a big hit in Game 2?  
 MICHAEL YOUNG: It was a fastball, a sinker that stayed up a little bit. At that point I wasn't thinking about doing anything too big. I was thinking about focusing on the strike zone, wasn't thinking about doing too much, just trying to put the barrel on the ball, stay as short as I possibly could.   
 But for me personally, I mean, this personal stuff goes out the window. It's always nice to contribute and nice to play well. We're competitors, we want to do our jobs well. But at the end of the day the W is what every team is searching for, regardless of how it comes, you get the win, that's what we're searching for. I feel no different today than I did yesterday.   
 Yesterday I went 0 for 4, but I feel no different today than I did yesterday. The win is what our team is searching for right now.
