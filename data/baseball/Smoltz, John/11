Q.  John Schuerholz was in here talking about how you met with him in New York.  He said their goal is to continue to have you as a closer.  He didn't explain why he felt that way.  I want to know, do you understand the Braves' thinking on that, and do you agree with it? 
 
JOHN SMOLTZ:  I really haven't had, you know, and I told John this, I haven't had time to really make up my mind.  But I understand where their line of thinking would be, and I'm open to anything at this point.  I have to be, because when I started the year, I thought I was going to be in a certain role.  Obviously, that's changed.  I had to be open over the last few years of making changes mechanically and making a change this year for a chance to pitch.  So I'm not at a point where I've made up my mind any which way.   I just learned that you got to leave a lot of doors open.  Otherwise, what you think is going to happen or what you plan to happen, the last three years of my career haven't gone the way I thought they would go.  So...  I'm just leaving it open.  I understand a lot of the situations, and I'll let the off-season take care of itself.  Hopefully I can be doing this for the next  - we need ten more wins.   Hopefully I can do this for the next whatever it takes. 
 
Q.  Did you get the impression it was for your benefit they wanted you to be a closer or for their benefit? 
 
JOHN SMOLTZ:  No, I took that as for the club's benefit, you know.  They know my desire to win.  They know how bad I want to win.  Anything else is second nature for me right now.  Just a chance to pitch in the post-season again after what I went through last year, in whatever capacity it was going to be, that was my goal.  Everybody can say there's writing on the wall one way or the other, whether it's with the new owners or, you know, can the Braves keep winning?  Can they keep going?  Every indication I have is that they can keep winning and we got a chance in the next few years.  But, again, I don't have any control over that other than I'll let the process take care of itself and see what happens.  
 
Q.  How difficult has it been to go from the ritual, standard preparation time as a starter?  There is a lot more uncertainty as a reliever when you don't know when you're going to pitch. 
 
JOHN SMOLTZ:  Well, it's been a mental adjustment.  It hasn't really been that bad of a physical adjustment.  As much grief as those guys gave me, they've helped me out a lot.  The bullpen has been much maligned.  They haven't got much credit over the years I've been here.  And the microscope of the media and our starting staff for so many years, they got blamed for things that weren't really exactly the correct blame.   So they did, they helped me a lot.  It's not a role that many people appreciate.  As a starter, I had an appreciation for what they did but not to the degree that once I got down there and realized how difficult it really is or how much more difficult it is.  They have a lot of pride.  They want to do their job when called upon.  But it really is depending upon the situation of the game.  As a starter, you know when you're going to pitch.  You prepare to pitch for a certain day.  As a closer, you pretty much wait to see if your team's going to put you in that position.  That, for me, because everybody knows in my clubhouse how patient I am, that's probably been the hardest transition.  
 
Q.  John Schuerholz was in here a minute ago.  He was talking about almost as an example an Eckersley thing where you start for a few years, win 100, 150 games, then have another long period as a closer.  Is that something that would be okay for you? 
 
JOHN SMOLTZ:  I'm just being honest when I say whatever capacity, I want to be able to feel like I'm competent.  Not to just hang on for any prolonged situation.  I had the surgery that seems like a lot of people have been having lately to continue pitching past at least  -- you know, not just to finish this year.  I felt like the surgery's taken place to give me another three, four good years.  I don't look too far down the road.  I don't pitch for any kind of records or any kind of situation that's going to prolong my career.  They know, and I think anyone who's close to me knows, as soon as that desire's gone and I don't feel like I can come through, then I'll walk away from the game.  I don't look at it like that; I don't.  I know comparisons based on the numbers are pretty close and the age and the starts, you know.  I would think that looking at that would be a little difficult for me because he was the best at what he did, and he pitched for a long time.  
 
Q.  How much will this post-season, either success or failure, play into your thinking, your enjoyment of this role in the post-season? 
 
JOHN SMOLTZ:  I don't know.  That's tough to answer.  I mean, you know, I think the last ten years have been incredible  - can't take that away from myself or Glavine and guys that have been on this team.  But every year, the process as a player, when you go to spring training, they've given us a chance to win every single year.  That's all you can ask for.  I've been spoiled in that regard.  But at the same time, having a choice to go somewhere or be part of something, I would like it to continue in a winning way.  I don't think you ever get tired of winning.  That would be a nice direction if they're going to continue going.  I don't look at it if we come up short or win at all that's going to make my decision one way or another, whether it's going to be as a starter or a closer or whether it's going to be with Atlanta.  Again, those things at this point are out of my hands, but hopefully in some time shortly will be worked out.
