 Q. You played in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. What are some of the differences that you see?
 MICHAEL COLLINS: We're in a little bit of a different atmosphere here in Mexico, but the team is going along really well and everyone seems to be in a good mood and ready to play, so it should be fun.

 Q. How intimidating is it to play in front of the home crowd of Mexico?
 MICHAEL COLLINS: I wouldn't use the word intimidating, but it certainly makes for a good atmosphere. As soon as you start worrying about that, you lose focus on the game. 

 Q. You're a guy that doesn't walk or strike out a lot, kind of a rare feat. Why is that?
 MICHAEL COLLINS: I don't know. I guess I put a lot of balls in play early in the count.

 Q. You missed part of the 2008 season with an injury. How do you feel now?
 MICHAEL COLLINS: I feel great. I was cleared to play back in mid-December, so I've had a few months now to get ready, and everything feels good. I'm ready to go.
