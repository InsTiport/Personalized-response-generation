Q.  How does this feel for you tonight?
 
ARAMIS RAMIREZ: It's big.  Like I told Dusty I used to be home by this time. I enjoy this moment like it was the last one.  Hopefully we'll keep going to make it to the World Series.  
 
Q.  You faced Wood in the past.  Now that you are a teammate, are you even more impressed than you were before?
 
ARAMIS RAMIREZ: Yeah, playing behind these guys is unbelievable.  He and Prior and Zambrano, they throw strikes and strikes out people.  They're great to play behind.  I mean, I've faced them a lot before and it's not fun to face those guys.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about your home run, the pitch and how it felt?
 
ARAMIS RAMIREZ: Well, I think it was a changeup that, and I just tried to make contact with the ball and play.  It was huge.
