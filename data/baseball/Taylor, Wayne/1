MARK MARQUESS:   Well, it was a great college baseball game.   Both teams I thought played extremely well.   Some big pitches and they won some big spots early, big hits.   They got them on base and they got some business you hits against us and jumped on us early and then we came back and we got some big hits.   It was just a great college baseball game, great atmosphere, and we are fortunate to win. 
But we battled really well.   I thought A.J. Vanegas did a great job.   That's probably the longest he's gone all year, and then Wayne Taylor, the three‑run home run obviously was the one that really put us over.   It was a great college baseball game in a great environment. 

Q.   Schwarber was in here just a few minutes ago and he gave you credit.   He said he thought you hit a good pitch.   He said that there really wasn't anything‑‑ it wasn't like it was a go‑for ball up there or anything.   Can you talk through that at‑bat and was it indeed a pretty good pitch that you managed to drive out of there? 
WAYNE TAYLOR:   Yeah, I thought that was a pretty good pitch.   That's a good pitcher for them.   He throws pretty hard, keeps the ball down really well.   And then the slider he throws a lot, it's a pretty sharp pitch. 
You know, I thought that was a pretty good pitch.   I ended up getting the barrel on it and driving it pretty well.   But he's a great pitcher.   I thought he did a very good job. 

Q.   What did he actually throw you there, basically, and how much did that change everything for you guys just in the dugout and everything? 
WAYNE TAYLOR:   I think the pitch was a slider.   I saw a slider on the pitch before and he threw it again and I hit it.
You know, I think it was a turning point for us.   I tell you what, the most clutch part of the game I thought was scoring three more in the ninth there.   It was huge for Tommy Edman with the lead‑off double, and then Danny Diekroeger bunting him over.   Blandino had a huge two‑strike hit to drive in Tommy.   And then of course, Slater came through with the big double to score Blandino and Hoffpauir with a triple to score Slater.   That I thought that was the biggest part of the game.   Especially having to face their one, two, three hitters coming up in the bottom of the ninth, that was huge. 

Q.   Coach obviously had enough confidence in you to put you in for a pinch‑hitting role two nights in a row.   What is it about your makeup that you think allows to you excel in that role?
WAYNE TAYLOR:   Well, I appreciate the shot again tonight.   I just think it was a good match‑up.   I think Coach does a great job of putting the right guys in at the right times with the right pitchers. 
I actually saw that guy last night in a pinch‑hit situation, and so I think Coach just thought it was a good match up and I think it turned out to be one. 

Q.   How did you feel out there?   How did you manage to get as much out of yourself in those four or five innings? 
A.J. VANEGAS:   Felt good.   Just kind of just keep grinding.   I was just trying to give my team an energy boost.   We had fallen back, fallen behind, and just pitched with a lot of energy and just tried to get the momentum on our side. 
That's what‑‑ with big crowds like this, you get ahead, and the key is getting ahead early and staying ahead, and that's what you try and do. 
I feel like I did that to the best of my ability, and gave our team a shot.   That's all you can ask for.

Q.   Do you know who you will throw tomorrow, and how many arms do you think you have left? 
MARK MARQUESS:   Well, that's a good question.   I'll get together with Coach Filter, our pitching coach, and we'll go back tonight and figure out what we're going to do and see who who's sound and who's ready to go. 
We are limited a little bit.   You know, A.J. obviously won't go, but Castellanos can come back, Viall pitched before.   We'll see.   We'll see what we've got. 

Q.   How clutch, how huge was it for a guy to come through as a pinch‑hitter? 
MARK MARQUESS:   Well, Wayne caught the first game and had a lot of at‑bats.   I think he came in last night and pinch‑hit, so I think he saw the guy.
He's very dangerous.   He's very dangerous.   He's got tremendous power to all fields, and if you elevate it ‑‑ and I think it was a slider, but I think it was up a little bit, and he hit it out to the deep part of the ballpark.   He's worked hard.   He's started the most this season for us, and he's come off the bench in a couple of games. 
I wanted just to split the catching up today.   So I caught him the first one, and I wanted to rest him and bring him in in a situation if there was a match‑up and it presented itself, and he got ‑‑   he's very modest. 
The big hit of the game is his hit.   That gives us the lead in that situation; obviously adding the runs in the ninth was big, but that was ‑‑ that turned the game around.   That was a huge hit off a good pitcher. 

Q.   A.J. went five‑and‑a‑third innings, and before that I believe his longest outing was four innings.   Going into, before he came in, did you tell him, we need a little extra from you? 
MARK MARQUESS:   Not really.   We told him we were going to go to him early and there was no tomorrow and we needed to win today and to keep playing.   So we would go to him in the second inning which is what we did, and he could go as far as he could. 
He's had a lot of‑‑ not arm problems, more back problems last year, and he's really come off a lot of injuries.   And his arm is pretty sound, because he throws about 94, 95 miles an hour.   But his recovery time really has not been as good, so we've been very cautious of that.   We knew if we used him this weekend, it would probably only be one time, and so this is the perfect time to extend him.
And he knows his arm.   He's a senior pitcher.   And he got tired there at the end.   And then he threw two balls and then we got him out.   But he gave us everything that he had for that time, and that's his longest outing at a big time for us.
