 MIKE DAVIDSON:  No, I haven't.   
  
  Q.  Sounds like you work pretty hard.  How many hours a week do you work?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  Anywhere from 40 to 80.   
  
  Q.  At any point did you consider how much that money could change your life?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  Yes, I have, but I figure it would be more aggravation dealing with people that come out of the woodwork when people win the lottery instead of just giving the ball to Mark McGwire for him to appreciate.   
  
  Q.  Have you had a chance to talk to your wife yet?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  Yes, I have and she is thrilled.

 MIKE DAVIDSON:  No, we have already picked the names out so ââ   
  
  Q.  How would you compare this to everything else that has happened in your life?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  So far it is the biggest thrill of my life, so far.   
  
  Q.  You started to talk about the aggravation that would come if you held on to it.  Did you start to feel that already or what made you think about it?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  Not really, but I have had a distant relative win the lottery and they have been driven out, basically.  We don't hear from them anymore.  People coming out of the woodwork irritating them for money and stuff.   
  
  Q.  How much did he win?   
 MIKE DAVIDSON:  I have no idea.
