   BOB GEBHARD:  The Rockies are pleased to announce a trade with Montreal for second baseman Michael Lansing, and in turn we traded three young prospects, rightâhanded pitcher Jake Westbrook, rightâhanded pitcher John Nicholson and outfielder Mark Hamilton to the Montreal Expos.  But we feel with the addition of Mike in our infield probably starting the top of the order for Don it gives us a quality, certainly an AllâStar capable second baseman in our lineâup.   
 DON BAYLOR:  Once we lost Eric Young, one of our priorities was maybe trying to find a second baseman, but to come up with a find like Mike Lansing, AllâStar caliber type of player, plus it also gives me an impact leadâoff guy.  So we're looking forward to him hitting in the lineâup with another former teammate Larry Walker.   
  
  Q.  Don, Lansing says he's never been really comfortable in the leadâoff role, but you think you see some potential for him there?   
 DON BAYLOR:  I think in our lineâup he'll find a comfort zone about scoring runs in our ballpark  and playing in our ballpark.  He's from Wyoming, so I think in that scenario it fits for him.
