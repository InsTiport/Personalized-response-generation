 Q. (No microphone.)
 SADAHARU OH: (Indiscernible) something nice about this time was Holland. There are nations trying to find out how to participate in this, and other countries have to participate. That was the original purpose. In doing so, the level will increase little by little. 

 Q. (I hear) there are restrictions about the major players and the coach is frustrated. 
 SADAHARU OH: (Indiscernible) as of now, we just have to keep going. In reality, we realize that restrictions may not be needed (hopefully, the status increases) everything will not be fine from the very beginning, so you have to keep doing it, and then that might be the only way. 
 Same is true for myself and Hara, we have to go to the U.S.A. Yesterday was very good for the sake of Japan. It's nice to be able to continue. Whatever has been said, America has started this kind of thing. 

 Q. In L.A. (indiscernible) is waiting. 
 SADAHARU OH: Yes, yes. Dodgers are calling up.
