Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  I just actually thanked them.  After this point in the season, being together this much, I needed to thank them, but I don't think he had to sit there and get a long speech.  They know how we feel.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  It's probably a little bit of both.  I thought we did a great job, very elevated.  We did a good job, actually great job to get to 3-2, just couldn't lay off of balls.  I think, you know, you don't want to all the time, but sometimes you have to tip your hat.  That wasn't a point where we wanted to.  He pitched great.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  We certainly tried.  That's the whole idea, regardless of whatever happens or what happens in front of you, or what happens in the rearview mirror, our goal is to win, and we didn't.  But, yeah, I don't feel even remotely -- they gave everything they have, and we gave everything.  It just wasn't enough.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  Well, sure.  It's a lot more comfortable when you're ahead.  First of all, it means you're winning but, I mean, because of the way they play, what they can do, a good example is the tack-on run.  If you're up by 3, that's not a possibility.  It's certainly at lot more comfortable to have the lead.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  Up until that last out, there's never a thought that we're not going to score.  That's not how you operate.  It was a great opportunity for us, and we didn't cash in, but we had scored 1 to make it 4-3.  I don't think there was anyone in that dugout that didn't think we would win that game.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  He's an All-Star catcher.  Everybody knew when Wakefield was done, we had a chance to do some damage, Tek would hit.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

TERRY FRANCONA:  Last three or four weeks?  What matters was today.  That's a tough question to answer, because the last three or four weeks, that's a whole different season.  This was the best of five, and they outplayed us.  They pitched, hit, and ran the bases better than us.  They outplayed us.  That's why they won.
