 MATT McKENDRY: Questions for Terry Francona. 

 Q. The lack of offense, is that more something with your team, or is it just their pitching is that good right now? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: It's probably a little bit of both. They certainly have executed very, very well. Weaver tonight -- he wasn't pitching down the stretch very much. Jacoby's triple. You know, he throws across his body with the deception we talked about before the game. He executed his pitches, and we looked like we started trying to pull a little bit too much. 
 We didn't square up on the balls. 

 Q. Can you talk about Josh's performance tonight? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: Yeah, I thought he was good. Fourth inning he was up a little bit. Mike Lowell makes that diving catch. We limit it to one run that inning. Other than that going into the 7th, he didn't even have -- I think he had one 19-pitch inning, an 8 and an 11. Threw a lot of good changeups to kind of slow him down. And the triple really hurt. 
 The way they were limiting our offense, that was obviously a big hit. 

 Q. What can you do to get this offense clicking? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: You I missed the first part. Can you say that again.

 Q. Going back to Fenway, will that be enough to get the offense clicking? And what else can you do? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: Well, I certainly hope so. I don't know if I can answer that. What we'll trying to do is win the next game we play, that's what we always do. I certainly hope so. We've had a tough time these last two games swinging the bat. That's an understatement. 

 Q. Does your strategy change now that you're 0-2, and if so, how? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: No, our strategy is that we need to win. No, we need to win a game. 

 Q. You've obviously liked this team and the situation is obvious. Are there some things about this team's character that you feel they might rise to the occasion now? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: Well, I think that's how we always feel. I'd rather not be down 0-2, because the team we're playing is really good. If you put yourself in a position where you make a mistake, it can really cost you. But until they tell us to go home, we'll take our team and keep going. That's how we always feel. 

 Q. You said you guys were trying to pull Weaver quite a bit. What was he doing that was getting you to do that? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: No, he throws, you know, like we talked about before the game, he throws across his body, a lot of deception. If you do try to pull the ball, you get yourself in trouble. That's a lot easier said than done. 
 You know, he was pretty effective. Located everything. He pitched -- he executed his game plan very well. 

 Q. In Josh's last inning he went 3-0 on the first three hitters. Were you thinking about taking had him out then? What were you thinking then? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: I would never take him out after a 3-0 count. He's thrown a three or on four-hitter going into that inning. No, I didn't think he was tired. I thought he was fine. 
 We had Wagner up for Figgins, which we ended up going to anyway, but up to that point we were staying with Josh. 
 MATT McKENDRY: Thank you, Terry.
