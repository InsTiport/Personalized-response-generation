Angels  Â– 7
  Red Sox - 6

 THE MODERATOR: We'll take the first question for him. 

 Q. Could you just explain the thinking on walking?
 TERRY FRANCONA: It's tough to walk the bases loaded. But Pap throws strikes and he had had a lot of success against Guerrero. I think Hunter was probably 3 for 7 with a homer. I guess, put it in a nutshell, we thought it would put us in a better chance to win. 
 It didn't work. 

 Q. Maybe it's hard to put into words but what are your feelings right now? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: I think we're disappointed. The season doesn't wind down. It just comes to a crashing halt. You go into the top of the inning excited because you think you're going to keep playing. Half an inning later, you're going home. So it's disappointing. 
 Not disappointed if our guys. I just told them it was -- somebody has to go home not happy. Unfortunately for us this year, it's us. But we asked a lot of them all year, asked them to do some things a lot of guys weren't accustomed to doing. They all tried to handle it and they always tried to do what we asked them to do. Just a tough ending for us. 

 Q. Terry, this might be a little bit of the same thing, how excited at the top of the inning, but to get two strikes, two outs, two strikes, batter, batter, batter there, that sequence, just how tough was that, the ending sequence? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: Well, the way it started was good. Again, it's 0-2. He left a pitch out over the plate. And we don't take anything for granted. But we were in a good situation. And that's the way they've played all year also. They don't stop playing. They are very talented. You give them a chance to extend innings, and they extended it one too many for us. 

 Q. Were you, I guess, the right word is satisfied, what you got out of Buchholz, and did you think the balk bothered him, unnerved him a little bit? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: A little bit. I thought he pitched very well. I thought that inning he was starting to -- you can tell he was thinking about some other things. Third to first on his own in a situation where Vlad wasn't running. 
 And we sent John Farrell out, wanted to talk to him. It looked like they were doing -- the way they play, the game is fast anyway. But you could tell that he was thinking about some things. So it looked like it was probably time to get him out of there. Bard came in and did a great job. Limited the damage and really did a good job. 

 Q. Can you just talk about the season? You must be -- you mentioned it before, but you must be disappointed that it ended. But for the season, can you just talk about the season? 
 TERRY FRANCONA: Well, it's a long season, John. Like I said, it doesn't wind down. It just comes to a crashing halt. There will be plenty of time to think back on the season. Right now it's probably not the easiest -- 10 minutes ago we're fighting for our baseball lives. So probably not the easiest time to do that. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Terry.
