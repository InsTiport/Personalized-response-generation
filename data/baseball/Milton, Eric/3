Q.  Eric, can you talk about your physical condition right now and how you are feeling physically.

ERIC MILTON:  I am feeling really good.  My last two starts I have been feeling really good, and I have been able to figure some stuff out mechanically to get me back on track, because I was out for a month.  So my last two starts have been good and I am very confident right now.

Q.  Knee's okay, too?

ERIC MILTON:  Yeah, everything is great, everything is good. 

Q.  Eric, that night in Baltimore when you hurt the knee, I mean, can you just describe like how frustrating that was?  It was getting late in the year.  I think everybody knew you guys were going to be here.

ERIC MILTON:  Well, I am kind of glad it happened when it did and not later in the season, so I had time to come back in September and get a few starts under my belt and get back on track.  It could have happened in September, at the end of September, and that wouldn't have been a good situation.

Q.  Eric, what's the biggest game you have pitched in in your life before tomorrow's game?

ERIC MILTON:  You know, I really haven't had many big games.  There is our first post-season, looking forward to it.  We are trying to get to where the A's have been, perennial post-season powers, and we are trying to get there, so tomorrow will definitely be the biggest game of my career, no doubt.

Q.  In your last start you were pitching and you felt that twinge or that shock in your knee.  If that was to happen again, can you pitch through that or does that affect the way you deliver the ball anyway?

ERIC MILTON:  No, I don't think so.  It's something that's been normal since the surgery.  It must be scar tissue or something like that, but I went on after that and continued and finished that inning, so everything was fine.

Q.  Eric, what have you been able to  -- during the first two games of the series  -- pick up about these A's hitters?  Is that what you are doing is paying attention to how to get these guys out?

ERIC MILTON:  I am just going to focus on keeping the ball down, Joe struggled the other day, I think he got some pitches up wasn't able to get ahead of the hitters, and it started with the first batter of the game so I want to come out firing strikes right off the bat and keeping the ball down in the zone because you get the ball up and make mistakes, these are great hitters and they are going to capitalize.

Q.  Which of the guys in this lineup is the toughest for you to face, in particular?

ERIC MILTON:  I think Tejada is a great hitter, no doubt, he got me earlier this year with a homerun here at the Metrodome, and obviously, Chavez.  They are two big powers.  But you can't  -- 1 through 9, you can't take a rest because it's going to be the playoffs and they are all going to be geared up, so it's going to be a tough game.

Q.  I was going to ask you, Joe Mays admitted that he was a little too fired up for his outing.  Is there anything you could take from that to kind of keep yourself from falling in that same trap tomorrow?

ERIC MILTON:  I don't know what to expect.  We will see in a few hours here, with the crowd today, I am glad I get to sit back and watch Rick Reed and see how this crowd is going to react and see what it's all about today because it's something new for me and most of the guys on the team.  It's going to be a whole different situation out there. 

Q.  Oakland went with the three-man rotation and when Gardy set it as a four-man how did you take it that you would be game 4?

ERIC MILTON:  I am just happy to get the opportunity we are all happy to be here and whatever I can do, it's either going to be the clinching game or to stay alive, so there is going to be a lot of pressure and I am looking forward to the opportunity and to the challenge.
