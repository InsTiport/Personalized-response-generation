 Q.  You made your career debut here last season; how ready are you for this moment coming into tomorrow?  
ANTONIO SENZATELA: I feel ready, just focused on the game, and just like any other game, just prepared for that game.   
 Q.  How much have you drawn from Freeland and Marquez and kind of their performances over the past couple days, and I guess the need to just carry the torch?  
ANTONIO SENZATELA: I definitely learned a lot.  We pushed each other as teammates, but the best thing that I can get out of their performance is just the way they compete.  They're just relentless competitors.  That's what I'm striving for.   
 Q.  As you were watching the game go on last night and your teammates, were you pretty confident that you were going to end up starting in Game one, or was it still up in the air at that point?  
ANTONIO SENZATELA: The biggest thing was to win that game last night.  It definitely crossed my mind, the possibility of starting tomorrow.  But it wasn't a priority.   
 Q.  Any thoughts on Christian Yelich and how to approach him, attack him, a guy who can hit for power and average?  
ANTONIO SENZATELA: Just got to throw quality pitches and compete.   
 Q.  Is this a team that you've really studied a lot these last couple days or since you found out you were starting, and how much do you know them, or do you have to study film or whatnot?  
ANTONIO SENZATELA: Yeah, we study them a lot.  I just got on my mind, keep making pitches, quality pitches, and compete for the team, give us a chance to win.
