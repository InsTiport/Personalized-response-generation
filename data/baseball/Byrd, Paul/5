 Q.  I just wondered if you thought it was more dangerous when a team kind of comes off the mat like the Yankees came back today after a deficit and could have been eliminated?  I think they're a more dangerous team now for you to finish tomorrow? 
 PAUL BYRD:  I think they can be.  I feel like we made a statement in Game 1, and I feel like they made a statement here tonight, especially being down 3-0.  Offense showed a lot of signs of life. 
 This game runs in cycles, so, yeah, I think they made a statement tonight. 

 Q.  Do you think experience-wise, Paul, how much are you looking forward to this start?  Obviously, the two big guns for you guys are who they were.  And people are wondering whether they'd bring one of those guys back on shorter rest.  Do you feel like you have something to prove in that situation? 
 PAUL BYRD:  I'm kind of like a little gun (smiling).  No, I'm just kidding.  Yeah, we had two Cy Young candidates and then Jake and myself.  I think Wedgie went with some match-ups.  I'm excited to get the start tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it. 
 A great atmosphere, great place to pitch.  And I'll be excited to take the mound, you know. 

 Q.  Did you have any concern that Wedge would come back with C.C. for Game 4? 
 PAUL BYRD:  Yeah, I mean, and if he did, I was fine with that, too.  That's his call.  We didn't know what the Yankees were going to do.  We didn't know what we were going to do.  But I'm excited that he gave me the ball.  I've got a little extra rest.  I feel good, arm feel goods.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow night, you know.  Great fans here.  Just overall great place to play. 
 So I'm real excited that he is giving me the ball.  I've wanted to pitch.  I would have been happy if we swept, but it didn't happen.  So I'm excited to take the ball for Game 4.
