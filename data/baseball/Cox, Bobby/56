Q.  When you lose the first game at home in a short series, what does that do to the chemistry in the clubhouse?
 
BOBBY COX:   Chemistry could not be any better.  It was awfully good in the last two innings.  Hit the ball really well today.  We really hit it good.  
 
Q.  Can you comment on Tom Glavine's performance today?
 
BOBBY COX:   I thought he had some of his best stuff today, I really did.  When he gets touched up a little bit, those types of hits, I thought the Giants did a pretty good job of hitting to the opposite field, and that was about it.  
 
Q.  Andruw Jones' catch on Bonds, did that turn any momentum for you? 
 
BOBBY COX:   I don't know.  That's not even a spectacular catch from him.  That's just a routine catch, and he's made a hundred better than that this season.  Yeah, any time you save a run, it's worth saving, that's for sure.  We had the runners on and the right guys coming up in that last inning and then made some good pitches to Shef. 
 
Q.  When Sheffield got the home run and got things started with your offense later, what did that do to your bench? 
 
BOBBY COX:   Same thing Glavine's base hit did, gets you going again.  Tommy had one of the bigger hits today.  
 
Q.  Hammond's physical status? 
 
BOBBY COX:   I'm not too sure right now.  He's having trouble turning his neck with any degree of easiness.  So not real sure about him.  
 
Q.  In a five-game series, how much more difficult does it make it when you lose the first one at home? 
 
BOBBY COX:   You try to put it out of your mind.  It's one game out of whack and that's the way you look at it whether you win it or not.  I'd rather win the first one, that's for sure.  But you've got another game tomorrow; you've got to win it. 
 
Q.  Once again, what's Hammond's status?
 
BOBBY COX:  I'm not sure about his status.  His neck is really stiff.  He's having trouble bending it in any direction.
