Q.  What was your impression of what Glavine went through tonight? 

BOBBY COX:   A little bit of what happened the other night.  They broke a couple of bats, but there was three or four balls hit good tonight.  Couldn't catch a break.  Break a bat and we couldn't catch the ball because the bat was flying, two pop-ups.  And really, his home run was the back-breaker.  We are still in the game, two outs.  And Tommy threw a lot of fastballs tonight, I thought.  Didn't change speeds as much. 

Q.  Do you think the fact that he pitched with three days' rest affected him today?

BOBBY COX:   No, not at all.  I'm not just saying that.  It didn't, at all.  He threw harder tonight than he has all year.  He's throwing a little bit too strong  -- I don't know if he didn't have the confidence in the changeup tonight, just didn't want to throw it because the fastball was so quick.  He just kept missing by a couple of inches, and all of his pitches inside and outside, just off the plate. 

Q.  How did you tell your team to approach against Livan Hernandez having faced him in big games before?

BOBBY COX:   We are going to try to make him throw strikes.  First inning we hit three bullets right at him and after that we didn't do much.  We hit some ball good later on, but first inning, we could have got him a little bit.  Livan is hard to hit at.  He's got so many different angles to come at you, he can hit the black from the outside.  He's sneaky-quick.  He's got the slow breaking ball, the quick one and he's a great athlete.  He can field his position and do a lot of things.  He's a tough guy.  He was on tonight. 

Q.  You have a make-or-break game tomorrow.  Do you throw everybody but the kitchen sink at them no matter what?

BOBBY COX:   I think both clubs will do exactly the same thing.  If that's what it takes to get one win, that's what we will try. 

Q.  You mentioned one time back in 1997 Livan Hernandez got a rather wide strike zone.  Did you think he was getting any breaks tonight?

BOBBY COX:   I can guarantee you, he did not get one break all night long.  He pitched, good.
