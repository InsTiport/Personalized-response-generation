Q.  What did Kerry Wood show you tonight?

BOBBY COX: That he's a good hitter, and he won the ballgame.  We hit the ball pretty good, but he threw good.  So did Russ.  He made within bad pitch to Kerry and it cost him the ballgame.

Q.  When it left the bases loaded, how much did that take out of your pitcher?

BOBBY COX: Nothing.  They left the bases loaded too, a couple times.

Q.  When he threw a lot of pitches?

BOBBY COX: He was strong as an ox.  He could actually have thrown 160 pitches tonight. 

Q.  How much did the error hurt your team?

BOBBY COX: It was an error.  We got one on the play.  I'm not sure we could have got a double-play, anyhow. 

Q.  Did that affect your pitcher?

BOBBY COX: It better not.  We're all grown ups.  I don't think so. 

Q.  Even though you're down one game, do you still feel good about your chances?

BOBBY COX: I do feel good about our chances.  We have good pitches and we have good hitting too.  The ball's got to bounce your way and maybe the next night it will.

Q.  Were you surprised at the pro-Cubs atmosphere from the crowd?

BOBBY COX: We had plenty of fans too.  It's always that way here.  We go on the road and it's always that way too in certain cities.
