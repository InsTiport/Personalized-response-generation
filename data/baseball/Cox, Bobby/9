 KATY FEENEY: Questions for Bobby Cox.  
  
  Q. Bobby, how is Billy?   
 BOBBY COX: We're not going to write him off yet. I think he's probably done for this series for sure. We're not sure. It's an oblique. He did it on Edgar's bunt. And for Billy to come off the mound, it had to be hurtin' pretty bad. Obliques general take a while.   
  
  Q. What did you see on that play at first base that made you so upset?   
 BOBBY COX: I thought he was way off the bag at least 6, 8 inches. And he calls him safe, Ankiel gets a base hit, Hanson bunts him over, and Infante, 3-2 game, maybe.   
 But I honestly wasn't going to talk about it if we had gotten beat. It's umpires' judgments and they make great calls and they miss them once in a while. I thought he was off the bag from the dugout.   
  
  Q. Was there any spillover because it was the same guy --  
 BOBBY COX: Well, I brought that up. The only run that scored last night, he was out. But still I respect the umpires, and they're human. So am I. And I'm not always right.   
  
  Q. Bobby, what were you thinking watching there with Glaus at third base when he fields the ball and throws to second to start the double play?   
 BOBBY COX: I thought he did a good job of it, and I was -- you know, I was around. I was proud of Troy. He hadn't played in a long time, and he made a nice play. And they turned a real tough double play.   
  
  Q. I was going to ask about Ankiel, you know he has that power. He's done it a couple of times --  
 BOBBY COX: You know, I talked to Ned Yost when we got him. He said, "He can carry your club for a period of time," and we've been waiting for that. And he had a great night tonight defensively and offensively, and he's got tremendous power. If you watch your batting practices, he's the one hittin' them all out of the ballpark.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the job your bullpen did?   
 BOBBY COX: Bullpen, again, two nights in a row, we've been absolutely perfect. Tommy Hanson deserved better. He made one bad pitch and Pat Burrell has been really good. He missed by about 10 inches and that's right in Pat's wheelhouse. And he had great stuff tonight. Fed pitched 8 innings. He would have struck out 8, 10 batters.   
  
  Q. Bobby, you got a win to go home 1-1. You're down 4-0, and you come back and win the game. Can you give us perspective on baseball and this game for you?   
 BOBBY COX: You can never figure out baseball for sure. But I was telling our guys before the game, you know, win this one, the momentum swings the other way.   
 And it's a great club to manage. There is no problems on this club. They're always hustling. They're working out. They give you everything they've got. We're not the most talented club in the major leagues, but hard work and trying, dedication, we got to be at the top.   
  
  Q. Now that you know there is a Game 4 in the series and it's wide open, when are you going to decide what you're going to do for a pitcher Monday?   
 BOBBY COX: I'm leaning right now to Derek. I think he only threw 88 pitches, and he's been politicing before this series started, and he's good on 3. He didn't throw a lot of pitches, he didn't labor. And right now, I would lean toward him. Subject to change, but I don't know what.   
 KATY FEENEY: Thanks, Bobby.
