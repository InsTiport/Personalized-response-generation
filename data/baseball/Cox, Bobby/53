Q.  Is this ballpark any advantage to you or the Giants, considering the strong pitching on both teams? 
 
BOBBY COX:   I really can't answer that.  I really don't know.  I do know left field is going to play real tough tomorrow with the sun track for starting at 1 o'clock.  It's going to be tough, I think, from probably the third inning on.  We took a lot of fly balls out there today, Chipper and some of the coaches, some of the balls were uncatchable because of that.  It's going to be tough for us, we have not played in that type of field, maybe the left fielders are more used to it; I'm not sure.  We worked at it today but it's going to be difficult.  It's a big park in areas where you can tag up from second and go to third, tag up from first and go to second and stuff like that, and we know about that; that the Giants do it very well. 
 
Q.  How is Hammond? 
 
BOBBY COX:   A lot better today.  He should be, I think, game-ready by tomorrow.  Hopefully, we have our fingers crossed.  He's improved quite a bit.  Not nearly 100%, but by tomorrow he should be able to pitch. 
 
Q.  What are the differences you see in Jason Schmidt since he was with you? 
 
BOBBY COX:   You know, we only see him occasionally any more, with the way the schedule is set up.  We may only get to see him once a year.  The times I've seen him on TV, and we faced him once already this year, he's throwing great.  He's a pitcher that throws hard.  I think he's got good command, locates well, and one of the better pitchers in the league, for me.  He's had occasional arm problems throughout his career, but not a lot of differences.  He was a good pitcher for us.  A lot younger.  Of course, you get better with maturity and the more games you pitch, the more you learn.  He's a standout pitcher. 
 
Q.  Have you officially announced a Game  4 starter? 
 
BOBBY COX:   Glavine.  You know, he and Millwood both only threw like 70 pitches, so they are more than good to go on three days' rest.  
 
Q.  Do you have a very different approach with Maddux, in terms of pitch count since he won't be pitching again this round?
 
BOBBY COX:   No.  Not at all.  Whenever Greg feels he's had, he had it.  It may be after 55 pitches or 110.  It just depends on that particular day.  I expect Greg to throw a good ballgame.  He's ready.  His finger is a lot better.  He's been pitching really well.  He's really been on a good roll.  
 
Q.  Do you think that Greg Maddux is fresher this time of the year than he has been in the past, since he's under 200 innings this year?
 
BOBBY COX:   Good question.  Could be.  I don't really know that.  He's pitched really well the last few months.  He's really thrown the ball super good.  His arm has never felt better, I can tell you that.  
 
Q.  You had so many good teams; what is the unique aspect about this one? 
 
BOBBY COX:   Certain areas of our defense is really, really good.  The bullpen, we really don't know what we had going into spring training.  We knew we were going to close with Smoltz, and Remlinger who has been a workhorse for us and been a big part of our success the last three or four years.  After that, we were kind of, you know, see who can make the team.  It turns out some guys that had been out of baseball had made the team and pitched extremely well for us.  I think we led the League in bullpen ERA, or close to it.  But it's a very good bullpen.  We can hit the ball.  When everybody is clicking, we can put runs on the board.  Furcal is a unique shortstop, too.  He gets to so many balls shortstops don't get and he's got that throwing arm; you're out.  We all played a little bit  -- we made some errors earlier on when the season opened, but after the first two or three weeks, I think Furcal is the best defensive shortstop in the game; he played that well.  
 
Q.  How long has it been since Javy started a game pitched by Greg Maddux and how difficult is it to pull his bat out of the lineup, hitting as he has been?
 
BOBBY COX:   I can't recall when he last caught him, and it's not tough at all because I like Blanco as a hitter, too.  He hit better than Javy most of the season to be honest with you.  Javy has been hot lately, but Henry is the best defensive catcher, too.  He helps Maddux throw runners outs.  People like to steal off him and Henry can help stop that.  But it's not a hard decision.  It's very simple.  Real easy. 
 
Q.  This is not a park that has a reputation for being exceptionally loud.  Do you think the fans will be a factor this weekend? 
 
BOBBY COX:   You know, this is  -- they are setting a great tradition out here with this new ballpark, and Dusty's tenure here and Barry's.  I think the fans can help the club.  Sometimes you help the other team, too, just to have some noise.  It's energizing for both teams.
