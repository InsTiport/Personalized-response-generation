Q.  Was 88 or 90 pitches all you were expecting to get from Schilling?  Was it an easy decision to take him out? 
 
BOB BRENLY:   Yeah, it was an easy decision to take him out, considering he was starting on three days' rest.  We had a lead and we insisted all along we would go to BK (Kim) for two innings if necessary and try to close the game out, just didn't work out that way.  That was a tremendous outing by Curt Schilling tonight. 
 
Q.  When you look at this game, can you go back to early missed opportunities, maybe theoretically forgotten but you don't forget them?
 
BOB BRENLY:   Clearly we had a lot of chances to score early in the ballgame.  We had runners on base seemingly every inning.  We had Hernandez on the ropes several times.  Just could not come up, a couple double plays and could got get some rallies.  Certainly, if we cash in, we win the ballgame but didn't happen. 
 
Q.  Kim for the 10th, was that something that you talked about, in terms of going a third inning with him?
 
BOB BRENLY:   We had not talked about it before the ballgame, but BK throws every day, he throws a lot of pitches every day.  It wasn't really pushing him beyond what he can do.  
 
Q.  How much was game 7 in your mind with regard to taking Curt out early?  Or what he did?
 
BOB BRENLY:   Certainly that, entered into it somewhat.  But once again, we had a lead, we had six outs left to go in the ballgame, and that's the way we hoped it would work out.  Unfortunately, it didn't.
