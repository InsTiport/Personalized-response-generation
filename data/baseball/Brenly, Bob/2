Q.  In the ninth, why not Durazo? 

BOB BRENLY:  We'd anticipated Tony was going to bring Isringhausen into the game.  We were saving Durazo for a later spot in the inning, if it got to that.  Let's just put it that way. 

Q.  Neither of your aces came out of here with a win.  How tough is that?

BOB BRENLY:  It's tough.  It means you're in an 0-2 hole going back to their ballpark.  It's probably the understatement of the season that our work is cut out for us now. 

Q.  When you took Schill out, was that just for the bat?

BOB BRENLY:  He expended an awful lot of energy to get out of that jam.  The strike-out of Jim Edmonds put him at 97 pitches on the ballgame.  You know, we had to score at that point.  Schill does a lot of things well; hitting home runs is not one of them. 

Q.  When you talked to Alex about that play, did he think Scott was not going to charge as hard?  What did he say to you?

BOB BRENLY:  It was an instinctive play.  He read the ball off the bat.  I think he thought it was hit a little bit harder than it was.  When Rolen came into the baseline to field it, he tried his best to get out of the way, but unfortunately made contact.  Just one of those things that happens. 

Q.  Thoughts on leaving Koplove in in the ninth?

BOB BRENLY:  Pitcher's spot due up the next inning.  At that point if we decide to go to another pitcher, most notably BK, we would have to make a double switch in the lineup.  I mean, I guess we could have done it.  Koplove was throwing the ball well.  I felt comfortable with him starting the ninth inning, with Myers and BK available, should anything happen in the ninth. 

Q.  Would you talk about Curt's performance tonight?

BOB BRENLY:  It's exactly what we expected from Curt Schilling.  You got to tip your cap to JD Drew, that was not your typical hanging home run pitch.  It was a fast ball over the plate, down below the knees.  It was a real nice piece of hitting on Drew's part to get it.  Other than, that I thought Schill was tremendous.  He did exactly what we needed him to do.  Offensively we couldn't get anything going against Chuck Finley. 

Q.  How did you feel your hitters approached Finley today? 

BOB BRENLY:  I thought we did all right.  We had some good at-bats against him.  He had a real good split-finger working for part of the game today.  Got a lot of swinging strikes on pitches that were in the dirt.  Probably looked bad from the stands.  From our level, those were nasty pitches.  Matty hit the ball well, Colby hit the ball well today.  Hit a lot of balls hard.  Unfortunately for us, hit them to the big part of the park. 

Q.  Obviously, the toughest situation you've been in all year.  What will you tell your team?

BOB BRENLY:  The same thing I would have told them if we won this game.  Tell them to show up Saturday and be ready to play.  That's all you can do.  There's no pep talks, there's no magic words that are going to suddenly make everything okay.  You just keep grinding.  You keep playing the game.  You keep doing the things you've been successful doing and hope for the best.
