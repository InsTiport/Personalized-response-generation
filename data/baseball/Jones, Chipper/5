 Q. (Question regarding injury).
 CHIPPER JONES: A couple dozen of these in the course of my career, I would probably be a lot more cautious. But I know that it was, you know, a mild strain and, you know, a couple days of treatments with the ultrasound, doing exercises, stuff like that, really helped. 
 You know, so still got two more days till Saturday.
