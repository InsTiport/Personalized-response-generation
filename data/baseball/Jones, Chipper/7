 Q. You got two days off. Does it look like more than that for you?
 CHIPPER JONES: I'm hoping not. I'll probably -- I won't do a thing tomorrow, maybe test it out on Tuesday during our workout, and, you know, I'll just have to wait and see.

 Q. Critics of the tournament bring up injuries, things like this that happen, obviously. You came in here knowing a risk like that could happen at any point. This doesn't make you second guess anything?
 CHIPPER JONES: I would have done it in Kissmmee, Florida, today, I guarantee. Because I got a good pitch to hit and tried to come out of my shoes to hit it. And I'm a switch-hitter, it's something that's happened to me dozens of times. And, you know, just happened tonight. Hopefully, it will just be a couple days and get back in.

 Q. (No microphone)?
 CHIPPER JONES: Got a great crew of guys. They're excited to be playing together, and we feel like we've got something to prove.

 Q. Is there any lead on the team?
 CHIPPER JONES: Not really. We just got a bunch of individual guys who have their individual roles. I mean, a lot of people probably point to the guys who were there in '06, as the leaders on the club, but we got some other guys that are doing a great job. You know, whether it's keeping the clubhouse mood light or giving motivational speech.
