Q. Luis, you got down the line pretty quickly on one of the plays in the first game. Are you feeling really good? Are you operating on adrenaline, a little bit of both? How are you feeling now compared to where you were a week ago?
LUIS ARRAEZ: I feel good overall. Those are things that happen in the game, and I didn't feel anything bothering me when I was going down the line.
Q. Luis, did you -- what was playing in that stadium like for you as a rookie? Very intense. Did you have any jitters at all? And if you did, are they gone?
LUIS ARRAEZ: More excited than nervous. I wasn't nervous at all. I'll compare it something like playing in Venezuela. I think playing winter ball in Venezuela, I'd say, is little more difficult than playing here when it comes to fans and playing in that environment, too.
Q. Luis, when it happened last week, when you ran into ^ Willians as you're going off the field, did you think your season was over at that point?
LUIS ARRAEZ: Yeah, I thought my season was over back then, but there is a God up there looking down to protect me, and I think I worked really hard on my legs lately, and I'm ready.
