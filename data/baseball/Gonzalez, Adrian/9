 Q.   Just talk about the home run.   Were you looking for a changeup first?  
ADRIAN GONZALEZ:   Yeah, it was just a situation like that, two out, nobody on, I figured he was going to pitch me tough.   My best chance was to get something off speed for a strike.   I was able to get a first pitch and just able to put a good swing on it.   
   
 Q.   All season guys in the lineup have pitched in.   Tonight you hit the home run, but a lot of their guys, what's it been like just next man up all season for you guys?  
ADRIAN GONZALEZ:   Yeah, we have a lineup that's deep.   We work the count well.   So when we're at our best, that's what we're doing it as a whole.   I think that's our game plan for the entire postseason is to do it as a whole, and nobody go out there and try to do too much with anything.   
   
 Q.   In a five‑game series just talk about not only winning the first game but winning the first game on the road, the importance of that.   
ADRIAN GONZALEZ:   It's huge.   First game, like you said, it's huge in a five‑game series, definitely put a lot of pressure on the other team there, and it's real big for sure.   That's a definite.
