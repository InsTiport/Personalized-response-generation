 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jorge Posada. _

 Q. Jorge, it's been awhile since you guys got out in the first round the playoffs. What does it mean to you to be able to accomplish this?_
 JORGE POSADA: You know what, it's a lot of hard work, a lot of good things we have done this series. I think we played the same way we have been playing the whole regular season. I think pitching is just so important when it comes to a series like this. _You know, you show what Andy was able to do today, CC and Burnett, so it just changes the page. You are talking about pitching, pitching, pitching, but once you see it, then you understand why pitching is so important, especially now._

 Q. Jorge, how would you describe your emotions and your feelings for this whole series, starting with not starting in game 2 to tonight, hitting the homerun and you guys advancing?_
 JORGE POSADA: You know what, we won Game 2, and I knew that I wasn't going to play in Game2. Really, it doesn't change the way I thought or think throughout the moves. I came with the same attitude. _I knew I was some way I was going to play probably in Game2, and I was going to prepare in Game 2 if I was going to pinch hitch or go behind the plate. I don't change the way I think. So I am happy that I was there and we got it done today._

 Q. Jorge, can you describe the way the play at third base unfolded from your perspective, what you saw. _
 JORGE POSADA: I saw Kubel, the way he was running, after the ball was hit, it looked like he thought the ball was going to go through, as soon as Derek catches up, I just hope he kept going because we have a pretty good shot to get him at the plate, and I think he just passed the coach and he couldn't get back to third base. But if he keeps coming home, he is out, and after Derek catches it, he had to stay at third base._

 Q. Can you compare how it feels right now to be going into the second round versus how you were feeling last year at this time?_
 JORGE POSADA: Last year I was sitting around home and not really enjoying myself too much. You know, working hard to get back, doing training, so it's a little different now. I am excited, I am excited that I got a chance, and my shoulder was again feeling like it's supposed to. It took a lot to be here._

 Q. Jorge, your thoughts on Carl Pavano, how he threw and how you guys were able to get to him. _
 JORGE POSADA: He is good, he makes his pitches real, real well, he had a very good slider to right, very good changeup, kept us off balance. He was tough, tell you the truth, he was tough. He pitched, he pitched real well. You know, you got to give a lot of credit to him because he kept us and they kept it close to win the game. That's what you ask for._

 Q. Jorge, follow up on Pavano. Considering how poorly he pitched for the Yankees, what was going through your mind as he was shutting you guys down for the first six innings?_
 JORGE POSADA: You know, you just hope you get better atbats, but you got to give him a lot of credit, he did a lot of things well, and pitched real well against us today._

 Q. You were on both the teams that lost to the Angels in the fivegame series. How do you feel going into this one? What do you think the differences might be, how they play in the sevengame series?_
 JORGE POSADA: Like you say, we got a sevengame series against them. Again, it's going to come down who is going to pitch best, who is going to hit in the clutch. You know, home field advantage is going to help a little bit. I think that's the key to this series, having four games at home is going to change._THE MODERATOR: Jorge, thank you very much. Appreciate it. _
