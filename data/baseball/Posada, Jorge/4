Q.  Seeing that the win/loss ratio on the pitchers on the Yankees are a lot more better than the win/loss ratio for the pitchers on Minnesota does that give you an advantage in the series even though it's a short series? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   It doesn't matter what you do in the regular season.  When it comes down to it, every pitch in the playoffs counts.  Every hitter is important.  You know, you've just got to bear down and make sure that the pitch is supposed to be at the location it's supposed to be, and you've got to make sure that the pitch is the right one for that particular batter. 
 
Q.  You haven't seen much of Johan Santana, but what you have seen of him, what do you think? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   You know, obviously he doesn't get scared.  That's why he's throwing the first game.  He has come down the stretch for them big time.  They needed an extra pitcher and he has stepped up.  I tell you, he's looking forward to his start.  I don't know much about him.  We haven't seen him much, but to me, it looks like he's ready.  He doesn't get scared.  
 
Q.  During the team's World Series run, much was made of the leadership and experience in the clubhouse, does this team have the leadership that that group had, and who are the guys that are providing it?
 
JORGE POSADA:   We're going to find out.  We have no idea till we win something.  Obviously the clubhouse is full of veterans, full of guys that want to contribute, but this is the time that we all have got to step up.  We're going to find out.  
 
Q.  How do you pitch against the Twins, the way they utilize their speed, is there any different approach that you have with pitchers, or do you try to work with pitchers? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   They are a fastball-hitting team.  We all know that.  We've just got to bear down.  That doesn't mean we're not going to throw any fastballs.  That means that we've got to  make sure, like I said earlier, the pitchers are in the location that they are supposed to be and make sure that the pitchers are in the right spot at the right time.  We've got a bunch of veteran pitchers that know what to do, and I think that's the advantage.  
 
Q.  You spoke very emotionally after the series last year against Anaheim.  How much is that still eating you at this time as you get into this first one, and can you use that somehow? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   I think that's said and done.  I said some things, obviously, that upset a al couple of guys.  But it's the way I felt after a loss.  I was very angry.  I was even angry at myself.  You just can't take a loss like we took at that particular time, in Anaheim.  I was very disappointed and I kind of said something that I wish I could take back.  It's just, whatever.  But that's the way I felt.  Hopefully we can build from that day and try to be more focused.  
 
Q.  Is that still something that you're thinking about even before you start the series?
 
JORGE POSADA:   No, not at all.  I think we understand what we have to do here, and it starts tomorrow.  
 
Q.  It's been awhile since you've faced the Twins, and obviously whatever strategy you had then worked pretty well, also with what you had last year, is your strategy pretty much going to be the same as when you played the Twins early on in the season? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   No.  I wouldn't say so.  I think that team has changed a little bit.  They have got some key guys that are hot and they weren't hot back then.  We were playing good, we were playing very good baseball, and it just happened to be at the right time we were playing.  We started real hot.  It's different now.  It's just a different kind of ballgame.  It's a different atmosphere.  It changes a lot of things.  One pitch can win the whole series.  
 
Q.  You had a real strong finish, a real burst of offense during the latter part of the season here; do you contribute that to anything that you've changed in your approach at the plate? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   You know what, I haven't  -- I didn't change much during the years that I've been here.  I try to adjust a little better.  I try to not  -- hopefully not throw at-bats away, and make every one, every at-bat count, and I think that's the difference.  
 
Q.  Post-season in the Metrodome, with a roof and Astroturf; do you take your game differently? 
 
JORGE POSADA:   No.  I think the game doesn't change.  I think we try to do the same thing here and there.  Obviously, it's going to be a lot faster over there. But, you know the game really doesn't change.  I think the most important thing is our infielders and outfielders have to be a little quicker on balls hit.
