  Q. How satisfying is it to turn a performance like this under these circumstances?  
 JOE BLANTON: You know, it's awesome. I mean, all the credit really goes to the offense, though. Jimmy came out of the gates and really set the tone. You know, really gave us some momentum early.   
 Then later Pat came through with the big blow. That's huge. That really gives you a lot of confidence pitching to go out and attack the zone and feel a little more comfortable.   
  
  Q. What were you doing out there? The Brewers got the lead-off hitter on, two innings in a row, and at that point you just seemed to shut them down. What were you doing that was keeping the hitters off balance the whole day?  
 JOE BLANTON: Just trying to attack the zone. Ruiz did a great job of calling the game today. We got in a great rhythm early, and I really tried not to change anything once runners got on because it was working when nobody was on.   
 So I just kept trying to attack the zone and hopefully good things would happen, and I was fortunate enough where they did.   
  
  Q. Do you think that you still had anything to prove to Philadelphia people today, to the fans, going into today's game?  
 JOE BLANTON: No. I mean, I guess -- I don't know, I didn't really think about it. I haven't thought about it. I just go out and play the game the best I can every time, every fifth day or whatever it is, every start, and try to give the team a chance to win. That's my main focus is just helping us in any way I can.
