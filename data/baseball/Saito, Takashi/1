   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Takashi Saito.

 Q. How physically prepared are you to go? 
 TAKASHI SAITO: I am not only physically prepared, but I am mentally prepared as well.

 Q. The fact that you're going to be on the roster comes at the expense of your friend, Billy Wagner. Can you describe a little bit of your feelings about Billy being out now and you being in? 
 TAKASHI SAITO: I feel bad for Billy, but I just have to be ready for whatever comes my way.

 Q. I know your bullpen before you left you were not that pleased with. Bobby said in Florida you were happier with how you threw the ball. Can you describe the change that went on there? 
 TAKASHI SAITO: The bullpen actually threw in San Francisco, I really felt good there. And also the one in Florida I felt really good as well.

 Q. How much of a thrill is it to be here knowing that you were, you know, not -- knowing that you were omitted from the roster to begin with? 
 TAKASHI SAITO: To me, it's being able to pitch in the regular season, postseason, just in the Major Leagues in general is a thrill.
