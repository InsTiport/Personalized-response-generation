Q.  You're the ninth-place hitter.  Would you like to bat higher or does it matter? 
 
RAMON HERNANDEZ:   To me, it doesn't matter.  Wherever I get, I get in the lineup every day.  
 

Q.  Talk about the game-winning double.  You had a 3-1 pitch and finally got something to hit? 
 
RAMON HERNANDEZ:   You know, the count was 3 and 1 and I was looking at a fastball right over close to the plate, what I wanted, and I think he threw it left-to-right, in the middle and I just took advantage, I hit it and got it down the right field line.  
 

Q.  You were saying that this is your first playoff game ever.  What was the atmosphere like?  Were you able to keep relaxed and cool? 
 
RAMON HERNANDEZ:   Yes, I was happy excited, a bit excited.  It's like a dream coming true.  It is my first season in the big leagues, full season and just living this right now, we're in the playoffs.  It's unbelievable for me.  So I just trying to be as relaxed as I could and thinking about just another game like the regular season, I guess.
