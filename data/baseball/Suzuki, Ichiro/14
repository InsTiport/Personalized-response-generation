Q.  You mentioned before the game that you did not know all that much about U.S. baseball.  After this All-Star Game, do you think that you have a good appreciation of U.S. baseball culture? 

ICHIRO SUZUKI:   Well, first of all, I've watched a lot of All-Star Games on TV and I cannot feel it, but today, being in the game, I got a lot of feeling with the whole of my body.  I got a feeling of it, and that's what it is. 

Q.  Could you take us through your at-bat with Randy Johnson where you got the single and legged it out, and did you know that you had a chance to do it when you saw him fall off to the third-base side of the mound? 

ICHIRO SUZUKI:   Well, first of all, I'm very honored to face Randy in an All-Star Game, rather than the fact that I got a base hit off of him.  Randy is a great pitcher, and he was a Mariner and he wore a number 51 before me.  One of the things I always keep in my mind is to keep this number 51 with good dignity.  And I play with the Mariners with number 51 with good dignity, because I inherited good things from Randy with the number 51. 

Q.  Can you share your thoughts with us on the great play by Cal Ripken, Jr. essentially closing out his career with an All-Star home run tonight? 

ICHIRO SUZUKI:   Well, I'm very happy to see that Cal Ripken hit the home run in his final All-Star Game.  At the same time, I'm very honored to be on the field with him.  I could say the same thing about Tony Gwynn, but I'm very honored to be on the field with Cal Ripken, Jr.  I'm very honored to be in the same lineup with Cal Ripken, Jr.  I'm very happy about that. 

Q.  I just want to know your thoughts on your popularity, not just among fans, but the players and coaches who seemed very anxious to meet you.

ICHIRO SUZUKI:  Well, I really don't know  -- the popularity things, I don't know, what can I say.  But I'm very thankful and appreciate the fans who elected me with their votes.  And, also, my teammates, American League teammates, have welcomed me, opened their arms, and they have been very friendly the last couple days.  I appreciate they give me the opportunity, and to be part of them and I appreciate that I got this opportunity to be with them. 

Q.  How did you enjoy playing centerfield, and would you like to play centerfield during the regular season with your team? 

ICHIRO SUZUKI:   Well, I haven't played centerfield for a long time.  I'm glad that none of the fly balls came to me.  I probably need a little more practice to be a centerfielder during the season.
