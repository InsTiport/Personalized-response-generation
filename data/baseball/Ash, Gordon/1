 Q.  Tell us about Butler? 
 GORDON ASH:  Sure, Butler is an excellent young outfielder, can play all three probably better in the corner than center, currently playing in Venezuela.  One of our most difficult decisions in our protected lists, we had the three young outfielders and Cruz, Green and Stewart, and felt since we couldn't project Rich higher than a 4th outfielder for the coming season that we would expose him.  And I knew very early on in my discussions with Tampa Bay that it looked as though they were going to take him. 

 Q.  Are you expecting a flurry of activity after this draft, a lot of big trades? 
 GORDON ASH:  Yes, sir.  Are the Blue Jays involved, no, we're not, yet. 

 Q.  Can you talk about Butler as a player? 
 GORDON ASH:  Yeah, he has all around tools. He's a Canadian from Toronto, actually.  His brother played in the Big Leagues, as well, with us in Philadelphia, has a little more power than his brother, he has power potential, but an average runner, a good  defensive player.  He should have been a TripleâA All Star, he had a great season in Syracuse, 20 stolen bases, 20 homeruns.  A good allâaround player, no one tool stands out, but he doesn't have any glaring deficiencies, either.
