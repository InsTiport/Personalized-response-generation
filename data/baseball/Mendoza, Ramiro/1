Q.  After not playing in last year's playoffs, how satisfying is it to come in this year and have the effect that you have had on the team? 
 
RAMIRO MENDOZA (Through Leo Astacio):   I didn't play in last year's playoffs because of my injury, but I'm very happy I'm able to play in this year's playoffs and help my team and I'm also very proud to be pitching here in New York.  
 

Q.  Can you define your role now?  You've been long, you've been short, you're kind of in that slot of getting them too Mariano; what do you like best and can you define if I'm right or wrong? 
 
RAMIRO MENDOZA (Through Leo Astacio):   I'm happy that they have confidence in me to pitch me long or short relief and help to get to Mariano (Rivera), who has thrown a lot of innings.  I'm proud that I can help the team. 
 

Q.  How concerned were you about the shoulder in September and whether it would keep you out? 
 
RAMIRO MENDOZA (Through Leo Astacio):   I wasn't worried about my shoulder.  I worked hard all off-season in Tampa so that my arm could be strong and thankfully it is and I'm just going to try to continue to do my job.  
 

Q.  The games have been tight lately and the relievers have played a very important part in the game; is it going to continue to be that way? 
 
RAMIRO MENDOZA (Through Leo Astacio):   The relievers are doing their job, Mariano, Stanton and everyone else in the bullpen.  Same for the starters.  We are just going to try to continue to do our job and see if we can get to the World Series.
