Oregon   3
  Tennessee   1

THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Oregon Head Coach Mike White, student‑athletes Kailee Cuico and Jessica Moore.   Coach, an opening comment.
COACH WHITE:   Well, it's great to get a win.   I know it took us three years to get our first Super Regional win, so getting a win here after our second game in the College World Series meant a lot to the ladies.   And they've worked, definitely, very hard.
We played a very class team in the Tennessee.   The Weeklys run a great organization.   Knew it'd be a tough game.   They had a couple of good pitchers.   They've got some players that can really make something happen in a hurry. 
I thought Jess did a great job of neutralizing them when we couldn't turn a couple of double plays, which were big in the context of the game.
So I thought we played a very, very good game out there today.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Jessica, can you just talk about how you pitched today and, after the second inning, how you were just pretty much able to dominate the Volunteers lineup?
JESSICA MOORE:   I just got ahead early for the most part, just kind of just went at them.   I was going to make them beat me. 
And lately I've been getting myself into trouble, so I was able to keep my pitch count and stay on, and the defense worked great for me today.   So I think that's kind of how I was able to be so dominant today.

Q.   Jessica, just reading your comments after that first loss to Arizona State, they're pretty combative.   Sounded like it was kind of a circle‑the‑wagons, Oregon‑against‑the‑world.   Can you just talk about that mindset and how that played into today with you all jumping into a quick lead and you dominating on the mound?
JESSICA MOORE:   Again, I think we decided we're going to have to make the games unquestionable.   We're going to go out and hit the ball.   And Pappas did a great job with that lead‑off home run, and I think that just got our wheels turning.
And I was able to go out there and just throw the ball, get groundouts.   And defense did great, and just we made the game unquestionable.
We didn't put ourselves into times where the umpire could potentially make a tough call and us not be able to get that break.

Q.   Kailee, how anxious were you to get back into the game today?   And then take us through your first at‑bat. 
KAILEE CUICO:   I was just really excited just to be back out there with all my teammates.   Once I was out there, it was just like another game. 
Sitting out was really hard just to watch all of them play without me.   But they picked me up really well in Texas, and even, yeah, the first game here, they played well. 
But, I mean, I was just happy to be back out there, and I kept it simple for the most part because of all the hype and stuff.
But I talked to Coach Dodd, and she kind of helped me stay calm about everything and just keeping the game simple and just playing it right.
COACH WHITE:   She wasn't as excited as I was.

Q.   Coach, can you describe what is the lineup like with Kailee in it and with her not in it?   What's the biggest difference?
COACH WHITE:   Well, I think if you said to anybody they're going to get the leading RBI hitter and four hitter taken out of the lineup, they'd say we're going to be in trouble.
So just having her back there gives us a little more confidence, less pressure on some of the other hitters.   So that's a big plus.   And plus she's a good defensive first baseman.   She's played a lot out there where Christie is and played too much at first base.

Q.   Coach, at some point in the postseason, I read an article about the facilities that Oregon has.   Oregon's known for fabulous facilities and great funding.   And yet, from what I read, your field's pretty poor.   Are you hoping that maybe this appearance could draw some attention to your program and maybe get some money pointed towards the softball facilities at Oregon?
COACH WHITE:   Yeah, it's a glaring fact that we're probably the last program to get an update, but there's some political issues there as far as campus.   Some issues with Mac Court, which is the old basketball building.   That's holding a lot of things up.
Once Campus makes a decision on that, because it's no longer Oregon athletics that owns that building, it's Campus, they need to make a decision and find the money to fund everything, and then either we stay or we get moved. 
So it's kind of like a Catch‑22.   It's very hard to make a decision for us to move. 
But our administration is very, very aware of the fact that we need a new facility.   We will get a new facility it's just a matter of time.

Q.   Kailee and Jessica, have California tonight at 8:30 or whatever time it is, I forgot.   What do you want to be able to see out of your team as they try to keep their postseason running?
KAILEE CUICO:   I think mostly we need to just stay loose, and we play really well when we're just having fun and we're playing our game.   At practice, hitting the ball hard and making a lot of plays, and I think today in this game, we played really loose.   Defense ended up being really tight.   That sounds really opposite.
But I think when we have fun and we swing the bat, play catch, keep it simple, we do really well.
JESSICA MOORE:   Just like Kailee said, we have to stay loose.   And at this point, like the coaches have told us, we really have nothing to lose.   People are going out here and expecting us just to be happy to be here, but that's not the way we want to play. 
We want to come out and put a lot of runs up on the board and go right at people, and just keep showing people that we're here to compete.   And we're here to get to that final series.   So I think, again, like Kai said, just gotta stay loose and go one inning at a time.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
