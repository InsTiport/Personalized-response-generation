 Q. This is a significant event, there are three third basemen in the American League
lineup?
 
 CAL RIPKEN: That could be one of the reasons, yes. We're all interchangeable here, I
guess, or all replaceable. I don't know. 
 
Q. How about the ball in the fourth inning, the double that would have been a home run
for another inch?
 
 CAL RIPKEN: Well, I expected the ball to kind of curve away. Maybe it's the light air
here in Colorado. The ball kind of stayed straight. 
 
Q. I have to ask, Joe and Bob were talking about this earlier in the game, talking
about the prospect of you resting at some point in the season. Both of them saying that's
your call, your decision, it's all up to you. We'll just put it out to you. What are your
thoughts on it?
 
 CAL RIPKEN: You can really overanalyze and really overevaluate the streak any way you
want. 
 
Q. We sportscasters can do that?
 
 CAL RIPKENN: Fans, anybody can do that. The basic thing, it's a very simple approach.
Every day third baseman, come to the ballpark every single day to play. I come out there
to get the job done. Sometimes if your performance is down, I'd rather have people talk
about your performance than the streak. Taking a day off is not going to help your
performance. Actually, working hard and correcting your hitting will correct your
performance. Usually the streak talk comes up when I'm not quite hitting like I normally
do. That's where I am right now. It's a manageable thing.
