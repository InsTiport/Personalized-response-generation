Q.  Do you think if a pitcher intentionally walks you, is he being smart, or is he being  -- is he not being brave? 
 
BARRY BONDS:  Next question.  
 
Q.  Does that mean you're not going to answer that? 
 
BARRY BONDS:  No.  
 
Q.  Speaking to some of the Angels and some of your teammates, I don't know if they used the word "nervous," but certainly there are jitters, going into a situation they've never been in before.  Are you the same way or calm, cool and collected? 
 
BARRY BONDS:  I think we're excited, both sides.  The Giants have been in the World Series, but I think it's very exciting for the Angels that have never been in a World Series.  I've never been in a World Series.  There's a lot of guys on their team, our team, that have never been in the World Series.  Obviously, everyone's excited to be here.  I am particularly, it's something I've worked for my whole life.
