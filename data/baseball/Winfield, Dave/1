 Q. What does it mean to you to be able to throw out the first pitch for an event like this? 
 DAVE WINFIELD: If I couldn't play on the field, this is the next best thing. You know, the people asked me, this is -- would I have played in this if I was, you know -- if this was my era, yes, I would. But just to be out here, international play, it's exciting, glad I could do it. 

 Q. Have you got a chance to watch any of the competition and how have you felt about the level of play? 
 DAVE WINFIELD: Yeah, I've seen all the games here in San Diego, I'll see them in Los Angeles, and it's high-level play. People ask if they draft 1500 guys in America each year, how come 40% are international players? 
 This is why. This is the talent of the world that you see. Each country has a lot of pride, so there is pretty good competition. 

 Q. If this had been happening in your era and you were playing, who do you think -- there has been a lot of talk about the major league players' mind-set for this competition. What would it have meant to you, mind-setwise, to play in these games? 
 DAVE WINFIELD: You always play hard. This is -- it's early in the season, so you have to -- you're a little mindful you can't get injured, but you really go hard. And you play for respect, pride, nationalism, you know. There is all that going on. So that's what it would have meant. I would have enjoyed it immensely.
