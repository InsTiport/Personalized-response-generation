Detroit Tigers  Â– 5
  Texas Rangers - 2

 THE MODERATOR: First question for Doug Fister tonight. 

 Q. Doug, especially in a park where you've pitched so well, how do you instantly regroup after the first three hitters get a hit and they score a run? 
 DOUG FISTER: You know, I mean, they came out swinging the bats. That was their approach. It was obviously working for them.  
 But at the same time, Alex and I really focused on doing the same thing from the get-go. We were going to attack the zone with our fastball and keep it down and use the defense. We stuck with it. 
 Yeah, they got a couple of ground balls through the hole that scored a run there if the first. Good hitters come out doing that. 
 Where we stuck with our guns and used the defense and let them work. 

 Q. Didn't look like anybody hit the ball hard on you until later in the game when Torrealba hit the double. Is there any difficulty not getting frustrated? Were you thinking that nobody is hitting this ball hard on the me when I'm down 1-0? 
 DOUG FISTER: Those thoughts really never crossed my mind. It was a matter of focusing on the pitch at hand and taking it one step at a time. 
 I say it over and over again, but that's how -- that's my kind of technique of how I get through things. So using the defense was a key thing for me and just focusing in on hey, I'm not trying to blow it by these guys. 
 I'm not trying to get strikeouts. I'm looking for contact and let's go deep in the game. 

 Q. This has nothing to do with pitching mechanics. It's very commonplace in this era for pitchers as they leave the field to an ovation to really not express any kind of recognition. You chose tonight to acknowledge the crowd and you did it a couple of times. Can you get a little thought behind your philosophy there? 
 DOUG FISTER: We're at home here in front of fans, and everybody is standing on their feet waving those white flags. It gives me goose bumps to remember walking off on that, and it's kind of nice as a fan to be acknowledged and to know that you're there. 
 We definitely appreciate the fan base we have here in Detroit. And us as players aren't afraid to go out there and say thank you. We're here because of them, we're here playing because they want to come out and watch. 
 So a little tip of the cap isn't anything directed to anybody but the fans, just saying "thank you." 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
