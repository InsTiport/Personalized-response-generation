Q. How do you think the weather will affect today's game?

BOBBY COX: I don't think it has a bearing on it. I think we will get the game in, as I
understand it now, the forecast will be okay, might get a little rain after three o'clock,
but nothing that we could not play through. I think both teams want to play. These off
days are kind of long, I would rather be playing.

Q. Are you ready to name a Game 3 starter?

BOBBY COX: We will see what happens in today's ball game and make that decision on our
way back to Atlanta tonight. We will do everything that we can to win this one with
whoever, so we will wait and see.

Q. You have had so much career success against Darryl Kile, what have you told your
teammates about hitting against him?

ANDRES GALARRAGA: Well, he is a tough guy. I can hit very good against him. I wait for
breaking ball and fastball, trying to see the ball, wait for something around the plate,
try to hit the ball to the middle. I think that is the best way to hit him, he has a good
breaking ball and good fastball, also.

Q. What do the players think of the days off between games; do they like it, not like
it?

ANDRES GALARRAGA: We try to be relaxed with the family. Like another normal game, try
to get some rest, try to figure out what we doing good, what we doing bad. And be ready
for the next game.
BOBBY COX: They're pretty long days.

End of FastScriptsâ€¦.
