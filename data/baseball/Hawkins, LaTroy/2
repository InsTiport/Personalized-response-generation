Q.  You challenged them, didn't you, with fastballs; is that the idea, what you decided to do when you took the hill, decided, "I'm going to go after them?

LaTROY HAWKINS:   That's what I do. I throw a lot of fastballs.  My key is, I try to spot my fastball and I thought I did a good job of that.

Q.  Talk about the second half of the year, you've been so effective, your ERA has been below 1.00.  What's been working for you and why? 

LaTROY HAWKINS:   The key for me is:  Throwing strikes, working the ball in and out, and start throwing changeups a lot more.  Developed a little slider and a lot of curveballs, throwing a lot of strikes.  I give up some hits, but I try not to walk guys and I think that's the key. 

Q.  How big is this to come in here at Yankee Stadium, when Santana leaves after four innings, Ron has to piece together you guys to win this game?

LaTROY HAWKINS:   Well, he totally caught the bullpen off-guard.  We were totally just like, "Wow, what happened?"  We've been in this situation before.  We told ourselves, just strap it on, fellas, go out there and do the best you can.  It worked out in our favor.  Our best was good enough today.
