JOE BUCK:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great night to celebrate Major League Baseball, this is a great night to celebrate the great City of Houston, and this is an even more special night to celebrate one of your favorite sons, the great Roger Clemens.  Here is the Commissioner of baseball.  
 
BUD SELIG:  Roger, before a worldwide television audience in your hometown fans here in Houston, it is my great honor to present you with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award.  Your Hall of Fame 21-year career has been highlighted by many awards, honors, and remarkable performances.  Tonight we are celebrating your place, amongst an elite group of pitchers, who have accumulated 300 career victories and over 4,000 strikeouts.  (Applause). These achievements will ensure that your name will always be mentioned with the greatest pitchers in the history of this great game.  This is the eighth Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award that we've presented.  Congratulations, Roger, you've done a lot for so many and all of us are very proud of you. 
 
ROGER CLEMENS:   Yeah, I put our guys in a hole but we'll get our crowd into it a little bit.  These guys are working their way back into the game.  We're going to win the game. 
 
JOE BUCK:  You have your family behind you, I know your retirement didn't last too long, you end up back here in Houston and have had a great first half, does it make you think past this year with what might be out there. 
 
ROGER CLEMENS:   I'm going to leave that percentage point open again.  I don't want to get into that, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you to all of the fans, all of the great fans of Major League Baseball, all of the towns and cities, the great cities I've had the fortune to play in and he especially here at home, I thank you very much.
