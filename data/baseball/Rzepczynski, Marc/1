St. Louis Cardinals 12
  Milwaukee Brewers 6

 Q. You guys have had to overcome so much this year. What is the feeling now?
 MARC RZEPCZYNSKI: It's awesome right now. Coming from where I was at the beginning of the year to here now, I mean we played every game just like it's our last. We keep going through the entire series, and now we get to go to the World Series. So I couldn't ask for anything more.

 Q. How much of that is a reflection of Tony LaRussa's influence?
 MARC RZEPCZYNSKI: You know, he's been great. He takes every day, day-by-day. We've done that. When the next day game comes on, we get ready for that game and at the end we get ready for the next one.

 Q. When was the turning point? You were so far in back of Atlanta for the wild card spot, and then all of a sudden you got hot. 
 MARC RZEPCZYNSKI: Like I said earlier, we took every game day-by-day. We didn't really care what Atlanta was doing. We just had to go out there and win that day, and luckily we got hot at the right time. We were able to clinch the wild card and now we're here.

 Q. Your thoughts about Texas? They're pretty good hitters. 
 MARC RZEPCZYNSKI: Definitely. Coming from the American League, I've faced these guys before, 1 through 9 could put it out of the ballpark. We're going to go in there and just do our job, what we've been doing lately, and hopefully we come out.

 Q. Do you anticipate having the longest outing by a Cardinals pitcher in a clinching game like this?
 MARC RZEPCZYNSKI: Definitely not. Especially with the saves coming on, and I came in for one out to face Prince. When the 4th inning came on and the phone rang, I was, like, all right, I'm going to give it as long as I need to, and I was able to get out there and give us two and a third.
