 RICK REED: Flipped over to second. I thought he had possession before he dropped the
ball. After we went in and looked at the tape, we decided that wasn't the case. As an
umpire it was my job to get it right. I didn't. You feel bad about it. I feel awful. On
what Jimy Williams told him when he came out to argue the play. He didn't feel he had
possession and I thought he did. His voice was kind of raspy but I thought I made the
right call.
