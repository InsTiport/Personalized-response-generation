Q.  What makes the Metrodome such a tough place to come in as a visiting team?

ART HOWE:  Well, first of all, the roof there, you know, sometimes balls get lost in the roof, and only coming in for a couple games out of the season, it takes you a little while to adapt to it, and I think that the Twins have an advantage of playing there so often, they get used to the environment and probably do a better job of playing there because of that.  They know what's at stake, and there is not very many Astroturf fields left, either, so they are used to playing on that turf.

Q.  Are you going to have to adjust going in for your series there?

ART HOWE:  Well, we were there just this past month, so I think we will remember what that's like, plus we get to work out there tomorrow, so that will help, also, but, you know, the crowd noise will definitely have some affect, and we have to be aware that communication is going to be a problem there, probably, so we have to be careful with that. 

Q.  Will having played at Yankee Stadium in the past couple years help you with the noise factor?

ART HOWE:  Well, I hope so, about the Metrodome, it's enclosed, so we know it's going to be very noisy, and how noisy, I don't know.  I was there back in  '87 as a coach with Texas, and it can get very, very loud there, and I played the Astrodome in the post-season, and it can get really loud.  So in comparison to Yankee Stadium, I don't know. 

Q.  Do you sense anything different with your players as a perceived not underdog this year?

ART HOWE:  I don't think so.  We realize this is a new season and we have to go out and find a way to win 3 out of 5, and you can throw pass records or whoever is favored out the window because we gave the Yankees all they could handle the last two years, we were the underdog, and we had an opportunity to win that series last year when we had a 2-0 lead, but we also realize that being down 1-nothing or 2-nothing doesn't mean the series is over.

Q.  Do you have any way of knowing what Olmedo might return?

ART HOWE:  No, I don't.  The doctors would have to give you a prognosis on that. 

Q.  How much does the injury to Saenz affect your strategy in this series?

ART HOWE:  I guess we will see.  I don't know.  We will just see how each game goes and we will try to adjust to whatever the situation calls for. 

Q.  Is it encouraging to see Piatt  batting well against a lefty?

ART HOWE:  Yeah, that's the reason I put him up there in that situation, we felt good about his chances and he worked the count and got a pitch to hit and just missed it.

Q.  Hudson seemed a bit irritated coming out.  Does that mean he is competitive or is he showing you up?

ART HOWE:  I know he is a competitor.  He never wants to come off the mound.  That's his makeup.  But if you saw, when he left, he stopped and gave Lilly some words of encouragement, and that's the class act he is.

Q.  Does it matter if it's a day game or night game in terms of judging balls at the Metrodome?

ART HOWE:  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I think the daytime might be a little more difficult because of the brightness of the roof; that would be just my gut feeling, but I really don't know. 

Q.  How well-suited is Zito for the Metrodome, given he is a fly ball pitcher?

ART HOWE:  He is suited just fine, he threw a shot out there earlier this year, so he can pitch in any ballpark.
