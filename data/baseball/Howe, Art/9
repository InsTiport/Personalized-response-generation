Q.  Talk about how your team turned a corner, perhaps before the streak.
 
ART HOWE:  It's really hard to say.  I mean, there were so many changes made in our club in late May.  I think when we started making those changes, things started turning around for us, performance-wise, and then the addition of players like Mabry and Durham and Rincon, basically like the icing on the cake. 
 
Q.  What makes Rincon so tough on lefties?
 
ART HOWE:  Just has great stuff, basically, he can turn strikes with all his pitches, it's hard to sit on anything from him, and just has above-average stuff. 
 
Q.  What's your impression of the field compared to how it generally is after Raiders games?
 
ART HOWE:  Well, thank goodness it didn't rain.  I think we dodged a bullet there, but it's not in great shape, but, you know, both teams are going to have to deal with it, and they did the best job they could to get it in playing shape, so we just hope  -- probably both teams hope it won't affect the outcome of any of the games. 
 
Q.  Do you have a role for Mabry in this series?
 
ART HOWE:  Just what his role has been all year, come off the bench, hopefully get us a big hit if we need it, play defense, either in left field or first base, basically, that's it.  
 
Q.  Does Billy Koch's last week concern you at all?
 
ART HOWE:  Not at all.  I think we (inaudible) last week and he was a big part of it.  He has pitched great baseball all year long and we expect the same thing here in the post-season. 
 
Q.  After the hype of the Yankees series the last two years, does this feel any less intense?
 
ART HOWE:  Not at all, because we know that Minnesota is a solid club and we had a battle every time we played them, and it should be a great series because both teams match up pretty well.  
 
Q.  How do you feel most people in baseball feel the A's will win this series versus maybe not the same series with the Yankees?
 
ART HOWE:  Well, I hope they are right for a change.  
 
Q.  Talk about Mulder this season, how you feel about him in game two.
 
ART HOWE:  He has had a great season.  He missed a full month of the season and he ended up with 19 wins.  That tells you what kind of season he has had, phenomenal.  If he is healthy, probably 23, 24, at least wins, and he had another Cy Young type season.  He followed up last season's performance with another solid one.  We feel great about him going in game two. 
 
Q.  Back in May were you concerned about where the season was headed, and did you think you would come back like you?
 
ART HOWE:  When you are not playing well and there is no light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, you tend to think of the worst, really, and it didn't look like things were going to be able to be turned around at that time, but the people we brought up from our Triple A club pitched in immediately and started us going in the right direction and, like I said, Billy made some key acquisitions and everything seemed to fall into (inaudible) and the pitching started to come on strong.
