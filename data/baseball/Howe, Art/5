Q.  Okay.  We will take just a few questions for Art, who was nice enough to come down here.  Who has the first question?  Anybody?  Art, you brought Frankie, added him to your traveling nonroster.  Is that because of Olmedo?

ART HOWE:  Yeah, he is a consideration for the second round, if we get that far.  Another right-handed bat to consider. 

Q.  I just wanted to ask, there has been a lot of talk, even this morning, about the dynamics of playing in this building in the post season, they say it gets very loud.  What are your thoughts about that and are there any preparations you can make for that specifically, that atmosphere?

ART HOWE:  Well, the one thing we talked about mostly was just communication, especially amongst the outfielders on fly balls, the noise level is obviously going to be pretty high, and to be able to hear each other is going to be a little difficult, so we have already discussed methods of trying to alleviate any mistakes out there.  But otherwise, both clubs are playing in the same situation with the same crowd, and we were here just recently, but obviously not with the same kind of crowd that's going to be here this time, so we played in the dome here just within a month.

Q.  Art, can you address two aspects of what you are expecting from Barry Zito:  One, the mental aspect of coping with the atmosphere, how he is especially well-suited for this opportunity; and two, the idea that the Twins don't do that well against lefties?

ART HOWE:  Well, first of all, Barry is used to the post-season.  I mean, he has pitched well in Yankee Stadium and that's got to be as tough a place to pitch in the post-season as anyplace, and he has pitched very well there.  I think he loves the big stage, he is looking forward to the challenge.  Hopefully, you know, we know that Minnesota has had some problems, more so against lefties than righties, but it doesn't really matter.  Barry is just a competent pitcher and we feel good no matter what the numbers are against any team when he is on the mound.

Q.  Art, you talked about Eric Chavez having those couple days off and how he was rejuvenated by that.  The fact that Mark Ellis had a few days off before post-season started, have you noticed anything different since he had that time off, and what are your thoughts on how he has performed so far in the series?

ART HOWE:  Well, Mark Ellis played extremely well for us, ever since the day he got here, really, and yeah, maybe a couple days here and there off, it helped him and everybody.  And that was the beneficial part of going into Texas with things wrapped up and being able to give people a day or two off, and it has paid dividends already, you can see a little giddy-up in their step, but obviously also when you get to the post season the adrenaline is flowing a lot more and you really don't need much rest.
