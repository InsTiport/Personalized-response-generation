ART HOWE:  We let them get a running start on us tonight.  The difference in the ballgame was the first inning.  Put up that six-spot.  We got back two.  I'm proud of the way the guys played, not only tonight, but all season long.  We learned we can play with everybody in this season.  We're looking for bigger and better things next year.  Like I said, I'm very proud of my club.
