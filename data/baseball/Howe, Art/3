Q.  Art, yesterday some guys were talking about how difficult it is to see the ball, fly balls, here at the Metrodome.  What's been your experience with that phenomenon?

ART HOWE:  Yeah, well, I have lost a couple games here because we have lost some fly balls out there, and that's why I am not a real fan of the Metrodome.  There were times when I don't think you would get major league baseball here.  We lost a game in the eighth inning one of my first years managing here with two on, two out in the 8th, just a lazy fly ball, mid centerfield, and our centerfielder never saw the ball and we ended up losing that game, so inside the parker.  Hopefully, that won't happen these two days, hopefully they will get to see real major league baseball.

Q.  How would you describe Rick Reed as a pitcher and what do you think he needs to do to be successful?  How do you approach him from your side of the fence?

ART HOWE:  Well, Rick Reed is a crafty veteran who knows how to pitch and change his speeds with everything, he pitches from both sides of the plate and he has got presence, he knows  -- he has been around, so we just have to be real patient with him and be ready for any kind of mistakes that he makes and capitalize on them.  Thank you very much.
