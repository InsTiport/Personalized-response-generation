Q.  Art, sometimes it seems like errors and other mistakes get contagious.  Did it feel that way to you today?
 
ART HOWE:  No, not really.  We just made a couple throwing errors in the same inning, and that kind of opened the door, and then they strung a lot of hits together after that, broke the game wide open, but Hudson pitched a lot better than the way it looked, final numbers, should have been out of that inning probably with no runs being scored, but that's baseball. 
 
Q.  Is this the first time you have seen this place really rocking when they got going there in the 7-run inning?  Was it as loud as advertised or not?
 
ART HOWE:  No, I was there in  '87, you know, when they had that great season going, so I have seen it before. 
 
Q.  Both teams have proved that they can win on each other's home field.  How important is it that you are going back to Oakland for game 5?
 
ART HOWE:  That's the idea of getting home field advantage?  We are playing in our own backyard and our fans will be out supporting us like theirs were today, but the bottom line is we have to play a little better to get it done and we expect to do that.  
 
Q.  When did Mulder do his between-starts throwing, and is he fine?  Did he throw between starts?
 
ART HOWE:  He is fine.  He threw yesterday, so he is ready to go.  
 
Q.  With Mulder pitching on the three days' rest are there any things that you look for, et  cetera, as the manager tomorrow, as the game progresses, that you wouldn't if he had the extra day?
 
ART HOWE:  Not really.  We just  -- if he is going out there just pitching the way he normally does, we will go as long as we can with him.  Our bullpen, even though we got beat up today, is actually well-rested because of  -- you just  -- you bite the bullet and you save your key guys and go from there, so the bullpen will be ready.
