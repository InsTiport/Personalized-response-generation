Q.  Quick read on the mood of the team after the game.

ART HOWE:  Disappointment.  These guys had a great year, they battled all the way to the very end.  The way we battled in the ninth inning is what they have done all year long, and just won't quit.  I am really proud of this club. 

Q.  Is this any more difficult than the last two or do they run together?

ART HOWE:  This one is difficult because we got some tallies in the bottom of the ninth, but I feel for Billy.  Billy has done a tremendous job for us all year long, and one of the few times he didn't come out and just put the 0's on the board.  Without him we wouldn't even be close to being here.

Q.  How good was Radke today?

ART HOWE:  That's exactly how he pitches, changes speeds, gets ahead, and did a heck of a job for them.  Have to give him credit.  Pitched a fine game and spread the hits out when he did give up hits, and he knows how to stop the damage. 

Q.  How difficult is it to fathom having chances to put away series over three years?

ART HOWE:  Don't remind me.  I am not looking forward to the off-season thinking about it, but it's better being there having a chance to win than being home when the season is over.  We will find a way to get it done.

Q.  As good as Romero has been all year, were you surprised to see Hawkins and what did you think of him?

ART HOWE:  Not at all because he has had a good series for them, he has pitched lights out for them and he did again today, got the big out.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ART HOWE:  Evidently he didn't check out the light on the card.  He was hitting second, not first.

Q.  Do you think Mulder gave you everything he could on three days' rest?

ART HOWE:  Yes, definitely.  Deserved better.  He pitched a heck of a game, and, you know, he can sleep well over the winter, the effort he gave us today.
