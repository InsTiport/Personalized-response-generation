Q.  Art, the confidence of the team after coming in 2-0 like this.  I know momentum is only as good as tomorrow's pitcher, are you shaken, do you think, a little bit?
 
ART HOWE:  Not at all.  We're not shaken at all.  I expected this to go five games, and we were pretty fortunate to come in here two up.  I wish I wasn't a soothsayer, but I thought it would go 5.  Hopefully we can turn the table on them tomorrow, against them the way they did against us last year. 
 
Q.  Would you talk about Dye and what kind of loss that is for you?
 
ART HOWE:  Well, Jermaine has done a tremendous job ever since he's joined us, and we're going to miss him.  But the other guys have to step up.  We won a few games this year when he wasn't here, so -- we're going to have to find a way to get it done tomorrow, the other guys are going to have to pick up for him. 
 
Q.  You guys are scuffing a little at the plate to score runs, is that Yankee pitching?
 
ART HOWE:  If I knew what the answer was I'd solve it.  We had 11 hits today, we just didn't put them together.  But at least we got the hits, and hopefully tomorrow we'll bunch them.
