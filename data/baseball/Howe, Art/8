Q.  Can you talk about your thought process for pulling Hudson when you did.

ART HOWE:  I just thought he wasn't as sharp as he could be, a couple of home runs, that's not healthy and I wanted to get him a win, and we had our left-handers ready to come in, and it just didn't work out the way we wanted it to.  They bunched a few hits together right after he left the game and that was it.  Their bullpen did a heck of a job keeping us from getting on the board.  We scored in the first two innings and didn't get anything after that.

Q.  Why (Ted) Lilly at that point?

ART HOWE:  Because it was only the sixth inning.

Q.  Any thoughts of pinch hitting for Hernandez in the eighth?

ART HOWE:  Not against a left hander, no.

Q.  How big is tomorrow's game?

ART HOWE:  Well, you know, last year we won the first game and ended up losing; the year before we won the first game and ended up losing; so hopefully we can bounce back together and get that one, and hopefully we can go in tomorrow in Minnesota (Inaudible) but tomorrow is a big game.

Q.  How does the Saenz injury cripple you?

ART HOWE:  Well, it obviously limits our right-handed bats, so it's a shame, too, a foul ball on top of it.  But, you know, he was hustling down the line, he said he felt something pop and it was his achilles.

Q.  Do you see this as a challenge with the way Radke pitched and them having some momentum now?

ART HOWE:  I said it was going to be a good series, tough series.  They have got a good club, as they showed today, so we have to bounce back tomorrow.

Q.  Is a loss a loss, or is this tougher than normal?

ART HOWE:  Yeah, I mean, actually, what we have gone through the last two years should show us that this isn't the end of the road, so you obviously want to get the first game of any series, and we didn't get it today, but we battled and we will be back tomorrow.

Q.  A bit different this year being the hunted versus the hunter?

ART HOWE:  Well, I think ESPN picked the Twins, so I don't know if that's true or not.

Q.  How important was it that the Twins were able to come back after being down 5-1?

ART HOWE:  That's very important.  We call those momentum innings where you can go out and get runs on the board.  We always want our pitcher to be able to go out and put a 0 out and keep the momentum on our dugout, but they came back and got the two-run homer by Koskie, and that gave them some momentum, and they kept taking a bite here and there until they got the lead and they made it stand up.

Q.  Was there anything specific today that you saw with Tim Hudson?  He seems to do very well with the Twins.

ART HOWE:  It's unusual for him to give up homeruns so obviously getting the ball up a little bit more than he usually does.  But he battled, he came out of the game with a lead.

Q.  If (inaudible) hadn't had to replace Saenz, would he have had to hit in the ninth?

ART HOWE:  Who knows? 

Q.  Did the starting time cause you to not have home field advantage?

ART HOWE:  No, I don't think so.  The fans that were here were very supportive and that's what counts.

Q.  Can you assess the mental state of your team?

ART HOWE:  They are teed off.

Q.  Did the shadows come into play in the latter innings at all?

ART HOWE:  Well, I could see that it was going to come into play.  I don't know how much it really affected the hitters because  -- but I could see the eight and ninth innings were going to be affected by the shadows, and I was hoping we could get some runs before that took place.

Q.  Teed off because your team is frustrated or another reason?

ART HOWE:  No, I mean, we lost a game that we had the lead, and normally we do a pretty good job of holding leads, and just have to get the momentum back over our way.
