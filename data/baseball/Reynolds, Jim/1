  Q. Take us through what you saw, obviously it was a little bit close with the fan and the potential interference?  
 JIM REYNOLDS: From the angle I had, I was very confident that the ball was in the stands.   
  
  Q. Did Ron Washington push to review it?   
 JIM REYNOLDS: No. He asked me the same question you asked me, "What did you have."   
 I said, "Ron, the ball was in the stands."   
  
  Q. Was there consideration at that point of going inside and taking a look?   
 JIM REYNOLDS: No. Like I said, I was confident from the angle that I had that it was -- the ball was in the stands.   
  
  Q. Have you guys seen the replay since?   
 GERRY DAVIS: Yes, we have, and the ball was in the stands.   
  
  Q. I guess on the Berkman, home run, also, pretty clear on the replay?   
 JIM REYNOLDS: Yeah, and in that situation, I wasn't confident of what I had, and we got together and we went to the replay.   
  
  Q. And you said you just saw it, you confirmed that it was clearly foul?   
 GERRY DAVIS: After we reviewed it, yes.   
  
  Q. One other play, have you seen a replay of Swisher with the bases loaded?   
 GERRY DAVIS: We looked at it, obviously in Angel's judgment the ball had not hit him and we looked at the replay and even from different angles, it's inconclusive.
