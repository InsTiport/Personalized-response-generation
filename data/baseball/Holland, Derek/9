  Q. Derek, what's your mindset coming into bases loaded and one out situation?   
 DEREK HOLLAND: The main thing was definitely just come in and make sure to get the least amount of damage. I don't want them to score any runs and just make my pitch.   
  
  Q. When you were watching, I presume the 2006 NLCS when Yadier hit the home run, is this comparable at all?   
 BENGIE MOLINA: Actually two minutes before it happened, I was actually yelling in my kitchen, "Sit on the change, sit on the change, sit on the change, please, just sit on the change." And he threw a changeup and I was very happy. (Laughter.) So I had a lot of fun that night.  
  
  Q. Moments comparable, do you think?   
 BENGIE MOLINA: I don't think it's the same. I think it's very happy for both of us, but he enjoyed it a lot. I'm just here still waiting for one more game, and then we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. What were you thinking when they walked Murphy to get to you, and can you just take us through what you saw there?   
 BENGIE MOLINA: I was actually looking for a good pitch to hit, that's all. I think when something like that happens, I always said it, it's the game. Murphy, he's a great hitter and he kills right-handers, so why not walk him and face me. I haven't been having a great season. I don't think it's a bad move. I think it's the right move that went wrong.   
  
  Q. You've had some success against the Yankees in the playoffs before; what do you point to for the reasons for that in?  
 BENGIE MOLINA: I don't know. I don't see who I'm facing, I'll tell you that.   
 I've been blessed, I think, by God just giving me good games against them. I don't see it like, here come the Yankees, I'm going to have a great game. I don't see it that way. It's not a bad for a fat kid that everyone makes fun of when he runs.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about working with a veteran catcher like Bengie and about what he specifically brings to the table for you?   
 DEREK HOLLAND: It's been real huge for me. It's been a good communication thing, we have been on the same page for the most part. I've been learning a lot from him and he's been helping me a lot with going right to the mitt and not falling off so much.  
  
  Q. It was not too long ago that you were wearing the Dora the Explorer backpack, we are talking about months, basically and it's been a big move over the last couple of months as far as your performance goes. From that point on, to now, and this very moment, what's been the mindset, like when you came out of the bullpen today, what was your mindset exactly in Yankee Stadium in?  
 DEREK HOLLAND: I was definitely a little nervous coming into Yankee Stadium, especially in the playoffs, but at the same time you have to have fun with it. That's how I've been taught and everything. I've been around a lot of veteran guys and learned a lot from them and it goes to show with how I've been performing that you can tell I've definitely learned a lot from those guys.   
  
  Q. Did you change your catching gear tonight, and also, on your home run when you were nearing third base, you were pointing up in the stands, were you pointing to anyone in particular or just a group of Rangers?   
 BENGIE MOLINA: My family is very special for me, every time I do good, I thank God and I thank my dad for every day of my life. My dad passed away two years ago, and my mom is here, and her health is not very good, and my wife is here supporting me. It's like a little excitement and enjoying the moment.  
 I got a foul tip on the leg on a shin guard and it broke and it kind of cut my leg, so I couldn't play like that, so I had to go to a new one.   
  
  Q. Do you assume that Yadier was watching, and if he was watching, what was he saying to himself in his kitchen?   
 BENGIE MOLINA: When we're done, I'm going to show you the text. They are enjoying it so much. They are home and they have a great game room to watch the games, and I'm sure they are having fun.   
  
  Q. You also talked about pressure in coming into Yankee Stadium and being a little nervous and obviously Bengie, you've done this before, but this team is 5-0 on the road in the post-season, can you both give me an idea about how you've dealt with the pressure and just being in the post-season even though you've done so well on the road?   
 DEREK HOLLAND: I think the big thing is we don't really think too much about it. One thing is we like being considered the underdog going into people's places. They all talk about home-field advantage; we want to be able to show that there's no such thing.   
 BENGIE MOLINA: And my opinion is that we came here, we are supposed to lose. So, let's go out there and have fun, see what happens.
