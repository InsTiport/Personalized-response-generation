 Q.   What happened with the playat the plate? ‑  
SEAN MURPHY:   Couldn't really tell you.   My job is to get in front of the plate, catch the ball and make a tag.   I did my job, and, I don't know, up to the umpire to do his job and I don't know if he did or not.   
   
 Q.   Do you know what Greg was arguing?   Was he arguing for an ejection?   
SEAN MURPHY:   He was arguing for malicious contact.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel it was?   
SEAN MURPHY:   I don't have to answer that.   No comment.   
   
 Q.   What did his ejection do for you guys mentally?   Did it take you out of it or did it fire you up a little bit?   
SEAN MURPHY:   It fired everybody up.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever seen him get that upset before?   
SEAN MURPHY:   No.   That was the most fired up I've ever seen him.   
   
 Q.   What's the mood right now?   Obviously it's disappointing, but looking at the season you've had, can you appreciation the whole of it right now?   
MARK FOWLER:   Oh, yeah.   I think after I crossed first base on that last out, I had my moment to kind of feel sad about losing.   But I mean, it's been a great season.   It's been a great ride with all these guys.   I mean, I won't hang my head on one game at the end of my career.   But it's been a great season and that's all I could say for it.   
SEAN MURPHY:   I want to thank the seniors.     Can't thank guys like mark enough, Mark, Mike, Luke, all those guys out there, outstanding leadership.   Great guys and I'm proud to say they were Raiders with me.   
   
 Q.   What did you say to the guys when you gathered everybody around after the second ejection?   
MARK FOWLER:   I just told him to play baseball.   I mean, there's no use going out there, jawing back and forth.   The only way‑‑ the only way to get back at a team is to go out there and beat them at the game of baseball.   That's what we are here for, so I told them, hey, we are not going to fight anybody.   We are not going to get upset.   We are not going to be little kids about it.     
We'll settle it on the baseball field in between the white lines.   We came up short, but I thought we played hard.   I thought we played hard all the way to the end and that's all I wanted was for everybody just to keep their heads in the game, remember their technique and just play baseball.   There's no need for anything else on the baseball field.   
   
 Q.   Did anything change with Trevor in the fifth inning when they started getting to rim?   
SEAN MURPHY:   Just left a few balls up, made a few mistakes and they capitalized.   I mean, it's baseball.   
   
 Q.   What did you guys see off Tyler Jay?   He shut down your comeback.   Is he a different class of pitcher than what you guys are used to?   
SEAN MURPHY:   I mean, yeah, he's one of the best out there.   I mean, everybody knows that.   He throws hard.   He's got sharp off‑speed, but you've got to go up there.   You've got to compete and you've got to battle and treat it like every other at‑bat, have an approach and do what you can.   
MARK FOWLER:   I mean, he's one of the best in the country for a reason.   I mean, he showed it today.   He had his stuff and we put our best against his best and he won.   So he's a pretty good pitcher.   
   
 Q.   So was there something that you look at that was a difference today between the two teams, because it felt like for the most part, throughout the game, it was pretty even back and forth.   
SEAN MURPHY:   I would agree.   It was a very evenly matched game.   I think could have made some plays there that would have helped, would have stave off some of those big innings.   I mean, I think it was very evenly played.   Both were good teams.   
   
 Q.   Can you appreciate this season and this run yet, or is it going to take some time to really step back from everything that happened today?   
SEAN MURPHY:   I mean, we're proud of the season we've had.   We talked about it.   We are extremely proud of the seniors, everybody that's going out.   It's disappointing to lose, lose like that, a game we thought we could have won.   But you know, we're still proud.   End of the day, we're happy.   
   
 Q.   Did they give you an explanation on Mitch, why he was thrown out?   
MARK FOWLER:   Probably chirping.     Beak (ph) was real chirpy.   We knew he probably went out there and said something, got tossed.   But that's him.   That's his personality.   That's what makes him so good.   I mean, he had a lot of hits and played a great shortstop for us, so that's what fuels him.   We knew he was going to have something to say.   But never gave us an actual explanation on what he actually said but he probably said something.  
   
 Q.   The play where Andrew got picked off third base, was that a design squeeze bunt?   
MARK FOWLER:   That was a safety squeeze.   He got a little too far.   I mean, he's being aggressive.   It's probably a pitch I should have bunted.   It's on me for sure at the plate to at least know he's going to be that aggressive and at least make some contact with that pitch, so that's on me.
