 Q.   What did you tell the team after the loss, and how disappointing was it to see the bullpen have problems in the seventh inning?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   Well, I told them that I'm proud of their effort.   We established a way to go about this game in spring training, and we accomplished that goal.   We played the way we wanted to play and did a lot of things right.  
So, you know, it's tender and it's bitter and all of those things, but I'm proud of them.   I'm proud of the way they went about it.   
With regard to the bullpen, you know, we had a chance to tie the game there on Bryce's homer and had it set pretty good.   They got a couple of base hits and the wild pitch did us in.   
You know, that's the way the game goes sometimes, and I'm proud of the way they have gone about it this year and they should be, too.   
   
 Q.   Can you go through why you went with Thornton and then why you didn't go to Storen and Clippard during that sequence?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   During the seventh inning?   Because those are our seventh inning guys.   That's how we set this up.   We had two lefties at the top of the inning, and if we got to the righties, we were going to go with Barrett.   That's what he's done for us all year long.   
We are certainly not going to use our closer in the seventh inning.   So that's why we went with it.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about how shocking it was to see Gio couldn't field his position?  
MATT WILLIAMS:   It's not shocking.   It happens.   The ball is hit back at him.   The mound is chewed up.   There's a huge hole in front of him.   It's in between hops, and he didn't catch it.   
So it's not shocking.   It's disappointing that he wasn't able to make that play.   But we have to move on within the game after that.   
That's the way it is.   That's baseball.   Sometimes the ball bounces fine.   Sometimes you don't make the play, sometimes you do.   
The bottom line to it was we were tied after six.   So it's irrelevant at that point.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a scenario in mind when you were going to Stephen?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   It's irrelevant.   Did I have a scenario in mind when we were going to Stephen?   No, it's irrelevant.   Doesn't matter.   He didn't pitch.  
   
 Q.   Did you think about going to him when you went to Roark, or was that just Roark's‑‑  
MATT WILLIAMS:   No, that's Tanner.   Stephen, as I told you in pregame, it's emergency‑only for Stephen tonight.   We get into late innings, then he's our guy.   He's only on three days' rest.   Tanner is rested and ready.   
   
 Q.   Going back into Barrett there, was there any thought to getting Soriano up a little bit sooner in the inning?   Did you maybe wait a little too long?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   I don't think so.   Aaron's been doing that job for us all year long.   He's a strikeout guy.   He's got the ability to strike that guy out.   Unfortunately it was a wild pitch.   
So, you know, that happens.   But he's been our guy that we've gone to in the middle of orders with every team that we've played all year long to get a big strikeout or get a big out.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of Gio tonight?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   Well, in a normal game, in a normal game and not an elimination game, he may still be in that game.   But we know that if we lose it, then we go home.   But I thought he was okay.   
You know, the unfielded bunt play was the one.   But, you know, in a normal game, he may still be in there.   
   
 Q.   Seeing what Bryce Harper did in this series, what do you think the baseball world thinks of him now?   
MATT WILLIAMS:   You know, I don't know.   I know that we're proud of him.   I know that much.   I know that he's got great talent.   I know that at this point he is healthy and certainly now, looking forward, with great anticipation to next year.   
So I think he played really well in this series.
