Q.  Was the clubhouse that much more motivated in this last series against St. Louis?
 
MATT WILLIAMS:   No.  I think the biggest thing, we knew that the Cardinals were going to play well over the weekend.  So, it's important to us to try to retain home-field advantage and that was the only focus.  It didn't go any past that.  We just knew that they were going to play well and that we had to do the same.  We felt going in that we had to sweep that series, and that's what happened.  
 
Q.  Other than the World Series, was that series last year with the Cardinals as exciting a series as you've gone through?
 
MATT WILLIAMS:   Yeah, great starting pitching.  It was  -- the first game, 1-0, and it didn't get any easier from there.  I think both clubs have great starting pitching, good bullpens, and in the post-season, pitching and defense wins you games, anyway.  That's what we face again.  So we'll have to play well, not give them any extra opportunities to score runs, things like that.  
 
Q.  With the extra day off and Curt and Randy maybe going twice each, does that give the offense any chance to relax or just be a little more confident? 
 
MATT WILLIAMS:   Well, if Randy and Curt get to go twice, so do Matt and Chuck.  I mean, that's what that means.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  I think we have  -- we're excited that they could possibly go twice, sure.  But we'll still have to do all of the other things well if we're going to beat the Cardinals because we know that they are going to.  They are going to play good defense, bloop guys over, bunts, squeeze if they have to with Tony.  So we will have to do all of those things well on our side, too, if we are going to have a chance to win this.
