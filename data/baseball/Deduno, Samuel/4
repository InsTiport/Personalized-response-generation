 Q.   What is the strategy for you to pitch against Spain?   We know the pitch limit thing, but how do you prepare pitching to players who are practically your peers?   
SAMUEL DEDUNO:   You're talking about the Spaniard players or the Dominicans?   I don't know many of the Spanish players, but it was like Tony was saying, there's no easy enemy.   I'm going to pitch like today's game, like if it's a team like Venezuela, to use all my pitches and try to get to the third or fourth inning with God before me.   
   
 Q.   Spring Training is barely starting.   At what point of your physical condition are you right now?   
SAMUEL DEDUNO:   Really to tell you the truth, I feel very good physically.   My arm, my body.   I can tell you that I feel 100 percent that I can use all my pitching without a problem.
