 Q. What is El Duque going to think tomorrow when more of the fans are screaming for
him? 
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: The same thoughts as I've thought since the season started. 
 
Q. What are they?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Personal thoughts, thoughts of my job. 
 
Q. When Livan was pitching in the World Series last year, did you think one day that
would be you?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No, I didn't think I would be here today, but, yes, I did think of
finding a way to one day be here. 
 
Q. Has he talked to Livan about what to expect pitching in a World Series or what to
expect from the National League batters.
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No, I haven't spoken to my brother concerning National League
hitters. We have a great pitching coach here, we also have a number of other coaches who
help us to prepare for the opponent. As far as what to expect for the World Series, no, I
haven't spoke to him about that. 
 
Q. One year after your brother being in the World Series, what are your feelings on you
being here this year?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: My feelings are happiness. 
 
Q. In Cuba, training is very hard and you train very hard prior to the season. Usually,
you prepare to pitch 200, 250 innings a year until you die. Did it bother you when Joe
Torre took you out early in the day prior?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No, it didn't bother me. Here we have relievers, we have long
relievers, we have short relievers to go along with the starters. No, it did not bother me
that he took me out. I think he took me out at the right time. 
 
Q. How did you know what Livan did last year, and how will the people at home know what
you do this year?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: A lot of newspapers get to Cuba. Also, Radio Marti is a popular
station in Cuba, you get a lot of information. And some people have satellites and such,
but I wouldn't really know much about that because I didn't have that.  
 

Q. Did you watch?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Yes, I was able to watch. I went to the CNN studios in Cuba and was
able to watch the games live. 
 
Q. How much of a milestone to your career was beating Cleveland in Game 4 of the last
series?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: To me, every game is important. It really doesn't matter what game
and what series, I just like to go out and help my team to victory. 
 
Q. Because of the unusual way that he throws the ball, does El Duque feel like he has
an advantage tomorrow against this lineup, which he's never seen before?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Logically and obviously they haven't seen me. This would be the
first time I'm going to pitch against them. They've probably seen some video. As always,
I'm just going to try to go out and pitch as best I can. 
 
Q. In Cuba or in international competition, did you pitch any games that rival a World
Series game as far as magnitude? And if so, when?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I don't remember when, but I know I've pitched in three World
Championships, one Olympics, also various other tournaments I don't remember. And in Cuba,
I pitched in multiple league championships and national titles which -- I don't know if
you could compare the magnitude of the World Series, but they're pretty big. 
 
Q. With your creative delivery and your varied release points, did you ever surprise
yourself during a game or do you ever make something up out there?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I never really surprise myself on the mound because if I did it,
then there's no reason for me to be surprised because it's something I did. 
 
Q. I am told that the people who were on the boat with you are here tonight as your
guests; is that true?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: My wife? 
 
Q. No, the other people who were on the boat, when you left.
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Left? 
 
Q. You did not bring them here?
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Did they come? 
 
Q. I was told they came.
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Who told you that? 
 
Q. One of the broadcasters from Miami.
 
 ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Yes, they are here. Now that you told me who told you, we're even.
