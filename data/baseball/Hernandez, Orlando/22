Q. Dwight Gooden has had a very difficult time winning postseason games and went out in
your first try tonight and won, would you comment on that?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Well, we're two different people and today luck shined on me and I
had the chance to win a playoff game.

Q. Joe talked about spotting you at brunch and how you were reacting there, kind of
made him feel more comfortable about how you were going to do tonight. Could you elaborate
on that?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I had pressure prior to the game. It was a big game. And I knew we
had pretty much a must-win situation. I had pressure, but I had no fear. I've been through
many difficult times in my life on the field and off of the field and I knew that I would
be able to handle it.

Q. The fact that Livan talked about this last year when he pitched in the postseason,
at this stage for you -- and maybe it's just you or the Yankees, the exiles and Cubans
that are here -- you're probably being watched by every Cuban exile and I'm pitching here
tonight. Was that on your mind, on your shoulders?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I'd have to agree with you. It was a very big game for you and a big
game for my team, but it was also big for other people of Cuba who are here. We the few
Cubans who play here represent our whole country. That is very big and very important to
me.

Q. Can you talk about facing Jim Thome with the runners on base when you struck him
out. What was on your mind?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I never try to strike anyone out. I just try to get them out. That's
my job. His job -- I'm sure what he was thinking was to try to get a hit against me and my
job is to get him out. That's what I was trying to do.
