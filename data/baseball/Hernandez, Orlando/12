Q.  Are you satisfied that any difficulties you had this season with your health and mechanics are behind you?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Yes.  
 

Q.  What was your reaction when Joe told you you were starting Game 3?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Wait until the first two games are over.  
 

Q.  Were you surprised? Did you expect that?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No, why would I be surprised? 
 

Q.  Because you started Game 1 last year. 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: In '98, I didn't pitch in any game the first series.  It's when the boss says.  
 

Q.  What would you think about a World Series matchup with Livan?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: We haven't gotten to the World Series.  We haven't even gotten out of the Division Series.  I haven't thought about that at all.  I'm thinking about winning tomorrow.  
 

Q.  You've had a perfect post-season, you've never lost in the post-season.  How do you explain that?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Thanks to God I've had luck.  I've been lucky.  
 

Q.  Did you make some kind of adjustment in the middle of the season to face left-handed batters?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No, I continue to do the same things I did last year, same this year.  
 

Q.  Joe was in here before talking about how he saw you before you pitched the game against the Indians two years ago in the coffee shop and how relaxed you seemed.  Do you remember how you felt going into that game and do you put any extra pressure on yourself before you compete in the post-season?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I feel the same pressure as in any other game.  This is a game just like any other game during the regular season or the post-season.  I feel the same pressure every game.  The objective is to go out and win.  
 

Q.  Did you watch last night's game on television?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Yes.  
 

Q.  What did you think?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Good game.  We won.  
 

Q.  Do you think your team was as relaxed in Oakland as they will be here at home?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I think yes, I think we're a great team and we're always going to be ready for the challenge, and we're always going to respect Oakland, which is a great opponent.  
 

Q.  Getting back to the pressure, it seems like in the playoffs you feed off the pressure more, like the objective is more intense.  Is that so with you?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I'd say no.  I pretty much prepare and put the same amount of pressure on myself for every game.  I don't want to lose in the regular season as well as the playoffs.  So I say I pretty much put the same amount of pressure on myself every game.  
 

Q.  What are your thoughts on Oakland's line-up, especially since they are heavy left-handed hitters?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: We're going to have to wait until after the game tomorrow.  
 

Q.  Did you watch Livan pitch yesterday against the Mets and what did you think?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I didn't see it.  I know that he won and he did a good job, but I wasn't able to see it.  
 

Q.  The way the season ended for the Yankees, how concerned were you when the post-season started coming in the way they did?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Although we lost, I wouldn't say that the team played so bad.  You have to respect your opponent and their qualities.  
 

Q.  Do you and your cousin (brother) ever discuss how you came from Cuba and became such prominent American figures here?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: First of all, it's my brother, not my cousin.  
 

Q.  I'm sorry, your brother.  I'm sorry. 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I cleared it up because that's the second time somebody told me that it was my cousin.  
 

Q.  No problem, no problem.  I don't mind, my mistake. 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Yes, we do speak of being here in America.  We don't speak of being great heroes or great athletes; we just speak of the opportunity to be here and the chance that we have to do our job and try to do a good job on the baseball field.  
 

Q.  What did you think of Luis Sojo's dance step last night?
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I don't think it was a dance.  He went to pivot and he got caught in his shoelaces.  It could happen to anyone.  I don't find any humor in that personally.
