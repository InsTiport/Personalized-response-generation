Q. How do you feel about coming to the plate? Have you taken a lot of batting practice?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I practiced one day. I don't think my hitting would have greatly
improved with practicing. 

Q. Are there things that you learn pitching in any league if you pitch long enough? It
doesn't matter how good the hitters are, that they're all the same in Cuba or in Panama or
in the Big Leagues?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: The hitters are pretty much always the same type of hitters, and I'm
always going to continue to pitch by the same form. 

Q. Do they all respond the same?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: They all hit; they all have bats in their hands. I respect them all
equally. 

Q. As a young man, were you ever a batter? Did you ever bat much back in Cuba? And were
you a good batter?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No. 

Q. You didn't bat at all?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: No. 

Q. How does the level of excitement and pressure and importance in the big-game
atmosphere of the World Series compare to the biggest games you've pitched in for Cuba?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: As I've said before, I pretty much try to approach every game the
same. The object of the game is to win, and I want to go out and win, prepare myself to
win. I try not to focus if it's in Cuba, in a World Series, in a national competition. The
object is always to win, and that's what I try to do. 

Q. You struggled at times during this regular season. Yet when the post-season started,
you were back to your old self again. How are you able to elevate your game?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I wouldn't agree with your assessment, but I pretty much was injured
during most of the regular season. If I didn't prepare myself during the regular season
for the post-season, then I wouldn't be able to do my job in the post-season. 

Q. Bobby Valentine said he didn't think you had a lot of release points, just a lot of
different pitches. Do you think that's an accurate scouting report?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: That's his opinion, and I respect it. I never agree with anyone
else. I pretty much just respect everyone's opinion and their right to it. 

Q. Were you disappointed at all that you did not get to face your brother in the World
Series? Did you talk to him recently about this?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I haven't spoken to anyone. And I wouldn't say I'm disappointed,
because I never gave that any thought. Sometimes you think things that I never think about
or I never will think about.

Q. Personally, how much does the unbeaten streak in the post-season mean to you? Do you
feel fortunate to have had it continue from last week's game?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I don't think about those things. I only worry about my team
winning. And as far as personal things go, I don't give any thought to that, I swear. You
could think that's ridiculous, but it's the truth. 

Q. Everyone seems to have an opinion about last night's bat-throwing incident. What is
your opinion, and what would you do in the same circumstances?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I don't have any opinion on that. I wasn't watching. 

Q. Just curious, off the field, do you enjoy the excitement of the Subway Series like
all the New Yorkers do? Or is it just another series to you?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: Not speaking as a ball player, but as a fan, I think the fans are
enjoying a great series. And it's very emotional, and they deserve that we go out and work
real hard on the field and give them something to enjoy.
