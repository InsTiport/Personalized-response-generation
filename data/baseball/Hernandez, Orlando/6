Q.  Could you tell us where you're at physically, going into the playoffs, not having pitched for a while?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  That doesn't have anything to do with tomorrow's game.  I feel good.  I'm going to pitch tomorrow because I feel good.  If not I wouldn't be pitching.

Q.  Can you talk about how nervewracking it was today to not know whether you were going to be pitching tomorrow?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  This is baseball.  You have to be patient to wait to see if we are going to win, to pitch tomorrow.  If not, it's out of your control, that's the game.

Q.  You're pitching tomorrow to keep the Yankee season going, how much does your postseason experience and your experiences in Cuba help you?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  We'll have to wait until after the game tomorrow.  I'm ready to pitch tomorrow's game.  I'm here to help my team, that's it.
