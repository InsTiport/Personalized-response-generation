Q.  How much do you think your postseason experience affected the way you were able to pitch today, manage your way through the first few innings?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  It's difficult to say how much my experience would help me because you have to concentrate on the moment.  And today I was trying to concentrate on every moment because Oakland is a very good team, and they were leading us in the series 2 to 1.

Q.  What was your approach to Jason Giambi today?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  That's a good question.  It's difficult to pitch to him, but I pitched to him and just had a lot of luck.  He doesn't have a lot of weaknesses at the plate, but I think what's also important is to concentrate on all nine hitters.

Q.  Once you got the lead, how did you pitch differently?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  I continued to do the same things, just got better results.

Q.  The team is very calm, cool and collected on Friday and Saturday, I was wondering if you could tell me about some passion and emotion in the clubhouse today before the game.?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  Incredibly it seemed as if we were leading the series.  And one more loss would have sent us home.  It seemed like we were ahead in the series, and everyone was focused on winning, not necessarily on what would happen if we lost.

Q.  Given your success in the playoffs, do you really enjoy pitching in this type of environment, given all the tension and the pressure?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:  I like to pitch whenever I'm able to pitch, but this is a time when the team really comes together.  To me every game is the same.  I try to focus on the first game of the season the same as the last game, and the last game of the World Series.
