Q.  Piniella was just talking recently about feeling that the pressure, even after Seattle's win today, is clearly on the Yankees.  Do you feel that way, and how will you respond to it? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   That's Piniella's opinion, and I respect it.  
 
Q.  Do you feel any pressure? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   I always feel pressure.  What I don't have is fear.  But pressure, there always is, and whoever says otherwise is lying.  
 
Q.  What is your confidence level going into the next game? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   Pretty much the same I have for every game of baseball:  To come out positive is important.  It is always important to respect your opponent.  Seattle is a great team, and we have to respect them; and may the best team win. 
 
Q.  Do you look forward to a game like this more than any previous ones? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   Tomorrow's game to me is the same as a regular-season game, and I prefer all of them alike.  I really don't have preference.  
 
Q.  What in your mind makes you tough on right-handed hitters?  What is it that you do that gives them problems? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   I try to do my job.  
 
Q.  Everybody knows the story of your life, and that may account for why you're able to handle pressure.  But in baseball, why do you think you handle pressure when so many other pitchers can't deal with pressure? 
 
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ:   Some luck involved.
