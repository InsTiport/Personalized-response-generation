Q. These last two games at the end of the season, the post-season, are they the two
best games you've thrown?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I can't say if it's the best games I've thrown, but they're
definitely games that made my team happy and made me happy. It was the difference in
today's World Series game.

Q. Can you talk about the pitches and what was working so well for you tonight?
Specifically.

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I felt all my pitches were working well, but especially my control.
I was able to work all my balls in the proper location. I was able to throw well. But
that's basically what was working best, was my placement tonight.

Q. Joe Torre was in here and said you would still come back to the bench and say,
"mistake, mistake, mistake." Where were all these mistakes, and why were you so
hard to please?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: It's my criteria. That's how I base my pitches. Often times if I ask
to throw a pitch in a certain location, I don't put it there, I get upset. It's just my
way of pitching and my way of getting on myself. It's the way I review my work.

Q. After they hit the home run off of you, how did you recover?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I have to realize, that's part of the game. And even though at that
time it was the only run, I had enough respect and confidence in my team that I knew if I
kept it close and I kept us in the game we'd eventually win. With no disrespect to the
great pitcher that is Greg Maddux, I just felt that one run wasn't going to win the game.

Q. When you left the game, did you have that confidence that your team was going to be
able to score runs?

ORLANDO HERNANDEZ: I always have the confidence that my team is going to defend and
protect me. And regardless of the situation, I have the utmost faith that my team is going
to come through for me.
