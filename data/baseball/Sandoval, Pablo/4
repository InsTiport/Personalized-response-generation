Q.   We know how your teammates were reacting last night, but did you get messages from home, from friends or family?   What were you hearing after that game?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   300 text messages, man.

Q.   300?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   300.   So excited how the people watched pay attention to all the things in the game, all my friends back home, family, just excited to be part of this. 

Q.   Has it sunk in for you that you made some history last night? 
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, I still can't believe it.   In the morning when I wake up, all the stuff, my friends keep texting me.   But you know, you have to realize what's going on right now in your life, so you have to keep your head up and keep focused. 

Q.   Gregor was talking last night about what it's like for you to go home in Venezuela.   What do you think it's going to be like when you go home next time?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   I don't know, man.   It's going to be a big deal.   Miguel Cabrera won the Triple Crown, myself hitting three homers in the World Series.   It's a big deal.   The President sent me a tweet yesterday.   I still can't believe it.

Q.   Did you hear from Reggie Jackson or Albert Pujols?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   No, I don't be hearing from those guys, but pretty much Albert is happy, Pujols is happy for all the things happening right now for me.

Q.   You talked last night about the disappointment of not getting to play more in 2010 when you guys made the World Series.   What do you think was the most important change you had to make to get back to where you are now?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, the work.   All the work you have to do, get in shape.   I think it's just one of those things.   When you have a good manager, good GM, throwing all the things in your face, you have to keep focused and keep playing and keep working hard. 

Q.   What did President ChÃ¡vez actually say in that text message to you?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   No, he put a tweet on the three home runs.   But when I was hitting the fourth at‑bat, he was like, "I'm just going to say congratulations to Pablo, but I'm just going to see the four homers right now."   So that was funny.

Q.   Have you ever met him?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   No, I never met him. 

Q.   So many great things from Venezuelans this year, Johan Santana, Miguel Cabrera, the Triple Crown and now yourself.   Do you guys pull for each other, feel happy for each other?   Could you talk a little bit about the other Venezuelans?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   I'll be happy for all things happening to Venezuelan players right now, happening in all the careers of the Venezuelans in the Big Leagues; Omar, all those guys, Andres.   I'm just excited what we do this year, Santana starting with a no‑hitter, following with a perfect game, Cabrera following the Triple Crown and me, excited how we're working hard to get all these things together.   You have to realize in your life, you have to be happy for all the work you do to get here. 

Q.   Marco Scutaro got a two‑out hit right before your second homer.   What did you know about him as a player before he came here and what have you learned about him?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, I know him from the last World Series he played.   He was playing with my brother, the world championship, so I know the kind of player he is.   He's a great baseball player, great person.   You know, the time he get here, when he got traded, you know what, it's one of the best things they do because he wants to help the team.   I know the kind of player he is and the kind of hitter he is.   He plays hard.   You can tell that he gets in the game, the postseason, and is still playing, pulls everything to be there for the team, for his teammates.   He won the MVP.   So I know what kind of player he can be.   I know what he can do.   So I'm happy having him in front of me. 

Q.   You had 12 homers during the regular season and six already in the postseason.   Is this a matter of it took you some time to get back into shape after the hand surgery? 
PABLO SANDOVAL:   I don't know, man.   It's tough when you lose strength in your hand.   It happened to me last time, last year when I lost‑‑ I broke my Hamate bone in my right hand.   It gives some time starting in September.   This year was different because I lost strength, I lost muscle in my hand.   So I just tried to keep focused, the World Series started, don't lose the faith.   I know that strength is going to come back, so it came back at the right time. 

Q.   You said that having fun and playing loose really helps you perform.   How much has somebody like Brian Wilson had to do with that for you; he's not pitching right now, but contributing in that way of keeping things loose? 
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, Brian means a lot for the team.   He's the kind of guy that's loose.   He's always having fun there, making jokes, trying to help get his teammates comfortable on the field, having fun out there.   He's meant a lot for us because he's the kind of guy you want to have right now in the clubhouse when you've got the pressure on, you've got a situation and the feeling you know you can do it.   He's the kind of guy that can go in there, tell you you want to do it, you're gonna do it.   Just happy to have him back there in the clubhouse.

Q.   What can you say about the way Bruce Bochy has managed this year from all the things he's done with the bullpen, giving Brandon Belt and Crawford time to develop and patience with you and everything, the way he's managed?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, the first time I get here I know what kind of manager he is.   He gives an opportunity to all the guys.   He pulls all the guys in there and gives you a chance to play hard.   Younger‑‑ it doesn't matter if you're younger, older, veteran, he's going to give you the opportunity to show what you can do. 
He's been doing a lot of things last year, this year, handling with people hurt, on the DL, moving the right pieces to pull to win games.   I'm happy all the things he's been doing for the team. 

Q.   The first home run last night was on an 0‑2 pitch.   Verlander hadn't given up a home run on an 0‑2 all year.   Most guys are just in protect mode trying to stay alive.   What was the thought process there in that pitch?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   You know, I just tried to protect my zone, get a pitch around the zone.   I know he likes to attack the zone.   He's the kind of guy that attacks.   I just try to protect my zone, and he make a mistake and I take advantage of the mistake.   That's all it matters, all it takes. 

Q.   You talked a little bit about the difference between 2010 and 2012, but what do you remember about the 2010 World Series experience for you?   Was it frustrating?   Were you eager, angry?   How was that experience for you?   What do you remember about it?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   Happy.   Happy guy, man.

Q.   Even though you didn't play?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   Even though I don't play.   You have to be happy.   You know how many guys in the Big Leagues play for 20 years, 13 years, 15 years and don't get rings?   Many guys, so I'm happy.   I just want to enjoy my moment.   That's what I do.   I know after the World Series I have to work hard to get back and the things that I want to do, so that's what I did. 

Q.   Omar Vizquel and some other Venezuelan players have said when they do go home sometimes they're in disguise.   Have you ever had to do that? 
PABLO SANDOVAL:   No.

Q.   Do you think you'll need to now?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   No, I don't think so.   I don't think so.   I'm the kind of guy that spends time with fans out there, spend time with kids.   That's what makes me happy out there. 

Q.   Prince Fielder said I didn't like it, but it was amazing to watch.   I saw on Twitter Matt Kemp, I think you even re‑Tweeted it, Matt Kemp said that was amazing.   When you see some of the best hitters in the game are amazed by something that you do and they talk about it on television or on Twitter, what does that make you feel?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   Excited, happy; one of the best hitters in the Big Leagues, they send you a tweet, "that's incredible what you do."   For me it was exciting to see Matt Kemp, he played with LA, he sent me a tweet saying that.   That means a lot me.   I know that guy because we went to All‑Star Game together, so we talk a lot. 
We went through the same program in Arizona.   There's a lot of things you have to realize in your career, you have to pay attention to all that, all those things, when the guys‑‑ when your friends do good things, you want to support them. 

Q.   By program you mean workout?
PABLO SANDOVAL:   Workout.
