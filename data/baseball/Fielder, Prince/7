 Q. I'm guessing you didn't think Garcia hit you on purpose?
     PRINCE FIELDER: No, not at all.

 Q. So were you surprised that there was warnings?
     PRINCE FIELDER: I don't know. I mean, that's not my -- that's an umpire's call, so I just leave that to them.

 Q. According to people smarter than me, the home run you hit in the fifth inning went 119.2 miles per hour, which is the fastest home run hit in 2011. Did it feel any different to you off the bat?
     PRINCE FIELDER: If felt good (laughter). I thought it might be off the wall or double the gap, and it kind of kept going, so that was good. 

 Q. Was that the biggest home run you've ever hit? 
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah, so far, yeah. 

 Q. You come up with that -- in that kind of an atmosphere, Braun just hit a double, you're looking for a lead, does your focus focus in, is that something that you're suddenly now even more on point than normal?
     PRINCE FIELDER: I guess. Sometimes. When it works out it seems like that. And when it doesn't, it might seem like the other way. 
     In that situation, nobody out with Rickie up next, I was really trying to -- obviously I was trying to drive the ball. But I want to try to get Braun over, at least. So it worked out.

 Q. Part of the home field mystique is you guys never lose when Greinke pitches. Is it talent, is it a belief in the situation, what's going on?
     PRINCE FIELDER: We'll go with talent, I guess (laughter). 

 Q. Roenicke said that when the ball came off the bat he couldn't even hear it it was so loud. 
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah, it was exciting. Yeah, it was really exciting. Kind of -- I heard the crowd, but it was like a blur, you know. I was really trying to see my two boys, to make sure they saw me. So I was just pumped up.

 Q. Do you enjoy making a good defensive play near as much as hitting a home run?
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yes. Yeah, I mean, anytime I can help on defense, it is good. I'm not the greatest defender, by any means, but anytime I can help on -- both sides of the ball, it's good. Because sometimes you're not going to hit. So you've got to pick it up on defense.

 Q. Is there a growing confidence when Rickie pitches here?
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah. I think when anyone pitches here I think we feel good at home. I think it's just the home field advantage that we feel good about. It doesn't matter who's pitching for us, I think at home we just have a lot of confidence.

 Q. Garcia has been tough on the Brewers at times. What were you looking for at the time of the at-bat when you hit the home run?
     PRINCE FIELDER: I don't know. I just try to see the ball and hit it. I was just trying to see a ball to hit, really. I wasn't looking for anything. 

 Q. You and Ryan have been so good together. Do you make each other better in any way?
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Definitely. 
     Whenever he's hitting, and hitting the ball all over the place, I think he wears the pitcher down. So the pitcher is a little worn down and hopefully he'll make a mistake to me, too.

 Q. You were very animated to someone in the stands after the home run, was that your two boys?
     PRINCE FIELDER: My two boys and my wife.

 Q. I think you were even more excited today than after the Game 1 home run?
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah. This is the playoff. You've got to let it all out. 

 Q. The strategy for so many teams is to not let you and Braun beat them. Do you get a little giddy when you see a pitcher is going to let you hit?
     PRINCE FIELDER: I guess. I mean -- I don't know. Obviously I think even when they're trying to pitch me, they're not trying to throw it down the middle, they're trying to get me out. It's fine. I don't really pay attention to it too much, I just try to get a good pitch. 

 Q. As Braun came to bat and then you, did you feel they were going to change pitchers at any point?
     PRINCE FIELDER: When Braun came up? 

 Q. Yes. 
     PRINCE FIELDER: I don't really think that far ahead. I was just trying to watch him do his magic.

 Q. You have Jackson tomorrow, you hit him up for ten runs the first time. Any insight into facing him tomorrow as far as approach and try to get after him the way you did the first time?
     PRINCE FIELDER: We've got to be ready for his mistakes, I think. That's my game plan. Make sure I get a good look at it and hit it hard. I don't really get too serious about it, because then I get confused. My thing is just to see it and hit it. 

 Q. You're in the middle of it, so maybe it's harder to see. Are you ever in awe at how quickly you can change a game offensively?
     PRINCE FIELDER: Yeah, I think that's why we get so excited. Whenever we do do that, it's just awesome, because like you said, it's just real quick. 
     It's a good feeling, because we're down there for a while, and obviously that doesn't feel good. Whenever we come back real quick, it's a little extra boost.
