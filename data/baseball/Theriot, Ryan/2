Cardinals   5
  Phillies - 4

 Q. I want to ask you about the play IbaÃ±ez had just thrown out a runner a couple innings before, just seemed like the throw was a little high. Can you take us through just what respect you have for his arm?
 RYAN THERIOT: Yeah, the one where I scored? 

 Q. Right. 
 RYAN THERIOT: Well, I mean, Oquendo was waving me around. I think at that point you're really trying to read his eyes and see where the ball is, look at the guy behind the plate telling you whether to slide and whatnot. But I was kind of undecided on whether I was going to go up until the last few steps and saw him kind of looking up and start to jump so I tried to slide early and get under the jump. 

 Q. Could you just comment on how it feels to make these contributions tonight and kind of how that ties in with what you did in September? A lot of people credit the moves the team made with us getting here. You lost playing time but then came up with some big hits after that down the stretch and then again tonight. 
 RYAN THERIOT: Right. Yeah, I mean, I know it sounds like a clichÃ©, but it's 25 guys, you're here for the team, you want to do everything you can for the team to win. Also you want to be playing every day, but you've got to be realistic, and when it makes the team stronger, it helps you get to where we are today, then you do it. 
 Tonight to be able to go out there and contribute, like you said, does feel good. So yeah, I mean, it's part of the game. You go out there whenever your name is in the lineup and play as hard as you can. 

 Q. How about that previous play at the plate where I guess Jay comes in right behind you and plows into Ruiz? What was your view of that play?
 RYAN THERIOT: I don't understand the question. What do you mean? 

 Q. Just the collision. Did you think the ball was going to come flying out?
 RYAN THERIOT: I mean, I hoped it would come flying out. You know, yeah, that would have been nice. 

 Q. What was the mindset like falling behind 4-0 with a guy like Cliff Lee on the mound? 
 RYAN THERIOT: Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, had it been in the 7th or 8th inning I think it would have been a different story. It would have probably been more of a panic type feeling. But it was early in the game. Our offense has been wonderful all year, and at that point we had a lot of outs to give. I think, what was it, the 2nd inning, 3rd inning, 4-0? Yeah, plenty of time. Cliff is one of the best out there, and we just tried to throw great at-bats at him, and hopefully we can scratch a few runs. Luckily we were able to tie it and it seemed like we started to get the momentum going, and our bullpen did a phenomenal job. Those guys went out there and really threw the ball well.
