New York - 4, Houston - 1
Q. Do you know yet who you'll start in Game 6 or how you'll handle the pitching situation?
AJ HINCH: No, we'll talk about it on the plane ride home.
Q. Can you tell us what happened with Verlander there in the first inning and how he was able to get back on track?
AJ HINCH: Yeah, he was incredible after the first. They felt really good about going into the bottom of the first. We had put up a run and then we were just barely a few feet away from putting up a second run with Bregman's bullet to left field. And then we go into the bottom of the first, LeMahieu took a couple big swings, hits the homer and woke up the building. And Judge hit a pitch he hasn't pulled hardly at all this season for the bullet base hit. And then Torres did what Torres has been doing this series, which is pretty good at-bat, snuck a ball inside the line. And then Hicks had a really good at-bat in a mistake slider for a homer off the foul pole 315 feet away.
I thought he recovered great and did his best to continue to keep us in the game, because that was a great recovery after an inning that looked like it was spiraling away from him. The two balls that they hit, unfortunately, went out of the ballpark.
Q. How much are you considering replacing Yordan Alvarez in the lineup tomorrow?
AJ HINCH: He'll be there. He'll DH and bat 7th.
Q. Just for a little more detail, when you decide what you're going to do tomorrow, is it basically a bullpen game?
AJ HINCH: It will be a bullpen game.
Q. And you'll save Cole if there's a Game 7?
AJ HINCH: I said it would be a bullpen game tomorrow, and I'm unlikely to use Cole, correct.
