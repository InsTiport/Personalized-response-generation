Q.  Garret, are you surprised you've been able to match the Yankees pretty much home run for home run with your power? 

GARRET ANDERSON:  As far as the power, we're not trying to match the Yankees, you know, home run for home run.  We're a good hitting team.  We hit hard line drives.  Our home runs fortunately get down the side, get out of the park. 

Q.  If I could ask both of you to answer separately, what do you think you showed the nation?  People who don't know much about the Angels, maybe they've seen you for the first or second time this season, what have you shown them the past two nights about this team?

TROY GLAUS:  I think, first and foremost, I think this team, we play good, solid baseball.  We do a lot of little things that need to be done to win ball games.  We pitch well, we hit well.  Like Mike was saying, we run the bases well.  We're not the home-run-bashing team.  That's not what we do.  We do what it takes to win no matter what the circumstance or whatever.  

GARRET ANDERSON:  I think, personally, we've been doing this a couple years now, just starting to get the national exposure.  But it doesn't surprise me, what we're doing because we come to play every day.  We don't worry about what happened yesterday.  I mean, it was a tough loss.  Today it was the same business as usual  - come out, hit the ball, put some good at-bats at people, throw some good pitches. 

Q.  The way El Duque had been pitching up to that point, what was your approach going into both of your at-bats? 

GARRET ANDERSON:  My approach, not really dictating the pitcher, but I'm a fastball hitter, I hit off the fastball.  So I'm constantly looking for fastballs.  I'm not going to sit up there and sit on different pitches all the time.  I look for fastball, and hit off of it.  Fortunately, he left one out over the plate for me.  The bat before that, he got a good pitch after my fly to center.  That time I just didn't miss the pitch. 

TROY GLAUS:  Obviously, off a guy like El Duque, especially from the right side of the plate, you got to make sure he elevates the ball - or get a pitch that's elevated.  In my first at-bat he didn't elevate anything.  The second pitch, that at-bat, he elevated a fastball  - or third pitch I guess. I mean, just a matter of not missing at that point. 

Q.  What was the attitude in the dugout amongst yourselves and your teammates when the Yankees started to claw back into this game?  What were you talking about, thinking about?  Were you nervous that this was going to be another Yankee comeback? 

GARRET ANDERSON:  Not nervous, no.  Just a lot of respect for their team.  I know what they're capable of doing.  So just praying that we, you know, our pitchers make their pitches and we play good defense.  They're not going to stop coming at you.  They've proven that time and time again. 

Q.  How important was it to come out of here 1-1 instead of going to California 0-2, knowing to win the series you have to come back here to win? 

GARRET ANDERSON:  (Laughing)  I think that's obvious.  Definitely to get one in their park, that's huge.  I'm not going to go and say we're going to run the table on them in Anaheim.  But to take one in somebody else's park in the playoffs, you've accomplished something  - especially in this park where they make things happen.  I always hear that things happen for them, but those players are good players, they make things happen.
