Q.   What did you say to Brad when you went to the mound there before the Pujols at-bat?

PHIL GARNER:  We didn't have to give in to him, make your pitches, doesn't matter if we walk him.  He made a bad pitch. 

Q.  Can you just describe the change in emotion? 

PHIL GARNER:  Well, it's terrible, you're high as a kite one minute.  The mistake we make is walking Edmonds.  You have to let Edmonds hit the ball in the next count.  You can't walk him and Brad knows that and that was a mistake. Then, of course, you know, we were feeling pretty good, but you have to play every out.  We failed to play every out tonight.  We just didn't do it. 

Q.  You are obviously still winning the series, but is this a momentum-shifter? 

PHIL GARNER:  Well, I don't know.  We've lost some tough ballgames on the course of the season, and we managed to bounce back from it.  It's a tough loss, no question and we have our fans behind us here.  We were down and it looked like we were not going anywhere and came up with a big blow from Berkman and all of a sudden we have the lead and we have the bullpen set up the way you want it set up and a lot of things go in our favor this game tonight and it didn't turn out the right way.  Tough loss, no question, but we've still got a lot of baseball to play.  No question in my mind that we'll bounce back and play well. 

Q.  How tough is it when you have now an extra day off to think about everything? 

PHIL GARNER:  Well, I don't think that matters anything.  We're going to have to -- we have a day off to travel and that's probably a good thing.  Then we're just going to have to play hard when we get to St. Louis.
