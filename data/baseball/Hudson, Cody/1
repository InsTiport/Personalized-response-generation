COACH McCLURE:   Well, thanks again.   First of all, I want to congratulate Indiana and Tracy Smith.   He runs a great program, a really classy guy.   He's a friend, and I wish him well, super regional.   They did a great job.   
Our guys I thought really came out ready to play.   You know, we didn't get off to a good start in the first inning on the mound, but I thought we swung the bats really, really well early in the game, first four innings or so.   We made hard out after hard out after hard out.   
You know, they made a huge defensive play in center field and I think that was the difference in the game tonight.   
   
 Q.   Cody, what did you see?   
CODY HUDSON:   I thought it was going.   Made a little baserunning mistake.   Should have seen it over the fence before I advanced any farther, got to second and couldn't get back.   But made a great play.  
   
 Q.   Casey, you had to come out on the mound after that; what was your mind‑set coming out?   
CASEY DELGADO:   I just wanted to come out and throw strikes, really keep the team in it, and try to go as far as I could.  
   
 Q.   Just to put a point on that, how much does it take out of you when you basically have one that far over the wall and it should by all rights be 3‑0 and you don't get anything out of it.   
CODY HUDSON:   A huge one, killer for us, and I think a big momentum boost for them and I think that was really the difference in the game right there.   
   
 Q.   What was sort of better for you tonight in terms of location, or what was it that I guess was just working for you tonight that wasn't earlier on last night?   
CASEY DELGADO:   I was able to keep the ball down.   That's where I ran into trouble last night.   I was able to keep the ball down and it helped set up my off‑speed pitches which were working pretty well tonight, so that was the biggest thing I think.  
   
 Q.   Coach always talks about you being better after a bad start; what do you think allows to you do that?   
CASEY DELGADO:   Kind of lights a fire under me I guess.   Gives me a little motivation to make up for my bad outing I guess.   
   
 Q.   Going back to the Valpo game, you get another big home run, were you thinking‑‑  
MICHAEL DAVIS:   I mean, really, I wasn't‑‑ when I came up there, I was just trying to get on base for the guys behind me and he just happened to leave one up and just found the barrel.  
   
 Q.   You came up in a big situation‑‑ indiscernible ‑‑ what happened in that at‑bat?   
MICHAEL DAVIS:   He kind of had it up with the off‑speed and I just tried to battle back and get on base really.   I didn't want to make an out at all costs.   I mean, that's all I was trying to do.   
   
 Q.   Tyler pitches the last few innings, you guys are all giving him hugs, what was that moment like for you guys?   
CASEY DELGADO:   He's been absolutely unreal for us.   He's been fantastic.   You couldn't have asked for a better pitcher to close out games for us, 23 saves in a season is unheard of.   I mean, that was awesome.   
MICHAEL DAVIS:   Just to reiterate what Casey said, Tyler did a great job for us all year.   I only got to play with him for one year but it was one of the most impressive things I've seen out of a pitcher.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like if you went out the right way; if you had to lose, you went out the right way?   
CASEY DELGADO:   I think so.   I think we gave it everything we had.   The ball just didn't fall our way today.   
MICHAEL DAVIS:   I mean, hats off to Indiana.   They played great.   But I mean, I still think we could have played a better game, but you can't take anything away from them.   They played great and they made some huge plays.   
   
 Q.   Let's start with that play again, you were up at third base, what did you see?   Did you think it was gone?   
COACH McCLURE:   Yeah, it was definitely going to be a home run.   You know, the wind was kind of going across at that time, so it knocked it down a little bit.   You know, had it been one of the other days, it would have been, you know, well gone.   But it was going to be gone.   
The guy came out of nowhere.   He went up and made an unbelievable catch.   You know, I mean, in my opinion, he saved the game for them.   It didn't matter what he did the rest of the day.   He had done his job today on that play.   If he went 0‑for or whatever he did; as long as he made the rest of the plays, he had done his job for today.     
That's what speed does for you sometimes, and you know, the kid's a great athlete and he plays a great center field.   So you know what do you do?   It ripped our hearts out and was a huge plus for them.  
   
 Q.   Was it reminiscent of last year's catch in the 1‑0 game?  
COACH McCLURE:   I compared it to that.   I was telling Bob who is running a regional that last year against Indiana state, we beat them 1‑0 out in Oregon in the regional, and against a left‑hander, I can't think of his name for the life‑‑ yeah, McNarick (ph) our centerfielder went up and took a home run away early in the game and beat them 1‑0.   So it was, yeah, scary.   
   
 Q.   Both coaches went to their closers relatively early obviously.   How big was that for them and for you guys, especially when Halstead comes in and gets that strikeout; how much does that take out of you guys, as well?  
COACH McCLURE:   He did a good job.   He challenged us and you know, went at us and did what he had to do.   You know, we‑‑ that was kind of the ballgame right there.   
You know, after everything that had happened early and we lined out a bunch of times and stuff like that, that was really kind of the ballgame right there, bases loaded, two hits, we're right there.   I think it's 4‑1 at the time and two hits, we're right there, that's all we needed.   
But did a great job.   Did a great job.   Threw strikes.   Did what he had to do.   
   
 Q.   Talk us through the decision to bring Delgado in in the second inning; was there a conversation based on how he felt from last night or what went into the decision‑making process?  
COACH McCLURE:   You know, I thought about starting him and we got him out of the game last night, he wasn't throwing well anyway.   But we went ahead and got him out as quick as we did and didn't give him any more chance because we thought, you know, if we can push this thing and get back in this thing somehow and get to the championship, we could bring him back.   
You know, I thought about starting him and maybe second guessing myself, I should have.   We wanted to try to get one or two innings out of Corey and bring him; and we thought maybe that could get us to six and we could hand it over to our bullpen which has done a great job this year.   But unfortunately we gave up the three runs in the first, but you've got to give them credit for that.   We hit the ball hard.   
You know, I talked about it last night.   You didn't see Delgado the real guy; tonight you saw him just minus a little bit of freshness.   But you know, the kid can really pitch.   He's got a heart the size of this room, and he really battles.   
   
 Q.   Cody had some big hits, and Casey and Tyler both gave you big performances; how special is it to see the four seniors like that?   
COACH McCLURE:   It's great.   You know, any time you have seniors, you spend a lot of time with them and you want them to do well and they have been very, very‑‑ I mean, every one of them was a big part of our program, and that's a neat thing.   We didn't have many.   We only had four.   But they were all huge throughout their careers here.   I mean, huge, huge, huge.   
You know, I think they will all play at the next level.   I don't think they are done playing baseball yet.   Just they are for me.   You hate to see them go, but you know, I guess the time has come.   But I'll tell you what:   They have been a part of some unbelievable things.   They have been to three regionals in a row, and they have taken our program to a new level.   Really proud of them.
