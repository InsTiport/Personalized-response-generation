Georgia Tech   6
  Miami   3

COACH MORRIS:   Both starting pitchers pitched well.   I thought there in the 7th inning we had trouble, a ton of guys in trouble with the bunt.   Two bunts and we made a really good play on the second one on the safety squeeze, but that kind of got us out of rhythm.   Didn't locate a couple pitches maybe they should have, and just back‑to‑back things that happened right there.   But, oh well, we played good defense.   They got some hits when it counted and we didn't.

Q.   Georgia Tech said you guys threw (No audio). 
COACH MORRIS:   They beat us 3 out of 4, 22‑5.   Doesn't anything concern me other than our final record and how we're playing.   They played good.   They played good at the semis last year to be honest.   When we played them, they beat us 2 out of 3 in Atlanta.   It's been so long ago.

Q.   You guys have been on such a streak.   To come in here so hot, can you just comment on losing the first game in the tournament? 
ANDREW SUAREZ:   It's always something we want to do, but we've been hot lately.   Just because we got one today doesn't mean we can't start another streak, and that's what we plan on doing.

Q.   How characteristic is it for both Cooper and Thomas to give up runs in the same innings?   Do you feel they weren't competing today? 
COACH MORRIS:   I thought they did a good job standing by and hitting the ball the other way and got some big hits for them out there.   Cooper's 5‑0 and he pitches very well, E.R.A. under 2, he just didn't have his best outing.   The same situation comes up tomorrow, and he'll be pitching again.   I can tell you that.   He's had a very good season.

Q.   When that first sacrifice bunt, it looked like the throw was there and the second baseman was not on the bag.   Did that catch you surprise on the bunt? 
COACH MORRIS:   Well, if you've got a man on first, and your middle infielders are cheating up the middle for a double‑play, which they have to do, and the guy shows the bunt late, it was a late kind of a push bunt, either the pitcher's got to be at first, or the first baseman has to get back.   David broke hard all the way in and Andy broke hard.   And it's very hard for a second baseman to get to first base on that play.   Honestly, I don't think it would have been a good throw if we would have had him at first base. 

Q.   Can you talk about that play? 
DALE CAREY:   Yeah, David and I both went hard to the ball.   When I went to look, I saw hands running in, and I thought that I could throw it on time.   But I threw it behind him.

Q.   Jim, you're up 3‑1, and it looked like you guys were cruising?
COACH MORRIS:   Yeah, I felt really good at that point when we jumped up 3‑1.   Andy was throwing outstanding, and our bullpen was great all year.   You have to be feeling good with the defense we've played throughout the year.   But baseball is a game you have to play nine innings and no clock to run out, so you have to play it all out until the end.   They did a good job to keep battling.

Q.   You had a great game individually when you were up 3‑1, and Andy was cruising.   Like Coach said, everything was just going your way. 
ANDREW SUAREZ:   Yeah, same thing coach said.   Doing a good job and trusting our bullpen, so we for sure thought at 3‑1 we could add on some more runs and keep them at bay, but they're such a great hitting team and they did a great job today.

Q.   Talk about their defense too.   They made some great plays defensively. 
COACH MORRIS:   They did.   They played really well today.   I thought both clubs played good defense.   That bunt thing we kind of messed up there.   But it was a tough play there.   It was kind of in between, and they played good defense too.   I thought there in the 8th we ran on the pitch, it was 3‑2.   And when Willie Abreu got the base hit to left field, and we had first and third, I was thinking we're going to come back.   We've been doing it all year.   Of course Lopez hit a scorcher one‑hopper right at third, and it was an easy double play ball.
