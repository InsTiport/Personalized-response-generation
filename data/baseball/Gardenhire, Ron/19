 THE MODERATOR: Thanks for coming in. Let's take the first question. 

 Q. What was your view of Mauer's ball down the line there? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: We didn't have it. You can't see from the dugout. You can't see at all from the dugout, but I think we all know the ball was fair by a long ways. 

 Q. Ron, obviously handing the 2-1 lead to the closer in the ninth. Can you describe Nathan's performance?
 RON GARDENHIRE: You know, you got behind Alex there, Teixeira got one. He got one up -- then he got behind him, I think trying to spin the ball. When you get behind the guy, then you have to attack there. That's what happens. You get behind in the count and you have to make -- you try make a pitch, and he banged it. 

 Q. How deflating is this? How tough is this going to be? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: It's really disappointing. I've been walked off enough times here. Some of the things that happened out there were pretty disappointing. Pretty good too. It was a good baseball game. A lot of things could have went either way. But didn't go our way again tonight. You end up getting walked off again. 

 Q. Ron, you obviously went with your starter as long as you could. Must have been a tough decision to pull him out with the two-hitter. 
 RON GARDENHIRE: He had a 3-hitter, I think. But I think that inning -- I think you probably saw Posada hit a rocket to left-center field. Jeter hit a rocket to right center field. That was that 90-plus pitch frame at the end of the year. You get in there and the ball was starting to get up. Guys were hitting it pretty hard. So talked with my pitching coach, we said we have to go to left-on-left here and see what happens. 

 Q. The play at second, too, that turns out to be a decisive run. Gomez overrunning second base? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: Yeah. I mean -- yeah. He was a little overzealous there. Rounded a little bit. It's pretty damp out there on the infield. They keep it a little soft. He spun out trying to get back. 
 That's not a good play. You either just keep going or you have to recognize it's coming in right behind you and shut it down. 

 Q. If Joe Mauer's hit had been called fair, how would that have changed that last inning? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: What did the next guy do? 

 Q. Single. 
 RON GARDENHIRE: Next guy got a single. You can figure that out, I think. 

 Q. Do you think there should be an instant replay for more than just home runs? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: It's not my call. I'm just managing a baseball team. I can't make that decision for them. There's not. We had six umpires out there. I think, right, six? Six umpires. 

 Q. Nathan had converted 12 in a row. The other day he mentioned he could use a break just from the 12-inning game. How do you think he -- just in terms of when he's at his best and towards the end of the year now, how -- the life on his fastball, all that stuff? 
 RON GARDENHIRE: I think you just said it. He's converted 12 in a row. I think the life on his fastball and his stuff has been pretty good he had a day off yesterday. Normally you give Nate a day off and -- or two days off really and you give him that and he's pretty good. Tonight he just got behind. Throwing the breaking ball got behind and got one up to Alex, and Alex did what do you when you get a pitch down the middle. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks for come in.
