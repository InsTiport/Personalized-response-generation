Q.  Talk about Curt's performance today. 

JASON VARITEK:  It was overall just a very solid performance.  He was able to leave us in that game.  We were able to come up with a big inning.  He was strong, and I think he was just a touch off a little bit, for him, you know, just a little bit on his location, but he did a fabulous job in allowing us to score some runs. 


Q.  Your last two appearances in the post-season so you (inaudible) game one in the division series.  How does it feel to take game 1?

JASON VARITEK: You know, it's a thing where you just have to concentrate day in and day out, doesn't matter what happens, and we got one under our belt, played the game well, played very nice defense today, and it's a good momentum builder. 


Q.  And Pedro going tomorrow?

JASON VARITEK: What about him?  


Q.  How do you feel?

JASON VARITEK: Oh, I mean he is Pedro Martinez.  He can surprise a lot of people every time he takes the ball. 


Q.  Just we talk so much about the one two punch that this team has with Schilling and Martinez.  How important do you think that is?

JASON VARITEK: I think pitching is important period.  You still have to execute your pitches, and when this team has played well, we have done that.  And we have to continue to do that to play well. 


Q.  Are you curious to see how Pedro will come out after the tough part at the end of the regular season?

JASON VARITEK: Honestly, I am not real worried about Pedro.  Pedro knows, he knows what time of year it is.  He has the ability to compete, and that's what's made him Pedro Martinez, is his ability to compete, and it doesn't matter what's happened to him or if he has had a rough outing or has had a great one, he knows how to compete.
