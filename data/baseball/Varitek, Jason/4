   JASON VARITEK:  This team has got a lot of heart.  We worked real hard from the staff to the scouts to the teammates to everybody.  We just beat a very, very good team, an excellent team.  We had to do the little things, and we were able to.   
  
  Q.  Unfortunate not being able to celebrate at Fenway, so what do you say to Red Sox Nation everywhere?   
 JASON VARITEK:  I thank them.  Every guy, every woman, whoever it was, they've always been there.  It makes it a special place to play, and I'm just happy right now.   
  
  Q.  When we asked fans which team was better, the 2004 team or this team?   
 JASON VARITEK:  I don't know, there's no comparison, different battles, different things to go through.  This team didn't hit quite as well as the other one, but we hit well late.  It doesn't compare.   
  
  Q.  How was the performance by Jon Lester, Mike Lowell?   
 JASON VARITEK:  You know, it was phenomenal.  We were in some tough spots and he made some pitches and stayed aggressive through the zone, and it was such a big part.  He hadn't pitched since Cleveland, and to have that kind of performance, it was just a testament to him.
