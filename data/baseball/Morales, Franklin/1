   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  What's the coldest weather you've ever pitched in?   
 FRANKLIN MORALES:  40 degrees.   
  
  Q.  Your success after coming up through the Minors seems to be that you've got your pitching under control.  Then in the first game against the Phillies, you know, a little wildness crept back in.  Do you see yourself having to guard against that tomorrow?   
 FRANKLIN MORALES:  Tomorrow, when I pitch, I'm just going to worry on concentrating, what I've done my whole career, is just pitch.   
  
  Q.  How will weather like this affect you in your pitching?   
 FRANKLIN MORALES:  It doesn't affect me to pitch in the cold.   
  
  Q.  What's been the key to your success?  You went from AA essentially to the Rockies in a stretch run in a pennant race and you've been able to provide them a big lift.  What's been the key to your success?   
 FRANKLIN MORALES:  It doesn't matter where I pitch, Minor Leagues or Big Leagues.  I just keep my focus and I keep doing what got me here.   
  
  Q.  What did you learn from that game against the Phillies?   
 FRANKLIN MORALES:  To maintain my focus and my concentration.  Just one inning in the game against the Phillies I got out of balance.   
 THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
