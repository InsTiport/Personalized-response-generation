 Q.   Do we have an update on Hanley's condition?   
DON MATTINGLY:   Well, it's the same condition, just it didn't‑‑ he was having a little more trouble today as the game went on.   It got worse as we went along.   We'll try it again tomorrow.   We'll see where he goes tomorrow, if he's able to get loose and basically we are at the same spot.  
   
 Q.   Much like last night when you grabbed the lead and that gave your team energy, tonight, when they grabbed the lead, did it feel like that sucked it out a little bit?   
DON MATTINGLY:   Well, obviously, they get the momentum when they get the lead early.   But we get it to 3‑2, we kind of bounce back and get right back in it.   At that point, it's a ballgame.   
Our pen really did a pretty good job for us.   We only gave up one run after that, gave us a chance to put something on the board.   We just weren't able to put anything on the board after that.  
   
 Q.   With your backs against the wall, obviously now, what is going through your minds?   What is the feeling after tonight and just being on the brink?   
DON MATTINGLY:   Well, to be honest with you, we don't have a lot of time to think about it.   We're down 3‑1.   That's not a real secret.   But we're going to be playing at 1 o'clock tomorrow.   Kind of the best thought I have is I've got one of the best pitchers in baseball pitching tomorrow.   If we come out here and play well tomorrow and get a win, I've probably got the best pitcher in baseball pitching the next day.   
Ryu hasn't been too bad.   So if there's any good thoughts it's that I know tomorrow we'll come ready to play.   It's a quick turnaround.   We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves.   We'll be ready to play tomorrow.   That's all there is to it.  
   
 Q.   Dovetailing off the talk about the momentum just going back to them, everything that Matheny seemed to do tonight worked.   He brought in a pinch hitter, got the home run, changed the infield around and they got that nice double‑play.   Can you talk about that?   In your dugout it must be like what have we got to do?   And for the manager, it's got to bring his confidence level up when he does something like that.   
DON MATTINGLY:   I never thought about that, confidence of the manager.   Again, we didn't do what we needed to do.   We weren't able to score after that.   Obviously, when Kozma comes in the game, he makes a nice play on‑‑ I don't know if it's Papi there, he hits the ball in the hole.   Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to answer that really.  
   
 Q.   Knowing your team the way you do, is this the type of team that is going to be down about this tonight?   Or is it going to be able to shake it off and say, okay, we've got to win three games in a row?   
DON MATTINGLY:   I think it's a little bit of both.   I think you're going to be a little bit down.   You're in the playoffs, so it's a big game for us, felt like we needed a win.   Talked about it, you felt like you wanted a win every day.   But on the back side of that, we'll bounce back and be ready to play tomorrow.   I don't think we need to think about winning three.   We need to win one.   That's all we need to do is win one game.   We've got a pretty good guy on the hill tomorrow.   You feel like you're going to have a pretty good chance of winning tomorrow.   So we'll see where it goes.  
   
 Q.   What was your sense of Lynn's vulnerability in the fourth inning?   It seemed like a lot of plays started jumping after he buzzed Puig and some stuff happened and obviously got out of it with a double‑play ball.   But how did you sense that inning going up‑and‑down for you?  
DON MATTINGLY:   It felt, obviously, to get two back right there, you feel like you're back in it right away and momentum's kind of coming our way.   At that point you're going to hit for Ricky to try to get another one, get a lead in there.   
So, again, at that point you feel good.   I feel pretty good.   Obviously, like to be tied or with the lead or whatever.   But going from three down to one down early in the game‑‑ like that was the fourth, right?   You've got a ballgame.   At that point you hope Chris comes in and throws well.   He did.   Our bullpen did a nice job for us, really.   Gave us a chance to get in the game.   We just didn't put another run up after that.  
   
 Q.   Do you think Lynn was vulnerable?   
DON MATTINGLY:   Well, obviously, we had him on the ropes a little bit.   But every time you get out of one of those, you get a chance to regroup.   So when he gets the double‑play ball, he kind of like, okay, I'm still up a run.   So he gets a chance to regroup.   If we can keep pressure on him right away again, but we didn't, so...  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the thought process?   How close you came to throwing Greinke today, changing the rotation, and what the final decision was putting Ricky in today?   
DON MATTINGLY:   Just didn't feel good about it.   As we talked through it, I think that's one of those things that you've got to feel a hundred percent sure that's the right thing, and it didn't feel that way.   We felt Ricky would give us a good game.   We've got a game pitched well enough tonight to win.   
So now we sit here with Zack on full rest.   Hopefully he pitches the way he's capable.   We'll sit with Kershaw on full rest, and then we'll be with Ryu at full rest.   We've got three pretty good guys going the next three days.   Again, I don't want to be down, but if you're going to be down, I like the guys we've got going the next three days or next four.  
   
 Q.   Was there any sense that Lynn was trying to send a message with the pitch high and tight to Puig there?   
DON MATTINGLY:   I don't think so.   It's first and second there, right?   So, his ball run across the plate all the time.   I know they're trying too pitch him in and it gets way.   I don't think there is any message trying to be sent there.
