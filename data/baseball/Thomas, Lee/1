   LEE THOMAS:  The Phillies have acquired Bobby Abreu through the Tampa Bay club.  We have given them Kevin Stocker.  Probably the toughest decision for us to do was to give them Kevin Stocker.  Not only is he a good player but a super guy and he did a great job for us.  But this allows Desi Reliford to play shortstop. We think he has very high ceiling.  And Bobby Abreu will get every opportunity to play.   
 TERRY FRANCONA:  Like Lee said, I concur, it was a very tough decision, because Stock is so reliable and he's such a good person.  But this move was made to help us get better, not for April, but for '98 and '99 and a key word in this is going to be patience, but I think both Bobby and Desi have very high ceilings, and I think with our patience is going to turn out to be a good move for the Phillies.   
  
  Q.  Without naming names, of course, roughly how many other deals did you guys possibly have in the works?   
 LEE THOMAS:  I don't think we were close to anything but this, really, there were some other  players that were not available.
