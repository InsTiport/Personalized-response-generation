 Q.   Did this one feel a little bit like last year?   I know you're not going to throw the defense under the bus, but with a little bit more support things might have been different?   
KRIS MEDLEN:   No.   I mean, I think I need to make better pitches.   I think it was one of those games where I felt like I came out strong.   It was probably one of the coolest first innings I've ever thrown with the crowd and whatever else.   I think it was just one of those games where even when I felt like I made pitches, they still found places to put them.   
They're a great team, and when you have an opposing pitcher on the mound who is as good as Kershaw, I mean, there's not a lot of room for error, and I had a lot of error tonight.   Obviously frustrating, but that's the beauty of there being a series rather than just a one‑game thing, and I think it's a lot different than last year.   
   
 Q.   Fredi was saying he felt like guys were over‑amped.   Do you think that's fair?  
KRIS MEDLEN:   I don't think so.   I think we came in as normal as I guess you can be.   Like I said, knowing the kind of pitcher you're about to face, obviously I think you are aware of his skill level.   But other than that, I mean, I really felt like a normal kind of a thing other than starting extremely late tonight.   But for the most part, it felt like a normal game.   We had a great crowd, and they really showed up and they were loud, which was good.   But I just think the game comes down to me.   If you don't give up any runs, you don't lose.   We got one off Kershaw, and if I put up zeros, it should be good enough, but it wasn't tonight.  
   
 Q.   The pitch that GonzÃ¡lez hit out, the changeup he hit‑‑  
KRIS MEDLEN:   Yeah, I started off with a changeup the first at‑bat, he swung and missed.   We tried to do the same exact thing.   I almost let it go knowing he was sitting on it.   I let it go thinking if I executed it, I could still get him to roll it over or whatever it is.   It's been a successful pitch for me and something I've been relying on the entire year.   
But he's one of the best hitters in the game, Adrian GonzÃ¡lez.   It was an 0‑0 changeup, but it was a very bad 0‑0 changeup.   And he put a really good swing on it, and for someone to take it dead center like that, he's got a good swing.   I wish I could have got on base to tell him how good his swing is for him.  
   
 Q.   If y'all are able to push this to your next turn to a fourth or fifth game, what would you take away from this one for your next one?   Anything you'd do differently?  
KRIS MEDLEN:   I don't think so.   Obviously I need to change something, but we and Mac had a game plan and we tried to execute it as well as possible.   Like I said, when I made pitches, I felt like they put them in good spots and made some decent swings on them.   But for the most part, they're a good team, and with no room for error.   You can't give Kershaw any room.   
   
 Q.   I know you said it felt a lot different than last year, but was there any kind of sense of dÃ©jÃ ‑vu?   
KRIS MEDLEN:   It's baseball.   You feel good one moment and then you can still feel good and give up hits.   Like I've said twice, I felt like I made some good pitches to some guys.   And I felt like Puig's singles, any time you can keep him in the park it's a success.   I feel like I made good pitches and went in with a lot of confidence in every pitch that I threw.   But for the most part, they put some good things on some balls and some other ones didn't go my way, our way.   But any time you have a guy like Kershaw, like I said, he's obviously the game's best, and you can't mess up like that.
