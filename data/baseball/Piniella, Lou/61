Q. What's the quick turnaround going to be like for your team?

LOU PINIELLA: You mean the 12 o'clock game?

Q. That, too. 

LOU PINIELLA: (Laughing.) Well, we'll wait and see what happens on the field. I think
we'll play a good ball game. We've got a little more age than their team. But outside of a
few positions, we've been able to rest this team all year. 

Q. Did the turnaround affect how you made up your line-up in terms of age and all that?

LOU PINIELLA: We're playing the same line-up except for Wilson, he's catching. 

Q. Everyone healthy from yesterday?

LOU PINIELLA: Everybody's healthy. Probably won't have Tomko in the bullpen today.
Outside of that, everybody else is ready to go, both pitching and playing wise. 

Q. Is Game 4 still Moyer or Halama?

LOU PINIELLA: Yes, one of the two and they're both available in the bullpen today. In
fact, they'll both be out there. 

Q. For those of us who haven't been out there, is your ballpark considered a pitcher's
park? How would you describe it?

LOU PINIELLA: You can hit the ball out, but the alleys are big and so is the
centerfield area. I would define it as more of a pitcher's park than a lot of the parks in
the league. This park here is big, but when the weather's warm, it seems to carry very,
very well. 

Q. You were able to handle Thomas, Ordonez and Lee quite easily yesterday. Any
strategy?

LOU PINIELLA: Well, they're three great hitters. It's important to handle the middle
part of their line-up although it's just as important to keep their first two hitters off
base. We have definite ideas on what we want to do with them pitching-wise, but it's up to
our pitchers to execute. Hopefully we'll handle these guys because they can really hurt
you with the bat.
