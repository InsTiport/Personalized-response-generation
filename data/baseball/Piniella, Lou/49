Q.  The way the game started, did you think that you guys were going to get Pettitte? 
 
LOU PINIELLA:   Well, we had chances there in the first two innings.  We had the right people up at home plate and just didn't get the big hit.  But I just have a feeling we're going to start hitting the ball pretty good in the series, starting tomorrow, I really do. 
 
Q.  Were you surprised that Bernie was given a green light on 3-0 in the second inning? 
 
LOU PINIELLA:   I don't know, he's a pretty good hitter, and the pitcher was just laying one in there.  It was a good call by Joe. 
 
Q.  Aaron, it seemed like three or four times, he just made bad pitches that cost him.
 
LOU PINIELLA:   Well, I don't know about that.  The other -- give the hitters some credit.  They went out and got, what?  13 or so hits tonight, whatever it was.  They swung the bats.  We know what we have to do to get them out; just a matter of making the pitches. 
 
Q.  You said you had a feeling that you're going to start hitting.  Is there something specific that gives you that feeling?
 
LOU PINIELLA:   Well, we got ten hits tonight, and that's a pretty good start.  We didn't get any runs to speak of, but it starts with getting people on base, and tonight we got them on base.  I just have a feeling we're going to come out tomorrow and start swinging the bats the way we're capable of. 
 
Q.  This was the first game in the post-season that the Yankees have sustained an offense throughout the game.  Does that concern you?
 
LOU PINIELLA:   We should have thrown out their baserunner stealing second base.  Both teams, they have gotten big innings off of us.  We have given them extra outs, and you just can't do that. I don't think you can do that against any good team.
