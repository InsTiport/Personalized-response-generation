   ENDY CHAVEZ: Here you feel like a little kid. There's no money. You have to play hard. Don't matter who you are, you have to play hard. And play for your country. I think that's the biggest thing that I have on my mind.  
  
  Q. You made a game seven catch?  
 ENDY CHAVEZ: Wait (remembering)...   
 That was outstanding. That was something, making that catch for the team. I mean, it's unbelievable and it's pretty good team.  
 But like I said, representing my country is something special. Nothing compares with that. And it's something that, you know, it's hard to explain. I feel happy just to wear the uniform and play for my country.  
 Like I say, you know, we all, my teammates, you know, around whole Venezuela, and it's nice. I enjoy a lot. And, you know, we got a lot of talent to come here at this level.
