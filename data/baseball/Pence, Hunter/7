Q.   This thing you have been doing in the dugout before the games these past few days, have you always been like this?   I've never seen something like this in baseball. 
HUNTER PENCE:   Yeah, I don't think‑‑ that's kind of what it's about, that's just us.   We don't really‑‑ coming together and‑‑ yeah, it's not‑‑ I don't know where it came from. 
It just kind of happened and the guys liked it, felt good.   So we kept doing it. 

Q.   Take me through your emotions of the 9th inning as everything was unfolding.   Tying run is on, go‑ahead run is at the plate, you've seen crazy things in this ballpark, what were you thinking? 
HUNTER PENCE:   I was like, I love this moment.   This is so incredible. 
You saw guts from both sides.   That's what playoff baseball‑‑ this is the best in the league, the best in the world playing right now, and you saw some of the best at‑bats you're going to see against one of the best pitchers you'll see.   So I was like, whatever happens this is an incredible moment, and I love playing out here. 

Q.   Can you talk about the chemistry the team has had since you joined the team? 
HUNTER PENCE:   We have a unique chemistry, definitely it's hard to explain in words, but you can feel everyone really just coming together, everyone playing for each other.   When you're out there, you see gutsy performances by Matt Cain by Gregor Blanco, by Brandon Crawford. 
We all feed off of it, and that's the best way I can describe it is that we are all different.   There are a lot of different personalities and we accept each other for who we are and go out there and play for each other.
