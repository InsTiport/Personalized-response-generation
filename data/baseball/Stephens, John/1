   JOE GOLDSTEIN:  Let's go ahead with your questions. 
 Q.  David, did it surprise you how lopsided this came out tonight? 
 DAVE NILSSON:  Yeah, it was an extremely surprising result for us.  You have to give them credit.  They played very well.  They swung the bats very well and their starting pitcher, he really threw the ball well and put them in a good position to get a W. 
 But to answer your question, it's extremely disappointing on our behalf to not even compete and to not even make it close. 
 Q.  John, in your minor league career in the States control has always been a big thing for you, but today it seemed to kind of desert you.  Can you pinpoint that somehow.  Was it the cold weather or anything that any reason that felt a little off tonight? 
 JOHN STEPHENS:  No, just missed my spots.  Just not missed by a lot, just a little down and a couple more inches would have been a different game.  But it's just tough when you go out there and you don't have that location.  And I definitely need that. 
 JOE GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you for coming.
