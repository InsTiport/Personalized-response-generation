  Q.  Tom, I was wondering if you were surprised you weren't one of the three pull-backs?   
 TOM MARTIN:  It's hard to tell.  All I could do is go by what the papers thought.  And I really didn't know what kind of situation I was in to begin with, so I'm not really sure.   
  
  Q.  Are you upset, Tom?   
 TOM MARTIN:  No, I'm not upset.  I think it's going to be exciting.  We've got a new ball club, ballpark, new staff, meet some new people.  I think it's going to be outstanding.   
  
  Q.  Because left-handed relief pitching is at such a premium, did you think that might work to your advantage?   
 TOM MARTIN:  I think it will help.  There's some things I need to improve on from last year, but I think it's going to be outstanding.  Yeah, I think it will help.   
  
  Q.  Did you think that would make you more valuable to the Astros?   
 TOM MARTIN:  I kind of thought that.  I  didn't know what to expect, like I said.  But there wasn't a whole lot left behind me in the Minor Leagues, so I figured it might have been a good shot for me to stay with them.  But I'm not upset by any means.   
  
  Q.  When you were in Arizona, where did you live?   
 TOM MARTIN:  During the off-season?   
  
  Q.  Yes.   
 TOM MARTIN:  I lived in Tempe.   
  
  Q.  So you know this area here pretty well, like it pretty much?   
 TOM MARTIN:  Yes, I love it out there.  The weather, the scenery.  My wife was out there with me in the Fall League and she's ecstatic, she loves it out there, it's all beautiful.  I think it's going to be great.
