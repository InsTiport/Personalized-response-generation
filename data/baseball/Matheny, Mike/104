Washington Nationals   2
  St. Louis Cardinals ‑ 1

Q.   Can you just take us through the decision to go to Lynn there in the ninth instead of Motte? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Well, being on the road‑‑ if we were at home, it would have been a very easy decision to bring in Motte.   We are looking at a team that had every save of our season by Jason Motte, and we take a lead there at any point, you're asking one of our guys, especially one of our young guys, who have never been in that situation to come in and close out a game, and that's a lot to ask.
But had a lot of confidence in Lance.   He came in throwing the ball well.   Werth just put together a very good at‑bat. 

Q.   How do you bounce back from a loss like this?
MIKE MATHENY:   Just like all year.   We've had a very large amount of heartbreakers this year, and I think that's really been used to develop the character of this team and the resiliency.   These guys realize that we've got an opportunity to come back and play another game.   They do shed it pretty quick. 
So it's a tough one, but still alive to play another game.

Q.   Can you talk about the starting performances, both for your pitcher and for the Nationals today?
MIKE MATHENY:   Yeah, both of them did a great job.   I can speak for our guy.   I've watched Kyle Lohse do that all season long.   He's been a big‑game pitcher and he's been a great leader with a few other guys on our team as far as our staff goes.   From day one Opening Day, he's just done a terrific job of taking advantage of the opportunities and has put together a solid season, and we knew he was going to give us a chance.   That's all we can ask, and he did that today.

Q.   Was the strike zone a topic of discussion in the dugout?
MIKE MATHENY:   Usually like every night.

Q.   Any different? 
MIKE MATHENY:   No.
