  Cardinals   4

Q.   You started with a bases- loaded, nobody-out first inning, and then didn't score.   Did that kind of take the bubble out of things for you?   Take the air out of the balloon for you that early? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Well, we're definitely pretty excited about the opportunity we had right there.   There was a little momentum going, no question, if we're able to plate one, a couple.   Our guys have been so good all season long in that situation, but it does happen.   They're not going to be 100% good.   You do give credit when they're able to do those and turn them around.   But it is a momentum shift, there is no question.

Q.   It seems like not just for you guys but this whole postseason Carl Crawford has kind of gotten his stroke going.   Just kind of wonder about the presence he's provided for them in the top of the lineup? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Well, I'll let them speak about their players.   As we try to get guys out, we know we make good pitches and we have a good chance of getting them out.   We get behind in counts and get balls in the middle of the plate and bad things happen for us. 
We have respect for all the guys in their lineup.   We have a game plan for how we feel we can get them out.   It's a matter of who executes.

Q.   I was going to ask about your hitters in general.   How did you feel they approached Greinke today? 
MIKE MATHENY:   I felt like they put together some pretty good at‑bats.   Once again, those are winning components to baseball.   You've got to have the timely hits.   We put some guys on base in that opportunity.   You don't get many when you face top‑tier pitchers.   We had a couple opportunities to do something, and just couldn't make it happen.   Those usually come back to haunt you, and today they did.   But once again, make sure that we keep the message the same.   These guys have done a tremendous job in those exact same situations all season long.   You're going to have games where you just can't make it happen, and we've got to figure out a way to get it done the next time we get a chance.

Q.   How significant in the 7th and 8th was it to have the shadows where they were?   Do you think that had a material effect on your hitters?   Was that something they were talking about? 
MIKE MATHENY:   Yeah, we don't go there.   I mean, this time of year everybody that's playing in the postseason is typically going to deal with shadows.   But both sides are going to do that, and they're going to have to deal with it.   We don't let ourselves start going to excuses.   It's just not productive.
