  Boston Red Sox - 6

Q.   Can you speak to what you saw from Mike tonight.   Just looked a little different.   What was he telling you the first couple of innings?
MIKE MATHENY:     I think a couple of things, one, you have a more educated team that s faced him before, and you got a kid that's been out there and so impressive to keep doing what he's been doing.   The game is going to catch up with everybody. 
I think he's that good.   Today was one of those days where he got a little more plate on a few pitches.   But this kid has been absolutely fantastic. I just told him a few minutes ago, we re not here if he doesn t do what he s done for us over this postseason.   It's something that not too many people have ever done, with as a little experience as he s had.   

Q.   What happened with Ortiz?
MIKE MATHENY:     He's as hot as anyone you're going to see this time of year.   We tried to make tough pitches in tough situations, tried to pitch around him at times.   What this comes down to, they got big hits in big situations, and that's something that eluded us this time.   It hasn't really all season.   We've been able to get the hits.   We hit the ball better today, we couldn't stack them on top of each other and get the big one. 
But you've got to give credit to good pitching.   We had good pitching, they also had good pitching, and we weren't able to get much going on a consistent basis.

Q.   Your trademark during the season was being opportunistic on offense and you ran into some good pitching in the postseason, obviously it didn't happen this series.   Is there anything you can look back on in terms of the opportunities that got away that would have made a difference here?
MIKE MATHENY:     You're asking guys to do some very extraordinary things when you ask them to do what they've been doing all season long.   They were some frustrated guys in there, but overall you can't ask us to go about any better than how our guys did.   Couldn't be any more proud of how they handled themselves, how they carried themselves and how they competed.   We had a couple of games that just didn't look real characteristic offensively.   But we did have a little trouble, but overall this team was very consistent all the way through.

Q.   What did you tell your team and what will you tell your team about the season they put together this year?
MIKE MATHENY:     We already talked.   I think the flood gates opened.   I told them to hold their head high.   They have nothing to be ashamed of.   We all know that we could come out and play a better game than what we did here, but we did a whole lot more than anybody gave us credit for or expected us to do.   There's a lot of things that they can look on in a negative way, but this isn't the time for it.   They have to be very proud how they represented themselves, each other and this organization.

Q.   This would seem to be a team that would be set up very well for the future. 
MIKE MATHENY:     Yeah, there's been a lot of talk about that, and rightfully so.   You look at the young arms.   We've got experience behind the plate and in left and right.   We've got a lot of young players out there.   There's a lot of things to be excited about moving forward. 
It's really hard to think about at this point, because it's so rare and special to be on this stage.   And you hate to see anything slip away, not that we gave away ‑‑ they took it.   They played us and they beat us.   There's a lot that could be said about both teams going head to head.   But overall we don't think too much about that right now because it's hard to take this time of year any losses you have.

Q.   Can you talk about Wacha.   What kind of statement did he make this October that he hadn't made previously.   Or was it just confirming what you already knew?
MIKE MATHENY:     Wacha? 

Q.   Yes. 
MIKE MATHENY:     People hadn't even heard of him.   There's a lot of guys that come in this league and are able to be a flash in the pan.   To pitch the kind of games he did and how he handled and controlled himself, those are rare qualities that he was able to show.   Those are things he's going to put on his mantle and hold in his mind, and hopefully for a long time we're going to see Michael Wacha perform like that.   And hopefully in October.

Q.   How would you describe how he looked tonight?   Would you use a term like "gassed" or "tired" or "dull"?   What would be the right description you saw from him?
MIKE MATHENY:     I don't think any of those are accurate.   I think if you look out there, he competed just like he always has.

Q.   What do you take away from this season?   
MIKE MATHENY:     As we looked through the season, and we'll start doing that tonight, kind of reviewing what we were able to accomplish, we had plenty of adversity.   Plenty of things we had to overcome.   And they did it in a style that represented the organization well, the way they played and didn't back off one second of the way they prepared.   It was a relentless team, and I think that's a way to label them.   And I'm very proud to be a part of them.
