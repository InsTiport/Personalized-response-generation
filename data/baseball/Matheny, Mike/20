 Q.   Can you start off with the comeback you've had so far, down 4‑0 early in the game, you had to manufacture runs, the big hit by Randal.   Things don't work out in the end, but talk about the resilience of the team.   
MIKE MATHENY:   We've just come to expect it, and that's a good place to be when we get down.   John Lackey did a nice job of finding it after that.   Had two quick outs in the first and then ran into a little bit of trouble, and next thing you know, he's real efficient and did a great job of pulling it together.  
Then, yeah, we just kind of made some things happen.   Kolten gets another big hit for us and guys just figure out how to give us a chance.   Randal gives us a big hit to tie the game.   Just comes down to doing the little things right.   
   
 Q.   Giants get the first two runners on in the tenth inning and there was a meeting at the mound.   What was the discussion there?   Can you game plan against what happened?   And your thought on simply a physical error.   
MIKE MATHENY:   Pitching coach goes out just to basically break up the momentum.   Guys at first and second and we're in a bad spot.   And a lead walk isn't where we want to go there.   Get to two strikes and puts a nice swing on the ball to put us in a bad spot.   
Kind of just slowing things down, that's it.   The guys had already known what our defensive play was going to be on a bunt.   They got the bunt down and we just didn't make the play.   
   
 Q.   You've been through a lot of this stuff.   Do you believe in such things as a pivot point in a series?   What are your thoughts about how the momentum of a series goes?   
MIKE MATHENY:   Yeah, I think about that when it's over and go back and then look at maybe where things did switch.   But right now, that's not‑‑ it doesn't help us do what we need to do.   We go out and just pitch by pitch, keep it very simple.   
It's a simple approach, and it leads to consistent outcomes.   Later on we'll sit and talk about where things turn either for or against, but right now is not the time.  
   
 Q.   Do you want the third baseman fielding that?   What happened there with the pitcher taking?   
MIKE MATHENY:   No, that's the ball right back to him.   He makes that play.   He's a good fielder.   Errors happen.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   You only need one win in San Francisco to push the series back to St.Louis.   Talk about the confidence you have in Shelby Miller?  
MIKE MATHENY:   Shelby has done a nice job all the way down the stretch and his last start was one of his best so we are excited to watch him pitch.   
As far as thinking we have one game back, we just have one game, tomorrow, and don't take it any further than that.   Once again, the simpler, the better for us; an easy approach of play the game the right way right from the first pitch.   That's all we can control.
