San Francisco Giants   6
  St. Louis Cardinals ‑ 1

Q.   Lohse definitely tomorrow?
MIKE MATHENY:   Yes, Kyle Lohse pitches tomorrow.

Q.   Was any of the decision to let Carp hit for himself early reflective of Kyle's struggles and wanting to keep a fresh bullpen tomorrow and how disappointing was the defensive performance tonight?
MIKE MATHENY:   Kyle struggles?   I haven't seen ‑‑ no, we just at that point let Carp go ahead and tried to work through it and give us an opportunity to try to save some of our pen.   But more importantly, he was making pitches getting out, so we let him go.

Q.   Can you talk about Ryan's pitching tonight?
MIKE MATHENY:   In my opinion he did everything he wanted to do to us.   We've had trouble with him and he's made great pitches against us, and we've made very little adjustments.   He's not making that many mistakes, so that's a tough combination for us.

Q.   Beltran and Holliday have both been hurt.   What kind of impact has that been on your defense?
MIKE MATHENY:   We'd like to have them in there.   We have some depth, to be able to throw a Matt Carpenter in there, we feel like we've got a viable option, and somebody that can be productive.
But Matt's been our three‑hole hitter all season long, which is something that has been very productive for us and we hated to lose him today, but somebody else has to step up.

Q.   Just quickly, what is the status report on Matt right now, and do you expect him tomorrow?
MIKE MATHENY:   Wait to see.   We'll see tomorrow.   But right now his back tightened up, even a little bit more as we went through the game.   We'll see when we get here tomorrow.

Q.   Do you feel like the Giants have made adjustments that they've had so much success against your hitters the last couple of games or any explanation?
MIKE MATHENY:   I think, yeah, they have.   But you're also talking about a couple of well‑pitched games.   You're talking about some of their hitters are doing a nice job of getting us in the middle of the plate.   And we knew going into this it was going to be a tough series.   We knew that we had a couple of pitchers that we were going to be facing that are tough to stack up any runs on.
So it's just kind of played into a Game 7 here that everything is on the line and we couldn't be any happier to have Kyle Lohse on the mound knowing that we're going to have another tough day with Matt Cain that isn't going to make a lot of mistakes either.   We have to make some adjustments. 
Our team has done that all season.   We've had some games where we stack on runs and then we go absolutely hitless, almost, for a while, or anything of impact.   But at any day we know that our offense can pull out quite a bit of production.   Hopefully it's tomorrow.

Q.   A lot of ballplayers say you don't really know them until you see them play every day.   You've seen Marco Scutaro play six games in a row.   What do you know about him that you didn't before?
MIKE MATHENY:   Six games isn't necessarily enough to make a blanket statement.   But he's obviously given us a hard way to go. 
He's a ballplayer.   He plays hard.   He sticks his nose in there and makes the plays on defense and he's gotten big hits against us.   And that's something to be said about somebody that's able to compete and to produce in this environment.   He's put together tough at‑bats.

Q.   Talk a little bit about what you've learned about your team being in these kind of games.   You've been no stranger to it the last couple of years both as a coach and as a manager. 
MIKE MATHENY:   Well, the one thing I know is these guys take these ones hard.   We've had a number of losses this season that felt like we've been kicked in the gut as we're walking off the field.   And what I have admired about this club is they show up tomorrow the exact same guys that they showed up here today.   And they come out and they play the game.   They're not going to dwell on it too long, but they're going to try to learn the lessons on the things they need to make the adjustments on.   And they seem to be able to do that.   They have a short memory.
We know this team on the other side is very motivated and driven, walked into Cincinnati needing to win three.   Now they walked into the last game in St. Louis needing to win three.   They've got a lot of positive thoughts going into it.   But we do, too.   Our guys will come out and play a different brand of baseball tomorrow.

Q.   You've played in a Game 7.   What experience will you take into now coaching your first Game 7?
MIKE MATHENY:   We keep it pretty simple, just play the game.   And we obviously have a close eye on everybody, especially Lohse starting pitching when you go into a Game 7 or elimination game scenario. 
But overall, I don't want these guys doing anything different than what they've been doing to get to this point.   If they've got something else in the tank, then they've shorted themselves and they shorted us all season long.   We play the game the same way all the time, whether it's Game 7 or it's the first game of the season.
