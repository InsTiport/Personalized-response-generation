 Q.  I just wanted to get clarification, because they were talking and they said Dan apologized to Sal for missing the 3-2 pitch to Bautista.  
CREW CHIEF JOHN HIRSCHBECK: I don't know anything about that, I really don't.  We've been talking here about situations during the game, but I didn't hear anything about that.   
 Q.  Would that be a common practice?  It seems a little uncommon.  
CREW CHIEF JOHN HIRSCHBECK: Well, it's not common practice, but it's not uncommon, if you think you missed the pitch to say, Sorry, I missed the pitch.  But I don't know that that happened in any way, shape or form.   
 Q.  Would there be any way to ask Dan or would you handle it?  
CREW CHIEF JOHN HIRSCHBECK: I'd probably handle it.   
 Q.  Is that the respect they give everybody?  They weren't mad about it as much as --  
CREW CHIEF JOHN HIRSCHBECK: Yeah, especially when you have a quality person like Sal Perez.  And I would have personally no problem saying to him, you know, while we're working a game, I would say on a close pitch, Sal, do you think I got that right and take his word for it.   
And the same way of saying it is if I missed a pitch I would not have a problem to saying to someone -- I wouldn't say that to everybody.   
 Q.  So it's hard to put words in his mouth, but it may be a thing of not necessarily, Sorry, I missed that pitch, but Sorry, we didn't see that eye-to-eye?  
CREW CHIEF JOHN HIRSCHBECK: Exactly.
