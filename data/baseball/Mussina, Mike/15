Q.  Joe thought in Game One command was the biggest issue for you.  Would you agree with that? 

MIKE MUSSINA:   Yes. 

Q.  Would you expand on that? 

MIKE MUSSINA:   Well, I don't know what else  -- that's it. 

Q.  Any reason why? 

MIKE MUSSINA:   I mean, I don't know what to tell you.  I could not throw it where I wanted to throw it.  Just that simple.

Q.  After the game, when you were discussing the aspects of specific pitches, you said it was so bad, I didn't even remember; will you take that attitude and forget about that game or will you build off that in any fashion?

MIKE MUSSINA:   I'll probably just forget about it.   There's not much I'd like to remember, so I'll just forget about it.  You know, it's a different setting, a different situation.  We'll start new and try to go after him again.

Q.  You had said after your last one that the eight days between starts might have been a bit of a problem.  Do you feel like you were able to get more into your regular routine this time and do you think that will help?

MIKE MUSSINA:   I always think that a layoff that long is not beneficial.  So this time around was more like it had been all year, so I would assume that everything is going to be  -- going to be fine.  I made the assumption things were going to be fine last time but it did just not work out that way.  But to get through the routine this time, having four days off in between instead of eight, is going to be, in my mind, better than it was.
