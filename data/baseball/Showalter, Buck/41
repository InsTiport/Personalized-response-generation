Baltimore Orioles   5
  Texas Rangers ‑ 1

Q.   Just talk about how you felt about your performance tonight and how your team played. 
BUCK SHOWALTER:   You know, in regards to what happened during the course of the game, it all starts with Joe Saunders and the outing he gave us.   He's had two good outings here in a row, and felt like if he could get his feet on the ground, all the emotion around the ballpark, you could see the experience that he's had play out.   Real proud of everybody.   Tacking on runs were big, knew they were going to run at you.   But just a real proud moment for us.   Our guys approached it and we talked about it being sudden life instead of sudden death, and we played that way.   You've got to seize the opportunity.   We don't get many.

Q.   You brought the Yankees back to the postseason after so many years, now after 15 years you bring this team back. 
BUCK SHOWALTER:   No, it's about the players.   I didn't do it.   I had good players, general manager, scouts, our front office.   It's just unfortunate in our society we want to hang the golden hero around somebody.   It doesn't fit in this case.   With our team it's just a bunch of guys that raised the bar and wouldn't give in and still haven't.   Now they get a chance to win to roll the dice, and there's a lot of good card players in there. 

Q.   How special is it to be the team that won tonight?
BUCK SHOWALTER:   Believe me, that didn't figure into it.   There's too many good people that are capable of doing the job as well if not better than you.   I understand the shelf life of coaches and managers in sports and the way our sports society works, and you're just thankful for every opportunity you get and hope in some form you've impacted them the way they've impacted me.   We all grow through life's experiences, so without getting too deep, I was real thankful for the opportunity I got here and continue to be.   They've got the perfect guy coming in behind me, and still do.   I hope they realize that. 

Q.   You were talking to us a little earlier about how things mesh.   Things mesh in different ways.   Did they mesh together or was it meshing one way or meshing another?
BUCK SHOWALTER:   Well, the biggest thing is that our core players‑‑ the one thing that hit me in the spring was how strongly they tried to Wei‑Yin Chen was a great example, guy comes from playing in Japan, from Taiwan, a lot of people from different organizations, and the one thing they told everybody that came in here, how confident they were in a hurry.   There's just a lot of guys that had their noses bloodied together here.   They developed a fraternity in there, of people that can play for their team. 
It means a lot to a lot of players here for the Orioles.   I look at Jim Johnson out there at the end.   He loves the organization and the people and the city.   There's just a real identification.   One of the biggest regrets of this year would have been if our guys couldn't have a moment after the game like that.   We came so close a couple times.   We got in the playoffs and didn't really get to ‑‑ except on the planes with a couple of iPads telling somebody you know.   And the other part of that is the two thing that guys have rallied around is trying to get back and play some games at our ballpark in front of our fans and trying to keep winning so Nick Markakis can get a chance to play in the postseason.   Each day that passes we get a chance of that.   I look at Brian Robertson, Nicky on the bench, and they're pulling and grinding with every pitch just like their teammates.
