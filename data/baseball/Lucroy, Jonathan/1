DIAMONDBACKS  Â– 4
  BREWERS - 9

 Q. What is it about you being in that situation that seems to bring out the best in you?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: I work on that a lot at practice and stuff. Just being in the hole I am, the position I am in the lineup, sometimes you're called on to do strange things, especially with the pitcher hitting behind you, and it's a free RBI if you execute. And I really work hard to try to get that down and it's worked out for me.

 Q. You said earlier in the season that you weren't a very good bunter, you continue to come through on this play. 
 JONATHAN LUCROY: I'm not a good sac bunter, safety squeeze, all you've got to do is get it down to their area. I'm not good at being soft with it.

 Q. When you dropped that ball, did you know that was going to get the run home as soon as it caught the bat?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: Yeah, I figured it would, especially when he made that kind of off-balance throw he did. I knew it was a tough play to make. 
 Like I said, if you execute correctly, it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll get a run out of that. So I just got it done right. 

 Q. Has this pretty much been as you guys scripted the first two games; could anything else have gone better for you?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: I mean, you know, the team's tough. It's a good team over there. I'm glad we're playing good against them. They've got some good starting pitching. We jumped up on them and put them away. They're tough. They're a tough team. They battle, they fight. They don't ever give up. 
 Yeah, it feels good to get these two out of the way, but we've still got to win one more. It's not over yet.

 Q. How is Zack? Could you tell again he was pitching short?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: Yeah, his velocity was up. I don't think his control was there today, his command. It wasn't as good as I've seen it. But for the most part he did his job, he kept us right there. We scored early on, and he didn't let it get past our lead. We ended up tying the game. After that it's a brand-new ballgame all over again. 
 He did a job for me tonight personally. He kept it there and gave us a chance to win and a chance to tack on. That's all you can really ask out of him. 

 Q. I guess after the game it was, like Kennedy said something that you weren't a very good hitter, that's the reason he pitched to you, is there any vindication, you heard him, both swinging and bunting, the first two games?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: It don't matter to me. I just like to win. Whether it's conventionally or unconventionally, I'll take a win any day.

 Q. Justin Upton tied the game, and they've had a knack of coming back in games. How important was the 6th and what do you think the balk did about the complex of the game?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: It made it exciting. He hit that pretty well. He took advantage of that mistake. I think that says a lot. All it is is a mistake pitch, really. 
 For me, it made the game interesting, for sure. It was fun to watch. It was a lot of fun to be in, especially when we pulled ahead by that one big inning. It made the game exciting. It made the game fun. 
 That team battles and fights. They're not going to ever give up. Those guys get after it over there.

 Q. The runs at numerous times during the season when the bottom of the order is hitting and getting on base they score a lot of runs, that obviously was the case again today. 
 JONATHAN LUCROY: Yuni hit a good bat against Ziegler. Jerry has been awesome right there. And like I said, for me I'm just trying to get in there and do a job, whatever I'm called upon. 
 I've had the -- I haven't had the best at-bats lately, but I'm trying to do whatever helps the team win. Whatever it takes. If we can get on base with those big guys, and 2, 3, 4 hole, that's the key a lot of times. Especially when he pitches around those guys so much. That means they've got to pitch to them, when we're on base in front of them. Like Corey and Nyjer.

 Q. You mentioned Hairston, how much is putting him in the bottom of the order helped him in that lineup?
 JONATHAN LUCROY: I think it's great. It puts a contact guy. He knows what he's doing, he's a professional hitter. He has a real good idea what he's doing at the plate. I think it helps our team out as a whole. You can't really ask for anything else for him lately. He's been awesome lately. He's been really key to us lately. And he's doing a really good job for us.
