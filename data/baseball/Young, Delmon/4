 THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?   
  
  Q. Everybody knows you're not 100%. You may be feeling a lot more discomfort than you've allowed, but how do you explain the home runs in the face of that?   
 DELMON YOUNG: The ball got -- I've been able to get my timing back the last couple of games. This is my first game playing back-to-back, so I didn't lost my rhythm.   
 I was able to get the bat head on a cutter and a high fastball.   
  
  Q. Delmon, I guess everyone looks better hitting home runs. But can you give us just an update on your health and the injury at this point? Did you feel a lot better today?   
 DELMON YOUNG: From when?   
  
  Q. From the day before?  
 DELMON YOUNG: It goes in and out. Sometimes it feels worse. It depends on what I actually did during the day to aggravate it or make it better.   
  
  Q. I just want to ask you, coming through in a game like this, getting the long balls in an elimination game, what does it mean for you to come through and get the game when you have to have it?   
 DELMON YOUNG: It feels great. It didn't matter if it was me or anybody else. We needed JV to go out there and pitch as deep in the ballgame like we did because we were short-handed on the bullpen and Coke coming in to finish it out.   
 We needed a whole team to be able to put up runs and then to hold runs off of them, because with their ace on the mound and their offense, they could explode at any time.   
 We've all seen what they are able to do in the short series by putting the gun on Feldman and the relief guys. And then they were able to set up their whole bullpen with Adams, Gonzalez, Oliver and Feliz.   
  
  Q. I don't know if you believe in momentum, but when you look back at that sixth inning and Verlander gets Kinsler to hit into the double play and then of course the single, double, triple and home run by you, if you do win this thing, I think you have to believe this is an inning to look back and say maybe it all changed there.   
 DELMON YOUNG: Yeah, hopefully, because we all watched the Rays series when they turned the triple play and did their heroics. Hopefully some momentum can swing for us.   
 But we need to go down there and play -- how we played in Comerica down there in Texas.   
  
  Q. Delmon, after the first home run, you headed back to left field and the fans were there giving you a standing ovation. Did you notice that at all? How did that feel?   
 DELMON YOUNG: Yeah, I noticed it. You can't really dwell on it, because Texas came right back out and scored to tie up the ballgame. You can't really dwell on anything until the game is over, because you don't want to be sitting out there in a parade while -- and then at the end of the game you're losing and going home.   
 We needed to go out there and win the game first and then we can enjoy later.   
  
  Q. Do you find it at all remarkable that when this series began you were not on the roster and here you are tonight the key player in this victory?   
 DELMON YOUNG: No, not really. I was just the way the postseason rules are set up. I had to start out not on the roster just in case I got hurt or anything, I wouldn't be able to play in the next round.   
 So that was for the postseason rules and everything. But since Magglio went down, I came back on, and it took me a while to get going. But I was glad to get going when we needed it.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for coming.
