Q.  How hard was it for you to stay ahead of the pitch count, was that part of your strategy?

BARTOLO COLON (Through Luis Isaac):  It was very important to get ahead of the hitter, because when you get ahead of the hitters, to pitch to them, it's a lot easier, because they are behind on the count.

Q.  Can you talk about the fastball and how well that worked for you today?

BARTOLO COLON (Through Luis Isaac):  I felt good with the fastball and I was pitching in and out, that it really worked today.

Q.  How do you feel pitching this game, a big game for your ballclub, being the ace pitcher that the Indians have?

BARTOLO COLON (Through Luis Isaac):  Being No. 1, I tried to set the tone for the series.  When you punch first, you can punch two times.

Q.  Late in the game it seemed that you were throwing as fast or faster than the beginning of the game.  What was going through your mind at that time?

BARTOLO COLON (Through Luis Isaac):  Always in the games I always throw hard early in the game, but I can throw anything I want.

Q.  Despite your record this season, do you feel  that you're the ace of the staff, the No. 1 pitcher?

BARTOLO COLON (Through Luis Isaac):  Today I was No. 1 for the team, because I was on the mound. And anybody that pitches is No. 1, because you're pitching the game.  And I feel that C.C. Sabathia is No. 1.
