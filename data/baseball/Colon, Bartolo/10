Q. This certainly isn't the first time you're going head to head with Pedro Martinez in
the playoffs. Would you tell us how it feels to go head to head again? 

A. he says that he feels very happy that he got this opportunity and he will do the
best he can to come out on top. 

Q. What was the difference between the second half of the season to you and compare it
to the first half? 

A. He says that he had a rough first half but he is working with Phil Regan, the
pitching coach, who helped him a lot in the second half and he is a very coachable guy, he
says. 

Q. Would you talk about the Red Sox lineup that you will be facing? What are the
dangerous spots and tell us what you think of it. 

A. He said that the whole lineup, he treats everybody like they are dangerous and there
are a couple of guys in the lineup that are very dangerous. They have Mike Stanley, Nomar
Garciaparra

Q. What do you think about being the number one guy for the Indians. This is the first
opportunity for you to be that guy.

A. He says it's a great opportunity and he feels very happy. 

Q. He had to skip that start in Detroit because of a little tendonitis. Is he able to
put that behind him? Is he 100 percent now? 

A. He said he feels good. Sometimes he gets soreness in his arm but he feels pretty
good. 

Q. Would you talk about some of the things you admire about Pedro Martinez? He has been
somewhat of a hero for you the last few years, outside of his pitching. 

A. He says that he's a great person. He can help him a lot with his pitching and with
life and he's a person that, like I say, he's a good person to follow. 

Q. Sandy, would you talk about the best way to approach Pedro Martinez? 

A. (SANDY ALOMAR) If I can figure that out, yes. We have to figure it out tomorrow, I
think we have to be very patient. Pedro is the type of pitcher, he doesn't fall into a
pattern. He's probably the most steady pitcher in baseball and he's a very smart pitcher.
We have to just go out there and be patient and not try to overswing. If you try to
overswing with Pedro you are done. 

Q. Let's finish with Bartolo at the moment. Pedro talked about how he's tried to help
you develop, and I guess the question is when did that interaction between you happen? Is
it in winter ball? 
A. He said in the All Star Game when he had the opportunity to talk to him, whenever
they get together for a game or before the game, whenever they see each other they have
conversations about pitching. 

Q. Has the addition of Robbie Alomar at second base helped your confidence this year,
knowing you have that glove back there? 

A. He said that not only him but the rest of the pitching staff, because they feel like
they can pitch ground balls and they know they have a solid infield and not only with a
glove but with a bat, he has produced a lot.

Q. Sandy, this is the third time these two teams have been post-season in the last few
years. Would you talk about the camera controversy, the bean brawl incident. Do you think
there is bad blood between the two teams? 

A. (SANDY ALOMAR) No. There is no bad blood. I think there was a misunderstanding there
with the bean brawl in Boston, and it was over with there. After that we had no more. The
camera thing, I didn't know until the next day. If anybody in Cleveland knew the signs,
you better tell me because I didn't know anything. 

Q. How do you approach pitching to Nomar Garciaparra?

A. He tries to throw his best pitch. If he falls behind in the count, you basically
have to pitch around him.
