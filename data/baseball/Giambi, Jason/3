JEFF IDELSON:  We have Nathan and Erin Stock from Evansburg, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh.  They now have a nice new house, courtesy of Jason Giambi and Century 21.  Questions for any of the three.  
 
 
Q.  It looks like New York beats Chicago again. 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   It was exciting.  I had such a great time at SAFECO when I participated in Seattle and I came in and they asked me to do it again.  Winning a home for somebody, it's unbelievable.  
 
Q.  Have you ever seen a display of power like you saw from Sammy tonight? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   He's unbelievable.  He's an manimal.  (Laughter.)  After the first round, I was like, oh my gosh.  He started out like a house on fire, hitting them almost out of the stadium.  It was ridiculous.  It was unbelievable. 
 
Q.  Did you get a chance to say anything during the competition? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   No, I didn't.  Sammy gets locked in.  He takes this contest really serious, and you can see him down in the clubhouse, swinging and stuff like that.  It's fun.  He's the best of the best.  When it comes down to it, it's exciting to have that opportunity to go up against him and walking away with the trophy is unbelievable.  
 
Q.  Did you notice any difference in that last round when the roof was closed, compared to the earlier round when the roof was open? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   Yeah, I think it was a little hotter and muggier.  So I didn't think the ball was carrying as far, but it was carrying just as far.  I don't think anything can hold him, except Yellowstone might be the only place to hold him out of.  Some of the line drives were dipping down.  The fly balls were going, but the line drives were dipping down. 
 
Q.  Did you think seven would be enough?
 
JASON GIAMBI:   I was praying.  I walked up there at that last at bat, I'm going, I've got to hit probably 10, to give myself a chance.  I just was trying to focus on that, trying to get 10.  Willie Randolph was unbelievable, who threw to me.  Even in the last round he came up to me and said, "I'm going to throw them a little bit slower."  I was gassed.  It hot out there; it was like hitting in a sauna.  
 
Q.  How much of a factor was the heat, especially as the competition went on? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   Yeah, I got more tired as it went on, there's no doubt about that.  Like I said it was so hot, and I did the same thing, Sammy was going into the clubhouse and getting the cool air.  Swinging up there, three rounds of at least 30 outs, plus your home runs; it turns into a lot of swings.  
 
Q.  Do you think Sammy ran out of gas there? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   He might have.  I know I was.  Like I said, if it was not for Willie who came up to me and told me, "I'm going to slow it down, not throw as hard," I probably would have petered out, too, but he let me get my bat head on the ball.  Sammy was probably a little bit tired because he had monstrous home runs, just like I did in Seattle and I petered out in the second round. 
 
Q.  Would you have preferred to bat first or second in the final round?  Were you happy batting first?
 
JASON GIAMBI:   Yeah, I just wanted to get it up there and get it out of the way, and like I said, let the manimal take his shot. 
 
Q.  How does it feel winning $250,000 for these two people? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   Unbelievable.  She had come up to me before the contest started and introduced herself and had me sign her hat.  I told her I'd give it my best shot.  It's exciting to have that opportunity.  
 
 
Q.  Your impression of Miller Park, the ball carrying here, how would you compare this place to stadiums in the American League? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   It's beautiful, the new facility.  I played here when they were in the American League.  It's unbelievable, with the retractable roof.  It's a nice hitter's park.  In batting practice the ball was flying out of here with the roof open.  When it was closed it did not carry as far, but it's a beautiful ballpark. 
 
Q.  Does Jason have an open invitation to come to your house when he's in the area?
 
 
Q.  Would you consider yourself a power hitter? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   I don't know.  I think I'm a gap hitter that hits a lot of home runs.  (Laughs). Actually I just go up there.  I enjoy hitting for a high average, driving in runs.  But at the same time, these events are fun because you can just swing from your shoe tops and get the ball up in the air and swing as hard as you can.  Definitely, I would not try to do that in the ballgame.  I would not even actually be here if I tried to do that during the season. 
 
Q.  I know this is a fun competition, but having set the record last year for one round and not winning, did that factor in at all? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   Yeah, like I said, I got in by a fluke last year.  Somebody didn't want to do it and they asked me and I ended up setting the record and I had a ball doing it.  They asked me earlier this year when it looked like I was coming to the All-Star Game, and I said, yeah, I'd love to. I had a little bit more of a strategy than before, because I had Barry screaming at me before:  "You're in, you're in, slow down."    I had a lot of fun doing it. 
 
Q.  How much credit do you give to Willie Randolph?  Looks like he was throwing you some breaking balls. 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   I give him a ton.  I'm sure it's got to be just as tough on them standing out there throwing at everybody, trying to get into that rhythm to get your swing going.  He was throwing it in good spots.  Like I said, learning the competition last year, it taught me, take a few of the pitches and let the pitchers get in their rhythm of throwing, but he kept throwing it right in my wheelhouse there. 
 
Q.  Do you recall what you were thinking when Mac was there in '99 at Fenway and you got similar boos? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   That was unbelievable to watch, watching Mac, he's so smooth.  He is one of the greatest power hitters.  Definitely me watching, but just sitting there that night watching him hit the ball that night at Fenway was unbelievable.  He had talked about the feeling he had, just one swing after another.  When I set the record, the only reason why I would not have beat him, when they started announcing I had a chance to beat his record, I didn't listen to Barry, because we're such good friends.  I got in that rhythm.  Dave Valle threw to me last year.  I just got into that rhythm. 
 
Q.  Could you compare this event to tomorrow's event, what they mean, are they similar, not similar? 
 
JASON GIAMBI:   I think this is more fun.  This is more relaxed, laid back.  Guys are having a good time interacting with each other.  I know a lot of people are saying, "Well, is the All-Star Game competitive?"  But everybody that's made these teams, they are competitive and that's why they are here.  I think once the game starts, whether they get one inning or at bat, they want to get a hit or strike out the side.  It should be pretty competitive tomorrow.  I know everybody is trying not to get hurt, but everybody wants to do well.
