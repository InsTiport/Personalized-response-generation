 Q.   When you had spoken at the pregame press conference as you talked about instructing your roster on the idea that you might have to pinch hit for Mike at some point.   How happy or whatever the word is that he was the guy that came through for you?  
    NED YOST:   We were talking about pinch hitting against left‑handers.   You know, Mous hit 15 homers on the year, but none of them were as big as that was right there, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the defensive play that a Aoki made?  
    NED YOST:   His plays were huge.   I didn't see the last one.   I got blocked off, but the play against the wall was as good a play as you can expect to make.   Cain got in front of him and missed it, and Nori snagged it right there, which was huge for us right there.   I figured at that time I wasn't sure either one of them were going to catch the ball, and I was shocked when Nori caught the play.   
    I'm going to have to go check the replay to see how special that play really was, because I kind of stand back and it's hard for me to see over everybody when they're jumping up‑and‑down and excited.   But they were great plays.   Saved the game for us both times.  
   
 Q.   I was wondering if you could talk about what you know at this point about Herrera's status and how you might set up the bullpen?  
    NED YOST:   Herrera suffered some mild forearm stiffness, so we're going to reevaluate it tomorrow.   We didn't want to take a chance tonight with the first game of the series.   We didn't want to damage it any further, so we'll reevaluate it tomorrow and see where we're at.  
   
 Q.   Has he gone for any testing, MRI?  
    NED YOST:   Not that I know of, no.   I haven't had a chance to talk to anybody.  
   
 Q.   Your pitchers did a heck of a job getting out of trouble repeatedly.   What were your feelings on the resourcefulness?   You stranded a lot of runners and got a lot of outs with runners in scoring position.   What do you attribute your bullpen's resilience to?  
    NED YOST:   Our bullpen has been great all year long.   At times‑‑ not the back end of our bullpen, but at times we'll bend a little bit, but very seldom do we break.   Wade came in and was a little erratic.   Got two guys on after getting us out of a jam in the 7th, and got us through the 8th inning.   A chance to get to Timmy Collins who came in and did a great job.   He hit Beckham in the foot, I mean, just hit him by about a quarter of an inch.   Frasor came in and got us out of that inning, and we just like our bullpen.   
    We wouldn't be here without our bullpen.   This is the type of game that we play.   We don't score a bunch of runs.   We try to get one or two or three runs and maybe one or two ahead by the time we get to the 7th inning and let those guys come in and shut it down for us.   So we have a lot of confidence in our pitching.   
    Jason Vargas pitched one heck of a ballgame tonight.   Six innings.   Gave up two hits, both of them were homers.   But our game plan going into it was Vargy get us six innings, keep us in the game and turn it over to the bullpen, and boy, he did that in fine fashion.
