ALABAMA   2
  ARIZONA STATE   1

THE MODERATOR:   Joining us from Alabama, Head Coach Patrick Murphy and student‑athletes Courtney Conley Amanda Locke, and Jackie Traina.   Coach, an opening comment.
COACH MURPHY:   I thought it was a classic fast‑pitch softball game.   Two really good pitchers going at it.   Two very good teams.   Two very offensive teams. 
I was watching the scoreboard during the first game, and it had the NCAA stats up there, and I think Arizona State and Alabama were number two in the nation around scores with like 6.98 runs a game.   And I thought to myself, wow, this might be a slugfest, and then it turned into a great pitcher's duel. 
But hats off to them.   Dallas pitched a great game, but Jackie just had just a little bit better one.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Potentially, facing Cal, what's the biggest concern about them?
COACH MURPHY:   They gotta come out of that.   I haven't even thought about it really.   Sorry.   Caught me off guard there.

Q.   Amanda, did you feel like you had gotten out of the slump when you got the infield hit, and how much did that play into your confidence later? 
AMANDA LOCKE:   Well, I think mainly I got out of the slump yesterday, just seeing the ball a lot better against Renfroe, and I think just some work in practice and working mentally, just seeing the ball and trusting myself.
And I think today was just kind of a breakthrough a little bit.

Q.   Can you talk about the home run?   Tell us what happened. 
AMANDA LOCKE:   Dallas, she's a great pitcher, and she was throwing the ball up and I was seeing it down.   I told myself, see it down, seeing and hitting the ball, really, not trying to think too much, just trying to keep it simple.

Q.   Courtney, was that your idea on the bunt?   Can you tell us about that sequence where you tied the game?
COURTNEY CONLEY:   Yes, sir.   I was just trying to get on base.   I haven't been hitting the ball really. 
And Murphy always says, turn the lineup over.   Braud's going to do something great, get on for Braud.   And so I just thought to myself, well, I already have a strike, I so might as well try and hit the bunt, get the bunt down, and it worked.

Q.   Patrick, were you surprised that Boyd didn't hit away there in the seventh?   And could you talk about what Courtney's D has meant to this team all season?
COACH MURPHY:   Yeah.   Ryan Iamurri, my fifth assistant coach sitting next to me in the dugout, says, "How many sacrifices does she have?"   And we pulled out the stats and zero.   And we both looked at each other and said she's probably not going to bunt.
And Ryan said, "I think she's going to try to hit away."   And she bunted.   And Courtney made a heck of a play, was very aggressive.   She's done so much of that. 
She's improved 100percent defensively this year.   She's much more confident.   Made some acrobatic spectacular plays throughout the year and has really come into her own defensively.   It's the hot corner for a reason.   In fast‑pitch softball, to me, it's the toughest position to play on the infield.

Q.   Jackie, when you gave up the run, you've got two runners on, no outs, and then a real situation after having a no‑hitter going.   How did you change gears there and get through that and how much confidence did you get after they tied it?
JACKIE TRAINA:   They scored the run.   I put the runners on base with walks.   But I had no doubt in my mind they had my back.   (Indiscernible). 
And I just have all the confidence in the team.   And when I put runners on, I hold myself accountable when it comes to that point and just gotta make a choice.   And can't let them get on.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
