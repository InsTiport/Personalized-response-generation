ALABAMA   2
  ARIZONA STATE   1

THE MODERATOR:   Joining us from Arizona State, we have head Coach Clint Myers and student‑athletes Dallas Escobedo, Amber Freeman, and Sam Parlich.   Coach, an opening comment.
COACH MYERS:   I don't have a whole lot to say.   I thought Alabama played very well.   I thought Dallas threw extremely well.   I thought their pitcher handled us.   That's about it.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   Coach, we've talked before.   This is a team that's faced adversity, especially in the postseason.   You've had these must‑win games before.   Are you looking at it this as just another bump in the road?
COACH MYERS:   Exactly.   And we're not dead.   We just didn't play well.   Again, it's something that we've had great resiliency, both in the Regionals and the Super Regionals and we're anticipating coming back and trying to be ourselves. 
Again, we make no excuses.   I mean, we talked about it today.   We've (indiscernible) players on the state softball and go from there.

Q.   You got three hits for the second straight game.   What has to change offensively?
COACH MYERS:   You've got an answer to that, I'll take it.   But we've got to barrel it up.
Just looking at the‑‑ she struck out 11.   Again, that's a high number for us.   You know, again, so I mean she did a great job.   We just didn't handle it.

Q.   Sam, 11 strikeouts, we just talked about it.   What did you see that Traina did well to keep you guys off balance?
SAM PARLICH:   I think that she‑‑ I feel like we had a lot of opportunities but I feel like we just didn't get‑‑ she threw us a lot of pitches that we could hit.   And everybody at‑bat had at least one or two pitches that they could hit or you're going to get a good pitch at‑bat.   I don't think we took advantage of that.
I feel like she didn't mix speeds up that much.   So it's not like she was fooling us with a changeup.   So, I don't know.   I feel like we just didn't‑‑ our opportunities were given to us; we didn't take advantage of them.

Q.   Also, your single on the right side, you've hit a lot of balls hard this year, just haven't gotten a lot of good bounces.   How good did it feel to be able to rip one to the right side like that?
SAM PARLICH:   It felt good.   Obviously I didn't get the bunt down.   I wanted to do anything I could just to move the runners over.   I just took it with it to right field.   Felt good.

Q.   Amber, you got that foul tip off your hand.   What went through your mind as you tried to decide, you know, I'm staying in the game?
AMBER FREEMAN:   Well, as soon as it hit me, I just looked at my fingers right away, hoping they weren't broken.   And they weren't.   So I was happy about that, honestly.   Just a little swollen.   And nothing‑‑ I can play through it.   So it's nothing big.

Q.   And then, Dallas, my last question is for you.   Seven hits tonight but had nine strike outs and only allowed two earned runs.   How did you feel you pitched tonight?
DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   I pitched great.   I felt like I was throwing hard.   I was happy to face them, because I've never faced them and they're a good team.
So I'm happy that I was able to pitch against a good team like that and feel confident in what I was throwing.   Just one pitch changes the game.   So I'm not too upset about it.   But I'm excited that we're still in it and we can still go strong tomorrow.

Q.   Dallas, can you tell us what the scouting report on Locke was.   She had been struggling a little bit, but obviously has hit for power all year. 
DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   Honestly, I barely watched film on her.   Maybe today.   I was just going in there with my best pitch.   And then just her hard swing contacted to my hard ball and it went pretty far. 
So I mean, she's a great hitter.   And I guess I'll be more aware and cautious when I'm throwing to her, but I'm still going to put my best to her best.

Q.   Clint, the situation where you made a switch at‑bat or something, seemed like about a five‑minute delay when you guys had something going offensively.   Do you remember that and can you tell us why that took so long?
COACH MYERS:   I'm old.   Again, we were going through a couple different options, and we kind of got together and we came up with a plan.   Didn't execute it but we came up with one. 
I mean, there's no reason to rush.   We got three pretty intelligent guys right there.   So we kind of talked it over and came up with what we wanted to do and we went out.   I'm not sure it took exactly five minutes.   It may have seemed that long.
Again, in that situation, we're the last game.   We have no place to go.   So, I mean, we weren't in a hurry.   So we took our time, tried to think it out.   And we just gotta execute it better.

Q.   Dallas, this means you have five more games that you're going to have to pitch if you want to win the World Series again.   So how do you prepare yourself for that? 
DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   I mean, Florida did it last year.   So it's not impossible to get there.   But definitely taking it one game at a time.   I'm not trying to look forward to anything but the game tomorrow.

Q.   Who calls the pitches?   Chuck?
DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   Yes, and I have the power to shake them off whenever.

Q.   You threw one awesome changeup tonight but you didn't throw many of them?
DALLAS ESCOBEDO:   It's not really my top pitch but I try to sneak it in there once in a while.   But thank you for calling it awesome because that's probably the first time I've heard that.

Q.   Coach, was there any hesitation having Boyd bunt there in the seventh?   Were you weighing letting her‑‑ having her hit away versus bunt there? 
COACH MYERS:   No.   The situation called for it.   And we just, she didn't get it down where she wanted it.   I mean, again, it was a heck of a play by the third baseman.   A close play at second.   No. 
I mean, going in, we had even said Talor gets on, you're going to bunt and we'll move it over and we'll turn it over to the freshman.
Again, three freshmen, two sophomores, that's a young team.   And we kind of played that way today.   But we're still alive.   Maybe slightly wounded a little bit, but we're still alive and we're going to come back and hopefully let them see Arizona State the way we've been playing. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
