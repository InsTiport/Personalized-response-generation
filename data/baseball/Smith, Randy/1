   RANDY SMITH:  The Tigers to complete the deal with Arizona in exchange for Travis Fryman have acquired Gabe Alvarez, young third baseman from San Diego, Matt Drews, who was Tiger property.  Drews acquisition enabled us to protect 22 of our top 23 players.  And Randa from the Pittsburgh Pirates has hit over .300 the last two seasons as a third baseman.
