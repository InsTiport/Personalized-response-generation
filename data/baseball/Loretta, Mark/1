 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Mark Loretta.   
  
  Q. So how was it to knock in the winning run?  
 MARK LORETTA: Well, it beats a hole in the head, that's for sure. I just thought it was such a great team victory, the at-bats we put together there in the ninth inning.   
 Casey Blake had that great walk and of course Belliard gets what I thought was the biggest hit of the game. And then Russell drawing the walk and kind of set the stage.   
 But it was a great team victory and a lot of fun. Really exciting. Nothing like a walk-off win.  
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about your approach in that last at-bat what you were looking, what you're expecting to see from Franklin?  
 MARK LORETTA: I wanted to be aggressive there, even though the bases were loaded, I felt he would try to get ahead most likely with something hard, with a fastball and fouled off the first pitch. So I figured he'd probably come back again with that, and it was a little bit more towards the plate, the first ball was a little bit inside, but my real approach is just to go up and try and make contact in that situation, make the defense make the play.   
 And I really didn't have a lot of nerves. The game was already tied at the time. So I felt like all the pressure was on them at that point. And I was fortunate to find a little bit of fairway out there.  
  
  Q. You've probably hit a lot of balls harder in your career but any more important than that hit that you hit?  
 MARK LORETTA: Absolutely not. That's the biggest hit of my career. I've only played in one post-season we were 3-and-out at that time. And I think the more times you play you savor being in these positions. It doesn't come along very often.  
  
  Q. What was the mood like in the dugout after Ethier and Manny had made the first two outs of the inning?  
 MARK LORETTA: Well, it wasn't like 100 percent positive in terms of it was two outs in the ninth, but we've had a knack of playing well at home and pulling out these games.   
 So I think that until that last out, nobody ever gives up. And that's sort of been our modus this year. We started off 13-0, we had a bunch of these last-minute wins, and so obviously that gives us some confidence in that situation.  
  
  Q. Mark, what sold you on signing with the Dodgers? You could have gone to a bunch of places, you've been a bunch of places. At this stage of your career, what was the big plus in coming here?  
 MARK LORETTA: First and foremost it was the opportunity to win. Secondly, this is my hometown. I grew up in Arcadia, 20 minutes from here.  
 At this stage of my career you can see I have some young kids and wanted to stay relatively close to home. I live in San Diego now.   
 The opportunity to play for Joe Torre is another reason. I played in Boston in '06 and I always admired Joe. The games we had back and forth with New York.   
 So really a lot of factors went into it and I think it was the right decision.  
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
