   THE MODERATOR: Good evening, welcome to the press conference following Game 5, Japan versus Cuba. We are expecting both manager, Hara, and starting pitcher, Iwakuma shortly. 
 A few quotes from Cuba's manager, Velez, will be read aloud in this room momentarily. 
 HIGINIO VELEZ: Sorry for not being able to make it here tonight to this press conference. But I would like to thank everyone for their kindness towards the Cuban team. 
 I would like to congratulate the Japanese team for their great victory tonight. They were much better than us, and that's why they deserved the victory. They do deserve to go on to the finals. So the only thing left for us to do is to continue to fight for our great game, baseball. 
 Thank you very much. All the best to all the four teams in Los Angeles.
