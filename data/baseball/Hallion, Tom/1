 Q. If you can explain what you saw on the play, the play on first?
 TOM HALLION: Sure. The ball down the first base line, and I came around, close, bang-bang play, and I tried to get the best angle on it. And it wound up being a great play by Jamie and Howard. And again, I really didn't get a sound to be able to judge. It winds up being a great play. And looking at a replay here, they just got him. 
 So kudos for them, because they made a great play.

 Q. When he flipped it --
 TOM HALLION: A couple of things there: He caught it bare-handed and with the noise in this environment, so it makes it very difficult. But again they made a great play. And I certainly wish it would have gone the other way, but it was a bang-bang play, and I did my best to get it right and that's what I went with.

 Q. I assume it makes you feel better that in the end it didn't impact the outcome of the game, probably?
 TOM HALLION: I guess. As an umpire you never want to be involved in the outcome of the game, any umpire that you have. 
 So, yeah, I would just say that we don't like being involved in something like that. We like to get every play right. We're human beings and sometimes we get them wrong.
