COACH KRISTIN VESELY: Happy to be here.  It was a long day for us.  I thought we handled the weather delay pretty well.  We played a close game with LSU, and we want to be standing next year on Sunday.   
 Q.  Defensively, y'all weren't able to stop them like you were last night.  What changed?  Did you see anything different this time?  
COACH KRISTIN VESELY: You know, they did a good job of making adjustments offensively, and I think that defensively, we did the best we could.  Made some big plays to eliminate some extra runs but today we just didn't have it in the circle that second game.   
 Q.  The Cajuns defense was really the difference in the game.  
COACH KRISTIN VESELY: Absolutely.   
 Q.  Can you comment on that?  
COACH KRISTIN VESELY: They made some huge, tremendous, big plays.  Their outfield, even the first game we played them, was the difference-maker in that game and they prevented additional runs in the first game we played them.  They stepped up and made big-time plays.
