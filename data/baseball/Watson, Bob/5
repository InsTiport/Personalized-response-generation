  Q.  Bob, did you expect to lose Boehringer, leaving him out there?   
 BOB WATSON:  Well, it was always a possibility.  We had to do like everybody else in this whole process, take a real serious look in our organization and we wanted to protect some younger people.  Brian has a very, very good arm.  He's, I think, found his niche as a middle reliever, but also has the capability of starting.  He started earlier in his career, so I think the thing that you really have to take a look at is a very, very good arm, that's left out there, and I think the way pitching is today, they're stocking up on pitchers.   
  
  Q.  Would you talk about Ben Ford, please?   
 BOB WATSON:  Another fine young arm.  We were kind of surprised that he went in the first round, but not surprised that he was taken.  I think the exposure of the Arizona Fall League, if you look at his numbers out here, they're outstanding numbers, and again he's a fine young right arm.  Out here he's closing.  We probably had him projected as a setâup guy  in the Big Leagues in the not too distant future with the possibility of closing.
