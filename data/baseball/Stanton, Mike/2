Q.  A couple of the innings before you pitched, the Yankees stranded some runners, lost some big opportunities to win the game.  How important was it for you to really shut the team down and get the momentum back or stop their momentum?

MIKE STANTON: Well, a bullpen as a whole, basically what we try to do is go out there and get outs.  Andy did a great job.  The guys in front of me did a great job.  It was a pretty good start.  I think it's going to be a nice series.  All I can do is go out there and try to make as many pitches as I can and put up a zero. 


Q.  Will you talk about your experience being in so many playoffs and World Series, what that does allow you to do before you come into the game as far as relax and come in, in these situations?

MIKE STANTON: Well, I've always said, in order for you to be successful in the bullpen, any bullpen, you have to be able to simplify situations.  Basically, the only difference between a World Series game and a regular season game is what goes on off the field.  You still have to throw the ball; you still have to catch the ball; you still have to hit the ball.  So saying that, what you try and do is stay inside yourself, and go out there and try to make quality pitches. 


Q.  Where do you rate those two innings in your career as far as the way you pitched, how you threw to Timo Perez?  Where do you rate that performance?

MIKE STANTON: It has to be right up there.  I don't know if I can say they're the best I've ever done, but I can't really say it wasn't.  Again, this team, it hasn't been as easy for us this year as it has in years past, but we're battlers, with pitchers that can go out  -- starting pitching has done a great job this season, this post-season.  If we can keep putting up zeros as pitchers, our line-up is going to come through eventually.
