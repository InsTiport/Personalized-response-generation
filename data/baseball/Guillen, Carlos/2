   CARLOS GUILLEN: It was a great experience. And it's for your country. A lot of people watching you over there in Venezuela.  
  
  Q. How much fun are you guys having? Seemed like the fans were chanting for players to come out and take curtain calls the last inning. Whenever you score a run, the whole team comes out.  
 CARLOS GUILLEN: You know, we've got great fans. Like I said before, they're watching baseball almost every day over there. Baseball is the number one sport. They come here to see our team and to cheer for us. We try to do the best that we can.  
  
  Q. For players on your team, do you think there's more pressure playing for your country than there is in the MLB?  
 CARLOS GUILLEN: I don't know, maybe, maybe not, you know. It's a little bit different, you know. You got to feel something different when you are for your country. All your family back home, your friends, and a lot of people, everybody, you know, watching baseball.   
 So we've got a pretty good team, pretty good players, a lot of all-star players. They're waiting for good results.  
  
  Q. I don't know if you've talked about this, but tomorrow night you are playing the USA. You are obviously moving on anyway, but how do you approach that game tomorrow night?  
 CARLOS GUILLEN: We're going face it the same way we face everybody else. They beat us last time, you know. We'll try to play a hard nine innings tomorrow. You never know what's going to happen in baseball.  
  
  Q. Do you guys feel like you have been getting enough work during the tournament to get yourself ready for opening day?  
 CARLOS GUILLEN: Yeah. We've been working hard. We prepare ourself to play every day.
