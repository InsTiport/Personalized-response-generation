 Q. What's it like? 
 FRANK MENECHINO:  I think it's great that we're getting the chance to mingle with the native Italians, and being from New York and being Italian from New York, we're all proud of our heritage in New York and stuff.  It's just that it's a once in a lifetime thing and I think that it's fun.  It will bring them and us together, and let them get a piece of our culture and we'll learn from them a little bit. 
 I think it's just all a lot of fun. 
 Q.  What's within the been the reaction from your family?  Obviously there must be a lot of pride. 
 FRANK MENECHINO:  You know, I think it will hit them after we're done playing.  To see how this all works out.  But it's, I mean, we look at it like the Olympics; like we're getting a chance to represent our country and it's great.  You can either represent USA or Italy and I chose right away Italy. 
 So I really, I was into this, I was dedicated from the beginning.  And I just joined the team because may main goal is to win a job with the Cincinnati Reds.  But I told Matty, I'll be there as soon as the game starts and I showed up today. 
 Q.  So you haven't been around the young Italian guys? 
 FRANK MENECHINO:  No, today was my first day.  I just got here. 
 Q.  Are you concerned that this will put you in a tough standing for getting a roster spot with the Reds? 
 FRANK MENECHINO:  No, I talked to the Reds and I told them that my main concern is to make the Reds.  And they told me, hey, you if you can go over there and get some at-bats, it will be great. 
 Three dates ain't gonna matter, and if you happen to go on, then, see what happens.  You know, as long as I'm getting my at-bats and they can see that I'm playing well, it doesn't matter where you play well.
