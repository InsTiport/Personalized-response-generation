THE MODERATOR:   Representing Vanderbilt, Head Coach Tim Corbin.   For the student‑athletes, relief pitcher, Walker Buehler; Dansby Swanson; and Zander Wiel.   
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH CORBIN:   I don't think it's to anyone's surprise.   I think the game turned around when Walker came in, Walker Buehler.   
There was a momentum change, and pounded the strike zone from the minute he got in there until the minute the game finished.   Very impressive.   Very mature approach to the game.   
I liked the way he came back from last week, because he had more of an earlier exit.   But I knew bringing him in today it felt like the first game of the year when he came in after Tyler against Long Beach State and did some similar things.  
We were opportunistic middle part of the game.   We started off with a short game a little bit and scratched some runs.   And we're able to get a couple big hits with Dansby and Zander there late.   
So well‑played game.   Beat a very good team.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   Walker, could you sort of talk about your approach tonight coming out of the bullpen.   I know it's something you've done a couple times this year, but was that something you were expecting to do coming behind Beede tonight?  
WALKER BUEHLER:   Coach Brown and Coach Corbin told me to be ready, but you expect your guys to go out and perform as well as they can, and I was happy I got to pick them up.   It was great for us all year.   But I think I was ready.   And I think doing that a couple times throughout the year also helps.   You're more comfortable doing it.  
   
 Q.   Dansby, no secret that the ball doesn't carry well here, that the ball you hit for the double you think you had a chance to go out when you hit it?   
DANSBY SWANSON:   When I hit it, I knew I hit it well but just always run hard out of the box and whatever happens happens.   I don't know if it hit the fence.   I still don't know.   Knew I should have done those pushups last night.   
But, I mean, when you hit it, just run hard out of the box, because with the way the wind plays here, you never know what's going to happen.  
   
 Q.   Walker, I think you had a number of strikeouts elevating the fastball and changing the eye level with a breaking ball.   Was that kind of characteristic of the way you usually attack or was that a specific approach for this game?  
WALKER BUEHLER:   I think sometimes some balls get up on me unintentionally and sometimes you do it intentionally.   I don't think any of those were intentional to be honest with you.   
But in this park, you can get away with a ball up in the air because it plays gigantic.   So I think you kind of have less fear of spraying a ball up because you don't feel like you're going to get hurt as much as you may at a smaller ballpark.  
COACH CORBIN:   You end up like that and you start steering the ball a little bit, the ball gets away from you you try a little bit harder.   I think all pitchers have been there.   It's not an easy thing.   
And as I told them when I walked out there, it's the last thing I want to do as a coach, to take him out there, but we needed to change the pace of the game at that point.   And you might let a guy like that go a little bit longer, but it was a point in the game where we were losing by 2, wanted to keep the game right there.   We felt if we were going to turn it around, we would hit the ball well enough.   We had some hard strikes that were caught.   And felt like we were going to swing the bat.  
   
 Q.   Coach, how does your coaching change when you have such a luxury of having so many good arms?  
COACH CORBIN:   Well, you got good arms, but you want to keep the game close as well.   I don't know if it changes that much.   I mean, I think the luxury is that we can go into the bullpen a little bit quicker and it never feels like any of these kids‑‑ we take a step back, whether it's Walker or whether it's Ravenelle or whether it's Stone or Jared Miller or Brian Miller.   We have some arms that haven't pitched yet.   Tyler Ferguson.   
I think just coming into this thing we just told the kids, as far as roles were concerned, it was up for grabs.   We were just going to do what we had to do from a skill‑set standpoint to match up against the skill set of the team in order to put ourselves in an advantageous situation.   
But I think of them all the same.   We don't label them as 1s, 2s and 3s.   They're all pretty damn good.   And I like what they're capable of doing.
