Milwaukee - 7, Los Angeles - 2   
 Q.  Game 7 tomorrow.  What in your experience as a pitcher can you draw from, if anything, that prepares you for a game like this?  
WALKER BUEHLER: My other postseason starts now as well I guess only real elimination game, is Game 3 my junior year, World Series.   
 Q.  How much fun do you think you're going to have?  
WALKER BUEHLER: Yeah, I mean, Game 7 to go to a World Series, I don't know if it gets more high stakes than that.  And I think if you approach it the right way -- it's hard to put into words what could happen and what we hope happens.   
 Q.  Just like night before a game, what do you like?  Do you sleep well, do you have jitters, what's your mindset?  
WALKER BUEHLER: No, I think it's pretty normal for me now.  This is a big one.  But at the end of the day it's the same game and the same thing I've got to go do.   
 Q.  We saw the Brewers tonight do some things that we haven't seen from them previously in the series.  We heard some things in the ballpark today that we haven't heard.  Is there any valuable information you can take from what happened today into tomorrow?  
WALKER BUEHLER: Yeah, I mean I would say what they did with their bats today is not a surprise.  You don't get to be one of the last three teams in baseball without having a complete team.  So we've done some things, as well.  It's down to one but at the end of the day we like our team.
