Q.  How are you feeling physically?
 
GREG MADDUX:   I feel good.  I feel fine.  Legs feel good.  Arm feels good.  Finger is okay.  Looking forward to pitching.  
 
Q.  How do you enjoy pitching in Pac Bell Park? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   I like it.  I think it's a good look, standing on the mound here, with the way the backstop looks with the umpire and the catcher, it's a good look.  The mound doesn't seem far away.  Some parks, it seems closer than others and this park seems to be one of the closer ones.  The mound is good.  The grass is good.  The dimensions are good.  The weather is usually good here.  It's usually  -- it's usually not hot.  It's a lot easier to pitch when it's like 40 degrees, as opposed to 90.  
 
Q.  What kind of development have you seen in Jason Schmidt since he was a 22-year-old in your home? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   Well, I think the biggest thing that I've seen this year was he seems to be more confident.  I think that comes with location.  I think his location is a lot better now than it used to be, and when you can locate your fastball, your offspeed pitches seem to look better, as well.  Plus, he's pitched.  I don't know how many innings he has, but he's probably got  -- he's got his 400-plus innings in, and that's usually when guys start to worry more about pitching than other things that go along with the game.  
 
Q.  What do you remember about him as a kid, anything specific that comes to mind? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   Really good fastball.  That was the first thing.  I thought he threw a really good fastball and had a pretty good curve or slider, whatever he calls it, and a pretty good breaking ball.  Like most guys when they first come up, they want to learn, and it takes time.  They all want to learn everything so quickly that, you know, it takes time to do that.  I think he's had some time now.  I mean, I've seen him throw some great games for the Giants this year.  
 
Q.  Do you feel like a mentor to Jason? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   Not at all.  Not at all.  I don't talk to young pitchers unless they ask.  He was a teammate and you pull for him, as long as he's wearing the same shirt as you, and I did that.  But as far as being his mentor; no, not at all.  He had enough things to worry about than me trying to tell him what to do.  That's what the pitching coach is for.  
 
Q.  So much has been made about whether or not the Braves would go after Barry Bonds.  The first two games you did because the situations dictated  -- is that what your plan is for tomorrow's game? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   Yeah, he's the best player in baseball, and has been.  It didn't happen like this year.  It's been that way for a long time, ever since his Pirate days.  Barry is the kind of guy  -- he's too good.  If he hit .280 like everybody else, he would probably get pitched to more, but he doesn't.  
 
Q.  Your stats in October compared to other months of the year are obviously a little less.  Is it that much more difficult to pitch in October when teams have a game plan and each pitch is significant? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   It's harder because you're facing the best teams.  You're facing the best hitters.  You're also facing the best pitchers.  I mean, I don't think it's any secret that it's harder to be the first-place team than it is to be the last-place team.  I feel like I've made mistakes in the post-season, but as I look at my post-season career overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  I got beat up pretty bad when I was with the Cubs the first time through, but since then, I think I've had as many good games as bad games.  
 
Q.  In Atlanta a couple of people talked about how you play the game out in your mind.  Do you know what the score tomorrow is going to be? 
 
GREG MADDUX:   No, I don't know.  It's not true.  You mean, so many people around sometimes, things get said and believed  -- (laughing).  I just try to locate a fastball and change speeds regardless of who is hitting, try to make a good pitch, get them out and move on.
