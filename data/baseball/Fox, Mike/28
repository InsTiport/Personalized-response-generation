THE MODERATOR:   Can you give us an overview of the game from your perspective.  
COACH FOX:   Well, at any time you're facing calls for Don, as good as he is, getting behind is one of the worst things you can do.   And it was evident of that today.   
We've been successful against them in the past.   Win/loss perspective, just because we've been able to hang in there with him and match him on the mound on our side.   And just kind of outlast him.  
You can see his dominance today, just how good that kid is, just complete dominance, really.   Proud of our team, obviously, there at the end.   But too little too late, but he's really good, and he was too good for us today.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions?   
   
 Q.   Mike, when you looked at what Kent did today, what did you see out there out of him and what do you think maybe has been bothering him some these past couple of starts?  
COACH FOX:   Well, Kent‑‑ when Kent doesn't have the command of his off‑speed pitches like he normally does, you know, that's his strength, to be able to throw his change up and his breaking ball at any time at any count, keep the hitter uncomfortable, be able to pitch in with his fastball.   And he hasn't had that the last few starts.   
But hopefully going to get another opportunity out here at some point.   And we would not be out here without him.   There's no question about that.  
   
 Q.   Brian, when you got the base hit that broke up the no‑hitter, did you kind of sense that that might knock the lid off and get something going offensively?  
BRIAN HOLBERTON:     Yeah.   I mean, just started getting something going right there.   He had been pitching really well, and that base hit maybe could have done something and started a few base hits, got a rally going.   But it ended up not doing anything.  
   
 Q.   Coach, any worries using eight pitchers?   Are there any worries heading into Tuesday's game, what that might mean?  
COACH FOX:   No.   That was all by design, to try to get some guys in the game, get their feet wet, get them on the mound in the World Series and just try to manage the game from the third or fourth inning on.   So that was actually good we were able to do that, I think.  
   
 Q.   Chaz and Brian, Carlos had a lot of success against you guys a couple of weeks ago with the slider.   Same thing working for him today?  
CHAZ FRANK:   That's what Carlos does well.   He uses the slider very effectively, throws it better and controls it better than his fastball and he feeds off that.   And with power pitchers, you usually see them throw their fastball and use their fastball more, but Carlos it's his slider, and that was difficult today.  
BRIAN HOLBERTON:   He can control that and throw it at any count, and then when he needs to, he can throw it 94, 95 and he can just throw every pitch today for strikes wherever he wanted, so he had everything working.  
   
 Q.   Chaz and Brian, did Carlos do anything different at all as many times as you guys have seen him over the past two years, and were you prepared for that going into this game?   
CHAZ FRANK:   I don't think he did anything different.   He's been‑‑ in his five career starts against us, he's been pretty dominant on the mound and just steps up his game like when he faces UNC.   He had a good outing today as well.   We just couldn't match him on the defensive side.  
BRIAN HOLBERTON:   Felt like he was doing basically the same he was doing earlier in the year.   He was just a little bit more on than we were today.  
   
 Q.   Kent, you kind of haven't looked like yourself the last couple of weeks.   How do you explain that?   
KENT EMANUEL:   Just not making the pitches I need to.   Basically, simple as that.  
   
 Q.   Mike, what's your plan going forward for Tuesday's game?   Have you thought about that and do you have any first thoughts just about who you might start pitching?  
COACH FOX:   I don't.   We're going to bear down this game tonight and watch all the hitters obviously on both of these clubs and then make a decision after that.   Not sure at this point.  
   
 Q.   Kent, just to follow up on that.   Coach talked about how it didn't seem like you had your best command of your off‑speed stuff today.   Did you feel that way, and is there any idea why?   Did you feel like you just didn't have your best feel for those pitches?  
KENT EMANUEL:   I don't think so.   I think just the big spots like Senay in that first inning, two strikes, I wanted to go away, and I did.   I just needed it just a couple more inches to get the swing and miss rather than him being able to get the cap on it and get a single like that.   It's just been stuff like that, just not executing the big spots.  
   
 Q.   Kent, you told me on Friday that after the South Carolina start you watched a video of‑‑ you know, fixed your mechanics and everything like that.   Did it have any difference at all today?  
KENT EMANUEL:   Yeah, definitely feel better today than I have in the past, the past couple of starts.   I was able to keep it lower, stay out from the top of the zone.   And hopefully that's just something to throw it on and hopefully I get another chance out here and be able to perform.  
   
 Q.   Chaz and Brian, last time you were out here you lost the first game but were able to bounce back and win the second one.   What's the message to your teammates to let them know this thing is far from over?  
BRIAN HOLBERTON:   Throughout the year, we've kind of played better with our backs against the wall.   We did in the Regional and Super Regional.   Coming out here the first game, maybe a little tight, maybe‑‑ now, moving on, we know what we have to do.   It's win or go home.   So hopefully we can do that.  
CHAZ FRANK:   This team played with a lot of fight the whole year.   And losing the first game doesn't mean anything.   Obviously it's important to win the first one and you want to win the first one and it helps you a lot.   But we'll come back and fight just as hard.   And we're going to come back and win the next game.   We haven't lost twice all year long and we don't plan on Tuesday losing.  
   
 Q.   Coach, obviously a familiar opponent.   How does the approach and the feeling in the environment change in such a different venue here in Omaha at the College World Series?  
COACH FOX:   I'm not sure I understand the question.   Sorry.  
   
 Q.   Just the feeling you have, a familiar foe but such a different venue, do you change the approach?  
COACH FOX:   No.   I mean you'd have to ask the players that.   It didn't for me.   I mean, it's a team that we're familiar with, and we know how good they are, and it's just another opponent that's really good out here that you're trying to beat.   So not a different feel, I don't think‑‑ I guess what you're asking is when we play at state and Carolina, it's a little different there, of course.  
   
 Q.   Coach, what type of solace do you take into the fact that you guys have not lost back‑to‑back games for over a year now and the confidence you instill into your team off of that particular stack going into Tuesday?  
COACH FOX:   Well, they instill that in themselves.   I mean, there's a trust factor.   That's where we've gotta rely on your leaders, on your team.   And to rally, and they've been able to do that all year long.   So whoever we play Tuesday there will be another good team, really good team.   And we'll have to obviously play a lot better.   But I have confidence in my guys.   It's disappointing today, but you get a day, you get a day, and sometimes that's good.   And I have no doubt we'll be ready Tuesday.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
