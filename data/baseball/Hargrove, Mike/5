 Q. I don't know how to ask this politely, but what happened out there?
 
 MIKE HARGROVE: Everything that we threw up there they hit. When it came down, it wasn't
where we were standing. That's about as simple as I can get with it. Any time you score 23
runs, you done a whole lot right. And a whole lot's gone wrong for the other side. That's
what happened. 
 
Q. On TV, you could see you grouped the guys together in the dugout. Tell us what you
talked to them about, what you said to them.
 
 MIKE HARGROVE: All I said to them was that I've seen big leads in this ballpark go by
the boards. That we still had a lot of time, and we had to -- we had to stay focused on
what we were doing and get base runners and see what happened. But I've seen a lot of big
innings and big leads disappear. I've never seen one where somebody scored 23 runs -- but
at the time I believe it was only 7-2. 
 
Q. Can you comment on Bartolo's ineffectiveness and whether the three-day rest was any
factor at all in today's performance?
 
 MIKE HARGROVE: I don't know that he was affected. I do know that Bart could not get his
breaking stuff over and had to rely heavily on his fastball. I don't care how hard you
throw the ball, if you throw a lot of fastballs and can't get your breaking stuff over,
Big League hitters are going to get to you. I don't think the short rest had anything to
do with it. You know, Bartolo's a good competitor, he's a strong young man. And, you know,
I just think it was one of those nights for him.
