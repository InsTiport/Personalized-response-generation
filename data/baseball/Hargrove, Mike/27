 Q. You got everybody in your lineup out there but Ray Durham of the position players.
Are you going to try to sneak him in at the end?
 
 MIKE HARGROVE: We're going to try. I just got through talking to him. As sad as it is,
you've got to have somebody in reserve in case somebody gets hurt or you go into extra
innings. I would have done that. We're probably going to do that with Ray Durham and Aaron
Sele. Pedro talked to us before the game and said he'd rather get ready for his next
start. He just didn't want to chance anything. Had a little knot in it. We put him back in
reserve. Told us he could pitch, that's how we'll use him. 
 
Q. You know how important it is to come here and get in.
 
 MIKE HARGROVE: I really do. I know that when I went there in '75. I would have been
disappointed had I not gotten in.
