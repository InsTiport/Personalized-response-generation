 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Ronnie Belliard.

 Q. How important for you was -- to get that hit against the team you played with for the world championship in '06 and take us through that at-bat if you will, please?
 RONNIE BELLIARD: I don't know. I think my last two at-bats I just swing at everything I see. Probably I knew they was going to pitch Casey Blake tough. So at that at-bat I didn't want him to tie the ball game. 
 I had a long talk with our hitting coach. He said: Hey, you're good at it; I seen you for the last month, you hit a breaking ball pretty good. Stay back and go through the middle with it. I went out there, hey, hopefully he'll flick me one and I'll stay through it and that's what I did.

 Q. You guys had a tough time with Wainwright through eight innings. Can you tell me how it was like in the box?
 RONNIE BELLIARD: Well, it's tough at that time. You know, he's tough to pick up the breaking balls. And risers, he's not a soft thrower, get up to 95, 93. He got a good sinker, good cutter. I know that. I played behind him. And he's tough. 
 And when it's like that, when that shadow is in between or the sun is back in center field, but I think our break just came in the bottom of the ninth, that line drive to left field.

 Q. Do you think a lot of people thought that with Carpenter and Wainwright the Cardinals were going to come in here and win one or two games in this series right away?
 RONNIE BELLIARD: When I was there, that's what I think. A couple of guys. Carpenter is a good pitcher. He's a Cy Young winner. Probably win another one. 
 And I think I told the guys yesterday, hey, we have to make him pitch. Gotta get in our bullpen. We all know the bullpen, their bullpen is good because they're here because they're good. 
 But I think when you fake up you have to make him throw a lot of pitches. But I think right today he was something else, you know.

 Q. What were you thinking when Mark Loretta hit that ball? Did you see it fall? Where were you exactly?
 RONNIE BELLIARD: I was on second base, and I see the short line drive. I was, wow, look what happened. I was happy. Everybody went -- everybody jumped from the bench and went to the middle of the field and we just got on top of him. 
 I think this is one of the greatest times for me ever in baseball.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Ronnie.
