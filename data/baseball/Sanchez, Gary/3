Yankees - 7, Indians - 3
Q. Gary, what was the biggest difference you noticed with Severino between tonight and the Wild Card game?
GARY SANCHEZ: I mean, the main difference tonight is that we wanted to attack with the fastball, use the fastball more.  He was commanding it very well.  Kept it low.  And then following that, later in the game, we started using the slider and the changeup, as well.
The two homers they hit off of him, I believe they were on good pitches.  So credit to them on that.
And he battled.  He threw seven innings, pitched seven innings for us, which was big.
