Q.  Scott, in all the situational hitting you did with you and your dad, were you ever in that situation? 

SCOTT SPIEZIO:  He always seemed to use it as Game 7.  I guess I'll be able to use that tomorrow.  The thing about it is he tried to put me in the toughest situation so that any other situation didn't seem as tough.  So, tomorrow, it's going to be real.  I'm looking forward to it.  But I've used all that visualization and situational hitting through my whole career.  I used it tonight again.
