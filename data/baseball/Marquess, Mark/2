 Q.   In that first inning, you guys were down 2‑0, but having given up a hit, what did you tell your pitcher to calm down?   What was the message to him?  
MARK MARQUESS:   I don't know what Coach Filter told him but it worked.   He settled down and pitched well for us.   Again, first time out there, freshman, did a good job, and again they scored two runs without getting a hit and then we gave them a lot.   
But we came back and then he settled down and pitched great for us and it really helped us because we didn't have to use any of the other arms for any great length, and it was really good.   
Then we got the big inning, six runs in that second or third inning, whatever it was.   And I thought Diekroeger's big three‑run homer was really the big hit in that inning.   It gave us a gap and we were able to add on to that and Hannie did a great job of really throwing the plate and doing a good job.   
   
 Q.   Brett, what did you do to settle down in the game and get past the first?   
BRETT HANEWICH:   Just really focus on throwing strikes and throwing it up.   I knew our offense would turn it on and they did, and just throwing it up, get me to settle down a little bit and feel for my pitches, all my off‑speed stuff and my fastball.   I just tried to locate and have my command, and that really helped me out.   Obviously helped me settle down.   
   
 Q.   Who are you going to pitch in this upcoming game?   
MARK MARQUESS:   Logan James, start him.
