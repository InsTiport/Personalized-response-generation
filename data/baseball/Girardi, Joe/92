YANKEES  Â– 6
  RANGERS - 5

 Q. Joe, what do you think CC's problem was tonight? Was it the long layoff or just not sharp or what? 
 JOE GIRARDI: You know, you can never put your finger exactly on it, what the cause was. I think CC had 20 balls in the first inning and that's usually about six innings of work for him. He was definitely off today, but didn't give up ten runs. He kept it to five and we were able to come back. 

 Q. Even for a veteran team like yours, that kind of win, what kind of rise? 
 JOE GIRARDI: It's a great win for our club, and you know, we get the one run on a homer by Robby in the seventh, and that big inning we have in the eighth all starts with a hustle play by Brett Gardner. We didn't do much off of C.J. Wilson and as much success as he's had off of left-handers, left-handers had most of the hits early on off him. He was very good. But we start scratching and you get a double by Jeet and guys start putting good at-bats and you get the walk and double; it's a huge win. 

 Q. What does it say about the bullpen to come in in a situation like this, down 5-0 and completely locked it down from that point on for you? 
 JOE GIRARDI: We have liked our bullpen all year long. We have added Kerry Wood, who has given us a lot of depth and Boone Logan stepped up for Damaso Marte who we lost in the middle of the summer and has had a very good year for us. Our bullpen, we have some good arms down there, and guys that have some experience and know how to pitch. 

 Q. When you take CC out at that point, are you at all thinking down the line in this series? 
 JOE GIRARDI: No, not necessarily. No. I think he had 92 or 95 pitches through four. He worked extremely hard. So we thought, I had Joba up, if I needed Joba to get him out of the fourth inning and that's why I went to Joba in the fifth because he was hot; I wasn't going to sit him down and not use him. Mo did a good job, Woody did a good job, big pick off move with Kinsler. Our bullpen was great.

 Q. This would not increase the likelihood of CC starting --
 JOE GIRARDI: I'm worried about Game 2. 

 Q. Your club is making an astounding routine of the 48 comeback wins in the regular season and three already in the post-season; what does it say about the group?
 JOE GIRARDI: Our guys grind out their at-bats. They put good at-bats against pitchers and we have guys that have come up against some really big hits this year during the course of the season and the post-season. Our lineup is deep, and whether we are facing a left-hander or right-hander, we feel good about our lineup and the at-bats that they put on people. 
 You keep putting people on, you're eventually going to get some runs. 

 Q. When Brett dives at first like that, do you feel a little upbeat in the clubhouse? 
 JOE GIRARDI: No, not necessarily. As a manager, you hold your breath. Because a lot of times, that's where you see hands get hurt or shoulders get hurt diving in first base. But he felt it was the right move and it worked out well for us and Gardy always plays extremely hard and we love the way he plays the game. And Jeet scores the big double and we get some runs.

 Q. I don't know if you need more confidence than you already have, but does this kind of win do something extra special for your team?
 JOE GIRARDI: We have a veteran clubhouse that knows how to react to whatever situation we are in. And you know, we look forward to Game 2, and I'm sure they are, too. 
 But, you know, some might feel we were fortunate to come out with a win tonight, but I thought our club played hard and kept playing and playing and playing. And you try to build on it tomorrow.

 Q. If you're holding your breath on Gardner's play, what were you thinking when CC made his play early in the game and how big was that for your team to cut off that run?
 JOE GIRARDI: Well, that's the difference in the game maybe. It's a 6-6 game and maybe we are still playing right now and we have seen some of those here, that's for sure, some long, extra-inning games. But you worry. When it comes up and he's got dirt all over, you worry. But if there is a collision at home plate, CC is going to win most of them.

 Q. Did this one surprise you? 
 JOE GIRARDI: I'm never surprised at what our guys -- maybe thrilled sometimes, but never surprised. Because I know the attitude in there, and they stay on each other about grinding out at-bats. That's what they talk about, and chip away. 
 You know, there's a talented group in there that plays the game with a lot of passion. So like I said, I'm never really surprised, but I am thrilled sometimes.
