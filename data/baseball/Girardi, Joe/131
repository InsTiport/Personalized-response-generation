 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Joe Girardi.   
  
  Q. Can you take us through taking Mariano out and Robertson out, and what your thought process was?   
 JOE GIRARDI: Yeah, we thought we had Mo for an inning. I didn't feel that I could stretch him out any further than that in that situation because of what we did the other day with him. So he had that inning, and that was it.   
 As far as Robertson, we like the match-up with Ace better, the two guys. And it didn't work.  
  
  Q. Why'd you like the match-up with Aceves and Mathis?  
 JOE GIRARDI: It's just different kind of stuff against those hitters. And we have all the match-ups, and all the scouting reports, and we felt that, you know, it was a better match up for us.  
  
  Q. I know you didn't know or think this was going to be a cake walk. Can you assess the series right now? You're still ahead. They're playing tough at home, obviously.   
 JOE GIRARDI: This is the type of series we expected it to be. We've had two extra inning games out of three games. They've been hard-fought games. Tomorrow's a new day, and we'll be back.  
  
  Q. You were talking about Andy about a couple of pitches before Guerrero took him deep. Was there anything specific you were talking about?  
 JOE GIRARDI: We just told him how we wanted to attack Vlad in that situation, and what we wanted to do. And Andy missed his spot, and ended up being a two-run homer.  
  
  Q. Any concern about the lack of being able to hit with men on base, besides solo homers, and any thought of trying to put Gardner in the starting lineup for one of your struggling outfielders?   
 JOE GIRARDI: I mean, these guys have got us to a 5-1 record during the course of this playoffs, and they've been big contributors. So I mean, tomorrow we're going to face lefties, so that does some different things, but we look at the lineup every day, and, you know, we had some chances.   
 I think we had a chance in the second, first and third, one out. And I believe in the fourth, first and third, one out. And not being able to get it done there is probably part of the reason we lost the game.  
  
  Q. How comfortable are you now with CC tomorrow on short rest having used only eight pitchers today?  
 JOE GIRARDI: I'm comfortable. We didn't really stretch out any of our pitchers too far today out of the bullpen. So I believe our guys will be fine tomorrow. We'll take a look at it when we get here.   
 So I feel comfortable with CC on three days.  
  
  Q. Just to clarify, Mariano was going to come out after that inning no matter what?  
 JOE GIRARDI: Yes, yes. Now if it's a save situation and we get a run before that, may be a different story.
