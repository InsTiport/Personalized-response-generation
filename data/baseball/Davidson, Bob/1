 It's a tag-up situation.  With the bases loaded, our mechanics are that it's the plate man who gets back and lines up the tag.  Brian Knight hustled over to third base where he's supposed to be, but he doesn't have the tag-up call.  That's the plate umpire's call.  I had it lined up.  The wrong umpire made the initial call.  It's the plate umpire, which is me.  It's my call, and I had him leaving early and called him out.
