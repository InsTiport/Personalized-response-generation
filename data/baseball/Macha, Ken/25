Q.   What did the umpire tell you?
 
KEN MACHA: He said that there are two types of obstructions.  He said that our runner gave up, he ran about two-thirds of the way down, Varitek had the ball and he stopped.  That was his interpretation. 
 
Q.   What was your interpretation?
 
KEN MACHA: It appeared that he ran two-thirds of the way, so I don't know. 
 
Q.   You were arguing with the umpire?
 
KEN MACHA: He continued to run.  The obstruction happened around the base.  I thought he continued to run. 
 
Q.   Did you feel you squandered a couple of opportunities?  And considering what's happened in the past, do you think this might have a hangover effect?
 
KEN MACHA: Well, I hope some of the guys learned a lesson on a couple of the plays.  It's unfortunate when it happens in a game like this.  Jason blocked the plate real well, the ball got by.  I think Byrnes' knee was hurting.  He was more concerned about his knee.  Obviously it would have worked out a lot better if he had touched the plate.  We were screaming out of the dugout for him to go do it.  It's tough.  We played a poor second inning.  It's amazing that I think we gave them seven outs in that second inning.  It's amazing they only got one run.  I thought Ted pitched extremely well, as did our bullpen.  We've got to bounce back tomorrow. 
 
Q.   Would you talk about Ted Lilly's performance?
 
KEN MACHA: Absolutely.  Like I said, I thought he did a tremendous job allowing just one run in the second inning.  He was aggressive, had a good fastball, pitched tremendous.
