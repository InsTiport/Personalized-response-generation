  KEN MACHA:  I told the players, they can't let this series diminish what they did this year.  I thought it was a tremendous year.  Just watching that game today, that's a tremendous baseball game. 
 The guys played their tails off and that's all you can ask.  There were great defensive plays, and guys were playing with tremendous intensity.  That's all you can ask. 

 Q.  Anything you want to say about the Tigers? 
 KEN MACHA:  The Tigers, they're playing real well right now, and I wish them a lot of luck.  I'm sure they'll do fine.
