Q.   How tough was that?
R.A. DICKEY:   It's a whole different dynamic coming out of the pen.   Especially this is the first time I've done it in quite some time.   I threw some pretty good ones and it all worked out. 

Q.   Since 2006, bouncing from team to team‑‑ 
R.A. DICKEY:   It's just, I don't know if I have the words.   It's a great honor, not just for me but for everybody that's supported me, just a nice night.
