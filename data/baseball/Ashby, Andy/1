(On how he was feeling): I feel great. Just didn't pitch very well. My throat is
not sore. It is just I don't have a voice. I am not sure why. I think it is because I was
screaming the last couple of weeks. I was disappointed I didn't give the team a chance to
win. It makes me mad, I didn't do my job. I take full responsibility. I pitched behind in
the count too much. My pitches were up in the zone. The result was not very fun. We now
have to go on to play some baseball. We know what we have to do.
(On how he felt about Caminiti's error and the throw to first): I didn't even
see the play. I was ready to back up first base. Caminiti is a good fielder. He did his
job to get the ball in play and I am not going to complain. He is a good fielder. These
things happen. It just didn't go our way. I can't faulter a guy when it is my fault for
not making accurate pitches.
