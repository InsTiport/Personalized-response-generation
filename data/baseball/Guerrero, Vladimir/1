VLADIMIR GUERRERO: Good afternoon.  When I was a player, I always mentioned that I wanted my bat to do the talking, but now that I'm not playing, I'm very happy to be standing here and talking to you.   
I'd like to thank God, my mom and dad, Paul Lino, Victor Frankomula, Varita Rojo (phonetics) for helping me out with my brand and understanding social media, and all the people that are here today for me.   
Yes, I thank God again, but also I give thanks to Canada and Montreal for the first opportunity to be a Big League player.  Beyond Canada and Montreal giving me a chance to travel, but also to the United States, I got to travel.  Thank you to the Angels, thank you to Mike Scioscia as manager, and thank you to all those that made a difference, and certainly what it means to be here today is truly special for all of you as you influenced my career.   
I know I don't speak a whole lot, but let me tell you that I am so happy to be part of this group because some of them I saw and watched play and I witnessed it, but also I got to play against a lot of them, and it means a lot to me.   
And lastly, I'd like to thank the fact that I came out of a small, little town, Don Gregorio (indiscernible), in the Dominican Republic.   
Even more special today is that today we celebrate Father's Day in the Dominican Republic, which is twice a celebration for me being here today, and happy Father's Day to all the Dominican pops.  Thank you.
