Q. In talking famous baseball players that come from Notre Dame, and he said Yaztremski
played there for a year.

CRAIG COUNSELL: There's a lot of guys that played like in the 20's and 30's, I believe,
but recently like I think Cap Anson, I think he's in the Hall of Fame. But recently like
since '60s, 70's, '80s, there's really been nobody that really stood out.

Q. Does that make the baseball player on Notre Dame's campus something of a second
class citizen compared to the football player?

CRAIG COUNSELL: Football is No. 1 at Notre Dame. Always has been and always will be.

Q. Even now?

CRAIG COUNSELL: I suppose it would be a good time to be there. No, football is No. 1,
but it's a good school to go to, it's a good school to play athletics. It's a great place
to get your education.

Q. Edgar, what are your experiences in cold weather, what do you think of playing in
very cold weather?

EDGAR RENTERIA: Yes, I spent three years playing in cold weather in the Minor Leagues
and I love playing in cold weather, I love the cold.

Q. Why do you like playing in cold weather?

EDGAR RENTERIA: I don't know, I just enjoy it. I like it a lot.

Q. For Edgar, do you think that Omar Vizquel is the best fielding shortstop in baseball
or do you think maybe you're better?

EDGAR RENTERIA: That I'm the best, no, but in the American League, Omar is probably the
best fielding shortstop. And in the National League there's a lot of real good fielding
shortstops.

Q. Craig, in that first series in Chicago when it was so cold, what do you remember
about that, how do you think it affected the game?

EDGAR RENTERIA: In Chicago I really wasn't prepared for the cold that early in the
season, but now these games mean a lot. These games are very important and I'm ready for
them.

Q. How did it affect the play, just in general?

EDGAR RENTERIA: I really don't know, it's difficult to play in there, but I think if
you're prepared for it, it's really not going to affect the teams at all.

Q. Craig, since you've come over and played with Edgar, what's the most amazing thing
that you've seen him do on the field, it doesn't necessarily have to be in a game, it
could even be in BP?

CRAIG COUNSELL: I don't think one thing is going to stand out in my mind, but I think
it's just -- I think the best part about playing second base -- shortstop is -- you can
make a real impact on a game defensively. And I think when you play with a great shortstop
you're able to make, sometimes make plays, make double plays that normally you wouldn't be
able to make. And I guess that's why I like playing with Edgar, because we're able to do
things, we're able to make great plays, turn a great double play that normally you
wouldn't be able to turn.

Q. Edgar, as well as you've played this year, we keep hearing wonderful things about
Alex Gonzalez and he will challenge you for a job next year. Have you seen him and is he
capable of pushing you?

EDGAR RENTERIA: Yes, I've seen him play and he's an excellent shortstop. I have a lot
of confidence in myself and I have a lot of conditioning and practice that I do myself.
But it's always good to be pushed, and he's an excellent shortstop. 

Q. Edgar, could you talk about what impact your being in the World Series has had back
home and how your family is following your play, how big a story are you in Columbia right
now?

EDGAR RENTERIA: In Columbia there's never been a baseball player play in the World
Series. And now all of Columbia is following me -- all of Columbia is supporting me, and I
think that's the best thing that's ever happened to baseball in Columbia.

Q. If I can ask a follow-up. What do you think will happen when you return home to
Columbia after the series, what kind of reaction -- what do you think they'll do for you?

EDGAR RENTERIA: I really don't know what they're going to be doing for me. What I'd
like to see is that all the youngsters follow the baseball and pick up the baseball and
there will be a lot more baseball being played by the youngsters in Columbia.

Q. Craig, did you ever face Jaret in the Minors, and also coming over from the Rockies,
at all prepare you for doing the same thing in the World Series?

CRAIG COUNSELL: I may have had one at-bat. I think I had one at-bat against him. But
everybody is kind of facing all these pitchers for the first time, so you try to do your
best to learn about them beforehand, whether it be on video or from scouting reports. And
that's -- sometimes that's tough. I always think you feel more comfortable after you've
faced the pitcher a couple of times. But I think everybody is in the same boat, Cleveland
and us. So you just try to do your best to prepare yourself through scouting reports,
coaches help, video, whatever.

Q. Do you remember batting last year, what happened, and also did you prepare for your
first go-around with the Marlins kind of like you've been doing for the World Series, did
you watch a lot of film, maybe more than other guys, in July and August?

EDGAR RENTERIA: That's kind of how I prepare myself normally. I like to -- I just like
information. That usually helps me out. The more information I have helps me out, then I
pick and choose what stuff I want to use and what stuff not to use. That's what I've tried
to do, yes, since I've been here.

Q. Craig, what's the coldest game you've played in the PCL, and playing in Colorado do
you think is going to help you prepare in Cleveland?

CRAIG COUNSELL: I grew up in Milwaukee, I went to school in South Bend, so this is
outstanding weather. I can't wait to go out and play in it, to be honest with you. To me
growing up, this is always what the World Series was played in, is weather like this. It's
the World Series, I don't care what the weather is going to be like, to be honest with
you. It's not going to be a factor from my standpoint, and I don't think -- it's going to
be cold, you've got to deal with it. If you let it affect you, you're crazy.

Q. Have you heard -- Craig, have you heard from anyone at Milwaukee, since this might
be as close as it gets to Milwaukee for a while. Have you heard from any friends?

CRAIG COUNSELL: Yes, actually I did receive a message the other morning from Paul
Molitor, who just called and wished me good luck, so that was nice and pretty special.

Q. Edgar, do you have any friends or family coming in from Columbia for the World
Series?

EDGAR RENTERIA: Yes, in Miami I had quite a few friends that came up from Columbia and
there were a lot of friends that came up for the game, plus my family has come up to
Miami, as well. Right now in Cleveland I don't know, but with all the excitement in
Columbia, I'm sure there will probably be somebody that comes up. 

Q. How much baseball is there in Columbia and if there's one baseball player how many
soccer players are there by comparison?

EDGAR RENTERIA: There's a lot, there's too many great soccer players that come out of
Columbia, too many to count, I'd be counting forever. Baseball players, about one comes
out every ten years, so you have to realize I have to take advantage of that opportunity
and enjoy it and show what I've got.
