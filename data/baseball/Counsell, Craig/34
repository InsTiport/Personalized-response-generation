Q.  We keep asking you to compare it to your time in Florida. 
 
CRAIG COUNSELL:  Well, I mean, we still got some work to do here, I know that.  But it's starting to get pretty darn close, I'll tell you that.  I think being here all year has been really special.  You've gone through all the ups and downs that a team goes through through the course of the year, and you become a unit.  How we got better, how we always had confidence, despite some setbacks sometimes.  But to be here all year with this team and just see everything, and the way we've won games in the playoffs here, I mean it's quite a thrill.  But I think we still feel like we got some work to do.  There's no question if we're able to win this thing, it will be a bigger thrill.  Just, like I said, being a part of it all year.  I feel like we still have work to do.  
 

Q.  How about personally, being able to do what you've done in the last year and now being the MVP? 
 
CRAIG COUNSELL:  Well, you feel really fortunate.  You feel lucky.  I mean, I felt like I was battling for a job in spring training just to make the team and be the utility guy.  Through some circumstances I got a chance to play a little bit.  Bob showed a ton of faith in me.  You just feel lucky.  You feel blessed to be in this position again.  The MVP, that's just something extra.  I mean, I'm thrilled to be going to the World Series.  That's number one, no doubt about it.  I'm still thrilled for all the guys in the room.  So many guys in there have played ten, twelve years, accomplished so much in their career, and not had a chance to do this.  For them to have a chance to do this, that makes you feel so, so good.
