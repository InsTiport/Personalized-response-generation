Q.  David, can you talk about your time here in  '91 and your memories of it, just go through that.
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  I just remember, you know, it being packed and the hankies and being very loud, and it was definitely, you know, playoff atmosphere.  I remember  -- I mean, I could talk all day about that, Susan.  You want to be a little more specific?  I mean, I just remember it, obviously, being my first World Series, and just the excitement of that.  And, you know, then I remember Jack Morris doing a number on us, I remember Kirby hitting a homerun to win the game, and I could go on and on.  
 
Q.  Hi, David.  Everybody talks about Yankee Stadium and they say, "Oh, we can handle the Metrodome because we have been to Yankee Stadium."  Can you compare the two and, say, are they similar situations?
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  Yeah.  They both are very similar.  You know, obviously, if you could put a lid over Yankee Stadium, I think it would probably be even louder than here.  You know, obviously, having the lid over the stadium, you know, keeps all the noise inside.  But it's great.  I mean, I don't think there is a better atmosphere to play in than a very loud or very noisy atmosphere, and, you know, I am looking forward to it.  And you've got to understand, though, that although it will be something new for us, our team, you know, seeing this dome so loud, like it will be, but I think it will be something new for their ball club, as well, because I don't think they have experienced it, either.  So both teams  -- we will see how both teams deal with it. 
 
Q.  What are your thoughts, Dave, on having Barry Zito starting this game, and are you going to give him any pointers about handling the noise, having experienced it yourself?
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  No, I won't give Barry any pointers at all.  No, I mean, we are very, obviously, confident and happy to have Barry going, and we just hope he comes out and pitches the way he is capable of pitching.  And, you know, obviously, as the hitters  -- go ahead.  Obviously, as the hitters, we want to obviously ease the stress on him by scoring some runs early and helping him  -- help him settle down, but we are comfortable about him going, and I won't say anything about it.  I think he will be prepared, he will be ready, and Barry can handle this situation.  He will be fine. 
 
Q.  How is his personality, perhaps, best suited for the rock concert type of atmosphere that one would see at the Metrodome for the post season?
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  I just think, you know, you got Barry Zito the man and then Barry Zito, you know, the pitcher.  And, you know, Barry Zito the pitcher, you know, is just as prepared, you know, works just as hard as any other pitcher, has incredible talent, the ability to  -- that great curve ball everybody knows, change-up, the fastball, he can mix in and out.  When the game is over with, Barry Zito the man, Barry might go somewhere and play his guitar and do what Barry does, but what he steps on that field, he is just as prepared as anybody else. 
 
Q.  David, a lot has been made about the Twins's problems handling left-handed pitching, and I am just wondering, in a series like this, does that tend to get magnified?  Is there any chance that that may become more of a mental thing with them than over the course of a regular season?
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  Well, no doubt about it, because, I mean, obviously, if they had to face Barry and Mark, you know, every time they faced a lefty it would be tough on them.  You are not just talking about two regular lefties; these two guys are two of the best lefties in the game.  And, you know, I have faced them both, so I can understand, you know, how their lefties feel.  So like I say, hopefully for us Barry goes out there tomorrow and pitches the way he is capable, and if he does, it's going to give us a great chance to win. 
 
Q.  Just one or two more, if there is anything.  Nothing else for Dave?  Okay.  One more back there. 
 
 
Q.  David, is there a trick to dealing with the noise, do you think?  I mean, they are 11 and 1 here in this building in the post-season?
 
DAVID JUSTICE:  Yeah, but they are not 11 and 1 because of the noise, though, they are 11-1 because they know how to play at their stadium, they have speed, they have guys who can chop some baseballs into the turf and get those type of base hits, but the crowd and the noise, that's not the reason why they are good at home, because they haven't played in front of a crowd like we are going to have here in these two games.
