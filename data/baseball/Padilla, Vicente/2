  Q. How do you feel today, and basically what was the difference between that successful outing against the Cardinals, and how do you feel compared to that one actually tonight?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: Well, I think I have a lot more confidence, and I was able to pitch well. Fortunately we won, so I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. What was it like today going up against Pedro Martinez?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: I was very emotional, and obviously he's one of the best pitchers that there is, and I have a lot of respect for him. You've got to give a lot of credit to that guy, as well. He pitched really well.   
  
  Q. It's been a long road for you. Did you ever expect when you came aboard here in August that you'd end up pitching these important games, especially in the NLCS, and what has this whole second part of the season meant to you?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: I was very happy to be given this opportunity with the Dodgers. The hope that I had with this team was just to pitch well and go all the way, and I just feel fortunate to pitch in this important game, and I hope we go all the way.   
  
  Q. Your teammates had a rough night against Pedro Martinez. But what was the feeling after he took you out of the game? You had to be cheering for them.   
 VICENTE PADILLA: I was very happy with the way I pitched, although we were losing. I knew that the guys were going to come back, and I think I'm more happy now because the team won.   
  
  Q. You've quickly become one of the most popular players in the clubhouse, but we're hearing stories about how you were a divisive force on other teams. Can you explain why there's this kind of disconnect between your past teams and what you have with the Dodgers?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: The obvious difference is that my teammates that I have right now, they have supported me from the beginning, and they have embraced me since I came. And I think that's the big difference.   
  
  Q. Have you seen this much crowd in your life in any game that you've pitched in your life? What did you think?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: It's my first time playing in front of a big crowd like this in a game that's more important than I've ever pitched in my life, and I was very emotional.
