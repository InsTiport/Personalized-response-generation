  Q. I'm guessing this is probably the biggest game you're about to pitch in your career. You can clinch the division for the Dodgers tomorrow. How are you feeling? How are your emotions?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: First of all, I'm very happy. I'm very glad to be in this position. And to be given this opportunity.   
 I'm really glad that where we are as a team right now, so I'm very glad that we're here.   
  
  Q. It seems like your pitcher strategy has been to avoid Albert Pujols at all costs. What can you tell me about tomorrow's start, what you'll do?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: I wouldn't know until I'm in a game situation. It depends on what the situation is. I'll decide then, but I can't really tell you right now.   
  
  Q. You went unbeaten as a Dodger, had your best game in your last game. What was the difference between what was going on for you in Texas and once you got to LA, and are you pitching as good as you've ever pitched in your career?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: I feel like the Dodgers are really United as a team. I was welcomed like a family, and I'm very glad at how they're treating me in the team. I think overall it's a great organization.   
  
  Q. You throw one of the slowest curve balls in all of baseball. It's almost like an eephus pitch. Can you describe where you picked that up and what an effective weapon that is when you throw that super slow curveball?  
 VICENTE PADILLA: Well, I think I picked it up around two years ago. I was practicing. I kept practicing, and the better rotation it has, the better result it's going to be. So I've been practicing for a while.
