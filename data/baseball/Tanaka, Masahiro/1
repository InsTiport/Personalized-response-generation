New York - 7, Houston - 0   
 Q.  67 pitches over six innings, what was the key to being so efficient?  
MASAHIRO TANAKA: Just going into the game with a plan, obviously having a plan going into the game and really focusing on each pitch, executing your pitches, that's kind of where it all comes down to. I think the other big factor about tonight was our defense. I think they made some really solid plays and that led to the W tonight.   
 Q.  What was the plan?  
MASAHIRO TANAKA: I can't say that, sorry.   
 Q.  Aaron said he considered sending you back out for the 7th. What would you think about coming out after 68 pitches?  
MASAHIRO TANAKA: At this point in time I don't think you really consider the number of pitches that much. For me it wasn't much of a surprise being pulled out after the sixth inning.   
 Q.  1.32 career ERA for your postseason seven starts, you've never allowed more than two runs in any of those starts. I know you're all about the team, but do you have an appreciation for what you've been doing for a few years in October?  
MASAHIRO TANAKA: Yeah, obviously the number's there and I guess I'm flattered. But the happiest thing for me is us being able to get the W. And knowing that you went out there and you gave everything you had, that's the feeling that you're looking for. And so that's kind of where I'm at with that.
