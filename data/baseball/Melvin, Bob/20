THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Bob Melvin.   
   
 Q.   The skirmish at the end, what was your take or perception on what happened there?   
BOB MELVIN:   I'm not really sure.   I know Balf talks to himself quite a bit, I think sometimes players think maybe he's talking to them.   I have not talked to Balfour about it, but that's my take at this point.   
   
 Q.   The pitching performance you got, holding them to three runs all in one inning?   
BOB MELVIN:   Right, and we've been obviously pitching really well, our starters are keepin' us in the game.   
I think in Jarrod's case, maybe pitching to the score of the game a little bit today.   But the bullpen came in and shut it down, so we're fortunate enough to be able to keep an offensive club to this point kind of at bay.   
   
 Q.   When the Tigers break the scoreless streak there in the fourth, how important was it for you guys to respond as quickly as you did?   
BOB MELVIN:   Right, because the momentum shifted, crowd got into it, all of the sudden it's a tie game.   It felt like a game we were semi in control of, and Brandon Moss hit a home run.   That's a huge swing in momentum for us.   At the time it felt like it was more than just a solo home run, so big of a swing for us and then continued to swing the bat well after that.   That was huge for us.   
   
 Q.   Is this a matter of time being patient and the guys start swinging the bat better, Moss and Donaldson, and was it tough to be patient and wait until they broke out?   
BOB MELVIN:   No, I mean, look, we had two well‑pitched games against us.   I have been asked about the strikeouts.   The reason we had strikeouts is because Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander were on it.   We have a tendency to strike out anyway because we hit homers, but we just didn't get too many of those looks in the Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander games.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
