Q.  Most of your success has been as a pinch hitter, even though you came into the game.  Did you treat it as that?
 
MIGUEL CAIRO:  Yes.  I always get ready to pinch hit.  Today I got the chance, the opportunity to go out there.  I was just looking for fast ball to hit somewhere hard.  I get the fast ball right in the middle, a little in, but I tried to hit it to the middle.  I get lucky today.  
 
Q.  Would you tell us what it means to you to be here, getting hit today?
 
MIGUEL CAIRO:  You know, I just am blessed right now.  I'm in the best organization in baseball.  Since I've been here, it's been so good for me.  You know, they've been treating me so well.  You know, today, the base hit, was make it most better.  You know, what a beautiful day today for me.  It was good.  
 
Q.  What does it do for the Cardinals to come in here and get these two games off Johnson and Schilling?
 
MIGUEL CAIRO:  You just facing the best two pitchers in the National League and American League.  You face Randy Johnson, he might win the Cy Young award.  When you come over here and you face those two guys, you know, you win two games here in Arizona, it's kind of hard, you have 50,000 people rooting against you.  It feels good.  It feels really nice to come here and get two.  Now we going to go home and try to finish over there.  
 
Q.  Do you consider yourself mostly a first pitch hitter when you only have one at-bat a game?
 
MIGUEL CAIRO:  I try to look for a ball to hit.  When you pinch hitting, you just going to see one good fast ball.  I try to go out there and trying to look for it, trying to hit it hard somewhere, you know, hoping that I get lucky at-bat.  Sometimes you going to miss, sometimes you going to hit it.
