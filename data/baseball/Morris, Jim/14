JIM MORRIS: I'm proud the way our guys have played all year.  They have played hard.  We have had some hot streaks and some real hot streaks to be honest with you.  We've been very consistent, our defense in particular.  Of course, Zack Collins is our best offensive guy, and he's improved tremendously defense.  If you take my vote, I would vote him as Player of the Year of the conference.  Batista, he's a player that's got a chance to go very high in the draft.  Our bullpen's outstanding, led by Garcia.  Brian has set the record for the most saves at the University of Miami, and it's been a pretty good program, so that speaks for itself.  I feel good about our entire team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
JIM MORRIS: He's got a lot of big hits for us and played tremendously.  Now we're talking about the bottom of our lineup, really when you talk about those guys, you're talking about six, seven eight in the batting order or nine with Edgar.   
Been very productive there at times, and the middle of our lineup Collins and Lopez and Ruiz and Chester, all of the guys have had really good years.   
 Q.  What challenges do you face not knowing who your first opponent will be in pool play, trying to set your rotation and get things ready to go when you start play later in the week?  
JIM MORRIS: Well, we'll get a chance to see BC play.  It seems like forever since we've played Boston College.  We didn't play them this year.  Didn't play them last year.  I haven't seen them in a while.  We have got a couple times to watch them on TV and we'll be watching when they open up against Georgia Tech, which we play Georgia Tech and we know a little bit more about them, but we'll try to find out as much as we can about BC and set our rotation appropriately.
