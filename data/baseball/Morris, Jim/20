HEAD COACH JIM MORRIS:   We left way too many guys on base.   We left 14 guys on base.   It's tough to win when you do that.   Their bullpen did a tremendous job against us coming in and pitching.   Our first four runs were a direct result of a walk or a hit batsman.   They gave them an opportunity in a situation which we haven't been doing during this 13‑game winning streak.   We've been getting the big hits when we need them and we didn't get them tonight, but their guys do really good, their bullpen threw really good and congratulate them on the win.   
   
 Q.   Ricky, it must be fun playing in a game like that but disappointing to lose.   Can you talk about the feeling in the dugout?     
RICKY EUSEBIO:   I mean, it was a tough loss to go down like that but I like the way we battled.   We battled the whole game.   We were all up, we're still up.   We feel positive about the loss but that's baseball.   They came out on top tonight, they pitched well and we left a couple guys, too many guys on base.  
   
 Q.   Coach, similar question, just what was going on in your head as that game went along?  
HEAD COACH JIM MORRIS:   Say that again?  
   
 Q.   Could you just describe what was going on in your head as that game went along?       
HEAD COACH JIM MORRIS:   Well, it was a battle the whole game.   We were both scrappy, trying to figure out a way to score a run.   I hate that it ends on an error.   Palmeiro really hit the ball good.   But we had some chances.   Ricky did a great job getting on base, he got on base four times and had some chances to score and we left him on base.   But you're just trying to figure out how to score a run and how to go to your bullpen and how to stop them and give us another chance with them being home team.   But their bullpen did a great job against us, no question about that.   And we left some guys on early, we left the bases loaded twice.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of Suarez and the way he pitched tonight?  
HEAD COACH JIM MORRIS:   I thought Suarez threw good.   He gave up, what, two runs I think, if I'm not mistaken, and‑‑ three runs, and he walked one guy and hit a guy and both those guys scored early in the game.   We could have made a play there maybe to save him, but the real deal is he had good stuff and when he left the game we were winning 4‑2.   You need to win in that situation right there.  
   
 Q.   You guys started the game strong, you scored your four runs in the first four innings, but then the offense kind of dried up until really the very end of the game at the last, top of the 12th when you had runners at the corners.   Did you see anything that changed as the game went along from NC State, from your own guys that maybe made the offense dry up there?  
HEAD COACH JIM MORRIS:   From NC State's perspective, I mean, they had guys come in throwing strikes and throwing hard with good breaking stuff.   We had a couple chances.   The catcher made a couple plays there, blocked balls, but really their pitching did a great job on us and that stopped us from that point on.   And every guy that walked up there had good arms and had good stuff.
