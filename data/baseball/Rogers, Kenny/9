Q.  People haven't heard why you decided to come here?
 
KENNY ROGERS:  I think people that know me - (inaudible.) 
 
Q.  Not only are you here you, but had some boos in the lineup in pregame --
 
KENNY ROGERS:  You know, I don't hold anything against anyone.  Everyone is going to say what they should do.  
 
Q.  The guys in the clubhouse they said "we want Kenny here," and Terry Francona had said if you're here that he would pitch you.
 
KENNY ROGERS:  I wanted to pitch also.  I didn't pitch last year in the game, and I think at this stage of my career, it's something that is not expected from me but I'm happy to be here.  I know I've earned the right with the way I've pitched but there's a lot other stuff going on.  I didn't want this to be a distraction and I hope it hasn't been.  I hope that everything that happened, we just put our attention on the game and keep our focus on that.
