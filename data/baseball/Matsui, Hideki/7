Q.  How have you enjoyed your first season in American Major League Baseball? 

HIDEKI MATSUI:   I've given my best effort every day, and so in that sense, I think I've been able to enjoy it. 

Q.  Has anybody talked to you on the team about the difference between the regular season and going into the post-season, how the season sort of changes? 

HIDEKI MATSUI:   I haven't heard any advice or anything from any of the other players.  I'm just intending to take the same approach that I have in the past.
