Q. Were you surprised at all about the amount of offense you were able to generate
without Mike Piazza?

JOHN OLERUD: Well, I think any time you lose a guy like Mike Piazza, he is such a big
part of our offense, you know, that definitely hurts, but we have got a lot of guys on
this club that can swing the bats and you know, so I don't think we were that surprised.
We needed big offensive performance and got some big hits.

Q. Can you talk about the energy level of the crowd tonight when you got the lead and
scored the six runs, how much of a lift did that provide your team?

JOHN OLERUD: Well, I think the fans were great from the first pitch on. Any time there
was a situation for a strike out, or a big at-bat they were on their feet. So I think it
was they were definitely a plus for us.

Q. Omar Daal has been pretty tough. You guys were able to get to him. How much
confidence runs scoring how much did the runs scoring tonight give you guys a lift for the
series?

JOHN OLERUD: Well, I think he has pitched us tough in the past. And when we have
struggled the last few games or coming down the stretch, it was from not scoring runs and
I think getting a big offensive output like tonight definitely gives the guys confidence.

Q. Can you take it one game at a time knowing that you beat Randy Johnson once and you
don't have to face him tomorrow; you guys feel like you have the series in hand?

JOHN OLERUD: Well, I think we are one game away, so we definitely have an advantage
that we can finish it up tomorrow. By beating Randy Johnson, that was a great win for us.
We just as soon not to have to face him again, so I think everybody would want to win that
one tomorrow.
