   THE MODERATOR: We'll ask U.S.A. manager, Davey Johnson, to make a few remarks about his team's performance remarks today. 

 DAVEY JOHNSON: I tell you, it was a heck of a ball game. This time of year, you know, everybody is not at their best, and I thought everybody played a heck of a ball game. 
 The hitting was there. The pitching was almost there. Just a heck of a ball game.
