Q.  You got things started tonight with your double, can you talk about coming off the bench and doing your job? 
 
DANNY BAUTISTA:   Well, I've been coming off the bench all year.  I think that's my situation here, playing off the bench.  I come to the park today, I was supposed to not be playing, but you never know.  I'm so glad when I saw my name up there.  I said, "Here we go.  Let's do it."  I'm having fun.  
 

Q.  Does it give you confidence knowing that your manager, Bob Brenly, has a lot of confidence in you, to place you in games like this? 
 
DANNY BAUTISTA:   I think he used me all year the way he used me right now, playing against left-handed pitching, and, yeah, I feel confidence.  
 

Q.  On your first at-bat, the double, what was the pitch and were you anticipating it, or did you expect it or did you just go chase it?
 
DANNY BAUTISTA:   I thought to myself, I said, I tried to get a pitch to hit and he made a good pitch.  That was a fastball and I handled it.  
 

Q.  You guys looked aggressive on the base paths tonight, was it an idea tonight that you were going to be aggressive on the paths? 
 
DANNY BAUTISTA:   When you play ball the way we played tonight, and with Randy pitching a great game, Matt Williams made a great play all over the infield; it gives you a lot of chances to win the ballgame.  
 

Q.  How would you describe the journey you have taken in baseball, from being 16 and drafted by the Braves and coming here and being in the World Series?
 
DANNY BAUTISTA:   Well, I had a chance before with the Atlanta Braves, but I have not had a chance to play in the World Series because I got an injury right before the World Series. But, you know, I feel like that's as far as you can go in baseball, and I feel happy.
