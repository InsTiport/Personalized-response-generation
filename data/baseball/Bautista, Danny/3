Q.  How long were you able to perform like this in the World Series with the limited time that you've had? 

DANNY BAUTISTA:   Well, I've been playing off the bench.  When you play off the bench, you've got to work every day; you've got to work hard.  You've got to stay focused.  That's what I did.  That's what I do, stay focused, come early to the park, working hard, and that's what I do pretty much. 


Q.  If you come to the park tomorrow and you are not in the starting lineup, are you going to be disappointed, and if not, how do you handle that, knowing that you are a hot hitter now but going up against a right-handed pitcher tomorrow? 

DANNY BAUTISTA:   Well, you never know.  You've got to come to the park.  You've got to come ready to play.  When you've got that mentality, you just  --  nothing can surprise you.  If you come ready to play every day, then you will be fine.  


Q.  With what happened to BK in New York, at some point did you feel the same sympathy for Witasick, what he went through in the third inning tonight?

DANNY BAUTISTA:   Well, you know this game of baseball, you never know about it.  This is great pitching.  He got beat, but, so what, you know.  Next day, you've got to come ready to pitch, and he's a good pitcher.  We were helping him because he had been doing a good job the whole season.  We win together, we lose together.
