David Wells on Gwynn's homerun: You have to tip your hat to the guy. In my mind
he's the best hitter in the game. I made a mistake and he got it. On the victory, the
first win's a big one in this situation. But you've still got to go out and play them
game-by-game. We've shown all year long what we're made of whether it's 10-9 or whatever,
it's a win. It pumps guys up. We want to come into the clubhouse with a win. On his
pregame, tonight I was relaxed. Don't ask me why. I had a good bullpen, I was focused. I
went out there feeling too good, and that's kind of scary.

Chili Davis on Martinez's homerun: I got so excited I had a stomach ache. I haven't
gotten that excited in a long time. I'm so happy for him, he's been trying to pick us up
but he doesn't have to. He just has to go out there and be Tino Martinez. On the victory;
we had to win this ballgame, playing at home. Beating Kevin Brown is big. He's been so
dominant in the postseason that at some point it seemed like he was unbeatable.

Chili on his at-bat against Langston: It was one of those at-bats where you step
back and take in a deep breath. I know Mark Langston, and he knows me. I was just waiting
for a mistake pitch from him. If that didn't happen, I was going to draw a walk.
