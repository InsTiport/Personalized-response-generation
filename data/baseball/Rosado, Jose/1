 Q. Would you tell us what's written underneath the bill of your cap?
 
 JOSE ROSADO: Where I grew up, my family, they always take me to a church, and I know if
I just needed one help, it would be God, and I can do nothing without him. And I'll say it
in Spanish -- in English, it would be that God helps me because I help myself. And 50
percent he gives me, and 50 I put in, and that makes a hundred. 
 
Q. Do you have any family here?
 
 JOSE ROSADO: No. They were in Kansas City for the month but they have to go back to New
York. And I know they were watching me. But I got my dad and mom, they were here. And I
wish my wife could be here, but I had a daughter July 4th, so they will be watching me. 
 
Q. You must love the All-Star Game, because in '97 you won the game. And today you had
a good performance, so what do you feel about the All-Star Game? You must love it.
 
 JOSE ROSADO: Yes, nervous in the bullpen, after I threw my first pitch, when I was
warming up here on the mound, everything changed. But to be in my second All-Star Game in
three years, I'm really happy. I'm proud. I just enjoy to be here around the great players
and I like it, who doesn't? It's great. 
 
Q. Are you expecting more run support in the second half of the season?
 
 JOSE ROSADO: I cannot control that part of the game, if they score or not. What I need
to do is try to go out and make a chance for my team to win the game. And I only care
about a quality start, and that would mean a lot. I did have a good record that people
would like to see in the All-Star Game, but to be here, that's a big win for me. So I'm
glad to be here.
