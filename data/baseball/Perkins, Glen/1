THE MODERATOR:   Okay, right here on the left. 

Q.   Glen, did it live up to your expectations? 
GLEN PERKINS:   I think my expectations and more.   Coming in, you know, the first thing I told myself when I got on the field was slow down, which usually is not a problem for me jogging in.   And I felt like I ran a little too fast, I knew I had a lot of time and I said take some time between warm‑up pitches.   I couldn't do that, so I had to stand on the mound for 45 seconds or whatever. 
But coming in there and hearing the reception, hearing how loud the fans were, it makes me want to get to the playoffs, because I think it felt like a playoff atmosphere out there tonight. 

Q.   What was it like to have this night for you in this town, same night when Jeter was being celebrated, too, all wrapped into one? 
GLEN PERKINS:   It was an honor to be a part of it in a lot of the same ways as getting to partake in it with Mariano last year.   You know, to celebrate his career, Derek's career tonight, was I think a moment just like me being on the mound, something that I'll never forget.   I think to get a standing ovation, have the players come out on the field, everyone recognize a career like that is pretty special. 
You know, down in the pen and we all stood up and cheered.   And I was thinking he was running off the field, I thought stop, you need to stop and tip your hat.   This is the last time all of these people are going to see you.   A pretty special moment. 
And again, just like last year, I was glad I got to be a part of it. 

Q.   When did you know it was going to the ninth?   Was that the plan all along or did that kind of evolve? 
GLEN PERKINS:   No, it was.   It was.   And I guess we scored 3 in the first and it is like this is perfect, let's just zeros, we will go a shut‑out, we will win 3‑0 and I will get out there in the ninth.   Then things happened and we got two.   And I kind of had a feeling I got to pitch the ninth and I wanted the sixth, seventh, eighth to go quick. 
And time stopped once we scored those two runs.   It really‑‑I think those are the three quickest innings, but they dragged on for me because I knew that was going to happen. 
And it was unbelievable and geeze, I don't even know.   Loss of words.   I am not usually at a loss of words but I am now. 

Q.   How special for Kurt being there and for him to get into the game, too.
GLEN PERKINS:   Yeah.   To have a familiar face when you come out on the mound, and he knows what I want to throw.   He comes out and says the same thing to me every time, what signs we are using and what we are using for the guy on second and what pitches I am going to throw, and he is going to call 'em. 
And I think I pitched a little differently than a lot of guys and that was very comforting for me.   And I think that was probably the first thing when I got out there that I was able to relax because I saw it was him.   And he's been awesome all year for everybody, for me especially, and he was great again tonight. 

Q.   Glen, 20 years from now what do you think you will remember most? 
GLEN PERKINS:   Probably how loud the crowd was when I jogged in.   That was‑‑I wasn't fighting back tears, but it was an overwhelming moment to hear.   Kind of the build‑up as I walked out of the pen and then it got louder and louder, and then I was jogging in.   You know, then I think after I got the first or second out they started chanting. 
And those are things that that doesn't happen during the regular season and, you know, it was a moment like that where you realize why you play the game and what makes the game so fun.   And it's the fans in the stands. 

Q.   Do you feel bad for Pat and how it went? 
GLEN PERKINS:   You know, no.   He got the chance to come pitch in front of the fans, you know, that watched him when he was here.   And I'm sure they're a very good team.   I am sure they wanted to win the game, but it didn't work out that way. 
I think the experience of it is more important than the result.   I think getting on that mound.   The chance that he got to go out and throw is the neatest thing. 
And I watched him when he came off the field and he got high fives from his teammates and that's more what it is about than if you win or lose.   It is more about the experience and he got to pitch in front of Minnesotans, and being a Minnesotan, if I were him I wouldn't be sad.   I thought if I get a 3‑run home run I will be bummed out but got to pitch in front of the home crowd. 

Q.   How did the second All‑Star Game compare to the first experience? 
GLEN PERKINS:   They were similar.   I think New York is a busier atmosphere, you know, but here, being from here, and everything that came with that, I think it made them very similar experiences.   And we won both, which is cool.   It is more fun to win. 
THE MODERATOR:   Okay, thank you very much.
