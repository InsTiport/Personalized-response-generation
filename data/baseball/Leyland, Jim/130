  JIM LEYLAND:  First of all, let me say congratulations to the New York Yankees and the Oakland Athletics for their season that they had, and fortunately the Detroit Tigers this year will have the pleasure and the honor, I should say, of representing the American League in the World Series, and we're very proud of that. 
 But certainly congratulations to Ken Macha and the Oakland A's.  They played it right until the end.  They couldn't have been any more professional.  We were just fortunate we got on a roll, snuck a game in Oakland and got a little momentum going, and we were fortunate enough to win. 

 Q.  And your team? 
 JIM LEYLAND:  Well, my team, I think early on in Spring Training we had a lot of good players.  We didn't have a good team.  And today I can make the statement that we've got a good team, and that's the thing that I'm proudest of. 

 Q.  You said all season how much fun you had.  Can you just contrast that with the last -- the only year you were in Colorado, and then what happened those six years away from managing that kind of triggered that fire for you again? 
 JIM LEYLAND:  Well, it's amazing that you asked that question, because I think one of the most responsible things about that and my coming back, they're playing right now in New York and that's the St. Louis Cardinals. 
 I worked for them for five years.  I was around that ball club in Spring Training.  I helped out.  I was around Tony LaRussa.  I helped his veteran players, bought into the program.  I never had a finer boss. 
 They kind of inspired me to get back in, and I kept getting closer to it and closer to it.  I think probably the reason I got back in is because of the St. Louis Cardinals.
