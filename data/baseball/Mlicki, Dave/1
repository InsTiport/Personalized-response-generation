Q.  A couple months ago there was some talk about you going to the bullpen.  Did you ever think you'd be in this position, starting Game 2 of the playoffs?
 
DAVE MLICKI:  I guess I always hoped that's what it would be.  Obviously, we had a lot of good pitching here.  And unfortunately, some of them have gotten hurt.  But it's given me an opportunity, and I think I've taken pretty good advantage of it.  I've always had confidence in myself, and in what I can do.  Now I have the opportunity and it's a thrill to be here.  You work for your whole career, to get to the playoffs.  And being a part of this team, it's been a lot of fun.  
 
Q.  Larry said you're a different pitcher than when you first came here.  Do you agree with that?  What have you done to make yourself different? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  Yeah, I do.  You know, I think when I first got over here, I was just kind of like nibbling at the corners, you know.  Not being real aggressive.  Trying to make them hit, you know, my pitch from the first pitch.  You know, then once I got here and just started getting more aggressive and a lot more first-pitch strikes and doing that, I was able to have them hit my pitch later in the count instead of nibbling at the first.  I could go after them then put them away with what I wanted to.  Throwing strikes and getting ahead, that's the key to me, and getting the ball down.  If I do that, I'm going to be successful.  If not, it's going to be a long day.  So hopefully I'll get the balls down.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the emotional highs and lows during the season, coming from a team that was not going well and didn't have a place to pitch.  Then you're here with a team that's winning?
 
DAVE MLICKI:  Yeah, it was shocking.  Over in Detroit I felt like I was really just treading water.  I wasn't doing very well.  The more I tried, the worse it got.  I got over here, it was like a breath of fresh air.  The guys here have been great.  Getting back with Brad I think has helped a lot.  He's been great for me.  Throwing to him has been a big step for me I think.  And just the attitude around here.  Everybody expecting to win.  You come to the park knowing you got a great chance to win.  I think that just rubs off.  It's a good feeling.  It's fun again.  And it's just been great since being here.  
 
Q.  Do you have to, just looking at them starting Glavine, obviously you have to be at the top of your game.  If he does what he normally does, maybe the offense won't score.  Do you approach things differently? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  No, I don't think you can worry about it.  Obviously, this last month we've been playing, we've faced a lot of tough pitching.  All these games have mattered.  So, you know, I can only control what I do out there.  Hopefully, the hitters can do their job.  Obviously he's a great pitcher and he's been here before.  And he's done it many times.
You know, for me, this is my first but it's going to be a great challenge and I'm looking forward to it.  
 
Q.  The Braves' offense has struggled a lot this year.  Do you think their line-up is one where you can pick spots, what to challenge, what not to challenge?  Or is this a game situation? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  You know, their line-up is obviously good with Chipper and Brian in there.  And, you know, there's always times in every line-up where you might have to pitch around a guy.  And this holds true. But the same, you know, these guys have been here before.  They've done it.  They keep coming back for a reason.  So you can't take that lightly at all.  This is  -- the season's over.  It's all-or-nothing now.  What happened in the past, if they were struggling before, I'm sure they're not going to be struggling now.  No, you just go after them with the same game plan and I'll just try and do my best.  
 
Q.  The biggest game you pitched in your career was a few years ago when inter-league play began - the first Subway Series in New York between the Mets and Yankees.  How much do you draw from that going into tomorrow?
 
DAVE MLICKI:  I think a lot actually.  That was the first game, even though it wasn't a playoff, it kind of felt like the playoffs.  There was a lot of hype.  Obviously, the first Subway Series, the atmosphere was kind of the same.  For me, that's the closest I've been  to this day, one of the best things that's happened to me.  That was a lot of fun.  So hopefully, you know, I can kind of draw on the similarities and do something the same.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about how you mentally prepare for a game like this that's so big and try to make it something that's not so big in your mind? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  Ask me tomorrow, see what I do tonight (smiling).  I'm just trying as much as I can to treat this like any other start.  Where I go out there, I studied the hitters, I have a game plan, just try and follow it.  I'm going to do the same.  That's what's gotten me here so there's no reason to change on that.  Obviously it's a big game.  But this is what you work for.  I'm thrilled I'm just going to be a part of it.  
 
Q.  How much have you been affected by what's going on in New York?  Just in terms of having played there. 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  You know, that first week afterwards was tough.  I think it was tough on everyone.  Especially playing there, you know, fortunately I didn't know anyone directly involved.  But, you know, I think it was good that we took some time off.  I think the whole team felt that way.  It was, you know, it's a tough  -- it makes you realize that this is just a game, and  -- but playing this game I think helps the country also.  And, you know, it's a terrible situation, but I think we can get through it.  
 
Q.  The fresh, fun attitude you found in the locker room when you first came over, now that you're into the playoffs, I know you haven't played the first game yet, but do you sense the guys are still loose?  Are there any steps being taken to make sure the guys are still having fun? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  I think it is now, after this series in St. Louis.  You know, when we had San Francisco in here, we just needed one game and we didn't play very well.  I think going to St. Louis, we didn't have any doubts.  I think it was just we were pressing too much.  And, you know, once we won two-out-of-three there, gosh, it just felt like the same again.  Same attitude yesterday, today.  Everybody's having fun and we're all looking forward to it.  I think it was just kind of a relief just to get there again.  We had such a good lead for a while there.  But now it's positive, and everybody's having fun in there and joking and just like it was.  And, you know, we all feel like good things can happen.  
 
Q.  Did the whole Bonds spectacle, just the unbelievable atmosphere, does that help you prepare for a playoff start?  There was so much media attention and hoopla surrounding the entire event, does that help you prepare for a playoff start? 
 
DAVE MLICKI:  Yeah, I think so.  Definitely.  You know, that was obviously a huge media event.  I think the last couple weeks in general have been that way.  You know, we've been playing so well for a while now.  But, yeah, I think that with everything that went on, it definitely felt like playoff atmosphere.  Obviously, it was.  They needed to win and so did we.   So honestly, the last three weeks have felt like that.  It's been fun.  Ever since, you know, we got back from the disaster, we've  -- every start has felt like that, every game.  It's kind of been a pressured couple weeks.  
 
Q.  How much harder might it be to go into your start with the team down a game rather than ahead?
 
DAVE MLICKI:  Actually, I've thought about that.  It could be a pivotal start.  Obviously, if we win today, then, you know, we definitely want to win because then we have a two-game lead obviously.  But same thing is opposite.  If we lose, it's a big start because we don't want to go into Atlanta 0-2.  It is a big game.  But I'm glad I get the chance to do it.  I can't tell you enough how much it means to me.  It's been something I've been working for for years, and I've finally gotten the chance and I'm looking forward to the challenge.
