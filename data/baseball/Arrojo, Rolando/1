Q. I just want to get an idea. He's coming from Cuba where there really isn't that much
press. Has he ever seen this much press? How does he feel about it?

INTERPRETER: This is the first time that he ever see too many press. He's very nervous.

Q. What does it mean to come this far, leaving Cuba? What does it mean individually and
for Cuba in general?

INTERPRETER: For him, it's very -- to come that far. In Cuba they don't have the
freedom. The people, they don't know what is going on outside of Cuba.

Q. Are your brother and mother here? Does the fact that they're in this country make
this whole thing more special?

INTERPRETER: It's very special for him to be reunited with his family again. He haven't
seen them for three years, so he's very happy to have them with him.
