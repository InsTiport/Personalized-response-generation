St. Louis Cardinals 16
  Texas Rangers   7

 Q. The play with Napoli and Holliday and the attempted tag: I guess, what did you see on that play?
 RON KULPA: At the time of the play, I had him on the base at the time of his tag. I had a tag, but I had him on the base.

 Q. And did you think about asking for help on that play at all?
 RON KULPA: No. On that type of play, I'm not going to ask for help. Ron (Washington) didn't ask me to get any help, either.

 Q. So when (Ron) came out, kind of what was the conversation that the two of you had?
He asked me what I had, and I told him the same thing I just told you guys.

 Q. Have you seen a replay of it yet?
 RON KULPA: I saw a replay when I walked off the field, and the tag was applied before his foot hit the bag.

 Q. You being from St. Louis...
 RON KULPA: Has nothing to do with it.
 JERRY LAYNE: That's pretty much all that there is to it. You know, he watched the replay. You know, he told you his answer, and there's nothing more to it.

 Q. Is there anything about your positioning, would you say? Was it different than before?
 RON KULPA: No. I called what I saw. 
 JERRY LAYNE: It was a wide throw. It was a tough, it was a tough call. Very tough call on, you know, that type of play, so I think that's about all that there is to it. Thank you for coming in, appreciate it. Thank you.
