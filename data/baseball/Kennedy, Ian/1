 Q. Can you just talk about obviously Game 1 in Milwaukee you had the experience there. Now talk about how you prepare and how you go into that game differently and what you expect, obviously going in for that outing?
 IAN KENNEDY: I think just using that experience, just like any experience, you learn from it. And you try to build and learn the positive things from it.
 I've definitely got the first one under my belt. And this one hopefully helps me my next start. And just prepare like any other game, like I did last time. And just know that my preparation will be all right and hopefully the outcome will be different.

 Q. Gibby told us today that you had gone into his office every day this week saying hey, I'm prepared to pitch on three days. Were you ready to pitch today? Did you want to pitch today?
 IAN KENNEDY: You know, I talked about it with him. I told him I was going to prepare as if I was going to come on the third day -- after the third day's rest and pitch today. And I really liked how he was just -- for me, just knowing that I like the ball to be in my hands, but I also know that it's going to be all right in my teammates' hands. 
 It showed that -- I think Josh threw really well last night. And we just had Collmenter today. And Joe didn't have it today. But he knows that we have a good bullpen behind him. For me, I was preparing as if I was coming back on the short day's rest.

 Q. Did you ever have a doubt that there would, in fact, be a Game 5?
 IAN KENNEDY: You know, when you're down 0-2 you just know every single game matters. I was willing to do anything, anything possible, just to help out in any possible way. Because as a starter you have that one time and you have to wait another five days, maybe six. 
 I mean, a lot of guys try to come back in four days rest or three days rest, sorry, and I was going to try to help any possible way I can. Luckily it worked out and we played well here at home.
