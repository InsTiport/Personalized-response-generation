 THE MODERATOR: A few questions for Nelson right down here in front.

 Q. Nellie, in your last at-bat, can you take us through what you were looking for, what you got around the bases? 
 NELSON CRUZ: It was amazing. It was a really good game. They do a really good job. Mixing the pitches. They got up 12th inning bases loaded, no outs. First two pitches I was too aggressive. I hit the ball, foul ball, foul ball. So after that, I told myself just slow down and try to hit a fly ball to the outfield. 
 THE MODERATOR: Scott Feldman has joined Nelson at the microphone. 

 Q. Nellie, can you talk about the pitch that hit you and how that affected your next at-bat? 
 NELSON CRUZ: When I got hit, I thought it was worse. I think the adrenaline in the game had to be really bad to come out of the game, not feel the pain. In that situation you want to stay in the game. Thank God I got a chance to win the game. 

 Q. Nelson, there have been a lot of big postseason home runs. I'm not sure if you're aware of it. Yours was the first walk-off grand slam. What does that mean to you given all the big home runs that have been hit in the history of postseason baseball? 
 NELSON CRUZ: It's special, you know. When you get a chance to get a W, that's the most important thing. Besides that, everything happened on the field. Usually when I get a W, that's the most important thing. 

 Q. Scott, I know you've had trouble with the Tigers. Can you talk about your performance and how you tamed them today? 
 SCOTT FELDMAN: I just went in there and just tried to stay ready down there. When they called for me, just really tried to keep the game close. That's all you can really do in that situation. Get our guys back in there as quick as possible to start swinging.

 Q. Nellie, in the ninth when you were in the outfield, Kelly doubles into the corner. A two out double. Did you get a good bounce, and were you thinking we have a shot to hold this guy from trying to score? 
 NELSON CRUZ: Yes, with a man on first, you've got to play no doubles, as close to the gap, as close to the wall. I pick it up as quick as I can. I even bobbled it a little bit. I throw the ball as quick as I can, like I said. 

 Q. Scott, after what you've been through in the last year, how much does it mean to you just to be in this situation and get that chance? 
 SCOTT FELDMAN: You know, it's great. Everybody wants to be in this situation. You know, luckily today we came out on top. I think mainly the number one thing is just got a great group of guys here, and you know for me I can honestly say that was probably the coolest game I've ever been a part of. 
 When I got done even watching that game I thought my beard was going to turn gray. Nerve racking, but it was awesome when this guy right here walked it off at the end. 

 Q. Because you've been struggling a little bit, did you do anything to get ready for this game that turned it around for you? 
 NELSON CRUZ: No, just I keep my same approach. I keep working with Coolbaugh in the cage. Also, I do some stuff at my house. Try to keep my swing in the right direction. 
 Like I said, it's amazing when you play around those group of guys. Everybody is pulling the same way. Whatever you put out there, it looked like they do a good job. It's a blessing to be around those guys. 
 THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thank you very much. See you in Detroit.
