"I have some improvement from yesterday. I feel better already. I really feel
positive about it. Right now I feel looser. In a few hours after treatment I'm hoping to
even feel better. Right now I'm just busy working and I'm going to keep working." 

DR. WILLIAM MORGAN:
(Red Sox physician on site in Cleveland) 

"Pedro has a muscle strain in the mid-back area. There is slight improvement today
but he does have persistent pain. He's undergoing treatment right now, which includes
ultrasound, anti-inflammatory medication and rest. His condition status is day-to-day. The
plan is to start stretching tomorrow and light exercise tomorrow. We'll observe his
progress and we will re-evaluate him tomorrow."
