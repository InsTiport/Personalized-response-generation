Q. One of those games where the big hit eluded you in the last few innings, you had a chance to get back in it.  It's one of those games like we've seen occasionally from this team?
DAVE ROBERTS: Yeah.  Credit to our guys for fighting back, and there were some big hits in there, obviously, with the Muncy home run and the C.T. homer, but 7th, 8th and 9th, we had our chances.  And those guys made some pitches and got out of some traffic, but our guys stressed them, got on base, and gave ourselves an opportunity.  But yeah, to take us over the top and take the lead again, we couldn't get that one extra hit.
Q. Walker (no microphone), in the second inning, how do you go about correcting that obviously the rest of the outing?
DAVE ROBERTS: Very uncharacteristic that second inning.  Tonight the stuff was really good, and I thought he had complete control.  But after that error in center field, I think that he lost his focus a little bit, and for him to go four straight to the pitcher and then the Inciarte, and obviously you get behind Acuna.  So very uncharacteristic but it was good to see him recalibrate and give us five innings to at some point save our pen.
Q. To follow up on the second consecutive outing where he's had at least a brief spate where he's had some wildness, but bounced back, what does it take for to sort of lock back into an outing?
DAVE ROBERTS: I don't know.  It takes a lot of maturity and focus.  So he did lose his focus, I think, in that point in time, but again, for him in a big game like this to go back out there and throw up a couple more zeros, that was huge for us and we had a chance to win the baseball.  So Walker's coming back and giving us five innings right there, it was big.
