 Q.  What did you make of the All-Star experience in Cleveland?  
DAVE ROBERTS: I thought the city of Cleveland did a fantastic job.  The logistics, the city, the weather, the fans, as far as the parade, during the game, attentive, cheering for past and present Indians and they were just really engaged.  So Major League Baseball and the city of Cleveland got it right.   
 Q.  Nice tribute to Carlos Carrasco and CC Sabathia?  
DAVE ROBERTS: Obviously to see CC back home where it all started for him, what he did for the city and for Major League Baseball to recognize that, to have him be an honorary All-Star, I think that's fantastic.  And, yeah, I think for me the highlight of the game was the Stand Up To Cancer mention and the tribute to friends, families, that are going through cancer.  And obviously with Carlos Carrasco and his teammates by his side, very emotional.  And you hear putting things into perspective quite often, but cancer definitely tops the list.
