THE MODERATOR:   Patrick, why don't you go ahead and talk a little bit about your performance. 
PATRICK DUESTER:   Well, I just didn't make pitches when I needed to.   That was the bottom line.   Obviously they're a good hitting team, but the mistake pitches, they handled it and hit the ball, and that's pretty much it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Richard, a couple base hits.   Talk about your night offensively, please. 
RICHARD CARTHON:   Saw the ball very well today.   Was able to lay down a bunt and drive a ball, obviously field.   Just able to make solid contact today.
THE MODERATOR:   Talk about Foster a little there.   He retired I think 11 in a row there after the fifth inning.   What made him so effective? 
RICHARD CARTHON:   He was doing a good job throwing strikes, especially getting strike 1, and we weren't taking advantage of some pitches that he left down the plate, and he just did a good job filling up the strike zone. 
THE MODERATOR:   Coach, a few comments, obviously the fourth inning‑‑
DAVID PIERCE:   Well, I mean, it's a ballgame.   We give up a run in the fourth if we just finish the strikeout, and it's just one of those things, we got past Rog and then they ended up scoring six after that.   I didn't think we showed enough mental toughness in the rest of that inning.   When that happens, you're going to give up runs like that, and that's what happened. 

Q.   Coach Pierce, what would you say kind of unraveled things in that fourth inning?   I know you mentioned the strikeout, but the play that Hunter Hope made, how do you explain that?   What did you see there? 
DAVID PIERCE:   Well, like I said, if we complete the strikeout there, we give up a run, and it's a 3‑0 ballgame, bases loaded, nobody out.   So we would have gotten out of the jam, but we didn't do that.   And I think before that, I think Tim threw quality pitches, and I didn't think after that he did.   Hunter Hope hits a line drive hit right at him, and he shuffled, I don't think Tyler was there in time, and he just through the ball errant. 

Q.   Richard, what's the mindset or the discussion now to have that quick turnaround and go into the early game tomorrow and try and bounce back? 
RICHARD CARTHON:   Now it's win or go home.   The stakes are the highest they've been all year because we realize you lose, you go home.   Tonight is over, regardless how things turned out.   Tomorrow is a brand new day, and you've just got to buy into fight for another day. 

Q.   Coach, have you decided who's going to pitch tomorrow? 
DAVID PIERCE:   Corey Merrill. 

Q.   Coach Pierce, do you think there was any nerves or anything like that that happened with this team as far as this was the biggest stage they've been on, anything like that?   Did you pick up on anything? 
DAVID PIERCE:   No, not really.   I'll say this:   The last two Fridays in the last two weekend series we got beat, and we really responded well.   We're a growing team, and we'll grow from this.   We'll be ready to play tomorrow. 

Q.   I know this was all about matchups.   Why Merrill tomorrow?
DAVID PIERCE:   Because it's do or die. 

Q.   You've come back from a lot of really disappointing Friday night losses.   Friday night has kind of been a little thorn in the side for a while.   Talk about how you guys have been able all season to kind of come back from a not‑so‑great performance? 
DAVID PIERCE:   Well, we've played a lot of ballgames this year, and they've learned from every loss and every win, and the resiliency of this team has been there, and that's why we made the tournament.   I have all the confidence in the world that our guys will be ready to play tomorrow.   We'll have a plan, and we'll try to execute it. 

Q.   Richard, I know this was not what you guys envisioned.   Talk to me about how you thought the night would go and kind of your take on it now. 
RICHARD CARTHON:   The biggest thing to take from the night is we can't let big innings happen like the fourth inning.   We had opportunities to actually get out of that inning with no runs, and we weren't able to capitalize on that, so I think the biggest thing stepping forward, also, we had a lot of guys in scoring position and we weren't able to get them in with less than two outs.   The biggest thing is more timely hits and of course more sound defense, but like I stated earlier, tomorrow is a brand new day.   Tomorrow is do or die.   So we've just got to come out with the right attitude, come ready to play.
