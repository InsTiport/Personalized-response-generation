 CHRISTIAN PRESICHI: I play for the Saraperos de Saltillo. 

 Q. How do you feel about the team's expectations? . 
 CHRISTIAN PRESICHI: Very well. Very well. We are working really hard. We've had a great preseason, and it's important when you have a good preseason to know the results. 

 Q. Are you hopeful to play in the U.S.? 
 CHRISTIAN PRESICHI: Yes, of course. I never lose hope. I'm one of those people that never loses hope. 
 I feel that I can still come and play here. I'm still waiting for that opportunity. It has not presented itself, but I will continue fighting for it until, God willing, I'll get that opportunity. Otherwise, I'll just be one of the best players in Mexico.
