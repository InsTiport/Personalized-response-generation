   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jonathan Sanchez.

 Q. Could you possibly be nervous for this start after pitching Sunday's game? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: No, I mean, it's just another game. Just need to come out here and play a good game tomorrow, and hopefully we win.

 Q. Can you talk a little bit about your kind of development, your maturing process over the last year? Bochy talked about you've made a lot of strides in that time. 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Just been confident out there. Every time I go out there to the mound, I just focus, try to throw strikes and get people out in less than three pitches.

 Q. Just wondering what the mood of the team was like. It was obviously a long flight to get here. You had a night's sleep to think about Game 2 disappointment. That was the team's mood like on that plane? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Same thing we do every day. Go on the plane, play games and just joke around. Just relax and watch TV.

 Q. Your numbers against the Braves haven't been too good. But is that just a different Jonathan Sanchez? Does the team match up well against you? What do you think it is? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: I mean, I'm a different pitcher now. The last two times I faced these guys I had trouble with my mechanics. But now I just -- I think I'm right on it.

 Q. With the big-game environment from Sunday, what could that help you with coming into this one? Because that was pretty much of a must-win Sunday. 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: It's pretty much going to be kind of the same game tomorrow. 
 But it's -- like I said, I'm just going to come with the same mentality. Just go out there and get people out. Try to go deep in the game and win the game.

 Q. After that triple, do you think they're going to fear you as a hitter a little bit more? Be more respectful? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Yeah, I don't think they're going to pitch to me tomorrow (smiling).
