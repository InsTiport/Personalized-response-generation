 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Aubrey and Jonathan.

 Q. Jonathan, you've been in big games before. This has to be the biggest. Did you know that you had the stuff early on, that you had the stuff to do what you did tonight? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: I was just being aggressive. I just prefer pitch first try and made them to swing the ball.

 Q. You've hit lefties and righties basically equally well this year. What are you thinking there as they bring in the lefty to face you? 
 AUBREY HUFF: Well, those guys, Venters and Dunner are tough. One of the toughest lefties in the league, if you ask me, out of the pen. I faced Dunn at our place, and he threw me five straight sliders. First pitch I was looking slider, put it right down the middle at 95. Kind of kicking myself a little bit. 
 But stayed with it. Saw it, and was able to reach out there and get it. It was a pretty good pitch. Just kind of hit it off the end a tad enough to where it could get down. When I hit it, it was the longest fly ball, medium fly ball I've ever hit. I didn't think it was ever going to get down. But they were probably playing no doubles, or they might catch it.

 Q. Aubrey, you waited a long time to get into the postseason, and just your emotions getting that kind of hit in that kind of situation? 
 AUBREY HUFF: Well, it was pretty strange. You know, when you set, a little nervous, little nervous for me especially on deck when they're making the switch. But once I stepped in the box, it was actually pretty calm. You have to be. I find if you stress out too much you get a little jumpy. All year long. Everything's a roll over. 
 So try to breathe, and take my best that I've taken all year. That's what people told me the whole time starting the playoffs, don't change your routine, don't change your approach. Just do the same thing you've done all year, and that's what I tried to do.

 Q. Bochy just talked about Giants baseball and how it's called torture. You guys have a lot of close games, tonight was no different. He said you guys don't seem to mind it. You grind it out, you're used to it. I don't know if you like it. Why is it the case that you guys have all of these very close games? 
 AUBREY HUFF: I speak better English, so I'll go ahead and answer. Is that okay? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Yeah, that's better.
 AUBREY HUFF: Okay. It's a slogan that our radio guys came up with. And certainly by no means do we ever want to be tortured out there. It just seems like every game, even all the way through San Diego to get in, everything's so stressful. You know what I mean? Eric Hinske, I'm thinking there's no way this guy's going to homer here. He hit it's, and I'm instant head down. He seems like this four times that I played against him, he's hit a homer late. Just can't make it happen. 
 When we got in the dugout, it wasn't down. Everybody was up and confident. Ishikawa did what he's done all year. Professional at-bat to get us going. Sanchez stayed through a really tough pitcher. And to be honest, I got lucky to get a hit out there off that tough lefty. 
 You know, sitting at home for nine years watching these playoffs and stuff happen, it's never over until it's over. And we battled. And that's exactly what the torture comes from. It's never easy.

 Q. Bruce basically said that it looked like you were at about that point. Did you feel like you were losing anything at all? Did you feel like you were still going strong at that point? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: When he took me out I felt pretty good. I was feeling good. I wasn't tired at all. But he made the decision to go with the bullpen, and we've been doing the job all year. We're playing pretty good. I mean, Romo laid one pitch out of the play and hit the homer. 
 But we've got a tough bullpen, so I thought we were going to get it done.

 Q. Bochy said Madison's going to be the starter for tomorrow. That's a big stage for a rookie for a young kid. How do you think he'll do, and will you say anything to him? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: I mean, as long as he throws strikes, he's going to be okay. 
 AUBREY HUFF: Catcher boy English, and this guy, I don't think it's going to be a very good conversation.

 Q. What was really working the best? What was clicking, what did you feel most comfortable with? What was getting them out? 
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Getting ahead and then using my breaking balls.

 Q. Is that kind of what you were talking about yesterday? You mentioned about getting outs with less than three pitches, is that what you mean by being aggressive and throwing strikes?
 JONATHAN SANCHEZ: Yeah, that's what I did today. Just get aggressive, throw first pitch for a strike and use my breaking balls. They were swinging.
