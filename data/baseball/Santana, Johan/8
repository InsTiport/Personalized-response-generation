Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
JOHAN SANTANA:  It was very fun.  So I think as long as you take it from the right side, like having fun, just go out there and enjoy what you're doing, because you know you don't get to do this every time.  You know, whatever happens tomorrow is going to happen.  We're going to try to do our best, and I think we'll be able to handle it.  You know we went to New York.  We did a pretty good job.  We showed them that we can play and we handled the fans pretty good.  So, I believe tomorrow is going to be the same way, because we are home.  We'll see how everything goes.  
 
Q.  How many other games has the cramping problem happened this year and has it happened in past years as well? 
 
JOHAN SANTANA:   Cramps, well, it happens late in August, in Texas, but I think it was the weather.  And also, before spring training when I went back home last year.  I was in Venezuela.  I was not able to play because of all the political problems that were going on in Venezuela.  So I was trying to stay loose at home.  But I pulled my left hamstring. So from there, I've been trying to make sure everything is fine and I went to spring training, and it was bad, so I was trying to deal with it.   I was pitching with a sore hamstring but I was able to go through the season and have a cramp in Texas and then the one in New York.  That was my left hamstring.  It happened the first time.  That thing is tough, you never know when it's going to happen, so you have to be careful with it. 
 
Q.  You've never had a hamstring problem crop up in back-to-back starts, have you? 
 
JOHAN SANTANA:   No.  I was able to pitch the next start when it happened in Texas, so I don't think it will be any problem.
