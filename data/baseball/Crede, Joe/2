Q. Joe, time and time again you come through late in the game.  Can you talk about relishing the opportunity to do it late in the contest?
 
JOE CREDE:  I think that's the biggest part is actually getting the opportunity to be in that situation.  You have to tip your hat to A. J. It was a heads-up play on his part and he was able to get to first and get there safely. 
 
Q.  Were you able to see, you were in the box, it obviously was a bad angle, but were you paying attention?  Were you able to see if the ball hit the dirt or were you confused to see A.J. up and running?
 
JOE CREDE:  As soon as I saw him swing, I seen him run off the field, I turned around and started walking back towards the dugout and I was thinking about who was leading off the top of the 10th.  I didn't know what was going on until I saw him rounding first base and he was safe. 
 
Q.  Are you surprised he challenged you or even came anywhere near you on 0-2 like that?
 
JOE CREDE:  Throwing a splitter right there, it hung up in the zone.  He got a good splittie tonight, it just didn't drop off the table like he wanted it to.  
 
Q.  Can a win like this put you guys in the driver's seat for this entire series?
 
JOE CREDE:  Well, I think it definitely helps the momentum going into Anaheim.  That's definitely a tough place to win and they have a lot of great fans out there, get loud.  They pack that place good, and we expect it to be loud and having some kind of a win on our side is definitely an advantage.
