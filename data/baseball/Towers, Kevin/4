Q. Why don't you go ahead and talk about what you see Kevin Brown's brought to the
team.

KEVIN TOWERS: Well, I think it's evident, with Brown's history, what he's done in the
pass. We went out and acquired Kevin Brown, and we knew we were getting a guy that's kind
of been a maverick, that's passed around from club to club, kind of a hired gun. But has
had tremendous success over the years. Last year helped the Florida Marlins, and they
ended up winning the World Series. He's probably one of the more vocal guys in the dugout,
even in-between starts. And I think he could only have rubbed off on a positive way with
Andy Ashby, Sterling Hitchcock, Joey Hamilton, having him around there, talking to them
about how to pitch in adverse situations. And as a general manager, I know when he's out
every fifth day, when you're sitting up in the box, and you watch Kevin Brown start, it's
a comfortable feeling.
