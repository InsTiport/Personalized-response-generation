Dodgers - 6   
Nationals - 5   
 Q.  Can you talk about your mind-set going into the game on Thursday?  
MAX SCHERZER: Just that, man, this is going to be a heck of a ballgame.  The effort from both sides over the first four games has been incredible.  We've seen unbelievable baseball, from both sides.  Great pitching, great hitting, defense, everything.   
In Game 5, anything can happen, and you've just got to go out there and execute your pitches.   
 Q.  What can you say about the competitive nature of the series?  We've seen guys get hit by pitches and stuff; it's been real, real close?  
MAX SCHERZER: I think our guys have done a lot of breaking balls to the lefties and caught their feet.  That's just baseball.  No one on either side is trying to (laughing) hit anybody with everything on the line right now.  That's just baseball being played at its highest.   
 Q.  How excited are you to be pitching in front of your home crowd again, and what do you think the atmosphere is going to be like on Thursday?  
MAX SCHERZER: If it's anything like Game 1, it's going to be such a thrill.  Game 1 was unbelievable there in D.C.  The fans were just going nuts from the first pitch.  So the fact that it's going to be Game 5, I mean, our fans really brought it in Game 1, so I can only imagine the atmosphere going into Game 5.
