THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Max. 

Q.   Max, as that count goes full against Reddick and you're trying to find a way to get him out, what was the thought process that you and Alex were going through trying to figure out how to get at him and how did you come up with the off‑speed pitch, and was it where you wanted it? 
MAX SCHERZER:   I think the first time I threw a fastball and I wanted to challenge him and he was able to foul it off, and I just thought at that point in time, I shook Alex off, that if I executed a change‑up that there was a chance I could get a swing and miss.   I bounced it on the wrong side of the plate.   I pulled it.   But it still had the effectiveness of looking like a fastball, because it got a swing and miss.   That was a huge out for me to be able to get in that situation. 

Q.   Coming in in a relief role, how did you prepare differently? 
MAX SCHERZER:   I came in today, we played catch and I told Skip, I got a couple of innings in me if you want it.   The way the game unfolded with Dougie going six, my number was called.   I was ready.   I was trying to warm up the same way, try to do everything the same way and think of it as a start. 

Q.   Was it at all surreal, you know, to come into a game at that point, to find yourself, knowing that you're probably not going to be in there after an inning, find yourself with the bases loaded?   Seems everything you faced tonight was different than what you normally do when you start and the atmosphere was so charged.   Can you compare it to your normal pitching experience? 
MAX SCHERZER:   For me, I tried to make it the same.   I know that the context of the game is different, but it's still 60 feet 6 inches, and you gotta throw strikes and that's the most important thing. 
I was wild tonight, I didn't have my best command, but when it counted in full counts, I was able to execute some pitches and that's what allowed me to be successful. 

Q.   Usually, that fastball is going to get a lot of swing and misses for you and yet you were mixing in a fair amount of off‑speed stuff.   You talked about Reddick in the change‑up.   Talk a little bit with more insight on that mix that you were throwing them? 
MAX SCHERZER:   Which batter? 

Q.   Your two innings.   It was noticed that they get so many misses on your fastball, yet you were throwing a seemingly inordinate amount of off‑speed stuff. 
MAX SCHERZER:   I know they're a good fastball‑hitting team, so you can't throw all fastballs.   Alex and I are familiar with their hitters and what we try to accomplish. 
For me, it was just the right instincts to throw each pitch, whether it was slider, change‑up, or fastball.   It's just a sequencing and knowing your instincts and knowing what pitch works for you in which count.   That's what you strive for, what you work hard to develop is have that type of confidence and conviction to throw each pitch. 

Q.   We saw your head whip around on that ball that went foul down the left field line.   Can you talk about what went through your mind. 
MAX SCHERZER:   Yeah.   Alex came out to the mound and I asked him which pitch we want to throw and I said, He's probably going to be really aggressive right now, let's go with our best fastball.   Sure enough, he put a swing on it and I thought I gave up the hit.   I thought the ball was down and tailed just enough foul.   I was so happy that that happened. 
Same thing happened full count.   You know, I had to challenge him with my best pitch and I know he's a great fastball hitter, but I had to come with my best and he put a good swing on it and hit it hard.   I thought it was down, but Austin made a great play to be able to run that play down and that was an unbelievable play. 

Q.   What was going through your head after that happened?   What was your emotional? 
MAX SCHERZER:   It was surreal to be able to get an out in that situation and keep the one‑run lead with bases loaded, no outs in the eighth inning.   That's the stuff you dream of, maybe it's not the ninth inning, but that's the stuff you dream about pitching, bases loaded, eighth inning, no outs and I was able to do it. 

Q.   When you come through the gate to start off, are you filled with more adrenaline?   Is it different than starting a game? 
MAX SCHERZER:   I try to make it as similar as it is to starting a game.   I didn't want to come out with the adrenaline and be wild because I'm not used to pitching like that.   I wanted to approach it as much as I could with a start so that it felt comfortable to me and I felt like I was able to do that at the beginning.   I was pitching out of the wind‑up constantly, so for me that was my mentality to do everything I could, the way I warmed up, do everything I could to make it feel like a start. 

Q.   There's got to be a psychological or gratification level that's different in this circumstance for you.   Last year in NewYork it was, but can you really‑‑ I think that's what we're all seeking here is to find out just what distinctions you would draw?
MAX SCHERZER:   It's such a different experience.   Like I said, to be able to get out of that jam, I mean, that's something I'll never forget.   That's something I'm not really asked to do, and tonight I was.   Obviously Skip had the confidence in me to stick with me.   I thought with the lefties coming up, he might go with Drew Smyly.   For me to be able to get those left‑handed hitters out in that situation that's something I'll never forget. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
