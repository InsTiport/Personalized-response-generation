 Q. You're still smiling as your teammates celebrate. Talk about going to the World Series.
 SHANE VICTORINO: It's great. It's an opportunity you dream of, you work all year long for. We have one step to go. We're happy to be here. We're happy to be NL champs and we have one more step to go.

 Q. It's an unusual series. You came up with some big hits, three hits tonight from Ryan Howard, certainly Cole Hamels. Just talk about how different guys contribute. 
 SHANE VICTORINO: That's what it's about. It's about everybody stepping up. I think, like I said from the beginning of the year and all year long, it takes 25 guys to win. 
 It's definitely big, and Jimmy (Rollins) leading off tonight, he did the same thing in Milwaukee, a game that was crucial. And leading off with a home run kind of threw the momentum our way.

 Q. I know you played the Red Sox during the year. I don't think you've seen the Rays in a while. Do you care who you play? 
 SHANE VICTORINO: It's a matter of going out and playing a good series. I hope it to be a fun series.
