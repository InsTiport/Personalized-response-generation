 Q.  I've followed your career from the very beginning.  Something that has marked you, Salvador and Altuve, is the consistency in your play after the 7th inning in the World Baseball Classic.  Where does this energy come from?  
ALCIDES ESCOBAR: Look, I think that energy, that commitment, the love for the game, we have it from the very beginning since we're small.  The World Series, and you win something like that, and you want to continue playing.  You want to continue doing great things for your career, and being here at the Classic is an incredible honor.  I'm very proud to be here to represent my country.   
 Q.  What is the mood in the clubhouse right now?  
ALCIDES ESCOBAR: The ambience that we have in the clubhouse is something big because for each one of us as a player, we are very proud to represent our country, to commit daily, day to day, and that really fulfills us.   
 Q.  Today, well, there were a couple of strong sentiments from the San Diego manager is not satisfied with how they're utilizing one of the players.  Are you on the same page?  Are there any feelings with this issue?  
ALCIDES ESCOBAR: No, we're not upset over this because everyone who is playing does -- at least should have the opportunity to play.  But we all realize that not all will be playing.  I think that San Diego manager is upset, but he has to understand that we all want to play, but the difficulty is that not everyone is going to play.   
 Q.  Everyone considers that this is a live-or-die game.  
ALCIDES ESCOBAR: It is a very important game for both teams.  We have to play hard.  We want to win the game, and we've been playing better.  I think we have the talent.  We have the capabilities to play the entire game.
