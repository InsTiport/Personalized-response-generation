Q. What did you see that prompted the initial call of fan interference?
JOE WEST: Well, when he jumped up to reach for the ball, the spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field and closed his glove.
Q. So the ball had not yet crossed the railing?
JOE WEST: No.
Q. And Betts' glove had not yet crossed the railing, do you believe?
JOE WEST: No.
Q. Okay.  Did the fan --
JOE WEST: Here's the whole play, here's the whole play.  He hit the ball to right field.  He jumped up to try to make a catch.  The fan interfered with him over the playing field.  That's why I called spectator interference.
Q. So it's a clear call in your mind?
JOE WEST: Yes.
Q. Were there already -- was there a single call that you saw, that the replay officials saw on replay that confirmed --
JOE WEST: I don't know what he saw.  He just -- the replay official said I was right.
Q. Okay.
JOE WEST: That's all.  He said I have nothing that can change it.
Q. Okay.
