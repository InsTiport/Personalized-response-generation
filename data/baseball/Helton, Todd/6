Q.  Talk about Torii Hunter's catch. 
 
TODD HELTON:   Unbelievable.  It's what the fans wanted to see, Barry to hit one deep and Torii to jump up and do what he did.  It's what he does all year.  It's what makes him an All-Star.  
 
Q.  Seems like Barry countered very easily on the next one. 
 
TODD HELTON:   Yeah, they need to call Barry up to the next league.  He's got this one figured out.
