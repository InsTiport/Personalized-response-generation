   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Willy, can you talk about, obviously two plays that come to mind, the catch you made to rob the tying run at the time, and then your at-bat against Valverde?  Can you talk about both those plays?   
 WILLY TAVERAS:  I know that Troy was throwing a fastball and I know I was playing on the other side of the field.  I don't think he crushed that ball, he hit it good.  But the ball hung up a little bit longer enough that I just take off running and try to make it for the team.   
 It was a great catch.  It might have saved the tie of the game right there.  Leave the run on second, I drop the ball or anything.  But it worked well for us and it's great to show your teammate how much you appreciate it they work hard and we have to work right behind it, too.   
 And Valverde, he walked Jamey, I wanted to be aggressive, too, but I know he walked Jamey and I wanted to be there and try to hit a strike.  That's what it was all about and it was great.   
  
  Q.  Todd, you're in unchartered territory now, 2-0 in this series.  You take the first two games on the road.  Talk about the roll you guys are on and just how much fun it must be in the locker room and how exciting it is for you guys?   
 TODD HELTON:  It's very exciting.  There's no doubt about it.  But we realize there's more work to be done.  It's a good ball club over there.  They're going to come out battling.  But we're excited to be in the situation we're in.   
 Denver's going to be a crazy place this weekend, and we're excited to go home and keep playing the way we've been playing.  But we still have work to do.   
 THE MODERATOR:  Thanks, guys.
