Q. What was your reaction when you found out that Clayton Kershaw would be opposing you in Game 2?
ANIBAL SANCHEZ: You know what, most of the time I don't think too much about the pitchers that I'm going to face.  I just try to keep my mind on the hitters that I'm going to face against Dodgers.  I think they got a pretty good lineup.  It's no doubt how good Kershaw is and what he's been doing for his whole career.  But at the end, I don't want to put that impression in my mind.  I think he's a guy that has a lot of hitters.  He knows because he's no hitter.  I think Kershaw can hit it pretty good.  But I just put my thoughts on the hitter situations.
Q. So you were released by the Twins in Spring Training.  You signed with the Braves.  I guess the basic question is how did you get to this point?  Is there any mechanical adjustments you made to kind of make some corrections?
ANIBAL SANCHEZ: You know, first of all, I always in my interviews all year long was that I say I'm excited every time that I wear the uniform.  To get here, it's a golden opportunity for me because I don't think that I got too much chance due to the whole season.  I think my range for me is really short.  And I feel so blessed to be here because that means that I threw and I got a good season for me.  And I helped this team.  It's helped me to grow up as a professional, as a person.  And when you see all those guys, the young guys play next to you and you realize how many years I've played at this level, I understand all the work that I've done over my whole career has made me through that season and especially what happened in the Spring Training.
