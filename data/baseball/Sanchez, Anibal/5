Los Angeles - 3, Atlanta - 0
Q. What was your thought process as you pitched to Machado there in the first inning, especially after you got the 3 and 0 count?
ANIBAL SANCHEZ: You know, you try to execute a pitch, 3-0 count you want to throw a pitch for a strike, especially how good of hitter is Machado.  And I know for some reason at that moment that's why I tried to execute the pitch.  But he put a really good swing on it.
Q. Anibal, what were your teammates saying about Kershaw in the dugout during the game, if they said anything?
ANIBAL SANCHEZ: You know, everybody can say good things about this guy.  Kershaw, he's dominating, he got really good stuff today.  You know, those guys they want to do something against him, but he's able to put the ball on the spot.  And that's the result that he got.  I don't hear too much about it, but I see the frustration those guys have against this guy.
