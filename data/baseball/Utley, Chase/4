 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chase Utley.  
  
  Q. Where'd the ball hit you in the 7th inning?   
 CHASE UTLEY: It was pretty close. At first I thought it was going to hit me in my head. Fortunately, it didn't. And he throws so hard. I felt like I thought it hit me, so I put my head down and I ran to first.  
  
  Q. Did it hit you?   
 CHASE UTLEY: I'm not sure.  
  
  Q. What was your perspective from, I guess, the hit that went to Bruce?   
 CHASE UTLEY: It seemed like he lost it in the lights. And we've seen it, it happens all the time. All year long guys lose the ball in the lights. It's unfortunate, but I'm glad it came out good for us.  
  
  Q. I guess when you were running, were you in the process?   
 CHASE UTLEY: I was in the process of going back to second base. I didn't want to get double off. Then I saw it go by him, and then I was not in a very good position to score, but lucky enough it got far enough away from him that I was able to, and Jayson as well.  
  
  Q. This team does not seem to panic at all. Can you explain the difference in energy and atmosphere in the dugout and clubhouse between 2007 Phillies and this year's team?   
 CHASE UTLEY: It's pretty similar. We have a confident team. You know, we've had some success in the past and I think that helps. We've built on that and gotten better.   
 We've played in difficult situations, difficult crowds. It seems like we're doing a pretty good job.  
  
  Q. How can you best describe that entire trip around the bases? Close play at second. Maybe third base was kind of close, and I think you almost fell over after third base.   
 CHASE UTLEY: Yeah, it was a little hectic, I'm not going to lie. I kind of lost my legs coming around third, but, again, it worked out for the best.  
  
  Q. You were talking about how you're a tight-knit group, and how you don't panic, and the team is pretty confident. How much of that is Charlie? And can you talk about that and what he brings to the clubhouse?   
 CHASE UTLEY: Well, Charlie breeds confidence. That's all he talks about is being successful. We don't have a negative clubhouse, which I think is helpful, especially in a game where you fail a lot. It does rub off on us players. Again, having just the experience the past few years in the playoffs has only helped.  
  
  Q. What happened on the double-play ball? Was it the grip of the ball or did the slide affect you at all?   
 CHASE UTLEY: Neither. The slide was kind of close. It's a play that I've made in the past. What I have learned is when you do make an error, you have to put it behind you. You can't change it at that point. All you can do is move on from there and try to improve on your mistakes.
