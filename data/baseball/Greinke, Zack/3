 Q.  Zack, it's been a while since you've pitched. Can you take us through what you did to make sure you were ready and sharp for game 3.  
ZACK GREINKE: Play catch every day.   
 Q.  Zack, what was it like for you to watch the last two games against the Rays, specifically Verlander and Cole and just how the crowd's been and the crowd supporting Cole and kind of seeing what it's like for playoff baseball in Houston.  
ZACK GREINKE: It's nice.   
 Q.  Zack, what do you think has made your transition to the Astros so seamless?  
ZACK GREINKE: Just pitching. Do what you do.   
 Q.  What do you take away from watching the guys pitch in the first two games, even though you have different styles, just facing this team? Is there much you can take away, even though you do things differently than they do?  
ZACK GREINKE: I'm not sure about that. I haven't thought about it too much.   
 Q.  Zack, what does it mean to be pitching --  
ZACK GREINKE: I didn't hear you.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to be pitching in a potentially clinching situation?  
ZACK GREINKE: I don't know. Just a normal game.   
 Q.  Zack, what does it mean to you to be pitching close to home in Orlando and what challenges does this ballpark present?  
ZACK GREINKE: I don't know.   
 Q.  Talk about the challenges that they bring, the Rays' hitters.  
ZACK GREINKE: They're good hitters, good runners.
