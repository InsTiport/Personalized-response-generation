Washington - 7, Houston - 2
Q. Going into Game 7, winner take all here?
ZACK GREINKE: Yeah, it's going to be a big game.
Q. Alex said it's going to be a fun game. Is that how you see it?
ZACK GREINKE: Well, I hope so.
Q. Any nerves or any kind of emotions right now starting the big game tomorrow?
ZACK GREINKE: A little excited about it. But we'll see. Wish it was in a National League park.
Q. Do you approach a game like this, winner take all, in any different type way or was it just the same approach, Zack?
ZACK GREINKE: Just try to do good. That kind of just what I do is just make pitches and that gives us the best chance.
Q. Do you ever fantasize about pitching in a Game 7 World Series?
ZACK GREINKE: Probably. I can't remember doing that at the moment, but probably.
Q. Do you feel added pressure given that it's Game 7?
ZACK GREINKE: Not at the moment. But maybe at some point, you never know.
Q. What makes the Nationals so tough to go against?
ZACK GREINKE: They have some good hitters. Not a lot of holes, not a lot of strikeouts. That's probably the toughest part.
Q. What are some of the takeaways from your first game against the Nationals in the World Series? Do you try to adjust for Game 7?
ZACK GREINKE: They had a lot of good at-bats. They pitched pretty good. And they got a good amount of hits. I felt all right and they made it tougher than it would ideally be.
