DIAMONDBACKS  Â– 4
  BREWERS - 9

 Q. How did it feel for you going on such short rest and how did you feel that affected your performance?
 ZACK GREINKE: It felt real good out there. All my pitches were coming under pretty well and pretty sharp. I guess the fastball must have been a little flat. It felt good coming out. They were hitting the fastball pretty good. They were struggling a little bit on the other stuff. Even decently located fastballs were hit hard sometimes.

 Q. You've been asked this so many times, what is it about this team when you take the mound? You said before even when you don't pitch great they just seem to win games. 
 ZACK GREINKE: Yeah, like today is a perfect example. Didn't really do that great, but we found a way to win the game. Their pitcher is a good pitcher, too. And just never really gave away any at-bats today. Just lucky season at home. 

 Q. What was it like your first playoff start, the anticipation for you, the crowd, what was it like for you?
 ZACK GREINKE: It was a lot more normal than I thought it would be. Just kind of felt like a normal game. And maybe focused just a little bit harder on every pitch. But for the most part I was just going on pitching and didn't really have anymore energy or anything than just a normal game. 

 Q. So many times this year you guys have been a pitching team. You won with pitching. But today the offense really came through. What was it like from your vantage point to see that?
 ZACK GREINKE: Well, the last couple weeks of the season, starting maybe the Cincinnati series, it might have been, and our offense has been doing really well. I guess they struggled for a little bit after the All-Star break. But it's been doing really well lately. 
 Getting Rickie back, they're pitching to Prince a lot more. Rickie is putting good at-bats. And I think that makes a big difference in the lineup just having him back for our offense. 

 Q. You come out, Ryan Braun, you see him all year, are you just amazed he keeps going out and doing what he does?
 ZACK GREINKE: Yeah, the main thing with Braun is he's just -- this year he's been consistent the whole time, the whole season he's put good at-bats. I don't know if he's even been in a slump like maybe a three-game slump or something. But all year long he's been consistent. When he gets hot it's just a little hotter than he normally is. But that's really good, because just when he's normal is better than most people when they're hot sometimes.
