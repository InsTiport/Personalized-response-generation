  Brewers  Â– 9
    Cardinals - 6

 Q. I was just asking Ron about what it is when you're out there, including the two postseason starts, the Brewers are 17-0 this year when you're starting. How do you explain it?
     ZACK GREINKE: I don't know. We've got a good record. I answer this question after every start (laughter), and before every start. We feel like we're going to win. We've been playing good baseball for about a month now. 
     We had like one-week or two-week stretch where we were struggling. But since the All-Star break we've been playing some great baseball.

 Q. Does having a duo like Braun and Fielder behind you kind of give you confidence, even when you're behind?
     ZACK GREINKE: Yeah, I guess you can count on a couple of runs every game for the most part, or at least an opportunity to score a couple of runs. 
     It seems like right now every time it comes to the middle of the lineup there's an opportunity. And that's just -- they're really good. Maybe -- probably the best three, four in baseball right now, maybe. 

 Q. How did you feel today on the extra rest? I know you don't usually like to have it, but this time in the postseason you can't avoid it, I guess. 
     ZACK GREINKE: Felt pretty good. Every time I threw a curveball it seemed like they hit it really hard. But the fastball location was really good. Slider was good. Change-up, I think I only threw one, but it seemed good. Curveball seemed sharp, too. 
     But they took good swings on it, starting with Freese's pitch. I got behind on Molina, that bat before. And Freese seemed to be pretty patient. I didn't want to throw it right down the middle to him, but wanted to be aggressive with the curveball and try to get ahead of the count and he put a good swing on it.

 Q. Is this the scenario you kind of envisioned when you decided you wanted to play baseball?
     ZACK GREINKE: Yeah, it's been a lot of fun. The game's been good. You just want to pitch on the most important games. And this is it, and see what you could do in those situations. 
     And so far in the first two games I felt like I pitched really good. But the results aren't really quite there. I mean, we won both games, but me, personally, it just felt -- it feels really good out there, just a lot more comfortable than I expected. I thought I'd be a lot more nerve wracking or whatever, but it feels pretty good.

 Q. In the big fifth inning with all the hitting going on, you had a chance to get up there and try to get in the activity. Did you have to lobby in there?
     ZACK GREINKE: I figured if I got up and there is guys on base he would probably take me out. But I guess we had a three-run lead or something, and wanted to get a little deeper in the game. 
     I figure if there's guys on base that he'd probably take me out. I didn't mind him leaving me in. I ended up throwing really good after that, too. 

 Q. Every time a pitcher makes the last out of an inning and then gives up a hit or even a run, people wonder if running 90 feet took it out of you. Is that a factor in your mind at all?
     ZACK GREINKE: No, I think earlier on in the year I focused too much on like hitting. And then I think that messes with you, because you take your concentration away from pitching for just a little while. 
     But now, I mean, I don't really think it makes much of a difference. Furcal, I made a good first pitch. It was like just an inch outside. He took it. And then I made a bad curveball and 2-0. 
     I mean, I tried to make a decent pitch and I made two decent pitches and one ball and he got a double. I don't think it had nothing to do with the inning before. 

 Q. You could imagine what it might be like to pitch to a team. When you come over here for a year and realize the offense you have behind you, does that make things easier for you, more comfortable?
     ZACK GREINKE: I realize it, but it's still just your job to go out and pitch, no matter what kind of team you have behind. And that's what I try to do. 

 Q. You talk about the bullpen a little bit today, specifically Saito coming in, first and third, nobody out?
     ZACK GREINKE: I mean, that's what it's been like since Frankie's [Rodriguez] been here, I can't imagine there being a bullpen that's done as good as ours, especially the four or five guys, Kam, Hawk, Saito, Frankie and Axford. I feel like their ERA is zero since we made that trade. And you kind of just expect it. 

 Q. Did you have any comments from the Cardinals to you regarding some of the things you said yesterday?
     ZACK GREINKE: No. They're yelling from the dugout some, but most teams do that. Everyone always makes fun of me grunting when I throw a fastball. It's kind of funny sometimes, but no big deal.
