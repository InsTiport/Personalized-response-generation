Dodgers   6
  Cardinals   4

Q.   What did do you in particular to get out of that first‑inning jam?   And how important was that for you?
ZACK GREINKE:   It was huge.   That was big.   I was real nervous out there with that situation and trying to make a good pitch and get Adams to chase and get him into a double‑play. 
Took first pitch, and then I don't really remember, and then threw a curveball down.   Once I got into that situation, I could go for a strikeout.   But then Molina, I know if you hit on the ground there is a good chance it's either going to be a hit or a double‑play.   Risky going in, bases loaded because he could do some damage.   It was just, I mean, it worked out. 
But with Molina there is nothing you could do that you know is going to work.   He can adjust to anything, and you just, I kind of got lucky, I guess.   I made a good pitch, but still even with a good pitch he can hurt you, and it just worked out.

Q.   Was there a little bit of a sense of deja vu when you gave the lead back up, the two‑run lead? 
ZACK GREINKE:   Yeah.

Q.   And what kind of a mental boost did you get when Adrian gave it right back to you with the home run? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I don't know why that happened, but it was the same part of the lineup too, I think.   Beltran same thing.   Just went over today.   I said if I got beaten by Beltran I want it to be with the curveball and that was what happened.   Probably should have went in earlier in that at‑bat when I had some opportunities and then that curveball would have been more effective. 
But it was one of those things where, like I said last time, yeah, you don't want Beltran to beat you.   But Holliday's just as good.   So have a pitch you want to throw to Beltran, and he just did a good job hitting it.

Q.   After the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, you had about ten pitches an inning on average.   What happened between the third and fourth? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I don't know if they did, but I felt like they were adjusting and looking out over, and they were hitting the off‑speed well.   So I just tried to locate some fastballs and ended up working.   Got some quick outs.   I don't know if that's what they were doing. 
But them and the Twins are the two teams that make adjustments faster than any other team.   It's always a mental battle, a physical and mental battle against them.   Trying, like I said, trying to make adjustments before they do.   I don't know if that was the case, but that was my mindset.

Q.   Being with Kershaw this year, did you guys create any kind of a friendly competition, or do you build off each other or push each other? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I mean, we might not knowing pitching‑wise.   But we have a hitting competition every month.   But pitching‑wise, we don't talk about it.   I don't try to compete with him because I don't think it's possible to.   Try, maybe, just try to come as close as possible.

Q.   Would you be available for a seventh game, not to start or anything, but maybe to throw an inning or two? 
ZACK GREINKE:   Yeah, I'm sure it's possible.   But, I mean, bullpen guys, their job is a bullpen.   Starters, their job is a starter.   They train for it.   They practice it.   I mean, I've done it before, but it's not as easy as you think to switch.   You're starting the whole year and then come out of the bullpen out of nowhere.   But I'm sure extra‑innings‑type situation it would be more realistic if that happens.

Q.   A few years ago there were some questions, maybe some doubts about you in big games and big markets.   How has it been for you here?   Do you feel any different than Kansas City, Milwaukee?   I know you were in Anaheim briefly, but has it been a bit of an adjustment at all? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I mean, the games are fun.   They're intense.   I mean, I get nervous before the starts, but I'm sure most people do.   I think the biggest difference is there are more people.   I mean, this room is full and the clubhouse is full of media.   I mean, it's crazy. 
The biggest difference is just all the people and having to get used to it and find a way that is comfortable dealing with all the extra people around.   Ideally there would be less people around, but that's just not the case.   It's not my favorite having it, but if it was like this the whole year, I don't know.   It might be a little tough.   But the regular season there's not too many people around and you just try to do as good as you can.

Q.   There's been a number of plays on both sides in this series where there's fist pumping and gesturing and whatever excitement you want to call it.   When you gave off the mound, you had to think you were pretty close to knowing you were done after seven and looked like you were just walking with your head down going to the library.   Did you have any thoughts of any kind of gestures at that point given how well you pitched and how big this game was? 
ZACK GREINKE:   The biggest ones were the two double‑plays.   I mean, those were really exciting.   Their team has gotten a bunch of double‑plays against us, and we've had them hit some hardballs that we've made plays on. 
But I don't think we've had many big double‑plays.   It's just guys in scoring position, and that happening is just really exciting.   The last three innings, nothing special.   It was more the double‑plays were the most exciting part.

Q.   You were able, after giving up the second run you retired I believe it was 13 guys in a row.   Did Adrian's home run having the lead back, did that make you a little bit more comfortable? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I don't really think about the runs too much.   I mean, if we get like a five‑run lead then I'll start to pitch according to that.   But a tie game, one run, I mean, one run is not very comfortable so still pitching the same and the way I go about it.

Q.   Could you tell us what your thoughts were approaching the plate in the second inning and take us through that at‑bat? 
ZACK GREINKE:   Just there's a guy on first, so I saw there were more holes open a bit.   So I was just trying to not strike out.   That was pretty much it and hoped it finds a hole, because, I mean, there were some holes out there because of people being on base.   They had to cover first and stuff.   So it ended up working out.

Q.   A.J. accused you of only wanting to extend the series so you had more time to make fantasy football trades.   Would you care to answer this accusation? 
ZACK GREINKE:   I'm in last place.   I'm tied for last place, so I've got a bet that I won't be in last place by the time the season's over.   So I needed to go to Sunday for that.   I've got a $10 bet on it, so it's important (smiling).
