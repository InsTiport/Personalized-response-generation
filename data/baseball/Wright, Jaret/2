Q.  How is your shin?
 
JARET WRIGHT:  Shin's okay.  
 
Q.  You've only given up 11 home runs all year.  Were you surprised to give up three in one game?
 
JARET WRIGHT:  Yeah, we made a few mistakes.  They were home runs.  They didn't miss them, they hit them out of the park.  I'm getting used to not giving up home runs, and giving up three today, was not good. 
 
Q.  Everyone talks about the Cardinals' lineup, but can you compare the two lineups.  The Astros are pretty close. 
 
JARET WRIGHT:  Yeah, I think they're pretty close.  I mean, you've got to be on your game when you face these guys.  St. Louis, too.  Didn't get it done today.  
 
Q.  Is their lineup that much different with Beltran in, and how much did he change their lineup from earlier this year? 
 
JARET WRIGHT:  I mean, he's your top-of-the-line Major League hitter.  You've got to make pitches on him.  They've got a solid lineup. You know, I was looking to pitch better than I did.  It's a bad feeling.  
 
Q.  When you were hit by that ball back up the middle, it seemed like it was worse than it apparently is.  Does it bother you?
 
JARET WRIGHT:  When you get hit like that, it doesn't feel good.  But nothing was going to keep me out of that game.  After that, it was fine.  
 
Q.  Where did that hit you? 
 
JARET WRIGHT:  Right in the shin, left shin.
