Q. One of the most touching and poignant scenes of evening was his son who had the
e-coli bacteria infection. He really was on the brink of fading away and almost losing
him. What kind of a moment, what went through you when you saw him up there?

WALT WEISS: I mean, all kinds of stuff. Probably take a while to be able to sit back
and reflect, I'll get some quiet time. It was special having him here. It was beyond
expectations. We didn't think he'd be able to get here.

Q. You're an All-Star, but you certainly found out that baseball doesn't mean a whole
lot?

WALT WEISS: My focus for the most part has been far removed from baseball and the
All-Star. Looks like it's going to be a happy ending. My boy is going to be fine. It's
been a great time here.

Q. You've had a lot of wishes, good luck, prayers. I know there's something that you
want to say to everybody.

WALT WEISS: I've been blown away by the amount of people that have reached out to us,
for me, my wife, Brody, in particular. I'd like to thank everybody. I mean, this is
something words can't express. I'd like to thank everybody for the way they've been
concerned and been thinking about us all along.

Q. Quite a fighter, Brody?

WALT WEISS: He's most likely to get in trouble as we move along. Maybe that helped him
come back. As soon as he turned the corner, he came storming back. Maybe that helped.

Q. Everybody is grateful for Brody's condition, happy that it worked out.

WALT WEISS: Thank you.
