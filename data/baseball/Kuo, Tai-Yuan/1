Netherlands - 6, Chinese Taipei - 5
Q. I think that the pitching staff performed better than yesterday's game.  Could you evaluate the performance of Chiang Shao-ching?
KUO TAI-YUAN: Well, he received some training in the United States.  He joined us a little bit late.  Well, we have some confidence in him.  That's why we have him pitch as a reliever.
Q. Chinese Taipei is likely to be eliminated in the first round, so could you talk about how you will prepare for the next game?
KUO TAI-YUAN: Well, we never say we are giving up, and we never say die.  We will make the best preparation for tomorrow's game.
Q. Will you give more opportunity to young players tomorrow?
KUO TAI-YUAN: As I said earlier, the ultimate goal is to win the game, and I will evaluate the situation and make a decision accordingly.
Q. There was a play which was quite controversial, in the bottom of the ninth inning, could you talk about why the call was changed?
KUO TAI-YUAN: The umpire at third base, well, I think made the right call to make that correction.
