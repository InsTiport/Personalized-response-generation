Tampa Bay   5
  Boston   4

Q.   Is this the best birthday yet for you?   What was that moment like when you hit the home run?
EVAN LONGORIA:   I think anytime you're playing in October and your birthday is in October it's a pretty good birthday in itself.   Coming into the game I just ‑‑ I wanted to play good, solid team game overall and be able to come out on top.   And just to be able to get ‑‑ to come through in that moment makes it all the more special.

Q.   Are you thinking one swing or are you thinking base hit, what's going through your mind?
EVAN LONGORIA:   Every time I try and think that it never works out.   So I was really just trying to hit something up the middle.   Clay has pitched me really tough in the past and he's had my number.   So I figure if I try to do too much it could be a bad thing.   And he threw a two‑seamer in the first pitch, got in on my hands, and I just barely got enough of the next pitch.   It was a changeup that just stayed up enough for me to get enough barrel on it.

Q.   Talk about the improbability of Lobaton's home run, who he hit it off. 
EVAN LONGORIA:   Koji has been tough, man.   He's been a really bright spot on that ballclub.   To be able to come through in that moment, you know, those are the kind of things that we're going to need to propel us forward.   Being able to walk off against a guy like him.   And carry the momentum into tomorrow is huge for us. 

Q.   You seemed angry with yourself when you took the changeup on strike three on the previous at‑bat for the home run.   Were you mad to take that pitch?   Was the changeup in the back of your mind on the next one when you hit the home run?
EVAN LONGORIA:   It wasn't in the back of my mind.   But I was mad, yes.   I was more mad at I guess the fact that he made a really good pitch in that spot.   And I got a first pitch cutter that I missed in that at‑bat.   And then I swung at a fastball after that, so I kind of put myself in a hole right away.   After that he didn't really make any mistakes.   After that he made some good pitches and a couple of good curveballs, and throwing that changeup.   When he throws it well it's a devastating pitch.

Q.   What was said in the locker room after the game?   How do you keep it going in these elimination games?
EVAN LONGORIA:   We just did our normal celebration, and kind of treated it like just another win.   I think we all understand the stakes.   We all understand that we have our backs against the wall.   And it seems like those moments have been fueling us.   These are the games that we've really played well in.   Although you'd like to be on the other side, maybe we need that right now. 
So I think ‑‑ like I said, the momentum going into tomorrow, the home fans were awesome, and I think we'll try to just continue that and use that to our advantage.

Q.   It doesn't seem like too many breaks have gone your way in the series.   Whenever two infielders collide as Boston did, maybe things are turning your way?
EVAN LONGORIA:   We've had some tough breaks against us.   Jacoby has played from line to line about as well as any hitter can.   He's hit the third baseline, he hit the first base bag tonight.   And those are the things that as an offense you need to get yourself going.   And so we'll take the one with them two colliding.   A slight miscommunication, I guess, on the bunt by Desmond.   It was a perfectly placed bunt.   And then I wouldn't really call it a miscue, but Napoli mishandling the ball at first when he probably had a chance to go home.   Those are the kind of things that you need to win.
And so we just try to use those to our advantage.

Q.   You've seen some of your high profile players over the years.   Do you take that responsibility upon yourself to come up in games like this and try and do what needs to be done?
EVAN LONGORIA:   I think everybody wants to ‑‑ everybody wants to come through.   I understand the commitment they made to me and the commitment that I decided to make to the organization.   And I definitely stick by that.   I love being here.   And for as many times as I'm able to come through in those moments right there, that's why I'm here.   And that's, I think ‑‑ hopefully what the fan base expects out of me.   And in turn I expect it out of myself.   And even if I don't look like I'm upset when I don't come through, it's definitely the other way around.   I'm happy to be a part of it tonight.   And like I said, Lobo's hit some big home runs for us, and none bigger than that one.
