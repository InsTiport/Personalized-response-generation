Q.  What did Lou tell you guys in the pre-game meeting and did that help the team, and second part was have you ever seen a lead-off guy get as many intentionals as Ichiro? 

STAN JAVIER:   First part, I mean, I'm not going to answer that, but it was great.  You know, it was good.  About Ichiro, he's just a great hitter.  I mean, he just puts the ball in play.  He's a clutch guy, and, you know what, if I'm the manager against him, I would do the same thing.

Q.  Could you take us through the catch and the process of tracking that ball down? 

STAN JAVIER:   When he hit it, it was pretty high and gave me enough time to go back to the wall and time it.   I saw the wall, and you know, I jumped and made the catch.  You know, that's the thing we're always trying to do in batting practice and, you know, I just caught it. 

Q.  Off the bat, did you think it was gone? 

STAN JAVIER:   I knew he hit it pretty good, but Yankee Stadium is pretty large, big left field.  Like I said, it gave me enough time.  I saw the wind blowing out a little bit and I was playing a little bit deeper than I usually play, but I just, you know, jump and sometimes you jump and it hits off your glove, but that one was  -- that one just caught it. 

Q.  You seem to be working awfully hard to delay your retirement.  You've had a nice post-season.  Could you just talk about that? 

STAN JAVIER:   Well, I hope I can delay it a little longer.  (Laughs).
