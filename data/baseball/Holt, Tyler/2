TCU  Â– 8
  Florida State - 1

 THE MODERATOR: Coach, your opening thoughts on the game today? 
 COACH MARTIN: If you had told me that we were going to get two hits in 27 outs, and no runs, I think I would have discussed it with you. But you really gotta take your hat off to TCU. They did a great job. After we got the first couple of guys on, we had a run in on the 3rd and nobody out. That's what I was alluding to. That's just a credit to TCU. They did a great job of playing defense and making quality pitches. And that's a ball game that you can analyze. From our side, we didn't make an error. You might just say we got our butts whipped, plain and simple. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Martin or the student-athletes.

 Q. TCU obviously had a lot of respect for them coming in, but did they exceed your expectations? Bottom line, are they better than you thought they were? 
 COACH MARTIN: They're everything that I saw when I saw them play Texas on television. Well-coached, solid defense, outstanding pitching. They're everything I thought they were, which I feel they deserve to be in Omaha. They earned it. And they went out today and whipped us. 

 Q. Sherman, could you talk about that 1st inning. You're on third and nobody is out, runs already in. That was one of the pivotal moments in the game when he came back and struck out the side like that. 
 SHERMAN JOHNSON: In the 1st inning he was going well. I caught a break, we caught a break, and he did a great job to come back and just stop the bleeding, is really what they did. They kind of used that as momentum into the next half of the inning, scoring. So they really played well.

 Q. Sean, was there something that was working, not working today? What would you attribute the results of your day to? What led to the outcome for you today?
 SEAN GILMARTIN: The 1st inning, basically they were just putting the bat on the ball. I don't really know how many balls they hit hard in that 1st inning, but I also got behind the count. So that didn't really help me out at all.

 Q. Tyler, could you talk a little bit about your impressions of Purke and what he did to keep you guys off balance in the middle of the game?
 TYLER HOLT: You know, he used all three pitches well. You know, we didn't help ourselves out a lot. I think it's a totally different ball game if we're more patient and better -- not swinging at that stuff that's in the dirt. I think we helped him along the way.
 But that's what happens when you have good stuff. It looks like it's in the zone, then it comes out. That first inning kills us and then it kind of went on from there. 

 Q. Question for Sherman. Could you just talk about your first experience playing in Rosenblatt?
 SHERMAN JOHNSON: It's pretty amazing. You're used to playing in front of 7,000 fans, and there's probably 30,000 people here. So it's really amazing. But the field looks great. I mean, atmosphere is amazing. It's what you want to play. It's where you want to be playing at this time of the year.

 Q. Tyler, first pitch, fastball, people weren't even in their seats by the time you got up there and got on base. Did you feel that that's what you wanted to do, look first pitch, fastball, and do you think in a way that eased the team up there in the opening minutes?
 TYLER HOLT: Always looking for something to hit. If that pitch is in or it's an awful pitch, probably not swinging at that. I thought I was swinging well. I put a swing on it and it fell. I thought it was a good start. We had things going. And the rest you guys watched.

 Q. Sean, could you talk about that 1st inning again. When you've had rough outings it's been the 5th or 5th inning, you've been good through three. Talk about their approach because they got two strikes a lot of times then just put the bat on the ball and put it in play. 
 SEAN GILMARTIN: That's been their -- it's been what's happening with me all year long pretty much. Get ahead in the count 0-2, 1-2, and then not finishing things off. Obviously have to get better at that.

 Q. Coach, I hate to bring this up, but opening games have become a nemesis for you where you're finding yourselves playing out of a rut. Can you address that? 
 COACH MARTIN: I wish there was something that I could say that would make any sense. I'll just say that I'm very proud to be a Seminole and associated with this baseball team. And certainly we're disappointed. But this TCU club is very good. They whipped us today. And I got a few on my resume so it's nothing new. 

 Q. Sherman, could you talk about -- I think you were 0 for 12 with runners in scoring positions. Some of those balls were hit really hard that were right at guys. Did it seem like after a while it was one of those days where you guys were going to hit them right at people? 
 SHERMAN JOHNSON: I mean, yeah, but he was making great pitches as well. It seemed when guys got on base it was crunch time, he really buckled down and he threw the ball well. Tip your hat to him. 
 THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you.
