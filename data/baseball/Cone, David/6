 Q. David, what did you know about Scott Brosius before he came to the Yankees?
 
 DAVID CONE: Not a whole lot, to tell you the truth. We didn't really know what to
expect. But from day one he seemed to fit in in Spring Training this year. Got along real
well with the rest of the guys, seemed to move around real well, and played great defense,
and started swinging the bat from day one, and we said we're onto something here, and it
was just a perfect fit. 
 
Q. The way the game unfolded, it looked like they were going to get some breaks, what
was your sense of how it unfolded?
 
 DAVID CONE: I thought the 6th inning was a huge turning point. We had a chance to score
in the top of the 6th, we didn't get it done. Hitchcock did a great job of pitching out of
that jam. And I turned around and went out there and gave up three runs, and I thought it
was a huge turnaround. And Scottie picked us up, got the first run on the board with his
first home run. That gave us a lift, and we broke the ice. And we thought we could get
Hitchcock out of the game and do some damage. 
 
Q. It took you a while to appear for your first at-bat, what happened there?
 
 DAVID CONE: I was up -- I tried to run up to the clubhouse to change my shirt, and
didn't realize I was that close to being up to the plate, and I had to run back down and
get out there in a hurry. 
 
Q. You didn't give up any hits the first five innings, but you seemed to be trying to
find your way through, it wasn't as if you were dominating, how did you feel?
 
 DAVID CONE: I would agree with that. I made just enough good pitches the right time to
get through the first five innings, a couple of walks here and there. It wasn't a
dominating performance, for the first five. And to go out in the 6th, gave up the hit to
the pitcher, and I thought the key to the inning was walking Veras, and then I threw a
really good spliter to Tony Gwynn, he's an amazing hitter, he did a great job of putting
his bat on that ball. And I think Girardi's glove was on the ground  
 for that pitch. 
 
Q. With everyone hitting so well on this team, and the starting five, what do you say
to the fans in New York about what to do with their Game 6 and 7 tickets, it doesn't look
like it's going to be necessary?
 
 DAVID CONE: Two words, Kevin Brown tomorrow. We're not by any means over confident at
this point. Obviously we're ecstatic to be up 3-0. Obviously we're 3-0, but Kevin Brown
probably has some other thoughts tonight. 
 
Q. Where were you when Brosius hit that home run, and what was your reaction?
 
 DAVID CONE: I was up in the clubhouse with ice on my arm. And everybody just jumped
through the roof. It was just incredible. It was almost disbelief when the ball went off
the bat, that's dead center, is that going to make it? And he just crushed the ball. There
was nothing cheap about that shot. When you go straight center field off a great closer,
that's legitimate. 
 
Q. Even so, tomorrow you guys are on the verge of doing what you've been working
towards all year, how does that feel at this point?
 
 DAVID CONE: It feels exactly like you said, we're on the brink of something really
special. There's going to be a lot of arguments historically about where this team fits
in. But we've got one more game to go. It's the most professional team, it's the best team
in baseball. We've worked very hard to play professionally, to come out every night. We
won 114 games in the regular season, and you don't do that without being an unbelievably
professional team, and I'm very proud to be a part of it. 
 
Q. Back to your hit again, was that an advantage to you, being able to come in and be
familiar with the process?
 
 DAVID CONE: Well, I had six years in the National League, and by no means did I think I
was going to get a hit tonight because of that. It's not as if I'd never been out there or
swung the bat or been in a position. I think Hitchcock was treating me like I treated him,
I didn't want to walk him. When he got the hit off me to return the favor, I thought go
right down the middle, and I'm sure he was thinking the same thing about me, go after him
and make him hit the ball. 
 
Q. Twice this team has come back from three-runs down in the late innings. It looked
like you were going to lose both of those games. What's it like in the dugout with the
Yankees?
 
 DAVID CONE: Well, action all year long. We just have great confidence in the depth of
our line-up. The bottom of our line-up has started many rallies all year long. National
League games are different because you have the pitcher batting. With Scott Brosius, we
have extreme confidence, regardless of what I think it is or where we are in the batting
order.
