Q.  What does this start mean to you?  It's the epitome of baseball, isn't it? 
 
JARROD WASHBURN:  Basically, yeah, that's it.  It means I get to start Game 1 of the World Series.  It's a dream come true.  You dream as a kid to play in the World Series, and I get to throw the first pitch of Game 1 this year.  I can't wait.  This has been an awful long week and I'm glad it's almost done.
