Q.  You have the most hits in post-season history; what is it when you get into these situations?
 
DEREK JETER:   I don't know, it's not just good fortune.  I'm up there swinging early in the counts especially when you're facing guys like Rocket and Randy Johnson.  
 
Q.  It was a tough first couple of months before the season, and I've known you for a long time, I've never seen you throw a helmet, how do you maintain that kind of poise, for young people out there listening to this?
 
DEREK JETER:   Well, it's a long season.  It's not over after the first month and a half or two months.  We've still got a long way to go.  I just try to keep things in perspective and take it day-to-day. 
 
Q.  Talk about Roger.
 
DEREK JETER:  Roger, he deserves to be out here.  He got a nice ovation and I have a lot of respect for him.
