  Q. With the passing of George Steinbrenner, what did you know about him that the public did not?   
 DEREK JETER: I think the one thing that stands out is how much he cared about his players, how much he cared about the community, whether it was in New York, in Tampa where he lives or anywhere in the country.   
 He really gave back, and I think a lot of times people didn't really pay much attention to that because they knew him as this vocal owner. He really cared about people.
