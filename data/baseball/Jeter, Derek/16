  Q. Did you detect any reluctance on his part?  
 DEREK JETER: I didn't detect anything.   
  
  Q. The WBC, Alex, now he'll be playing against you. Are you surprised, and is that something you've talked to him about?  
 DEREK JETER: I have not spoken to him about it. To be honest with you, I didn't know you could do it. Everyone is learning the rules, and that's an option he has. He has his reasons for doing that, and that's a great option for him. And whatever team he plays for, he's going to help.  
  
  Q. You said it wasn't a recruiting call, but I'm sure on his end, just curious, how do you take the responsibility of the captain's role?   
 DEREK JETER: I take it seriously. I don't even know -- I talked to a few people, but, once again, it's not...  
  
  Q. How long ago was it that you talked to him?  
 DEREK JETER: Maybe the first week in February.   
  
  Q. How long was the talk?  
 DEREK JETER: If he wants to address it, he can let you know.   
  
  Q. Are you surprised how long it took to sign him?  
 DEREK JETER: Well, you're only a free agent once in your career, so it takes a long time to decide. It's more than just playing a game, you're moving your entire family.   
 If you're talking about being in the game for a long time, you can't rush into a decision. People that rush into decisions tend to regret it, so I'm not surprised.  
  
  Q. Can you give us any scouting report as a hitter?  
 DEREK JETER: He throws in the upper 90s, he's a big guy, he's a power pitcher, and he has a great slider and knows what he's doing. He can pretty much do anything. He's a great athlete, and the list goes on and on.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to the Yankees to get him?  
 DEREK JETER: He's a great guy.
