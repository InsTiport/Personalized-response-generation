Brewers  Â– 9
      Cardinals - 6

 Q. Have you ever seen a game's momentum turnaround that quickly?
     YUNIESKY BETANCOURT: I don't know if I've ever seen that before, but the kind of team that we have, when we get it started, we can keep it rolling pretty quickly and continue it. 

 Q. Considering how many pitches you fouled off before hitting the home run, was that your best at-bat of the season?
     YUNIESKY BETANCOURT: I think it was pretty good. I think I fouled off four balls. And after the result I would say it was the best at-bat of the season, but I was just trying to do my job, trying to move the runner over. And the pitcher hung it a little bit and I did my job. 

 Q. Did you feel relaxed? 
     YUNIESKY BETANCOURT: Yeah, I was just trying to do my job. 

 Q. Do you feel that Roenicke is getting frustrated with you for swinging at the first pitch, and do they ever say much to you about it?
     YUNIESKY BETANCOURT: It frustrates me sometimes. And I certainly realize that it can be frustrating for them. But that's the style of player I am. I'm a very aggressive hitter and I just try to do my best that way. 

 Q. How do you feel about all the criticism you have dealt with over the years and is today sort of a redemption?
     YUNIESKY BETANCOURT: I don't really understand English very well, so that being said, I don't really pay attention to what the critics say (laughter). Since I don't understand, I don't get mad, I just try and do my job.
