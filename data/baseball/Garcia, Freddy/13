Q.  How was it seeing Carlos today?

FREDDY GARCIA:  You know, he's looking pretty good today. He was walking, talking with the other guys.  I think he looked fine today.

Q.  Any extra butterflies for the start tomorrow?

FREDDY GARCIA:  I don't know.  I'll wait for tomorrow, and see what happens.

Q.  What's the key to facing the Indians line-up, what do you have to concentrate on most?

FREDDY GARCIA:  You know, I think I have to throw a lot of strikes.  I have to be ready to throw a strike, because everybody knows they're a pretty good team.  You have to be ready for those guys.

Q.  Can you talk about how things change for your team, after the regular season, after getting 116 wins, and now there's so much expectations for you?

FREDDY GARCIA:  You know, now it's a different situation. The season is over.  We won 116 games, and tomorrow we play five games, and we have to win three games.  But it's a short series, you don't know what's going to happen.  You have to play good and do what you have to do.

Q.  What's been the difference in you from last season to this season, and how big was -- starting in Game 1, last year, maybe doting on that?

FREDDY GARCIA:  I think I've got more experience.  I've got a little more confidence.  I have the opportunity to start again tomorrow.  I'll try to do my best.
