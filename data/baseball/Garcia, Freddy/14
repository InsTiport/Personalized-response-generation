Q.  What do you think of what Mariano Rivera has done? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   I don't know, this guy is unbelievable.  He only got one inning pitch  -- he threw everything with one pitch.  The ball moves a lot for him, first try and every time, one, two, three, out of the inning, no problem.

Q.  Just one pitch, though? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   Yeah.  It's good. 

Q.  When you faced the Yankees the first time, what in general did you learn about their lineup?  And since you're so fresh in their minds, do you have to change your approach at all in this next game? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   I don't know.  I'm going to pitch my game.  I'll try to do the same approach I used last time, just try and work ahead in the count every time.  I think that's my thing:  Throw the first pitch for a strike.

Q.  If you guys are down three games to one, how much pressure or how much of a burden will you feel tomorrow? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   I don't have pressure.  I go pitch my game, try to be myself, and do the best I can.  Try to win, that's all I can do. 

Q.  Do you think that their bats woke up; that they are starting to hit again?  Because they were so quiet for so long.

FREDDY GARCIA:   I don't know.  You know, they have always been a good team.  Just have to be prepared for when they start hitting.  Now they play good.   We have to pitch  -- we have to make good pitches to get them out.
