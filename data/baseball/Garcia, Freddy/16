Q.  Are you excited? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   Excited?  Yeah. 


Q.  Nervous? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   No.  I'm ready to go tomorrow.  They have given me the opportunity to pitch tomorrow.  I'm here.  So let's do it. 


Q.  Did it come as a surprise to you that you were going to get the Game 1 start? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   Not really, because I pitched in Chicago, so I was supposed to pitch here or in Oakland.  So I was working out for pitching here or in Oakland. 


Q.  Can you describe what it is like when you saw Yankee Stadium for the first time? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   Before I come here last year, I always wanted to go, because the Yankees, they have always been a good team.  They have won a lot of World Series, and I'm excited to come here and pitch in the ballpark. 


Q.  This is only the second time the Mariners have been this far.  Can you talk about what it means to you to pitch Game 1 in one of the biggest series in the franchise history for the Mariners? 

FREDDY GARCIA:   For me, that's why we're here.  We've been working all year long.  So we are here.  It's good to face the Yankees.  We've been good and I'm ready to go tomorrow.
