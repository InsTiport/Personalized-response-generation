 Q. You've had a lot of success here at Fenway Park. What's been the key to your success here?
 JON LESTER: I guess just feeling more comfortable at home and in your surroundings, and you drive yourself to the ballpark, and don't have to worry about anything else. 
 I guess I'm just comfortable here.

 Q. What can you use from the Game 1 victory to help you tomorrow night? 
 JON LESTER: Just knowledge of the hitters and seeing them come up to bat and what they did to certain pitches. Just visualize what they did against that and just take little key things here and there and try to throw key pitches.

 Q. You've really come through in situations; what is the key? 
 JON LESTER: I don't know. I think it's just you've got that extra edge. That little extra intensity of the game. You know, I guess that puts you on your toes a little bit more. And being able to go out and execute pitches, and I've been fortunate enough to do that. And hopefully I'll continue to do that tomorrow.

 Q. Talk about being aggressive tomorrow? 
 JON LESTER: I don't know. I don't know what they're going to do. I guess we'll have to wait to see. They'll be aggressive tonight against Josh. Maybe they'll do that again. Maybe they'll be patient and make me throw strikes. I don't know. We'll have to wait and see tomorrow. 

 Q. Do you feel extra pressure because the team doesn't want to go back to Anaheim, and the bullpen was used up a lot tonight. Do you feel pressure to go deep?
 JON LESTER: No, no. I just have to worry about my pitches. I can't worry about us going back to L.A. or the bullpen situation. I just have to worry about going out and executing my pitches. That's all I can worry about. You can't worry about stuff you can't control.
