THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Scott Palmer is here to give us a status report on Corona Del Inca.   
DR. SCOTT PALMER: Thank you very much.  I'm sorry to be here today to talk to you about this, but Corona Del Inca was pulled up at the top of the stretch today, and the report that we have from Dr. Taylor, who is the CHRB veterinarian, told me that she sustained a fracture, an open lateral condylar fracture of her right front leg.  They splintered her leg and loaded her on to an ambulance and took her to the hospital at the track.   
At this time they're taking radiographs to make an accurate determination of the extent of her injuries and come up with a prognosis and possible treatment plan.  So we'll be giving you further information as soon as we hear back from Dr. Taylor.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for that, Dr. Palmer.  And he'll be here for a few minutes if anyone has follow-up questions for Scott Palmer.
