JOHN MAGNIER:  I'm happy it was a dead heat.  We were just hoping.  I don't think it would be fair to either side to have either horse lose.  We're all happy at the moment.  
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  You know, his record really is unbelievable.  I think he's only been beaten three times in his life.  And he's never -- he was second the first time he ran.  And other than that, he's never been beaten.  
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  I would think that this is his last race or this has always been the plan to finish here.  
 
 
Q.   I assume he will go to Coolmore, John? 
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  Yeah, that's the plan at the moment. 
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  I think in a big race this is as nerve-wracking as it gets, yeah.  Somebody said that it took so long as well.  Normally you get a result earlier.  
 
Q.   It looked like they were trying to separate them and couldn't.  If you looked at the photo, one of the legs of the inside horse looked as if it extended the nose of Johar and that was the problem. 
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  We settled out of court. (Laughter.)  
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  Well, in my opinion, anybody that gets a dead heat, it kind of suits everybody.  
 
Q.   John, how concerned were you about the firm ground here?  I know he's handled firm ground in Ireland.  But this is different. 
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  The conception you see that Sadler's Wells don't go well on the firm ground.  But that's simply not true.  And as you saw there again today.  Then he's run on firm ground a lot.  You can only run on firm ground so many times.  You can you can't keep doing it.  I think that's probably the reason now that we have decided he's run on the firm ground so many times that it's time to put him to stud.  
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  Depends on the result.  I wouldn't mind another dead heat, I'll tell you that.  
 
JOHN MAGNIER:  Thank you.
