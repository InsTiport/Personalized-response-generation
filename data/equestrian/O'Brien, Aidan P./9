AIDAN O'BRIEN:  I'd say no doubt.  No doubt would be serious, it serious consideration.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  We had a lot of concerns.  Obviously, he's only raced on turf, hard and soft turf.  He handled that so well.  You couldn't be sure, handled fast ground very well.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  He seemed fine.  It's the end of a long, hard season.  He's a three-year-old.  First time on the surface, he just found it a little bit foreign the first time.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  Obviously when he showed that much pace, he is just a serious colt.  We never tried him any farther.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  You're never really sure really.  So you are never sure really.  He traveled really strong off the bend.  Just, today he proved -- he got the trip real well.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  We probably keep him happy through the winter and keep him in one piece.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  He ran a great race.  He just got trapped a little bit.  He ran a great race.  

AIDAN O'BRIEN:  He will stay in training.
