   ERIC WING: We're very pleased to have with us Frankie Dettori who finally has a race off and can join us, he, of course, won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf earlier in the day with Pounced. Frankie, congratulations. It was about an hour and a half ago. So give us another run through the trip as you saw it.  
 FRANKIE DETTORI: Well, came into this race quite unexposed. Only run three times. But since he's arrived, he's been doing well. As you know all week being inside has been a great advantage, and a great draw with four. They jump good, they travel tremendously well inside. And then it was a matter of getting the split in the stretch.    
When I got the split, it took a little while to get in top gear, but it was always going to get there in the end. So it was a very straightforward trip. But it always happens when you go to a horse that can help you, and he did really help me.   
 ERIC WING: Watching the race on TV, though you only won by a length or two, it looked like you were much the best, is that the way it felt under you?   
 FRANKIE DETTORI: Yeah, obviously not knowing the American form, Kent Desormeaux and the favorite was the one I was keeping an eye on. When he drifted out through the straight I knew I had a chance. You know, he found that couple of lengths for me, and he proved the best horse of the days.   
  
  Q. Would you recommend or did you have discussions with John Gosden about whether this horse will be on the Triple Crown Trail next year?   
 FRANKIE DETTORI: Yeah, he's a mature horse. So he really improved. He's in the great hands of John Gosden, who I'm sure will find the best spot for the horse. But all the signs are good at this stage. You'll have to ask John that question.   
 ERIC WING: Well done.   
 FRANKIE DETTORI: I'd love to come back here. Please.
