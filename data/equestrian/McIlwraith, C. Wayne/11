   THE MODERATOR: We're here in the interview room, and we're joined -- before we meet the winning connections of Musical Romance, we're joined by Dr. C. Wayne McIlwraith. He's the on-call veterinarian for the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Dr. McIlwraith will give us a summary of what happened involving the gate scratch minutes before the race involving Number 13 Shotgun Gulch. 
 DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH: The veterinarians at the starting gate noticed that the horse was off on the left forelimb, and so they advised the stewards, who agreed to scratch the horse. 
 THE MODERATOR: As always, you're welcome to ask any questions here. 
 Dr. McIlwraith, it's safe to say that the horses are being given a pretty good scrutiny, basically right up until the moment they enter the starting gate? 
 DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH: The normal process is that the -- all the horses are observed before they go into the starting gate, and also if the jockey has a question regarding the horse, it's also addressed to the vet. 
 THE MODERATOR: I apologize if you already addressed this, but it doesn't appear to be any serious injury involving the horse? 
 DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH: No, it's not serious, but the horse will be evaluated by a veterinarian at the back side. It was a very mild lameness, but it's enough where it's not safe to race. 
 THE MODERATOR: Very good. We appreciate you coming down, Dr. McIlwraith to explain the situation to us. We hope we don't see you again. 
 DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH: Thank you.
