                         THE MODERATOR:   We have with us Dr. C. Wayne McIlwraith who is here to give us an update on Questing who was eased in the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic.  
                           DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   Yes, Questing, the No. 4 horse was eased in the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic, the ambulance was taken out and she was taken off in the ambulance.             But there were no obvious abnormalities.   In other words she had no injury to her limbs on veterinarian inspection.   
                           THE MODERATOR:   What's the procedure from this point?   Obviously great news that there is nothing apparent.   Just go over with the proverbial fine tooth comb later?   
                           DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   Exactly.   She has been taken back to the backside and when she gets off the ambulance if there are no obvious abnormalities, she'll be taken back to Irvine and the regular treating veterinarian will examine her.   
                           THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.
