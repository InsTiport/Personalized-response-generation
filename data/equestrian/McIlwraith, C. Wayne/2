  ON (Lady Zuzu)

THE MODERATOR:   Before we get to the winning connections in the Juvenile Fillies Turf, Dr.McIlwraith has returned, and he's going to give us an update on Lady Zuzu, who was scratched at the gate.   Dr.McIlwraith? 
DR. McILWRAITH:   Thank you, number 9, Lady Zuzu was scratched in the gate.   She lacerated her right hind limb, both laterally and medially, so on the outside and the inside.   They're just skin lacerations.   She's fine.   She's in a bandage at the moment, but nothing deeper than that.   And she's walking sound.
