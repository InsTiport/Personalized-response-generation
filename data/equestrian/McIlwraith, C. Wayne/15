   DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH: Quality Road had a history of being difficult in the starting gate, and became a bit of a battle of wills as you saw out there. 
 So, unfortunately, when he kicked in the starting gates, he lacerated. He received a couple of lacerations to his limbs. So there was no choice but to scratch him. 
 ERIC WING: Doctor, any indication that for all intents and purposes did it seem that the injuries were minor or too early to tell that? 
 DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH: They're just superficial lacerations. They're minor. It's not going to be a problem. But you can't race when you have a bleeding laceration.
