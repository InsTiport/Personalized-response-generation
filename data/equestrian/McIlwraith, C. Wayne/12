   ERIC WING: I've been asked to report by Dr. C. Wayne McIlwraith, the on-call veterinarian for the AAEP here today, that Atta Boy Roy who was vaned off following the Sentient Jet Breeders' Cup Sprint, Atta Boy Roy, an update, he has a superficial wound at the skin level. A superficial wound at the skin level for Atta Boy Roy. No injury to the suspensory itself. So that's good news that comes to you via Dr. C. Wayne McIlwraith. 
 Again, just to repeat, Atta Boy Roy, he's just experienced a superficial wound at the skin level. No injury to the suspensory itself.
