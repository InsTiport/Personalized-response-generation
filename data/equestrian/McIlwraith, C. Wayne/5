  THE MODERATOR:   Before we get to the winning connections of the Breeders' Cup Marathon, I want to go to Dr.Wayne McIlwraith.   He is the onâ€‘call AAEP Association, the American Association of Equine Practitioners.   Dr.McIlwraith is going to give us a quick update on Ever Rider who was pulled up by Gary Stevens.   Dr.McIlwraith, can you tell us what happened to Ever Rider?
DR. McILWRAITH:   Yes, the report from the veterinarians is that Ever Rider was pulled up and he just got tired.   He checks out normally, and he's walking back to the barn. He didn't need to go on the ambulance. 
THE MODERATOR:   I think that will suffice.   We're happy to hear that it was nothing serious.   Thank you for stopping by and sharing that update with us.   We'll be back with the winning connections of the Breeders' Cup Marathon shortly.
