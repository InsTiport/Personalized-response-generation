  THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, before we get to the winning connections of today's Juvenile Fillies, we have with us again Dr.Wayne McIlwraith here from the American Association of Equine Practitioners.   He's one of the on‑call veterinarians and he'll give us an update on Secret Compass, Dr.McIlwraith.   What can you tell us about Secret Compass? 
DR. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   Thank you.   Secret Compass sustained a lateral condylar fracture with dislocation, which is an injury we can't bring them back from because when they dislocate on the track, they lose their blood supply, so she has been euthanized. 
THE MODERATOR:   This was a case where there was really nothing else that could be done? 
DR. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   No, because, as I said, because of the blood supply loss, the only‑‑ there is no other alternative.   So we certainly express our condolences to the connections of Secret Compass.   It is the worst type of injury we get, unfortunately. 
THE MODERATOR:   It certainly is.   Related to that, can you tell us, jockey John Velazquez, was he okay? 
DR. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   Yes, as I understand it, he's okay. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you for stopping by.   If anyone has further questions for Dr.McIlwraith, he'll be available down here in the press room.
