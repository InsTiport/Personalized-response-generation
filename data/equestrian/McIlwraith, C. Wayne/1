THE MODERATOR:   As we await the trophy presentation for the Distaff, Dr.McIlwraith has a quick update on Vicar's in Trouble.   
DR. WAYNE McILRAITH:     Thank you.   Vicar's in Trouble, as we discussed before in the Dirt Mile, had been taken off in the ambulance with an injury to the left forelimb.   It's now been confirmed with radiographs that he has an undisplaced fracture of the lateral condyle in the left front fetlock joint.
