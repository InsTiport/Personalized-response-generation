  THE MODERATOR:   Before we get to the winning connections of the race, we'll bring up Dr.Wayne McIlwraith once again, he's got an update on central intelligence from the Dirt Mile a couple races back.   Doctor, please tell us what you know about Centralinteligence? 
DR. WAYNE MCILWRAITH:   So, Centralinteligence was fanned off after the jockey got off after the race, and the problem is in the right front and radio graphs show a fracture of the lateral condyle of the distal cannon bone in the fit lock joint. 
THE MODERATOR:   All right, condyle fracture of Centralinteligence.
