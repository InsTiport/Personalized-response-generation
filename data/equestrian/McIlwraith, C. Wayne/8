   THE MODERATOR: We have Dr. McIlwraith, the on-call veterinarian for AAEP to give us an update on A.U. Miner, who pulled up in the Breeders' Cup marathon. 
 DR. MCILWRAITH: It was previously mentioned the clinical diagnosis was fractured sesamoid in the right front fetlock. That's been confirmed. The horse stayed in the ambulance and being transported to Lexington to the equine hospital. He'll be under observation for a couple of days, and then tentatively surgery will be performed on Monday or Tuesday. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any prognosis for an injury of that nature, Dr. McIlwraith? 
 DR. MCILWRAITH: Basically, you do the surgery to save their life. There can be a number of complications. It will be done by Dr. Larry Bramlage, who developed the technique fetlock arthrodesis for it. It's hard to give a diagnosis, but generally 60 percent to 70 percent of them do well. 
 THE MODERATOR: As always, we thank you for the reports.
