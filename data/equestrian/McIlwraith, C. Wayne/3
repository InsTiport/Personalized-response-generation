  THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, before we get to the winners of the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile, Dr.Wayne McIlwraith joins us from the AAEP Onâ€‘Call Program to give us an update on Vicar's in Trouble who pulled up. 
DR. McILWRAITH:   So the No. 3 horse, Vicar's in Trouble, the jockey got off the horse, he's being assessed.   The ambulance has come and is taking him back to the barn.   He was off on the left forelimb, but did not require any splinting, so it's a minor injury.   He'll be assessed by his attending veterinarian. 
If we get more information, we can report it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Dr.McIlwraith, for joining us.
