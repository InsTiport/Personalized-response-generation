   THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the auxiliary press center. Before we get started with the winner of the Breeders' Cup marathon, Afleet Again, we have with us Dr. Wayne McIlwraith. He's the on-call veterinarian for the American Association of Equine Practitioners. And Dr. McIlwraith has a report on a pair of horses in the race, I believe, A.U. Miner and Meeznah.   
 DR. MCILWRAITH: The Number 3 horse Meeznah was eased due to fatigue, but everything else looks fine.   
 A.U. Miner has sustained a clinical diagnosis, sustained bilateral sesamoid fractures in the left front fetlock joint. It's currently back being assessed and will be radiographed. We'll have more followup later.   
 THE MODERATOR: Any questions in the room for Dr. McIlwraith?   
 All right. Dr. McIlwraith, thank you very much.
