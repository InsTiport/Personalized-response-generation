DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  The radiographs show he's got a displaced lateral condylar fracture in the left front fetlock joint.   
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  It's not life-threatening but it does need surgery.  You know, it's -- because the fracture is displaced, it's got to be put together with screws and Dr. Steve Selway will be doing surgery on him probably tomorrow.   
 
Q.  So will this end Jump Start's career or is that still an open question? 
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  Still an open question based on how much damage we've got particularly with surgery.  Those type of fractures, quite a lot of them are, particularly when you consider the decision for what the horse can do with stud duty.  So it will depend on how much damage Dr. Selway encounters when he does surgery.   
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  Exogenous continues to do well.  You know, he's under surveillance, of course, and continues to get IV fluids, but is doing really well.
