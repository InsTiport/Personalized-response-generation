DR. C. WAYNE MCILWRAIT:  Thank you.  Yes, Ethan Man was taken off in the ambulance because the veterinarians at the ambulance noticed that he was off in his left front leg.  On examination he's got swelling in the suspensory ligament.  That's a relatively minor injury.  But the best thing was to take him back to the barn.

DR. McILWRAIT:  Again, good afternoon.  The jockey didn't feel comfortable with Tates Creek, and he got off.  And so he's been examined by the veterinary crew and no injuries have been found.  But they have taken him back in the ambulance for safety's sake.  But he has no palpable injury.  Just the jockey did not feel that he was okay.
