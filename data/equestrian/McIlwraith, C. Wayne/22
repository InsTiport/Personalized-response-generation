DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  Yes, Jump Start was pulled up and has a swollen left front fetlock joint and ankle, he was taken off in the ambulance for radiographs, so is currently getting x-rayed.   
 
Q.   Could you repeat the medical condition? 
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  He's got a swollen left front fetlock joint.  And so there's a good possibility of a fracture and so he's getting x-rayed back at the barn.   
 
Q.   Thank you.  
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  We need to wait for the results of the x-rays, but it would appear -- it would certainly not be life-threatening, but it could be depending on the degree of fracture.   
 
DR. C. WAYNE McILWRAITH:  Thank you.
