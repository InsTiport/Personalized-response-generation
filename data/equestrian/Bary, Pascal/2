MARIA MIARCHOS-GOUCE:  We were all stuck in an elevator.

MARIA MIARCHOS-GOUCE:  No, all our group, so we didn't see the race.  We still haven't seen the race, but we heard we won.

PASCAL BARY:  Before the race I think we have a very good number with No. 5, and just keeping behind her, and I'm not sure we can take any risk and --

THIERRY THULLIEZ:  I'm sure I speak very bad English.  I know is my horse like the race very spirited and today in her last turn ROCK OF GIBRALTAR very outside.  I have a good race in the last race.  I think he like finish in 200 meters and today very strong finish.

THIERRY THULLIEZ:  I think today the winner is the best.

PASCAL BARY:  We decided not to run the horse anymore this year, so the horse has been sold.  Even if he had not been sold he would not have been here coming in.

PASCAL BARY:  In our view it was 12 to 1.  He was the favorite in the past.


Q.  Pascal, this horse had talent right along.  What slowed down him so that he's a four-year old before he wins his first graded race?

PASCAL BARY:  Last year he won the regional in his group, and we took him to Rome to run in a group one, and this day it was very warm and he -- the horse needed a long time to recover and I think this year he's much more mature.

MARIA MIARCHOS-GOUCE:  Thank you very much. 

Q.  Any decision or thoughts on whether DOMEDRIVER will stay in training next year? 

ALAN COOPER: Not yet, but before the race we were definitely considering it.  Let's get home and make our plans.
