DR. LARRY BRAMLAGE:  Proud Citizen galloped out fine.  Mike Smith said he was a little uneven when he turned him to jog him back.  He's got a little swelling inside of his left front ankle, above the ankle.  There's not even any fluid in the ankle.  It could be he hit himself or there's something else going on.  They put him in the ambulance and took him back as a precaution without jogging him back.  It didn't look too serious right now.  Of course he'll have to wait for an examination and a diagnosis to see if it has any impact on his racing career.  
 
Q.  What kind of thing would cause that? 
 
DR. LARRY BRAMLAGE:  One of them would be if he hit himself.  Another would be stress fracture, something in the skin.  The kind of injuries that racehorses get and get treated all the time.  I could see him from the middle he was a quarter of a mile away.  He didn't look unstable.  The ambulance people didn't think he had any significant structural injury.  
 
Q.  Dr. Bramlage, when will he be x-rayed? 
 
DR. LARRY BRAMLAGE:  He'll be x-rayed now.  
 
Q.  We might know tonight? 
 
DR. LARRY BRAMLAGE:  Dr. Selway is on his way to look at him right now.  He's his attending veterinarian. Dr. Selway might be able to fill you in later.  
 
BOB CURRAN:  We'll start here.  Gary TKRAEUBG, who runs the partnership will start first, this is Richard gal pin will explain his role later.  Gary first of all. Congratulations and tell us how it feels to win the
