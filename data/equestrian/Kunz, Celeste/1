Q.  Dr. Celeste Kunz, works for the New York Racing Association here as the attending veterinarian on call.  Could you give us a status report? 
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  Basically the horse has a mild heat exhaustion.   
 
Q.  We're speaking of which horse?  
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  This is Unshaded.  He had mild heat exhaustion and the way we address this, we mechanically lower their body temperatures that's done with horses, ice water and alcohol.  Resolved very quickly, about five minutes he walked on his own back to his barn and we followed him with the horse ambulance because we had an unlimited supply of ice on it.  Everything was just fine.  
 
Q.  Where is the alcohol, internally or externally?  
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  Externally.  He received no medication at all.   
 
Q.  I didn't see after the race he was on his feet.  He just showed signs of distress? 
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  He showed signs of distress.  The jockey noticed it, pulled up immediately.  We have hoses down at that end.  We were able to take care of him right away.   
 
Q.  He never went down?
    
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  No.  Every horse that has heat exhaustion does something different.  Some look like they're kicking out a fly.  Some look like they're seizuring.  Some look wobbly.  It was excellent on the part of the jockey to recognize that and allow us to treat him as quickly as possible.   
 
Q.  Jockey Shane.  Any other questions on this topic?  Thank you very much Celeste for clearing that up for us. 
 
DR. CELESTE KUNZ:  Thank you.
