  THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations.   I guess when you came to New York, this is exactly what you had in mind is win the Travers, right?   
LUIS SAEZ:   Yeah, this is my third year here in New York, and I feel glad because this is my first year here, and a ride would be great, and a win would be great.   So I feel amazing.   
THE MODERATOR:   Take us through the race a little bit.   You're sitting mid pack, the pace a lot of people thought would be a little quicker up front.   Didn't turn out it was that quick.   What was your feeling going down the back side in terms of where you were and how the leaders were going?   
LUIS SAEZ:   Yeah, well, in the race when my agent told me I'm going to ride the horse and he told me Lukas gave me the opportunity and the owner, so I tried to work hard.   And looking where he ran the last time and other races, he seems like he was even stronger.   
THE MODERATOR:   The stretch drive, take us through that a little bit.   It looked like had you some horse under you.   But the leaders were going on pretty well there.   Then in the end it got really tight.   Take us through that last 1/8 of a mile.  
LUIS SAEZ:   Yeah, when I was going down the stretch, the horse he leaned a little bit, and then he came in and (Indiscernible) we were coming along forward and I could see how the horse was growing.  
THE MODERATOR:   When it came to the wire and you saw the finish, did you know you had won or were you not sure?   
LUIS SAEZ:   Yeah, (Indiscernible).  
THE MODERATOR:   Coming here, is this your first Group One race?   
LUIS SAEZ:   Yeah.
