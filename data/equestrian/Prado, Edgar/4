EDGAR PRADO:  Real win.  She was about a month off.  She handled the track well last time she run here.  When she come out of the gate, she come so fast out of the gate, I took advantage of that and try to get a good position, and after that I give her a little breathe in the backside.  Let her relax, and see what other horse is coming and see what happens when back again they were off again.

EDGAR PRADO:  Well, definitely have a nice trip, nice and clean and I was behind horse fighting for the lead.  I don't know if it was very comfortable.  Confident to hold down the horse that was coming very fast.

EDGAR PRADO:  I was pretty straight.  You can see in the replay.  You see the horse lift a little bit.

EDGAR PRADO:  Absolutely.

EDGAR PRADO:  Unfortunately, part of this game, you know, part of this game, I never thought that the horse something that could have happened to this horse.  He was training well and he was going very well to this race.  That's racing luck and it happened.  And I was very broken hearted.  The show had to keep going, had to ride more races coming up.

EDGAR PRADO:  I will put it behind right now.  Once I go home, I start thinking about it.  Definitely it's going to get more emotional.  A nice horse.  We win a race together.  Especially being a rider, I'm a horse lover.

EDGAR PRADO:  Well, I was looking forward to next year coming up, trying real hard to find the right horses and be able to ride in this year.  But I was lucky to get it done this year.

EDGAR PRADO:  No.  That's such good riders in Breeder's Cup.  They know where they are and what they're doing during the race.  They put like attention.  This horse something was wrong with the horse, everybody tried to get out of the way.

EDGAR PRADO:  Thank you very much.
