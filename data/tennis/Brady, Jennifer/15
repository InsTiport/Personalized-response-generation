3-6, 6-1, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?   
 Q.  Your serve was pretty untouchable after two games or so into the match. What were you feeling best about in that part of your game?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Yeah, I've been focusing a lot on my serve, working a lot on that, spending a lot of extra time out on the practice court. I think today I probably served, I would say, better than the past three matches that I played in the qualifying. So yeah, I was pretty happy to dominate on my serve, because towards the end there it definitely got me through and helped me in the match.   
 Q.  Talk through the match a little bit. Seemed like the intensity levels were pretty high for you like pretty early on, a lot of positive body language throughout the match. And then also, it just seemed like in that third set you were ready to run for another five hours if you needed to. Just talk about kind of like the work that you've done before the season to be as fit as you are right now.  
JENNIFER BRADY: Yeah, yeah, I would say throughout the whole match, I would say, I was just focusing on starting each point fresh, trying to just compete on every single point, leave it all out there, just try to win every point that I could. Yeah, I mean, really happy with my body language today. I thought it was pretty good. Like you said, I was showing a lot of good energy, intensity, and, yeah, I would say the clich√© quote, did a lot of hard work in the off-season. But, yeah, you know, I did, like everyone else, I'm sure. But, yeah, I felt -- I'll agree with you, I think I could go for another five hours. So yeah, really happy with my performance.   
 Q.  What was your pre-season like? Did you train in Germany with Michael and what was it like spending a pre-season in Europe?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Yeah, something very different. Usually I'm in Florida training, but just started working with Michael. Yeah, really enjoying that so far. About five weeks, I think, in Germany in the cold, indoors, so that was something very different for me, climate change, all that. And then coming here I got here about a week early, just to try to get used to the conditions. And I would say, I mean, just growing up in Florida pretty much my whole life, and I would say I don't think five weeks is really going to change something as far as --   
 Q.  The heat didn't knock it out of you?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Well, maybe like the first day, but after that I got pretty used to it.   
 Q.  What was it like just being -- most players when they get a chance to be near home they stay near home. But venturing out for what normally would be your hometown, did that feel like a sacrifice at all or how did you manage that?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Yeah, I would say so. But I went with my gut. I told myself I want to try something new, do something different, commit to it, and I did and I'm really happy I did. I really enjoyed my time there. Germany's a great place, so looking forward to going back.   
 Q.  Your next match you get Ash Barty, so two Grand Slam champs in a row right off the bat for your first main draw here. What are your thoughts on facing Ash?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Ash is a great player, great person, on and off the court. I've gotten to know her a little bit. But, yeah, she chopped me up a few times, so hopefully we can change that (laughing). But, yeah, I mean, as everyone knows, she's just a great player, sees the court so well, knows the ins and outs of everyone's game. So, yeah, I'm just going to go out there, compete my hardest and just leave it all out there.   
 Q.  Just the details of when you were in Germany for those five weeks. You stayed at an Airbnb? You had a hotel? How were you spending your time kind of in a new place, no friends, I presume in Regensburg?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Yeah, okay, okay.   
 Q.  I did my research. I Googled it. So what were your days like? What was it like? Was it lonely? Was it fun? Like, how was it?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Days were long. Long training days. Didn't really have much free time, except on Sundays, but everything is closed on Sundays. I found that out (laughing). So, yeah, not much to do on Sundays. But, yeah, I stayed in an apartment pretty much like an Airbnb. Yeah, definitely couldn't stay in a hotel for that long. I had a kitchen, was able to cook, little things like that. Yeah, I just -- when I was there I was only thinking positive things. I never really got distracted or talked myself out of anything, yeah.   
 Q.  And just going into this season, then, especially coming off of the 2019 you had, goals that you set for this year? What are you looking to kind of, what's the next step for Jen Brady?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Next step for Jen Brady? Honestly, I haven't really set any results goals, things like that. I think just taking each tournament as is and, yeah, just kind of figuring out myself a bit, figuring out my game, putting everything together, and then, then kind of seeing where I'm at and moving on and progressing from there.   
 Q.  How did you assess the match today? Maria's form, obviously, she's won a lot of great tournaments, she's been down a bit in the ranking, how did you see her game today overall?  
JENNIFER BRADY: Honestly, I thought she had a great performance. I think both of us played pretty well. I don't think she made very many errors as far as she didn't really miss any easy shots, maybe just the swing volley in the tiebreak at the first point. But still, I would say she served well, she was moving well. Yeah, I would say she's in good form right now. I played her a few years ago, but I don't really remember much. But, yeah, I would say overall she was, she definitely gave me a challenge.   
 Q.  You probably play Ash on the center court on Thursday with the ATP Cup over. Maria just said it feels like a secondhand tournament at the moment, this one, because you've sort of been shunted outside. What do you think?  
JENNIFER BRADY: I don't really like to get involved in those types of discussions. I just kind of just play and do my thing. I think it's cool what they're doing, the ATP Cup, something different. I don't know if I want to say we got shafted, but, yeah, I mean we get to play on center court on Thursday, so...
