 6-1, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through the match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 JENNIFER BRADY:   Yeah, today I think it was a little bit hotter than the previous days that I've been practicing and I think the conditions suited me pretty well.  I was able to start off pretty strong, was serving well and using the court, the balls, the speed of the court, the bounce, all of it to my advantage, yeah.
 Q. A lot of unusual things certainly coming into this Grand Slam tournament and I'm just wondering how you would say the whole situation, the longer than usual stay in a place before you start playing, the warm up tournaments last week, all of that, how would you say you came in to this Grand Slam compared to your usual entrance to a Grand Slam tournament?
 JENNIFER BRADY:   Yeah, I would say the preparation was definitely a little bit different.  Not something that is usual, the 14-day quarantine and then pretty much just playing a tournament at the site, up until the day that the Grand Slam starts.  So for me personally I think it was a little bit, it was nice to have that opportunity to play a tournament to get some matches under my belt before starting the Australian Open and also it was a little bit of a distraction mentally, just focusing on that tournament and not really focusing on the upcoming Grand Slam.  So I think I was able to use it to my advantage and hopefully I can keep it going.
 Q. One thing that we haven't seen before we saw it on a lot of courts at the US Open, but here every match on every court there's no line judges at all, no human element to those calls.  I'm just wondering what you think of that and is that something you would be in favor of seeing moving forward at all tournaments or do you prefer to have people you can disagree and argue with?
 JENNIFER BRADY:   Yeah, I would rather not argue with people.  I think the electronic line calling is good, it's great.  There's nobody to argue with.  If it's out, it's out.  If it's in, it's in.  So and, you know, humans are humans, everybody makes errors, so I think electronic line calling is great and, yeah, I'm a big fan of it.
