Q.  You competed well in the first few games, first four or five games, and then what happened after that? 
 
MEIKE BABEL:  Well, to be honest, I felt very tired.  I had two very tough matches in the last two days. She never gives you any free points.  She makes you run all over the court.  I just quit being aggressive enough to put some pressure on her.  She's just too good to let you go away with it. 
 

Q.  Did you feel like for a while you could hit her off the court or did you know you were going to tire eventually and that would be it?
 
MEIKE BABEL:  Since it's not my game anyway to outhit someone, I just thought to try to keep the ball in play.  As the rally continues, get a little more aggressive and try to finish it off at the net.  For that, you've got to be real tough.  I just wasn't today, I guess.  
 

Q.  How is it to play a player of Hingis' ability when you know you're tired?  Do you go out there thinking, "I have absolutely no chance"?
 
MEIKE BABEL:  Well, I mean, the good thing is you go into the match and you know that she doesn't hit you off the court.  You know, she's not that hard-hitting.  Still, it was a little frustrating to see it slip away from me.  I know I began pretty good.  That was okay. Overall, it was a good match, even though it was half a bagel in the second.
