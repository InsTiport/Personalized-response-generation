N. KYRGIOS/M. Cecchinato
7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. From an Australian perspective, we saw a Nick have a couple tense moments with the umpire towards the end of the first set.  As an opponent, what's that like to see your opponent reacting like that with an umpire?  How did you take that on?
MARCO CECCHINATO: For me he's very, very good guy.  I don't know what he said.  I don't care.  He play very good.  He has big serve and I like him.
