2-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. So there's a saying in English, It's better to have loved -- and there's something about loving and then losing, that it's better to have had a great experience and then to have a difficult one after that because it was all worth it.  Because at least you had the great experience of last year reaching the semis.  I know it's disappointing, but can you look back and reflect and now you have the confidence to know you are good enough to do this well at a tournament like this?
MARCO CECCHINATO: It was a bad day today.  I don't want to speak a lot today.  Is very, very tough on me after last year.  So I think it's bad day today.
