 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Are you a U.S. citizen? I know you're an Australian citizen.   
 CARSTEN BALL: Yeah, I'm dual citizenship. Father is full Australian, mom is American. Born in America, and then got my Australian passport when I was about 15.   
  
  Q. What do you take out of a match like that, albeit you lost?  
 CARSTEN BALL: The same I guess I took out of the last three weeks. Getting opportunities to play better players than I don't get to throughout the year.   
 I felt like I played pretty well. It feels like it just gives me more confidence to go out and play bigger matches and play Grand Slams.   
  
  Q. What was the difference between winning and losing in a match that tight?   
 CARSTEN BALL: Uhm, a few points here and there. You know, I got into the tiebreak, and then got off to a rough start in the second set. Then he just kind of I think got momentum with that.   
 Then had another close third. Got a break straightaway in the fourth. I think that gave him a bit of confidence. It was hard to stop him after that.  
  
  Q. Tell me what happened at 6-5 in the third set on your serve. You served, looked like an ace.   
 CARSTEN BALL: I don't know. They called it let, but there was a few let cords that I felt were lets, but you never know. They probably were.   
  
  Q. Where to from now? You've shown you can match it with a guy who is a form player on the tour. What happens now? Do you go back to the States and play?  
 CARSTEN BALL: Yeah, I go back and I'll play -- there's a challenger and a few ATPs. I'll be back down here the first week of March. Hopefully be on the Davis Cup team.   
  
  Q. Talk about your Davis Cup prospects. Gooch is injured. Do you see yourself in contention for the second singles spot, perhaps?   
 CARSTEN BALL: I hope so. I mean, I do my best to try and be able to play singles or doubles, wherever I'm needed. You know, I'd be happy just to be part of it.   
 I've been a part of the last two ties. We've done pretty well. We almost beat Chile. We beat Thailand. Hopefully I'll be a part of it and look forward to doing my best.  
  
  Q. Have you played much doubles with any of the other Aussies?  
 CARSTEN BALL: Not much. Not really. Just Guccione all throughout last year.  
  
  Q. How about here?   
 CARSTEN BALL: Stephen Huss.   
  
  Q. You've had conversations with Todd about coming back. Has he said you have a chance for that second slot?  
 CARSTEN BALL: I don't know about singles or anything, but I know I have a good chance to get on the team and get down here and play a match or two.   
  
  Q. Do you feel the Australian public are warming to you? Do you feel you get wholehearted support here?  
 CARSTEN BALL: Yeah, I feel like I'm getting more and more. I guess the last three weeks helps playing bigger matches I guess on TV.   
 But, you know, I know there's a lot of people behind me. I know Tennis Australia is behind me. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. What was your schooling in the United States?   
 CARSTEN BALL: Just regular independent study school. Graduated high school, and then started playing pro.   
  
  Q. Have you played Tomic?  
 CARSTEN BALL: I have not played Tomic, no. I would like to, but I haven't had a chance to play him. I know he's a good player. I've practiced with him a little bit in Davis Cup, but haven't had a chance to play him in a match.   
  
  Q. Is Syd teaching or what?   
 CARSTEN BALL: Yes.   
  
  Q. Whereabouts?  
 CARSTEN BALL: Back in Newport Beach.   
  
  Q. He was in the crowd, your dad.   
 CARSTEN BALL: Yeah. He's been here. He's been here all three weeks. Travels with me a few other weeks, US Open, some of the other tournaments around the States.   
  
  Q. Do you have brothers and sisters?  
 CARSTEN BALL: I got two brothers, one older and one younger.   
  
  Q. Are they players?   
 CARSTEN BALL: Older one stopped playing. Played a little bit. The little one's trying to play more and more.   
  
  Q. Is J.A. your godfather?  
 CARSTEN BALL: Is J.A.?   
  
  Q. Yes.   
 CARSTEN BALL: To be honest, I don't know. I'd be a little scared if he was.   
  
  Q. Someone told me he was.   
 CARSTEN BALL: No, he could be. Why not? I love JA, so...
