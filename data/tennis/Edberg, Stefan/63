 Q.   Stefan, can we have your general thoughts about the match
and how it went?  How you feel, like you said?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  To begin with, I got to a very bad start. Since
I was down Love-40.  From then on, I played well throughout the
match, played 3 good sets after that.  I thought.

 Q.   What did you say to yourself, because all of a sudden
you put it into overdrive and just--

 STEFAN EDBERG:  Yeah, I mean, when you get a start like that,
where you don't sort of feel that you are you are on the court,
you are not in the match and you wonder what is going on because
it shouldn't really happen, but it happens, so you have to say
to yourself, "You got to start from now."  That is what
I did and he I hit a lot of balls back.  He got a little tentative.
 From then on I felt in control of the match.

 Q.   What really turned it around?  Was it just that you were
able to hit more balls?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  No, I think I held my serve and I broke him,
and, you know, once you have 2 games in a row, you always feel
you have a chance, then he may have doublefaulted at 5-3 or something
and I knew he was a little bit shaky.  So I just tried to make
him play every point.  And it worked.

 Q.   What are your thoughts about playing the Davis Cup on
red clay indoors?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  Why not?  It is not as bad because you are playing
indoors, so it is not going to be playing like on clay outdoors.
 Playing on clay indoors it is not so bad.  It is medium quick,
so we will take it from there.  I have to worry about that when
I am finished here.
