Q.  Stefan, you seemed to have had a very  disappointing season so far.  Is there any explanation  for that?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: It hasn't been great:  I don't  know, I am just finding it a little bit tough at the  moment.  I played okay in the beginning of the year.  Okay, I didn't do very well at the Australian Open;  apart from that, I have been playing okay, but today  was not very good.  So it is the first clay court match  and always a little bit difficult the first one, but I  have to keep training and take the next tournament;  just keep working; that is the only thing that you can  do.   
 Ã  

Q.  Is there a particular reason why you left it  to Monte Carlo, to actually start tournaments on the  clay?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: I played quite a lot in the  beginning of the year, or I had a lot of tournaments  scheduled and I felt after working a lot; getting ready  for Australia, then I should have played Stuttgart;  then I got sick; then I played a lot in the states and  I played Davis Cup.  I felt that I needed a break.  You  got to start somewhere and I felt this was a good  tournament to start, but, you know, it is still many  weeks left.   
 Ã  

Q.  How were the conditions on the court, Stefan?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: It was very windy.  No, I mean, it wasn't too bad.  I mean, there is nothing wrong with the court or  anything.  The things were wrong with me probably;  obviously, it is a little bit slow today.  I felt okay  to begin with; then I just lost the rhythm and once you  lose the rhythm on the clay, it is very difficult, so  it wasn't easy, obviously.   
 Ã  

Q.  This is the first time you played against  Fabrice on clay, I guess?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Yes.   
 Ã  

Q.  What do you think about his game?  Is it very difficult to adjust to your own  game against his game.  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Well, when I played him a  couple of times before on hardcourts, then it is  obviously a different match.  But if you are not sharp,  if I don't play my game and don't attack the ball, he  is very difficult to play because he gives you  "nothing" balls and he is quick around the court and  he passes quite well if you don't put any pressure on  him.  And he can play well at times.  I mean, I have  seen him play many, many good matches; obviously, he  hasn't really got anything to hurt you.  He is just a  good counter-puncher, I would say.  He takes advantage  if you are not playing well.   
 Ã  

Q.  What is your clay court program now going to  be running to the French?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Well, the program as of now is  I am playing in Rome next time, but --   
 Ã  

Q.  How did that come about?  That is fairly unusual.  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: I have just decided because I  played a lot last couple of years on the clay and I  didn't really want to play that many tournaments on the  clay, but the options are always open.  There is Munich  next week, Hamburg, and there is always the choice that  you can -- if you feel like you are going to play, if  you don't, you stay home and practice.  So I just need  a day after here to just to see what I am going to do  because there is a chance that I will pick up another  tournament and play.   
 Ã  

Q.  Are you playing Dusseldorf?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Yes.   
 Ã  

Q.  Stefan, do you feel you work as hard by  yourself than when you used to?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Yeah, I have been working the  last couple of weeks and I have been feeling quite good  and -- but everybody knows that playing tennis is one  thing -- practicing is one thing and another thing is  playing a match.  I am spending the time that I need to  do and, you know, obviously, I would have hoped to play  a lot better than I did today because I have been  playing quite, quite well in practice, but today was  just a very awful day.  So just have to keep training  and -- because the tennis can come back very, very  quickly and I know that.   
 Ã  

Q.  What do you feel is missing from your game at  the moment?  
 
STEFAN EDBERG: Today, everything.  Apart from that, it is just -- I mean, it is  not much.  It just needs to be a little bit quicker and  play a few more matches because it will come back  quickly once you start getting the rhythm back then I  will be fine, but it is always a little bit tricky on  the clay because if you don't hit the ball well and you  are not quite sure what you do, then it is a tough game  out there
