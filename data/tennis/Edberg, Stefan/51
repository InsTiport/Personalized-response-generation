START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT








Q.  How do you like 1993, what would you say  about (inaudible) --  

STEFAN EDBERG:  1993?  


Q.  Yes.  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Like I have said before, it hasn't been a  great year for me.  Obviously I am comparing it to the  years in 1991, 92 which were fabulous years and this  year, I have been in a Grand Slam final.  I have won  only one tournament and it still has been pretty  consistent because I am still on the top in the world  so things are not that bad.  It could have been  better.  


Q.  What do you have to do for your ranking to  change your position?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I am hoping to put my game together at the  end of this year.  I did play very well in Paris.  I  have been hitting the ball well last week.  This week I  am actually playing good tennis now.  It is just a  matter of continuing to work and do the things that I  have done before and I think I could have a good year  next year.  I feel pretty relaxed about things now, and  this year is sort of behind me now, soon after this  week, and so I have nothing to worry about.  I am on  the tour ten years and I am actually going to try to  enjoy next year more than I have enjoyed this year,  because it has been tough just realizing that you have  been slipping a little bit.  So next year I can go out  and feel a little bit more like an underdog, that  sometimes is better.  


Q.  The thing that (inaudible) --  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Major inspiration.  I am looking forward to  it.  


Q.  This week, does it take anything away  (inaudible)--  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Not for me.  It is good in a way because he  deserves to be No. 1.  There is no doubt about that, so  may as well-- to me, it is still a good event.  You  have got 8 great players.  To win it is a great thing  which for me-- I like coming to this event.  I can get  to No. 4 if I have a good week, so it is something  which I am looking forward to.  Try to get up to No.  4.  So --  


Q.  French Open title (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  It is not a nightmare.  I can't look at it in  that way at all.  I have had a great chance of winning  it.  I still give myself two more chances to  realistically have a chance to win it.  It is not  impossible.  It is very difficult but not impossible.  Something for me to motivate myself, something to train  for and I think at this stage in my career, I need to  have the things to try to do well.  That is one of the  things.  Basically have a chance to win.  It is not  impossible.  It is very difficult.  Might as well  (inaudible) something for me to motivate myself.  Something to train for and I think at this stage of my  career I need to have things (inaudible) try to do  well, compete for (inaudible) that is one of the things  I work to--(inaudible).  


Q.  How many times after Wimbledon -- (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't think I have changed that much.  I  have changed a little.  It is not for me to tell.  I am  just a very happy person; that is all I can say.  That  is what really is important to me.  I mean, --  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)--  

STEFAN EDBERG:  The favorite year?  


Q.  (inaudible).  You won the title --  Who do you like besides--  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Best chances here?  


Q.  Yes.  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I think there are a couple of names that I  think can do well.  Obviously Pete.  Michael Stich, he  has been playing very well in Germany this year, the  home crowd, he has a chance (inaudible).  Ivanisevic  has been playing very well recently.  So that is three  names which I am looking -- they will do well here.  It  doesn't mean anyone else can win it.  They still have  chances.  


Q.  Have you made up your schedule for --  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I will play doubles and probably the same way  I have been playing this year (inaudible).  I really  enjoyed playing doubles this year for the first time in  a long time.  So I will play doubles next year as  well.  Not every where, but -- I will play with Korda,  I think.  We have had some good results together and he  is good to play with.  


Q.  Would you know any reasons why (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  No, I think it is always comes to the stage  in life I mean, he is not going to come (inaudible)  sooner or later -- maybe if he is like losing.  I can  understand it.  He has been -- to have a week off doing  something totally different.  


Q.  Do you think he has -- (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't know what he is.  I have no idea what  he is doing.  He will still be around.  


Q.  Are you going to move to your house in the  south of France?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  You have been hearing wrong things.  That is  all I can tell you.  There is a lot of rumors, but it  is not true.  I do spend sometime down there.  I still  live in -- (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  When I will win it?  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't know any better than you.  I always  have a good chance of doing well at Wimbledon, playing  on the grass.  It could be next year.  It could be the  year after, who knows.  It is something -- it is  special to play Wimbledon.  


Q.  Very much between the two -- sometimes when  you finish with tennis, you will be playing golf --  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Yes.  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  No, I know I am the oldest one here.  It is a  good sign.  I am still hanging in there.  I don't know,  maybe my ninth year in the Masters of the ATP Finals  which is -- (inaudible) I don't feel like -- I just  feel that I am part of the eight players here.  That is  the way I look at it.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  No, from my standard, no looking back the  last couple of years, it hasn't been a great year.  It  hasn't been a bad year.  It could have been a lot  better than it has been.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  It is just that I haven't played well  enough.  I haven't played as well as I did the last  three previous years.  But I guess it is going to come  sooner or later.  You have three great years like I  have-- you are going to have a setback sooner or  later.  It happened this year.  It could have happened  last year.  There comes a time when things start to be  a little bit tougher and it has been a little bit  tougher this year.  I am still looking forward to next  year.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  (inaudible)  


Q.  Motivation after ten years (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  It doesn't get easier, but I still have a lot  of motivation to go out and work everyday.  I still  have a little bit left to do.  At the moment it is  really not a problem.  It is tough every week to really  get up and really, you know, want to be 100%.  


Q.  Are you still working so hard like, let us  say, ten years ago?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I am probably working harder now, which you  have to do in order -- if I worked the same like ten  years ago, it is impossible.  In order to stay at the  top, you have to work just a little bit harder each  year in order to stay physically fit because you don't  recover as quickly as you did when you were 17 or 18.  Plus you cannot work as hard like you do today ten  years ago because your body is not ready for it.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  It is a tough question.  The other one --  looking at things (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Pete Sampras is always tough to beat.  Bruguera had a great year.  He is probably not as good  as an indoor player, as he is playing outdoors, but  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Pete Sampras is the best player in the world,  (inaudible), he has got a very, very strong serve.  It  is the same thing with Ivanisevic, he has got probably  the greatest serve, (inaudible).  Bruguera is more a  player -- (inaudible).  You are going to get into a few  rallies at least.  He is a very, very good  counter-puncher and (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Everybody keeps asking why.  It comes a time  where things get a little bit tougher because you  cannot stay at (inaudible) rest of your life.  This has  been the year that it, for what reasons (inaudible),  maybe it is just nature, but at the same time, it gives  my more motivation to play next year and try to --  (inaudible).  It will be nice to start the new year.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I am doing my best.  I wish -- (inaudible).  At the moment I am hitting the ball well and I have  been -- (inaudible).  I play as well as I did in Paris,  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't know, it is -- well, I have been  around for a long time.  (inaudible).  This is good  opportunity -- Frankfurt is -- it gets a lot of  peoples' attention, (inaudible).  It is a good  opportunity (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I have had a lot of sponsors throughout the  years, (inaudible), you have to give something back to  the sponsors.  (inaudible) like to do things --  (inaudible).  I don't know, it -- (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  It helps.  It helps.  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't remember something about --  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't mind (inaudible).  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I think tennis has done very well the last  couple of years.  Always going to have people  (inaudible).  At the same time you have more rules  today that is preventing you to say things so you  really must --  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  The way I have looked at it, I would like to  be the best tennis player in the world that I can be.  I don't mind being -- I don't consider myself being a  big (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I think it is a good combination because golf  gets you outside in the fresh air, you go and see  (inaudible) trees.  Don't really affect your tennis  like if you were playing something like --  


Q.  Stefan, is it more difficult for you to play  tennis well when you are a father and husband?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  No.  I still can play good tennis.  I mean,  it is hard to explain.  I am really happy at the  moment.  That is really what is important to me and I  am playing good tennis, I think, as of now.  It has  been a little bit of a tough year.  There has been some  changes in my life; having the baby changes the way you  look at things, but I think it is really good.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Goran, he is a great talent.  He is a very  good player.  He has probably the best serve in the  game and there is only one thing that is important that  is winning a Grand Slam.  That is what he needs to do.  He has really become a great player.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I think he is in the right direction what he  is doing now.  He had a great year last year.  He lost  track of things a little bit but now he is playing good  tennis again.  (inaudible).  Hasn't been the best year.  It hasn't been a  bad year.  I am still No. 5 in the world.  That is not  so bad.  It could have been better.  I still have  motivation to go out there and work.  (inaudible) they  bring tennis to a new level.  Hitting the ball very  hard.  They are always going to try to improve things  and the competition is as hard as it has always been.  So tennis is progressing.  


Q.  How was your performance, Stefan, (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  My form is good at the moment.  I started to  see signs in Stockholm-- actually I played some good  tennis against Michael, but I did lose, I played --I  played well in Paris last week.  I have been hitting  the ball well this week and I am still hitting the ball  well, so I would say my form is good as of today.  


Q.  Who do you think-- who else do you think is  this time last year you said (inaudible) really anybody  catches your eye?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I would name three players.  


Q.  What is the (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Well, it is mostly what has happened this  year and is the question I get asked most because it  hasn't been a great year this year.  I think it is  coming back.  I think I have pretty good chance of beating  him indoors.  


Q.  Do you get the sense as we do that without  Boris here (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I mean, it always comes a time when McEnroe  wasn't here a couple of years and Lendl wasn't here.  Obviously, Boris has been one of the biggest stars in  the game I have seen quite sometime (inaudible).  Obviously it is a pity he isn't here because -- I think  he has been great for the game of tennis and he is  obviously a great inspiration for people here in  Germany who come and watch him play.  But (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Not the way he has been playing this year.  He hasn't really produced that much, maybe three  tournaments.  Maybe he hasn't been able to focus as much  this year like in the past.  I can't really say why  (inaudible)  that is one of the things that you -- that  is the same with everybody, if you are not fit enough  you just (inaudible)that extra yard slower.  That makes  the difference.  That makes the difference.  


Q.  I mean you also (inaudible), do you think he  knows now how much his life is going to change?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't think anybody knows how much it is  going to change their life.  Some people, it changes a  lot.  Some people it doesn't change at all.  (inaudible).  Things are going to be different.  That  is for sure.  We have spoken in between the two of us  obviously we have got something in common, and  something to talk about.  


Q.  Life is (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I feel great.  Happened to me, something that  I wanted to happen, just -- I think this has been a  good year (inaudible) for me.  It has been  (inaudible).  It hasn't been great this year.  Everybody knows that.  Everybody is asking the question  why and I think looking at things realistically  (inaudible), in 1991, 92 No. 1, two years No. 2 sooner  or later you are going to have a let-down.  It did  happen this year, but it could have happened next year  as well.  It did happen this year, the way I look at it  now it is next year, it is going to be pretty  interesting.  I am looking forward to next year and it  is something to look forward to have a better year than  this.  For me things are not really terribly  (inaudible) haven't been playing very well this year.  I have been playing well at times.  You see the  difference for me has been couple of inches here,  couple of doublefaults there.  It doesn't take much to  get -- (inaudible)  I am still 27.  I am physically  fit.  Closest fit as they are -- (inaudible).  That is  the most important thing and I have been around and I  know how to play the game.  So it is not (inaudible) I  am possible target.  


Q.  Would you agree that Pete (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  The best player today, yes.  


Q.  Has been the last six months --  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Definitely.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  (inaudible) is definitely the best player as  of today he is very -- 2 Slams winning 6 other  tournaments, there is no question he is No. 1 this  year.  He claimed the No. 1 spot last week.  I think  that is rely good because I wouldn't want to see any  changes at the last minute being -- (inaudible).  


Q.  It doesn't really seem to be any reason why  (inaudible) he seems to be fairly motivated?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Yeah.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  He is.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  He could-- well, I am sure he is going to  have -- keeps his motivation, he could definitely have  another 2, 3 unbelievable years.  He has done it one  year now.  It is going to be tough next year.  Because  he is going to have excellent -- (inaudible)  expectations on himself.  Other people are going to  expect him (inaudible) he is going to be (inaudible) I  think mentally he is strong enough to have (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  That has been his (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I think he is a little bit in the same  situation.  (inaudible).  It is going to be really,  really tough for (inaudible).  


Q.  Why is that?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Because the way he plays.  He is not going to  get that many cheap points on the clay.  He still can  serve very well.  He is going to have to work a lot  harder for the points.  It is a two week tournament and  --  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  He needs to have a good -- I nearly did it in  eight (inaudible) and I wasn't --  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Pretty much the same, I would say.  It is  still-- it is still a great event to come here and win  it because it is very difficult.  I say the only  objection I have to it is if you look at the last  three, four years, all the champions (inaudible) that  is the problem what you have with a round robin.  It is  almost better to lose a match in the round robin  because there is a better chance to win it because it  is really, really tough to win five matches in a row  here.  That is I think -- (inaudible) what happened the  last four years now.  


Q.  Which one do you plan to lose?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  (inaudible) at the same time with a round  robin you have a system where you can lose, you still  have a chance to win.  You can look at it both ways.  


Q.  (inaudible).  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Psychologist, I think it does help some  people.  (inaudible).  I have never seen one.  I don't  think I really need to see one.  I haven't thought  about it too much.  I know some people gain something.  


Q.  (inaudible) do you (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  You can take a couple of months off maybe  two, three months off.  


Q.  Obviously.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  When he comes to win (inaudible) coming from  Germany which (inaudible) can't really do anything  without getting (inaudible) that is pretty tough.  But  I think Boris, he needs to get back to work.  Maybe he  is lacking a little bit on (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible) last year at the Masters a lot of  the top players complained about the ranking system.  This year we don't hear anything about it.  Is it  because the ranking has changed or because you have  changed your mind?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  There are some things under progress, maybe  that is why.  Like I said, you can never find a perfect  system.  You can find a system which is better than  others.  It has worked out pretty well.  You just have  to play with the system in place.  I think that is what  you have to play.  


Q.  (inaudible) very much your activity your  coach, I mean (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I don't know.  I can speak for myself.  I  mean, (inaudible) it is tough -- at the same time for  me, it is an inspiration and depends which way you  handle it too.  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  If you think it is important, it is going to  be a problem.  If you don't think it is important, it  is not going to be important because (inaudible)  definitely don't make a big issue out of that.  Some  people make a -- (inaudible).  I mean, it is something  perfectly natural to happen.  


Q.  About this year, I know (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Not very disappointed, but I am disappointed  because I am comparing with 1991, 92 which is in three  great years, therefore, this year hasn't been  (inaudible)  I was still in the Grand Slam final this  year.  I have only won one tournament, but I have been  pretty consistent.  I have played some good tennis  throughout the year.  It has been one of those tough  years to handle mentally, I think because things  haven't really gone my way this year.  I wouldn't say  unlucky, but miss a volley here, miss a volley there,  couple doublefaults.  That has made a difference.  Like  I said, (inaudible) timing and confidence.  My game  really depends on how I serve.  If I serve well, I play  well.  If I couldn't serve too well, (inaudible).  It  is tough to play guys like Sampras, Ivanisevic because  if he is serving badly (inaudible)--  


Q.  What do you think about the ranking system,  the points and so on, your opinion (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Like I said, you can never find a perfect  system.  You just have to play with the current  system.  There is going to be a few questions here and  there, and there are a few things in progress.  There  could be some changes (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible) that you can suggest --  

STEFAN EDBERG:  We all made suggestions something could  happen very soon (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  Yeah, like I said, it could be better.  (inaudible).  


Q.  What do you think the best thing you could  consider for the best four tournaments, the best  (inaudible) best four -- (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  That would be the perfect scenario, but it is  very difficult because you only got three, four  grasscourt tournaments a year.  (inaudible).  Obviously  that would be a perfect scenario, but it would be too  complicated to put together.  That would obviously be  the best thing.  If maybe you could have a ranking for  -- (inaudible) could have a raking for each surface.  The public does want ranking here, does not want  ranking there (inaudible) it is just not going to  work.  (inaudible).  You just look at the boxing  (inaudible) tennis is an international sport.  You have  got one ranking.  


Q.  The ranking is an (inaudible) --  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I mean, I would think it would.  


Q.  Is it  hard to (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  That is going to happen.  Like I said, you  can play.  It is not really (inaudible).  If you could  come up with the perfect system, you don't need  (inaudible).  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  You definitely got a point.  You can do  whatever you want (inaudible) that is-- I think it is a  very good idea putting it together at least in--  


Q.  (inaudible)  

STEFAN EDBERG:  I give you credit for that.  


Q.  (inaudible)?  

STEFAN EDBERG:  He has had a great year.  He proved he could  win a Grand Slam this year by winning the French Open.  I think he is-- like I said, he has had a great year.  I think about tomorrow's match.  I probably will have  a benefit playing indoors because he has most of his --  clay court (inaudible) does play quite well indoors as  well.  I don't expect anything easy tomorrow.  I think  it may be a tough match.
