 Q.   Stefan, was it as easy as it looked?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  It was okay.  I thought I -- I played okay today.
 I didn't play great, but it was good enough to beat him, so I
am quite happy.  At least I am through the third round now.  But
I am feeling pretty good out there. I play well when I have to.
 We played each other, many, many times, so --

 Q.   How would you compare the way you are playing now to
the same time last year?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  Well, I think I played better the first week
than I did last year.  That is for sure.  And I just need to keep
the momentum going now, because I am hitting the ball well.  I
am feeling good.  It is going to take one match at time.

 Q.   Next match is against Krajicek?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  That is a tough one and he is always going to
be a dangerous player with the serve he has, but I am kind of
looking forward to that one.  I know it is going to be tough,
but I am still looking forward to it.

 Q.   What makes the serve so dangerous?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  Well, he hits it as hard as anybody.  He is quite
a talented player.  You know, when he is on, he is good.  When
he is not, that is a different thing.

 Q.   Did you enjoy your stay in New York City?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  I haven't really been in New York City, but I
have been on Long Island.  That, I enjoy, yes.

 Q.   As much as-- I mean, last year you said that for the
first time you found it a quiet  place and all that stuff.  It
was all okay for you this year?

 STEFAN EDBERG:  This year it is fine too.  I am happy with the
things I am doing.  I am playing pretty good tennis.  I am happy
when I am doing things outside of the court.  That is important
too.

 Q.   Any other English?
