Q. Well done on a second singles win. Could you just analyze your performance, please.
GO SOEDA: Today, it's not so great because he was playing good. Also I was super tight because I need to win the, especially No. 2 singles, so I was really tight. But from the second set I just tried to focus, just focus the point, so. I mean, it's very good. It's that the changing of the game, that point, yeah.
Q. How difficult is it to play against a player that's ranked 670 in the world. You might not have a tremendous amount of information on him, and how difficult is it to prepare? Does that make you even more nervous and anxious?
GO SOEDA: Yeah, because he was, I don't know, he was not introduced and I have no idea how he's playing. I just watched a YouTube, like, against Spain. I just watched just two matches. So I didn't know him and how he played, so it's really tough to play him. But he has a huge forehand. He's really tough. For me, it's so tough to play him.
Q. It looked as if in the second set you extended out the rallies more, I think, in the first set. He won the majority of the points under four shots. Was that something that you sort of adopted, the longer rallies, and sort of staying in the point more?
GO SOEDA: Yeah. The last of the first set I tried to be too aggressive and then I was making many unforced errors. So in the second set I tried to be very thorough and then the game changed.
Q. Do you think after two matches you're building confidence or will you remain nervous?
GO SOEDA: Yeah, especially these two matches, it's nervous because I played against lower ranking. Next match I have no pressure, so I can do more.
