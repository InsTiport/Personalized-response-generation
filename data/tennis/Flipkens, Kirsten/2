 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Yeah, I was feeling actually pretty good on the court.  I was, I think, yeah, we both had a good start of the match and I was able to get a lead up to 4-3 and then, yeah, that service game I should have held, but, yeah, I think Venus was on a roll as well, she played well.
 I think once you give her an opportunity, she's taking it and from there on after she took the first set she was on a roll a little more.  But after all the circumstances that I've been through the last couple of weeks with my injury, I cannot expect to bring out may best level, but, yeah, Venus played a good match in general, so...
