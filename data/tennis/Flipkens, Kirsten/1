D. KASATKINA/K. Flipkens
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Daria just said that she never had a situation like this where the court is flooded because nobody knew that we were going on the fifth.  It can actually spoil your practice.  How did you deal with that?
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS: It would take me 15 minutes to change the court.  I don't understand that the referee didn't check the court.  Because, of course, it was impossible to play.  Then I heard that it was normally free until tomorrow.  This is why they put a bit more water.
But I never had a situation where it was flooded.  Daria also asked me if something like that had ever happened to me.  I said, no, even in a small tournament.
Same thing for both of us, but it's not easy.  Because you practice for half an hour, and then you have to wait 15 minutes, 20 minutes to change court.  And the same thing for both of us, but still it's not easy.
Q. On the match itself, do you have some regrets or she played too well?  How do you analyze this?
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS: I thought it started with four breaks.  It was a bit strange, I think.
I had the feeling that I didn't serve badly at first.  Until 3-2, I was still in command and then I missed.  I had, then, an unforced error.  I don't understand the situation.
I have to seize opportunities when they arise, especially when you're among the top 14.  And I shouldn't drop anything, and I did drop.  It's then not easy to start again and go back into your game and in your set, even 5-3, 40-Love.
It can frustrating.
