 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. that was a tough match today, can you talk us through how it unfolded for you?
 KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Well we lose in three sets and I had the feeling we had to win the match in three sets.  So we should have won basically all three sets, I think.  It was really up to me today, I let my partner down and I feel shit about it.  So, but, yeah, that's tennis.
