 Q.  Well, what do you have to say about that performance?
 Where does that rank for you?

 TODD WOODBRIDGE:  Well, it is really up there because I have
been working hard on my singles game and, you know, I think that
is the best tennis in singles I played in maybe three years since
before I had my arm injury.  I played confident.  I used my forehand
as a weapon and moved the ball around well and I served better
than I used to serve back then.  So it is really up there.  I
am really pleased because it got me sort of -- I haven't beaten
one of those top guys for quite awhile, so it has given me a lot
of confidence.

 Q.  This is the best year --

 TODD WOODBRIDGE:  I still see myself at the moment, I am really
trying to get my singles back to where I played a few years ago
and further, and I don't expect it to happen or I haven't expected
it to happen overnight, and I think this is just one of those
small steps to help me keep going back up the ladder.  This time
last year I think I had lost 11 first rounds in a row so it is
really going to give me a big boost in my ranking; as I said,
performancewise, it is the best I have played for a long time.


 Q.  Todd, your forehand has always been your best shot, but
it was really on the ball tonight?

 TODD WOODBRIDGE:  Yeah, I don't know what my winners and errors
were, but my winners stat must have been pretty good.  In the
tiebreaker I think I hit about 4 clean winners and just -- I timed
it well and I didn't try and overdo it.  I just decided where
I was going to put it, and it worked well.  Probably playing Gilbert
yesterday made me hit a quite a few balls; no pace and got my
timing done really well.

 Q.  Came up with some gutsy shot on the Ad court?

 TODD WOODBRIDGE:  I figured that if I had just put it back into
play he is going to be aggressive at me and make me have to miss
his shot and I didn't want to have to do that.  I didn't want
him to come to net at me.  He had a little trouble with his serve
all night.  I thought, well, let us give it a go.

 Q.  Todd, it is still early days in the tournament, but the
Australian guys have really put in some very, very good performances.
 Have you been able to feed off that, those other results?

 TODD WOODBRIDGE:  Yeah, I think so.  I have been feeding off
them for a while just being able to hang on last twelve months
or 18 months, and, you know, I can sort of feel good about myself
being in amongst them again.  I really felt like I was, you know,
watching them for a while,  so it is nice to be playing amongst
them again.  ^.

it well and I didn't try and over do it.  I just decided where
I was going to put it, and it worked well.  I probably playing
Gilbert yesterday made me hit a quite a few balls no pace an got
my type minutes done really well.

 Q.  Came up with gut tea shot?
