Q.  How do you feel?

FREDRIK JONSSON:  Very good.

Q.  Was this the beginning of something new in your career?

FREDRIK JONSSON:  I think so, yeah.  I played him before, a close match, struggled a little bit, lost a few first round.  Then I won a couple of matches.  Get more and more confidence.

Q.  As far as I remember, it was close, 2-4-set matches.  Do you feel tired a bit or exhausted?

FREDRIK JONSSON:  Of course you feel a little bit tired.  I mean, when you're winning, you feel happy.  You don't feel your body.  I can tell you, I was cramping a little bit in the fourth.  I play okay.  I serve very well today. 

Q.  It's the biggest win so far in your career?

FREDRIK JONSSON:  Yeah, it is.

Q.  Is there something wrong with your leg?

FREDRIK JONSSON:  No, no, nothing.  It's not something bad, it's just cramping
