N. DJOKOVIC/D. Shapovalov
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. What did you find the most frustrating out there today?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Definitely trying to return his serve today. I think he was serving really well. Pretty sure he hit, like, 103 first serve percentage in the first set.
So no, I mean, big credit to him. He played an amazing match and had a great week. I wish him the best of luck for London.
Q. What do you think make his serve to difficult to return?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: He just places it well. It's tough to read. He changes it up, has a good variety. He was really picking his spots today, so I had maybe one chance, but it was tough.
I mean, he played solid.
Q. Did you change anything technically against when you played him in Shanghai a couple of weeks ago?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, I mean, it's just different conditions, so it was a different match. I felt like in Shanghai the courts were a lot slower. So there was more rallies today. It was about serving a bit more.
And, honestly, it was tough for me to kind of find a groove just because he was really, really picking his spots on the serve.
Q. Do you have any nerves before the match?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: No, I was excited. Yeah.
Q. Did you have some emotion to play? Because in the beginning you were, like, a little nervous.
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: No. I was excited, really excited, to play the match. Yeah, a little bit of a bad start. But, no, I don't think it was any nerves. I mean, I just think it was just a bit of a slow start, couple misses here and there.
But, no. Honestly, before the match, I was really eager to get out on the court.
Q. The season is over for you now. It was a season with a lot of ups and downs. It was great at the beginning and after that you struggled a bit and then again it was good, especially since you appoint Youzhny as a coach. Can you talk about what you go through this year?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, I mean, it's a sport. There's going to be ups and downs. And it's not going to be finals of a Masters every week. So it's normal to have some dips and rises. You know, I'm still learning about my game, too, improving every day.
And I think the most important thing was, yeah, when I was struggling a little bit, I didn't get discouraged. I just kept working hard. I knew things would come.
And I truly believe in myself and my team. So it's huge credits to them, not only me, for these last couple of weeks.
Q. When you have someone like Novak saying on court great things are ahead of you and you are going to have a great career, does that resonate with you? Is that something you don't want to think about? What does that mean for you?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Of course it's great to hear that, but I still have a long way to go. I mean, of course it's an unbelievable week for me, but it doesn't stop here. It's back to the court, back to practicing.
And I want to be beating guys like, Novak so I have to improve, get better, find a way to return better against his serve.
And hopefully I can do even better next year.
