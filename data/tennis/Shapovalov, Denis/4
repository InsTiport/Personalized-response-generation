R. CARBALLES BAENA/D. Shapovalov
7-5, 6-7, 6-3, 3-6, 8-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Tough one out there today.  Wondering where you think things got away from you today and what, if anything, was giving you trouble toward the end of that fifth set.
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   Honestly I feel like the conditions were as tough as possible for me to play against here, with the balls being just so heavy and it being really cold.  I mean, I play an aggressive game, I like to step in, and I mean he just had so much time.  So it was very difficult.
I'm really happy that I was able to bring myself to a winning position, and then in the end it's just a little bit unlucky.  He misses a return one inch out and it's 40-15, it's a completely different story.  So just a little bit of luck at the end.
I think I did everything, everything right, just didn't go my way today.
Q. How much was his defense, I don't know if "frustrating" is the right word or just difficult for you, given your style and as you say, the heaviness out there, how much of that presented difficulties for you in needing to hit a lot of extra shots?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   Yeah, it's difficult.  It's one thing to play on clay, but it was a completely different story when I was playing in Rome and I could actually, I hit big, I can actually hit winners.  Here it's just like the ball's not going anywhere.
So it's just, it's just annoying that, you know, you have to be in that situation because it's just, in my opinion, it shouldn't be that heavy and that difficult.
Q. Since I couldn't see the last points because I was doing other interviews, can you tell me which was the best chance you had to win this match.  When was the score so that you could win it?  I mean, when was the moment that changed and what was the key?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   I mean, I was up 5-4 at 30-Love, so that's probably it.
I don't know, there wasn't any key moments that changed, it's just played a bit unlucky.  I had a couple 30-Alls and it just didn't go my way.
So I think in the end it just wasn't meant to be.  But, yeah, that's tennis.  I don't think anything happened that completely changed the momentum.  It was just unlucky.
Q. When you look at this past month, two Grand Slams, you get into the top-10 for the first time in your career, how will you learn and grow from these experiences going forward?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   I think I'm playing some good tennis, so I just want to keep that up.  Yeah, I mean I'm happy again that I was in the position to win today and won my first round, because these conditions were completely stacked against me.  Yeah, it just wasn't great.
So I'm happy with the tennis I'm playing, I'm not going to let this tournament affect me and I'm just going to keep going.  I mean, I injured my hamstring a little bit so hopefully it's not something too serious.  We're playing in freezing conditions so it's bound to happen that players are going to get hurt.  So it's a bit frustrating, but there's really nothing we can do.
Q. I think you came to the net over a hundred times today and I notice that had you serve/volleyed on the last couple of points of the match.  Just wondering what was the thinking behind that strategy today?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   I mean, it's impossible to hit a winner with these balls, so I figured I might as well come to the net because I'm just not going to sit there and play a 10-hour match.  Yeah, that's, honestly, why I was coming in, there was just no point to stay from the back.
Q. I think you said earlier in the tournament that you didn't want to talk about the French Open bubble compared to the US Open bubble until the end of the tournament.  Just wondering on your thoughts on that now whether you could explain the differences and which one you preferred?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   Yeah, honestly I think they're not doing a good job.  There's really no bubble, especially in the second hotel, I heard.
Scheduling is absolutely awful.  I mean, after a five-hour match I have to play doubles now.  It's just like, it's just complete trash scheduling.  It's disappointing.  I mean you're in a Grand Slam and I don't want to sound spoiled, you know, but you expect at least some help from the tournament to help you compete.  I mean, how am I supposed to come out and play doubles now after a five-hour match?  It's a first round as well, they could have scheduled it way better, way easier, I mean it's not acceptable.
And the bubble as well.  I mean, it's just, there is no bubble, you know.  You can leave the hotel, you can go to the city, there's no problem, there's nobody stopping you, so it's, New York was done way better.
