D. THIEM/D. Shapovalov   
6-4, 3-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Do you feel like that was one that got away from you today?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, it was a good match.  I think we were both playing well.  I definitely had a lot of chances to win the first set.   
Yeah, definitely the better player in the first set, no questions about that.  He did a good job of holding, serving big when he had to.  Didn't take my chances.  Then he played a good game to break me.   
Second set, good kind of change-up.  I think we both picked up our game, raised the level.  Third set was also very good.  He really started serving a lot better in the second and third.  Yeah, he managed to play pretty clean in the last set.   
It's a tough one.  But just going to take this...  I think it was a great match for me confidence-wise.  I showed myself that my level's there, that I'm able to compete against a player like this and have chances to beat him.   
It's nothing bad from this match.  It's only positives that I can take from it.   
 Q.  You've lost, but do you feel you've taken some rhythm and confidence this week?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, for sure.  Obviously playing two great matches here was extremely important for me.  It's been a while since I played a match, been over like three weeks.  It was great to be back out there just fighting.   
It was enjoyable.  I really enjoyed my two matches on court, even today losing.  It was a lot of fun to kind of go out there, play against a great player like Dominic, really put it to the test, see what damage I can do.   
I think if a couple of shots had went my way, I could have definitely won the match.  It's obviously a little tough to swallow.  But like I said, it's something that I can really look at in a positive way.   
 Q.  An awkward question.  The second-to-last game, the smash, the reason?  Lights?  A miss?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: No, I just missed, yeah.   
 Q.  You were at the net 17 times today.  Is the goal to be coming to the net a little bit more?  You've been playing doubles lately.  Are you trying to incorporate that a little bit more into your game?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: For sure, that's my game.  That's what I was doing really well two years ago here in Montreal, kind of fearless, just coming in.  Kind of went away from that a little bit.   
So I'm definitely trying to implement that.  Especially with the doubles, it's really helped my volleys.  I think my net game has improved a lot.   
I don't think I volleyed great today, but it's tough to come in on a guy like Dominic.  I think I did a lot of good points coming to the net.  Definitely somewhere I'm still trying to improve and make really solid.   
I feel like in the future it's going to be really a key kind of place on the court for me.   
 Q.  What is the plan for you for the rest of the hard court season in singles?  You had to take a break from tennis.  Are you going to have a less busy schedule until the US Open?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: No, actually I'm going to play every week.  I had my downtime, now it's kind of back to business, being on the court, playing these tournaments.   
Yeah, I'm super excited for what's to come.  Cincinnati, I had a really great week there last year.  I'm excited to go there.  Then I never played Winston-Salem, but I got a wild card there.  So thanks to the tournament director and to the tournament for allowing me to go play there.   
So, yeah, I'm excited.  I got a couple events leading up to the Open to get some matches, get a little bit more confidence, play a couple more points.  Hopefully I'll be really, really sharp for New York.   
 Q.  What is it like after being here, going to Cincinnati?  You did it last year.  A lot of attention here.  In a way is it refreshing to be a little bit more obscure?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, I think it's just a different week.  Obviously you go from playing in Canada to playing away from the crowd, away from the sport a little bit.   
Honestly, I think I'm pretty lucky.  I have a pretty good fan base anywhere in the world where I go.  I remember last year when I played, I had a lot of fans, a lot of support from them.  So I'm excited to be back.  I had a good couple matches against Kyle, against Frances over there.  I'm excited.   
Yeah, it's a bit of a different pace.  It's really slow.  You have a lot of time there.  There's not too much to do.  But, yeah, those weeks are enjoyable for me, as well.   
It's the North America kind of tour right now.  I feel like I've always enjoyed this part of the year, always managed to play well.  I'm really excited to head over there.   
 Q.  On a lighter note, I was watching you practice on Sunday.  You were out there, many fans watching.  You were wearing a cut-sleeved shirt.  Your arms are looking shredded.  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Thanks, man (laughter).   
 Q.  Are you on the Rafael Nadal workout plan?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Trying to pick up on it (laughter).   
Yeah, I don't know, you definitely just saw my left arm because my right arm is not even close to it.   
 Q.  He's the same.  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: He's the same, yeah.   
No, honestly, man, I'm just trying to get a tan (smiling).  I've been training with my shirt off, trying to get a tan.  It's not working out, guys.  I don't know what to do.   
Yeah, I mean, who knows.  Maybe if in the future if Nike creates kind of a sleeveless line, that would be pretty cool.  I'm not against that.  I think I do try to put on a little bit of gun show here and there (smiling).
