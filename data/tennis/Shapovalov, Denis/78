6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just wondering, how many different ways have you heard your last name pronounced this week?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Too many.  (Smiling.)
Yeah.  I mean, I'll explain it.  It's two parts.  So first part is Shapo, so French, hat in French.  Then second part is Valov.  So if you put it together, Shapo-valov.  For everyone to get it right.
Q. When you were like in school, is this like something that people have always struggled with,  pronouncing your last name?  Are you always correcting people?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, that and it also makes me a little bit upset when people write my name with two Ns, "Dennis."  I get that so much.  It's just so upsetting every time.
Q. Just talk a little bit about going back on court following the big win, just what the night before was like for you.
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: What do you mean?
Q. Just following the win yesterday.  What did you do?  Did you do anything exciting?  What was it like going back on court today?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: I didn't do that much yesterday just because, you know, I have to prepare for doubles today.  Of course it was tough.  You know, I'm so excited from the win yesterday.  It's tough to regroup a little bit.  Got home very late after all the media and stuff.
But, yeah, I tried to change my mind, focus on today.  Today it felt good on the court.  I think we really had a chance today.  You know, Tomic and Troicki, they are very solid and they are known to be very solid players.  That was the difference today.  We made a couple of mistakes.  Viktor got some insane balls in the second set.  That was the difference.
But a couple of points and we would have had the match.
Q. What has your Rogers Cup experience been like this week?  Obviously some tough losses.  Have you had a chance to hit with some of the pros or take in some of the atmosphere here?
FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME: Yeah, it's been a good experience being my first ATP tournament.  It's always different to see all the really top guys being around you.  It's obviously very great.  And, yeah, just playing at home.
I mean, the atmosphere was always great from the practice to the matches.  And, yeah, played two great matches.  Obviously could have been better, but I think the level is pretty close to theirs, so it's very motivating.
Q. Funny question for you because obviously you have Roger's birthday, but what did you think of Roger today for the rest of the year?
FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME: Yeah, it's pretty sad for tennis.  Yeah, obviously we wanted to see him play in the US Open and many more tournaments this year.
But I think, you know, he obviously knows what he's doing.  I think if he's taking off for the rest of the season, that means he really needs to recover and he needs to get fit for next year.
Q. Couple of questions for you.  What's it like now after your win last night to sort of become a face of this Rogers Cup tournament?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, it's exciting.  Trying to not look at it too much.  In that way, I'm just trying to focus on myself, focus on playing the match.  I'm not trying to look around too much.  But, yeah, of course it's exciting.
Q. I know you have hit with Dimitrov before in the past.  He's been really friendly with you.  What's it going to be like playing against him tomorrow when it really counts?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: It's going to be a very good match.  He's a very experienced player.  I think there is no reason why he shouldn't be in the top 10.
It's going to be a tough match for me.  I don't think it's going to be any easier than when I played Nick.  I'm going to prepare the same way, go out and hopefully play my best tennis.
Q. Just wondering if you had a chance, if you were watching Denis here last night.  Your thoughts on your friend's big win yesterday?
FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME: Yeah, I was there.  I was there the whole match.  Obviously we are all very excited for his big win.  Yeah, I think he showed a lot of great things, especially mentally, because Nick is always tough to follow, kind of get into his game.  He stays very calm.  I think that was a very mature win for him.
Q. Both of you guys have now done something pretty big on the circuit since you started playing, a challenger win and yesterday.  Have you been surprised by any players who have come up to you and know who you are and off the court?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Actually, I was just talking to Felix, when I was younger, just in the locker room, Mikhail Youzhny came up to me and we started talking in Russian.  When I was younger, I was at the Rogers Cup, I got a picture with him.  He was a star for me.  And now you're in the locker room with these guys, you're living with these guys.  It's completely different now.
Of course it's exciting.  Still a little bit new for me, but I'm getting used to it.
Q. Do the guys know who you are?
FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME: Yeah, they kind of -- I mean, a lot of pro players get into the junior tour to see who's coming up.  I think, yeah, they kind of follow who's coming up.  You know, it's good that they see what we are doing and hopefully we can reach that level sooner.
Q. Do the guys from France know anything about you?  You're a French speaker, and you were in the final of Roland Garros.
FELIX AUGER ALIASSIME: Yeah, I talked to Tsonga, met him last year in Montreal, talked to him a little bit during the French Open.  Yeah, especially also that my coach is French.  We kind of get to talk a bit with them and have chats and get some hits.  All the players, they're really great with us.  Yeah, they have been a good model.  Yeah.
Q. In the second set you had the trainer out working on your knee.  Can you explain what was going on and how you feel now?
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: I just tweaked it a little bit, but it's fine now.
