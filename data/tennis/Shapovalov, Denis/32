 Q.  Being part of the team again, what are your thoughts coming into this year's Laver Cup?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, I'm really excited. You know, I had a lot of great memories in Prague a couple years ago. It was a lot of fun being on the team with guys like Nick, Jack, and John this year.   
I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, I'm excited to be in Geneva. It's my first time.   
 Q.  In Prague, you were pretty much a rookie. Now you're more of an established player. How much easier does it get?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, definitely a lot more confident and comfortable around these surroundings, and I know kind of what to expect and how to prepare for the event.   
So I was definitely a lot more, like, easy-going this year, but, you know, at the same time, I'm just as excited as the first time.   
 Q.  Nerves will still be a factor?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Oh, definitely. I mean, we're going up against the best players in the world, and they've got a super strong team.   
It's definitely going to be a tough challenge for us, but I really think if we all work together, if we all get to play our best tennis, we have a chance to win.
