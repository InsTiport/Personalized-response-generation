 6-4, 5-7, 7-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. That was one heck of a match.  In your mind have you had time to process it a bit?  What do you think was the difference in the end between you and Diego?
 DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   One or two points.  Played a great match today despite not serving nearly as good as I could.  You know, I had a chance to win it and up a break twice in the third set.
 So, you know, I'm happy that I was able to almost find a way to win despite struggling with one of my main weapons today.
 Q. What do you think was the key in Diego's game to play such a great game against you in semifinal?
 DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   I don't know.  I don't know if there was a key.  We were both playing at very even tennis off the back, and it was just a couple points.
 I think it was a great match from both of us.  I feel like we both deserved to win today, so I don't think there was any keys or anything.  It was just a couple of points that made the difference.
 Q. After such a run the past few weeks, what's it going to take to get you to recuperate in time for Paris?  What's the plan?  Will you go right there?  How are you going to rest up and get fresh?
 DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   Just a long treatment tonight (smiling).  My physio is excited for that.
 No, I'm not sure yet.  I might just stay a day or two in Rome just to kind of refresh a little bit and then head to Paris or just go straight there.
 I'm gonna talk to the team and decide.  We haven't decided anything yet.  Definitely either stay here or go straight there.
 Q. If you look back at it, you must feel really good about where you are in the clay.  Would you say you're taking this as a very good positive, reaching the semifinals, battling it out with Diego, like you said, without your serve?  Looks like your clay game is shaping up pretty good and I would say improved quite a bit.
 DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   No, definitely very pleased with myself.  Obviously I'm a perfectionist.  I expect a lot from myself.  Definitely disappointed with today.
 But like you said, yeah, Diego's one of the greatest clay courters out there right now.  So it's big for my part to be able to go toe to toe against him from the back despite struggling with my serve.
 I think it's shown great improvement from me, and, yeah, I'm really, really pleased with the way I was able to play.
 Q. You will be top 10 if Diego lose tomorrow.  It's important for you to be there?  Time?  What do you think about it?  What do you expect for Roland Garros now?
 DENIS SHAPOVALOV:   Honestly, look, my time will come whether it's now or later.  I think God has a path for me, and, you know, obviously today I wasn't meant to win.
 But I'm gonna keep working, keep improving, and, you know, if I don't get there now, then I'll just keep pushing to try to break through to the top 10.
 But, you know, I'm only 21, so I'm really happy with having that chance for now to come that close.
