THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Out there on the court, came close in Australia, what is your thought on Davenport, how she played?
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  Well, today I think she played one of her best match against me.  She really stepped in as soon as the match started and played some really unbelievable shots.  I was pretty impressed by her level of tennis today.
