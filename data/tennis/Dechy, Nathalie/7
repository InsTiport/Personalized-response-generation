THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English.  
 
 
Q.  Can you tell us of what you think of your opponent in the next round, your thoughts about that match?
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  Well, obviously it's the defending champion.  She's playing really good on grass.  I think it's her best surface.  So it's going to be a tough match.  But I'm looking forward to it.  I'm pretty excited about playing that match.  I hope it will be a nice one.  
 
Q.  You played her two years ago in Birmingham.  Her game in the last two years has improved.  Have you seen her improvements?
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  Well, yeah, definitely I saw her improve.  I mean, when she came in Birmingham two years ago, she wasn't playing that well.  In between she won a Grand Slam, so that's pretty good.  But I improve, too, also in the same time.  
 
Q.  How was it two years ago?  How was she playing two years ago?
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  Still about the same as now.  But I think, yeah -- actually, I don't remember too much.  That was a long time ago.  
 
Q.  If you take a look at the draw, there are a lot of players on the women's tournament with quite some routine who are left in the draw.  They're not 16 or 17 years old left in the draw. 
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  I don't get the question.  You mean there's a lot of players who are pretty old?  
 
Q.  I would not say old, but who have a lot of routine playing on grass.  Do you have any explanation why?
 
NATHALIE DECHY:  Well, I haven't looked specifically at the draw, but there's a great mix of players.  Different type of game, different type of age.  That's the good thing about women's tennis right now.  It's really open.  Everybody has his chance.  So it's pretty nice.
