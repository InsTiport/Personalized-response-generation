 Q. How much was the very long match yesterday a factor in today's match? Were you tired from last night? 
 NATHALIE DECHY: Why we have to speak in English?  
 Q. Because we need one question. One quote for you in English. After we'll speak in French. 
 NATHALIE DECHY: Yeah, well, definitely I spend lots of energy yesterday in the match yesterday. And I finished really late. Went to bed really late. 
 And because also of my cold and the lack of energy, I could feel it today. Especially against a player like Elena. She's already really tough to play.
