 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tough match today, what can you take from that one?
 MIKAEL YMER:   What I can take?  In what way you mean?
 Q. Is there any learning or anything that you can take away from that match?
 MIKAEL YMER:   I wouldn't say not specifically from this match.  I'm kind of aware of -- I have a clear picture and I have had it for awhile of what's needed to improve to be able to compete with these guys and I was just finding the puzzles, the small puzzle pieces that are needed and for this I'm excited.
