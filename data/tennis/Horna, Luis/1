6-4, 1-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. He was able to get to the net a lot in this match. Unusual for clay. Were you surprised about that?
 LUIS HORNA: No. That's the way he plays. I knew he was going to serve and volley a lot and try to play aggressive all the time. 
 There are still a few players playing that way on clay or hard or grass or whatever. That's the way he plays and we all know that, and I was ready to have that kind of match.

 Q. People say that the clay of Rome is much faster than other tournaments. Do you feel like that helped him to serve and get to the net and keep you back?
 LUIS HORNA: He's been in the finals or semis in Hamburg and it's the slowest clay court in the tour. I think he's a very fit player and he knows how to play and he can play in any surfaces. 
 From Rome, the ball bounce high, flies very fast. It's a good place to play tennis. 

 Q. Who's the favorite for the tournament this year? 
 LUIS HORNA: Well, let me see, Federer, I mean, he's...

 Q. After Nadal lose?
 LUIS HORNA: Federer has been the second-best player on clay for the last couple of years, so you have to consider him as a favorite, with or without Nadal. 
 I like the way Ferrero is playing. Since the beginning of the year he's been playing great tennis.
