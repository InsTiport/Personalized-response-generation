THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  First Grand Slam quarterfinal, center court, in a tournament you only played in once before against Andy Roddick.  How significant is this?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I mean, I lost first round last year on the same court.  I mean, beating Roddick on the same court this year in the quarterfinal is huge for me.

Q.  How many times have you been to Adelaide?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Good question.  I've been in Australia since '99.  I've been there every year.

Q.  You go every year around Christmas?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, the last two years I've spent Christmas in Adelaide.

Q.  How many times do you think you've played Lleyton in Adelaide?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Good question.  We practice that was one and a half year ago, we practiced for two, three weeks.  And the same last year.  Then we've been hitting at few other tournaments.  I can't say how many times, but a few months total.

Q.  Do you play matches or just hit?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  We do everything you normally do when you practice.  You hit sometimes, you play games sometimes.

Q.  Who wins?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  We'll see tomorrow (laughter).

Q.  You are not scared that if you beat Lleyton, they will send off you from the family?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I don't think that's going to happen, though (smiling).

Q.  What have you learned from Lleyton Hewitt?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, I learned a lot of things.  I mean, he's a great player.  He gives 100 percent every point.  For me, I developed my game when I practice with him because I get so many balls back.  So I have to work the ball a little more.  It's been good for me.

Q.  Have you caused an official division in the Hewitt camp?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  We'll see tomorrow when I speak to them.

Q.  What about your girlfriend, did you speak to her after the game?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yes, just a little bit.  Briefly on the phone.

Q.  Did she guarantee her support?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, I didn't ask her about that, actually (laughter).

Q.  Where do you think she's going to go?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I don't know.  She said before if that would happen, she would sit in the Octagon box.  But I don't think she's going to sit in any of our boxes.  In the Octagon box, they have a suite up there. 

Q.  What happened in the third and fourth set?  You were playing so well.  Then you came back in the fifth.  What happened to you?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Actually, I don't know.  But I think I got a very bad start in both third and fourth set.  I think that held me off a little bit.  I was maybe concentrating little bit more on the next set.  It was tough to break him.  I think I started to play a bit better in the fifth.  So it was good.

Q.  You ultimately converted three of five break chances.  How do you think you played so well in the big points like that?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I played well on these points and then I think I played well on the 50 break points he had.  I think someone told me he won like 150 points and I won like 120 points.  That means I won the right points.  I don't know how, but it was very good for me.

Q.  How much confidence did you get when you played him in Juniors a number of times and then also you played him in San Jose, a very close match earlier this year?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I think I played very well in San Jose from the baseline.  I think I was dictating points even a little bit more than I did today.  Unfortunately, he did 27 aces.  It was tough.  I had one set point and I wasn't even close to break him.  But today I think I stepped back a little bit and I got a few more returns back.  But, I mean, it's so tough every time we played him.  We both have big serves, it's going to be tough matches.

Q.  But you had confidence?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, you can't say you got confidence if you have 4-Love down, but it's been close matches and that gives me confidence.  I know I can beat him, and that's what happened today.

Q.  Is this the biggest win of your career so far?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I mean, first quarterfinal.  I mean, I won Memphis this year.  That was very big for me.  I think this could even be bigger for me.

Q.  Do you have some of your own family here supporting you?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  My girlfriend.

Q.  What about your parents?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, my dad is in Scotland playing golf.  I was actually supposed to be with him maybe from today.  I bought him a birthday present for him and my uncle.  We were supposed to play golf this week, but I have to change my plans.

Q.  Have you had dinner with Lleyton this tournament?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No.  With the rest of the family.

Q.  Not Lleyton?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Not Lleyton, no.

Q.  Did you expect to hear from him?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No.  After his match.

Q.  What did you say to each other in that conversation?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  We spoke like we normally do.  We're good friends and hopefully we're going to be good friends after Saturday.

Q.  Is it awkward?  He said it would be very strange if you won. 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I mean, it's little bit strange.  But, I mean, for me, I guess it feels good for me because it's my first semifinal and I know the guy I'm playing on Saturday.  I mean, I think that makes it a little bit easier for me but little bit awkward for him.  I feel I can take advantage of that.

Q.  The birthday present you got for your dad, you were planning on joining him there, right?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, because I thought I would lose before that. 

Q.  Why the lack of confidence? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, it wasn't lack of confidence it was just the only time I could go on a golf vacation with my family.  Then I said if I can't go, it would be good anyway, so...

Q.  Which Swedish players did you grow up watching and admiring? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  The ones I remember is actually Edberg, because in Sweden they don't show that much tennis.  They showed Wimbledon a lot, so that's what I been watching.  And, I mean, Bjorn Borg is from the same city as me, so I watched some tapes from him, but I didn't actually see him live. 

Q.  Have you ever met him?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah.  My dad used to play Davis Cup with him, so I've been practicing with him when I was 13, 14, 15 years old.

Q.  Are you an equally talented golfer?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  If I would practice a little bit, maybe.  But I can't putt, so that's tough. 

Q.  Where do you play when you're in Adelaide?  Where do you practice?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  At the Memorial Drive.  (Inaudible).  They got a court over there.  But I have been practicing on center court on Memorial Drive.

Q.  On the grass?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, on the hard court. 

Q.  Do you think it will be more helpful for you or for Lleyton that you two have practiced so much together?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, I guess it's gonna be both actually because we know each other's game a lot, so it's tough to say, actually.

Q.  You have a strategy for the game against him? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I'm sure I will have, but I haven't been thinking about that yet. 

Q.  If someone were to have said to you going into this tournament that you would be facing Lleyton under the circumstances, having just beaten Andy under the terms you did tonight and reaching your semifinal here, coming into this tournament, is that something that you would have thought a very probable thing?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, I knew it was possible but, I mean, a tough task.  I had Ferrero in my half, and then I had Andy Roddick.  But everything's possible.  It's very close when you play matches, and it's just a few points here and there.

Q.  You played so well at Wimbledon.  Obviously, much better result here than last year when you did go out in the first round.  How have you changed?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I think I do everything a little bit better.  I think I move better on the court.  I serve more consistent, even though I haven't served that good this tournament.  I think even though I'm not serving that good, I still have a pretty high level.  I start to return better, I get more balls back.  I think I'm just more consistent than I used to be. 

Q.  You've led the tournament thus far in aces.  That's got to be probably a confidence-booster? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I mean, it helps if you get a lot of free points. 

Q.  Obviously, Lleyton has seen your serve a lot.  Would you say he's the best guy at returning your serve? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Well, I'm not sure if he's the best return of my serve, but he's one of the best returners around, so probably.  We'll see. 

Q.  Can you describe your experience out here tonight.  The crowd was against you, how you dealt with that.  Also, the emotions you've been going through since you just won. 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, it was a few guys cheering for me, actually.  Wasn't that many, but I think it's good when it's a good atmosphere out there.  Obviously, they got to cheer for someone, and in this case it was Andy Roddick.  I think it's just great fun.  After the match has been -- I haven't been thinking too much, actually.  There's been so much going on since I won, so we'll see after.

Q.  Has your phone been ringing?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  There's been messaging coming.

Q.  There was a contingent of people rooting for you yelling "Jay Jay." 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I'm normally called "Pim Pim."    That's my nickname. 

Q.  "Jay Jay" is not something...

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  "Pim Pim." 

Q.  Do you beat Lleyton in golf?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, he's more consistent than me.

Q.  Have you ever beaten him? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I'm not sure.  I stopped counting after a few holes. 

Q.  So when you play these matches, is Roger there usually?  Is he working with you a little bit, or is it just you're just hitting?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Which matches, sorry? 

Q.  When you're in Adelaide, playing, is Roger there?  Are you working on things, is he helping you with things?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, I mean, he's helping him.  But if I ask him to feed me some balls, he will do that.  I mean, especially if I come before Christmas, my coach is not there.  But, I mean, after Christmas this year the ex-coach I had, he was there.  So, I mean, it works out fine.

Q.  What is the biggest sort of obstacle you've got to overcome to beat Lleyton Saturday? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, it depends also how the weather is.  Hopefully it's not going to be that windy.  I mean, obviously, if it was like when he was playing today, it's going to be very tough to beat him.  I mean, I got to serve well and, I mean, I've got to keep the ball on the court and try to dictate points against him. 

Q.  It's extremely hard to take a nice picture of you in motion. 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  It's going to be tough.  You had a few chances today, but not many (laughter). 

Q.  Three or four times in five-set match. 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Hopefully I'm going to play better in the semifinal.

Q.  Is it true this was your first five-set match?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah.  I had doubles in Davis Cup, actually.  I guess you don't count that.

Q.  Did you play with Roddick in doubles?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah.  We lost final in the French Open doubles, Junior. 

Q.  Did you win it?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, we lost.

Q.  You know each other relatively well?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  We know each other pretty well in Junior.  But then he took the step much earlier than I did, so we didn't see each other for a few years.  We speak to each other when we see each other.

Q.  So when you're out there playing challengers, was there a time when you said to yourself, "Maybe I'll do something else"? 

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, I mean, I was injured 2001 for 11 months in my wrist.  I still wanted to play.  So since then I haven't had any doubts and I didn't even then.
