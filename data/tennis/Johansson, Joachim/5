THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  Did you think you were capable of serving that many aces?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  What do you think is so dangerous about your serve?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I don't know.  Actually maybe you have to ask the opponents that question, I think.  
 
Q.  How did you feel when you'd known you'd broken the record?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Well, I just heard it then.  Yeah, I think it's a nice feeling, but it's nothing I've been thinking about. 
 
Q.  Do you think you can do it again?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, hopefully one day.  
 
Q.  How does it make you feel knowing that someone like Andre Agassi is pretty much in awe of you now, respects you even more now considering what you've done?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I mean, he's a great player.  He's one of the best players of all time.  I mean, if he respect me, I think it's a good feeling for me.  
 
Q.  During that match you looked so close very many times.  How do you sort of look back on it now?  How do you feel?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, I was close in the second set when I had 4-3 breakpoint.  But, I mean, I don't think I could have played the match much different than I did today.  So I'm still happy with the tournament, but I was hoping to go all the way. 
 
Q.  Can you put a reason why your serve was working so well today?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I think it could have even worked better maybe.  But, yeah, I think I hit the spots I wanted to hit a lot of the times.  But I think I still can improve my serve a lot.  
 
Q.  Do you think you sort of proved something to yourself today the way you took it up to Agassi, given his stature in the game?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, I mean, I think every match you play, you can maybe prove something for yourself.  Today wasn't any different.  I think, for myself, I mean, I could work myself around with him.  I tried to play aggressive, so I was dictating the game.  That's what I did today. 
 
Q.  Do you think it was missed opportunities today?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  It's always a missed opportunity when you lose a match, I think.
