THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  I just want to ask why you decide to continue the game.
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Pardon? 
 

Q.  Why you decide to continue?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Oh, to continue.  Oh, I didn't really have much choice.  It was 5-4.  I prefer to play one more game so it was 5-All and we could stop when it was equal. The umpire said, Oh, you got to keep going until next side change, to court supervisor, when I speak to him.  When it was 6-5, he said, Yeah, if it's after 5-All, you got to continue to finish the set. So I didn't really have much choice.  I mean, it was tough to see when we were serving.  I think he also had problems. 
 

Q.  So you don't think about the crowd?
 
JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, no, the crowd was good.  I liked it.  Not because of the crowd.  The would see more tomorrow if we kept playing tomorrow, I think.
