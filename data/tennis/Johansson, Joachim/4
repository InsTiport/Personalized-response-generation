THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Joachim, there are a lot of people who think you're a very dangerous player in this tournament if your fitness is high enough.  Is your fitness high enough right now?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah, at the moment my body feels good.  I was playing Stoke Park last week and I got fever and a flu so I couldn't play all the matches I wanted to play. But now I feel good.  I got to win a match.  It was a while ago since I won one.  So it feels like I got my confidence back, and, you know, I'm feeling I'm on the right way again.


Q.  Are you still doing therapy for the elbow?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah.


Q.  Any pain today?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  No, not at all.  Feels good.


Q.  Are you satisfied with this performance?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Yeah.  I mean, for me, I haven't won a match since Estoril.  It was a while ago.  Before that was Rotterdam. So just the win, I'm very happy with just the win.  Doesn't matter how I won the match today, I think.


Q.  In your mind, as opposed to your heart, can you get through to a match with Roger Federer?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I'm just -- I mean, I'm playing Greg next match.  I mean, he's from England and he prefer to play on the grass.  I mean, that's gonna be a tough match.  If I will get that far, I would be really happy, but I have to focus on one match at a time.


Q.  If it's Rusedski or anybody, if you take care of your serve...

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  That's what he's thinking as well (smiling).


Q.  Yes, exactly, but if you're returning serve well enough, like you did today...

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I'm trying to work on it.  I mean, it wasn't my best match returning-wise, but I felt like it got better and better during the match.  I got more confidence. I played Greg three times before and it's been close matches.  Not that many breaks.  So later I got to prepare for something like that again.


Q.  One final question:  Norway versus Sweden, women's football.  Did you watch it?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I didn't watch it.  It was probably pretty good.


Q.  When you're playing Greg, obviously he's one of the local favorites.  Have you had much experience before of playing against players who are in front of their home crowd?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  Here I haven't.  In Australia I haven't.  French, I haven't played so many matches.  It was US Open against Roddick I played, and Fish the year before.


Q.  Yeah, okay.

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, I don't mind it.  I think it's probably more fun when the crowd is more into it, even though they probably won't go for me.  I think it's more fun if people is really into it, even though the crowd here is great.  I think it's gonna be a great atmosphere out there.


Q.  How have those games against Greg gone in the past?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  The first one was in Indianapolis last year; I won 6-3 or 6-4 in the third.  The second one, it was three breakers; he won the last one, in Moscow.  Then I beat him in Sydney this year, one break each set. So it's 2-1.  None on grass so far.


Q.  You've got the edge, but it's been close so far.

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  So far.


Q.  What do you think his qualities are as a player?

JOACHIM JOHANSSON:  I mean, I saw him when I was a kid, playing Wimbledon.  You know, he's got a great serve and great volley.  Trying to come in the whole time. So, I mean, I got to try to stay -- keep him at the back and try to dictate the point, as I normally try to do when I'm playing anyone. So, I mean, he's a great player or I guess he wouldn't have been as high as it's been in his career.
