Q. Kind of got through and saved those five matchpoints; then he just had a little loose game on your serve. 

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Yeah, I choked.  I should have won 6-5, 30-Love on my serve.  I did two doublefaults and two loose points, you are not going to win if you do that. 


Q. Did that throw you off for the tiebreaker?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  No, I mean, he played a good tiebreaker.  He didn't miss first serves, what can you do? 


Q. Disappointing the way you played up until this point?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Yeah, very disappointed, yeah. 


Q. What did you do in the second set after he was so dominant in the first; you turned it right around on him?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  He didn't miss a shot in the first set, so if he plays like that, he is going to win every match.  He played just too good for me in the first set. 


Q. Are you satisfied, though, at this stage of the season you are putting your game together again?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  It is tough to say right now.  I  mean, now, you are not satisfied.


Q. Of course not, but I mean, when you consider the early part of the season --

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Hopefully I can continue to play well. 


Q. Were you surprised he kept coming to the net because seems like every time he did that you burned him with some kind of passing shot?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  That is his game, so....
