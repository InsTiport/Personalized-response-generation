Q.  Thomas, did you expect such a match?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  No. 
 

Q.  It went okay for you?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Yeah, I think -- I played well.  It was easier for me to play today when I am playing on the court a little bit.  But, Boris already won the group.  It is tough to play when you have nothing to play on.  But, I played pretty well. 
 

Q.  Do you think it is a good preparation for Davis Cup, a win like that, or is it not a real win?  How do you feel about it?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  It is perfect for me, two good matches against Kafelnikov and Becker.  It is good preparation.  
 

Q.  Thomas, if you had not been a substitute here, do you think you would have succeeded better than you have done so far, if you had been one of the 8?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  You can't -- 
 

Q.  Difficult call to say?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Difficult call to say.  Everybody in this field can beat everybody. 
 

Q.  The news that you would go into the tournament, how did it make you?  How did you think about it?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, it is tough.  I didn't really prepare to play this week.  I feel like when you are No. 9, you really don't deserve to be in.  Last year it was very exciting to qualify for this.  And this year you don't feel really the same way, even if it's a lot of fun to come here and play in front of this crowd and to play such a good place and field - it is a lot of fun -  you don't feel the same way as you do if you qualify like you should.
