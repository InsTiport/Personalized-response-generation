MODERATOR:  Who would like to start? 
 
 
Q.  How do you feel you played out there today?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I felt I was playing really well and seeing the ball really well.  When the ball was coming into play with the rallies, I was confident.  I mean, I played aggressive, good grass court tennis.  
 
Q.  Your thoughts on the way Arvind played?  He had a wildcard.  He did pretty well in Nottingham last week.  What were your thoughts on his performance?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I knew that he was a dangerous player, especially on grass where he had some good results.  Obviously, really used to play in these kind of conditions.  The grass court season is so short.  Totally different kind of game.  You're very prepared against everybody.  I think I knew before the game I have to play well to win, and I think I did that.  
 
Q.  Were you surprised that he stayed at the back of the court all the time?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, I thought maybe he's going to come in more on his first serve.  I was thinking I was seeing the ball pretty well and hitting some good returns in the beginning.  I guess that made him stay back
