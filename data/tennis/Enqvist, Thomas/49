Q.  Thomas, never having played Todd before, did he surprise you in anything, his serve was awfully good today.  Did anything --
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I knew Todd was A very good player.  Today he served very well and I had a lot of chances, but I didn't take them. 
 

Q.  Thomas, I assume that when you went to bed last night, it was your thinking that you would be playing Agassi the following morning.  Might you have suffered some kind of letdown knowing that you would be playing Martin rather than Agassi?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  No, I mean, when you play Davis Cup semifinal, the match is still alive and we are down two matches to one, I mean, you are pumped up anyway, I mean, Todd is a very good player too so I knew I had to play very well to beat him so... 
 

Q.  Thomas, did he just serve too well or did you not return the way you wanted to?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, it is very hard to  say.  But I mean, the ball is coming very, very fast here.  I think Todd just hit the ball -- because it is very hard to see the serve, I think here, and -- but he served very well and put a lot of first serves in, so I think he served well. 
 

Q.  Thomas, what time did you find out that you would be playing Martin and how did you use the time that you had to prepare for it?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I find out at 9:15 -- 16, maybe.  I prepare as normal; nothing special. 
 

Q.  Thomas, you had several doublefaults.  Did you feel nervous at all during the match?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  No, I mean, Todd was hitting hard on my second serve, so I tried to put a little bit more pace on my second serve.  I did some doublefault in the bad times. 
 

Q.  I heard a rumor that the Swedish team was speculating last night that Agassi might not play.  Is that true?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  No, I didn't hear anything like that.
