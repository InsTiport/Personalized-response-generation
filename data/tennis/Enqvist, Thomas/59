Q. Were you satisfied with your performance this afternoon?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, I didn't return too good.  He was serving very, very good.  So I was returning his serve not too good.  He was serving very good.  So I made some mistakes when he break me.  Had some points I should have won, little bit disappointed, but I mean, he was too good. 
 

Q. Beating Agassi, did you come in thinking that you could beat Sampras?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I have to think that otherwise I shouldn't be playing on the court. 
 

Q. But you felt good coming in then?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Yeah, I mean, if you play a match, I mean you have to think that you can win.  Of course, it is going to be difficult if you play Sampras, I mean, he has beaten me two times before.  He is a very good player, but... 
 

Q. What makes his serve harder to deal with than other servers on the tour?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Pretty difficult to beat this server. He can hit it everywhere.  So I mean, he hit pretty good volley also.  You have to hit a good return to get a point.  You can't just keep the ball in play then he can out volley you.  That is pretty difficult. 
 

Q. Second serve also difficult too?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Yeah, he hit that very hard.  He slice it sometimes; kick it sometimes.  It is hard. 
 

Q. You have had a very good Open.  What is your overall impression experience for you?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, I am having fun.  I have been playing very good.  I am satisfied with my week.
