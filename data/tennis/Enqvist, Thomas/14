MODERATOR:  Thomas Enqvist. 
 
 
Q.  How do you feel you played?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  No complaints, straight sets.  Played a solid match. 
 
Q.  What do you think are the key points of the match?
 
THOMAS ENQVIST:  I think I played pretty solid through the match.  He played a better second set I think than he did in the beginning.  He picked up his game a little bit.  I think I played pretty solid all through.  I did a steady tiebreaker.  It was pretty tough conditions out there today.  It was pretty gusty, windy.  I think I managed that pretty well.
