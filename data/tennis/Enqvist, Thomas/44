 Q. Thomas, you figure you had him there in the end?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Well, it was a close match, I think. Boris served very well and
especially when he needed to serve well he put the first serve in, and I didn't. I think
that was the big key today. 
 
Q. In the 7th game of the third set, two break balls. Can you explain what happened in
your opinion?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: What happened? Two good serves. 
 
Q. You had more chance, I think.
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Yeah, he hit a good serve and I just got it back and then he hit the
hard forehand, I mean, I had no chance. 
 
Q. Are you very disappointed not to reach the final?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Yeah, I mean, you are always disappointed after you lose a match,
especially when a match is pretty close like this. I think I played well, and he was just
too good. 
 
Q. Do you think that the audience treated you well? Was it fair?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Well, I didn't expect them to cheer for me, so... 
 
Q. Thomas, did it turn out that the crowd -- did the crowd make you too nervous?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: No. They didn't make me nervous. Like I said, I think the key was that
I didn't serve that well, maybe, when I needed to do it, and Boris put a lot of pressure
on me and when I have chances in his service game, he put a good first serve in and just
not so much to do. 
 
Q. If you had played this match in Sweden today, would you have won?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: I can't answer that question. 
 
Q. The problem with the net at the time, what was it exactly you took with the umpire?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Tiebreaker he hit a ball through the net. 
 
Q. Through the net?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Yeah. 
 
Q. Are you sure?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Yeah.  
 
Q. Where are you going to play Davis Cup?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: We don't know yet. We know that just the week before. 
 
Q. What is your pick for tomorrow?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Well, it is very hard to say. I think everybody that lost in this
tournament was such good players, I think anybody can win it. I think if Boris is going to
serve well, I think he has a good chance to win, but like Michael played today, I mean, it
is going to be very tough and good match. 
 
Q. What is your pick, Chang or Becker?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: I don't have any picks. 
 
Q. The Michael Chang of today is not the one you beat at the beginning of the week; is
that true?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Well, what can I say, I mean, when you play these kind of tournaments,
I think it is very small things that decide who is going to win the match or not. I mean,
it is hard to say. I mean, of course, he played maybe better today than he did against me,
but I played very well, and I served well and I saw Pete was not 100%. It is all very hard
to say. Depends a little bit too who you play too. But what I saw, I think, I mean,
Michael was playing really well today.
