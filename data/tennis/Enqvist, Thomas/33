Q.  Thomas, how was it to wait so long time before you are finally on the court?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, it is tough.


Q.  After all those days?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  It is tough.  I didn't prepare to play, so you can't put too much pressure on yourself and expect yourself to do well when you haven't been practicing.


Q.  So your play was all right?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Well, think I played okay. Kafelnikov played really well.  He served really well.  I haven't seen him serve like this.  I mean, on this surface, the serve is the most important.  He served really well.


Q.  Any change from Bercy? 

THOMAS ENQVIST:  That was the big thing.  I think he served better.  In Bercy, I could put a lot of pressure on him after the second serve.  And, today I couldn't do that.  He served too well.  You play two sets and you almost are not sweating.


Q.  Do you feel it is faster here than in Paris?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Oh, yeah, much faster.


Q.  What do you think about playing Boris on his birthday tomorrow?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  I haven't thought about it too much. But, I don't know.  It is going -- for me it is a lot of fun to play.  And it is good for me to get some matches.  Davis Cup is coming up next week, so, it is great for me to play Kafelnikov and Becker and get two very good matches in.


Q.  Are you going to play the singles with Stefan?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  I think so.  I don't know.  The Davis captain knows.


Q.  Was it easy for you to come into the competition as a replacement player?  Could you imagine to qualify?

THOMAS ENQVIST:  Oh, no.  It was a pretty tough.  Like I said, I was not really maybe prepared for it.  But, still, I think I played okay.  I served pretty well.  I think I was playing okay.  And, I felt pretty good, but Kafelnikov, he was too good today.
