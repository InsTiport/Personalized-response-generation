 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Thomas. 
 
Q. Thomas, how highly do you rate Lleyton at this stage, and how far do you think he
can go in this tournament?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: It's tough to say on this match. It was tough tennis out there. He's a
very tough player, I played him four times this year and I lost all four. So obviously
he's a very tough player. He has a chance, as everybody else I think, here to go all the
way. 
 
Q. Do you think immaturity might count against him or do you think he's ready to go
through?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: I think he's ready mentally. He certainly has a good game for it, and I
think he has a chance to go all the way.  
 
Q. What do you put your performance down to, the wind? Just couldn't get the grips with
the conditions?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: It was tough conditions, but, you know, it was same for both of us and
he handled it a lot better than I did. So that's the way it was.  
 
Q. Have you played in conditions like that very often before?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: No.  
 
Q. Was that especially bad?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: Not so often. 
 
Q. Was that the worst you played in?
 
 THOMAS ENQVIST: I think one of the worst I played in, yeah.
