Q.  You seemed quite relieved to get through that. 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  It was a very difficult match and I could turn it around at the end of the first set.  Then after that, I was more comfortable.  
 
Q.  Tell us, you had some treatment on your leg.  Exactly, what was the injury? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  It was coming to a long match and I was feeling tired and cramping on the left leg.  
 
Q.  Did they just treat that with ice? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  In the thigh and the calf, just had a massage and a little stretch.  
 
Q.  His injury at the end of the third set, quite a long break. 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I was tired, but I took the regular time-out, regular time-out.  
 
Q.  You weren't annoyed that the break was so long?
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (In English)  No, it's okay.  
 
Q.  Looking forward a little way, Lleyton Hewitt possibly in quarterfinals.  Do you look that far ahead? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  It's a long way.  I'll be very happy to play quarterfinals against Lleyton.  But is a long way off yet.  
 
Q.  Not even with it being Lleyton? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  No, no.  I'm only thinking about what is ahead.  He has to win his matches.  I'm looking forward to meet Lleyton if it happens.  It would be a pleasure to play in his home, in front of his crowd.  I'll look forward to that if it happens.  
 
Q.  You enjoy the rivalry? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I respect Hewitt the same way I respect Roddick, Nalbandian, Federer.  I look forward to playing the good players.

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (In English)  Yes, I like.  It's okay.  
 
Q.  It's okay?
