Q.  Was it as easy as the score might tell?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, but the result seems easy because Ascione didn't play his best tennis.  I believe he was nervous.  I don't know what happened to him.  Myself, I played very good today.  I'm very happy because when I lost my serve at 4-1, I was able to come back into the match immediately after and dominate again.


Q.  Do you feel as good now as you felt last year at the same period?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Today I felt a bit like last year.  It was important to win the way I did today.  It gives me confidence for my next match.  I was very happy with my physical condition.  Today, I'm very happy with my game.


Q.  Ascione told us that he was wondering what your state of mind was when you stepped on to the court.  Were you there to have fun or to make the opponent seem ridiculous?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, I only try to do my best and I try to put the ball exactly where I believe it should be.  I don't like to give free points to the opponent.  I play each point as if it was the last one.  But I absolutely do not enjoy making my opponent seem ridiculous.  But if I believe a dropshot is the right shot to play, I do play it.  Today I played well and, I repeat, I'm very happy with what happened.


Q.  Do you practice your dropshots, or is it coming just naturally?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  It's natural.  Sometimes I practice a little bit, but when I play during a match it's because I just feel it's the right thing to do.  I must add that in Monte-Carlo, it's the place where I play my best dropshots.


Q.  Why?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  I don't know.


Q.  Were you surprised by Puerta's result?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, he's a very complete player.  He has very good angles when he hits the ball.  He plays very well.  I said Nadal and Gaudio are favorites, but I believe we can add him also as someone being able to win.
