Q.  You are using the new racquet from Prince?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Through translation.)  Yes, I'm using this new racquet. It's always difficult when you change, but I needed to after my operation.  I'm getting it done as I want to, so I'm fine.  I'm happy.


Q.  Is it very different?  Prince says it's a new generation of technology, but is it that different from the old style racquet?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Through translation.)  Yes, it's really totally different.  I'm very satisfied with it.
