THE MODERATOR:  English questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You got your first win of the Masters.  How do you feel right now? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  I feel very happy today.  There was a lot at stake there.  I wanted to really turn the image that I gave the other day against Schuettler.  It was an important match.  
 
Q.  Your next opponent is Andy.  How confident are you against Andy? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  The match today gave me a lot of confidence.  It's going to be a very difficult match, but I was happy to get the match done today like I did.  Like I said, it gave me a lot of confidence and hopefully that will help me tomorrow to get through.
