Q.  Just talk about your match, how your shoulder is doing. 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  The shoulder is fine.  If I'm here, it's because now it's fine.  Today I felt better than the match against Safin, I could do more things.  I'm a little bit disappointed with myself because, you know, it was 6-2, 6-2, but I still had some chances.  I could have broken his serve.  But the positive thing is that I felt good on the court, I moved well, and I hit the ball better than the other day.  
 
Q.  How do you see Safin versus Henman? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Well, it's going to be a very hard-fought match, like every other match here, especially if one of the two players will qualify for the semifinal, if the winner will qualify for the semifinal.
