Q.  You're playing on Court 11, people are walking by.  You're the No.  5 player in the world.  Do you think you deserve a little better than that?  
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  I'm going to try to play as best I can, no matter where I play.  Wherever they put me, I'm going to play the best I can.  It is a little distracting.  But I'm going to play the best I can, no matter what court it is.  
 
Q.  Did you think about the fact that you were playing against the only other player unjustly accused of taking steroids?
