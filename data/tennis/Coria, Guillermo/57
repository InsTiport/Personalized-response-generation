Q.  Was it an expected defeat? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Well, I knew it could happen since I only prepared for three days.  This is because after Roland Garros I relaxed and I've been in Argentina, so I cannot complain.  I have to be relaxed.  However, I am angry for having lost in the first round.  
 
Q.  In spite of this loss, it has been a good year for you overall.
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, I'm happy.  There's still another Grand Slam to come, so I don't want to get mad about it.  
 
Q.  There were two bad calls where you argued with the umpire.  Did this make you lose the match? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, it's not an excuse, especially because there were other bad calls for the other player.  
 
Q.  Olivier was very strong in that match. 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, I had chances to win the second set, but he played too good.  
 
Q.  And now? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Now I'm going to go to Argentina to train hard for the next tournaments to come.
