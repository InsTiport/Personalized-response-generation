Q.  The fact that you have finished in this tournament, what do you feel?  Is a little bit sad? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, I am very sad, especially because I knew it was going to be very difficult.  In the other group are players that have withdrawn.  I have one more match left against Federer, try to play like I did today and improve my serve.  
 
Q.  Tennis requires you to be physically strong.  Physically you are not in a very strong position.  Next year what are you going to do physically?  Are you going to improve physically next year? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  I feel physically very well.  I have no problems.  I feel strong.  Maybe that question should be asked to those who are not playing here, to the people that are not playing.  I feel very well physically.  Maybe I'll have to ask you what to do.  Hewitt is not also a very big guy or very strong guy, and he was No. 1 and No. 2 in the world when he came here.  He won this tournament three years ago.
