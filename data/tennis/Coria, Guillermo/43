Q.  When did you start preparing for this season? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Well, in fact, I started preparing last Monday because after my final in Miami against Roddick, I had to stop for a week because I had kidney stones.  I only had one week rest, and I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to prepare this season.  
 
Q.  What do you mean with the "stones in your kidneys"?  You had to take time off?  How did you cure it?
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  I cured my stones by just going to the toilet.  There were two stones. 
 
Q.  Was it painful? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Nodding yes).  It could have lasted even two or three weeks because what I had to do is drink a lot, drink a lot to eliminate them.  Fortunately, they went away in one week, but they could have lasted longer.  Until I eliminated them, I couldn't play.  
 
Q.  It was the only physical problem you had? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes.  I was lucky because when I went to the hospital in Miami, they told me it was a discal hernia.  It would have lasted five or six months.  I went to Argentina, and in Miami they were wrong; it was kidney stones.  So I was lucky it was just that.  
 
Q.  Do you feel well now? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, but I still have to drink a lot of liquid because they can come back.  I didn't have time to study because it happened to me.  
 
Q.  Were you surprised it was so easy today? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, I was a bit surprised, but I played very well, very deep.  My tactics were perfectly all right.  I'm very pleased it went so fast because now I'm keeping physical condition for the next matches.  
 
Q.  How long was your break after the Masters Cup in Houston last year? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Two weeks.  
 
Q.  So the most important thing for you now is to drink a lot? 
 
GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, exactly, more than normal  - I drink three liters a day.
