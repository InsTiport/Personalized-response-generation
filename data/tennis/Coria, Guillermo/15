THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Apologies for not speaking to you in Spanish.  In England there has been talk about Wimbledon may have to eventually dig up the grass courts because grass is now a surface played on only in northwest Europe practically.  Would you be happy if the grass was dug up, or would you like to see the tradition of grass continue?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, no, I would like more of this sort of test to be able to prepare better.  What's not very good is to come from a very long period of clay and go straight into grass because the difference is too big.


Q.  Wouldn't the easy solution be just to get rid of grass?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Not at all.  Not at all.  It's traditional.  All tennis players want to win this tournament because it's the most prestigious one. Especially in my case, it's where for me it's most difficult to play.
