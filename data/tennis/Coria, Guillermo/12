Q.  Can you describe the final gesture at the end of the match, bending over on one knee holding one finger up?  Was that solace? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  It's a player that he likes a lot, a soccer player. 

Q.  Rio player?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Ex-Rio player. 

Q.  What caused the exchange in the fifth set, the changeover? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He said it was a misunderstanding. 

Q.  Is it fair to say you weren't happy with the time he was taking? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He wasn't happy over all of the third set.  He just wasn't serving well in the third and fourth set.  He wasn't happy in the third.  Just felt he wasn't serving well.  But he didn't lose the serve. 

Q.  So you think you won or he lost the game, even with 20 double-faults? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He played real solid, played real well.  He doesn't know what happened on the serve.  In the fourth and fifth set, he didn't lose serve once. 

Q.  Any concern with your shoulder? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He put a lot of heart and was able to continue. 

Q.  What was the misunderstanding?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He lost a toenail on his foot, and he took some time.  Massu was thinking that he was -- it was not a real injury.  After the changeover, nothing happened, nothing further happened. 

Q.  When you came off, it seemed when Massu crossed in front, something was said, and that's when the exchange occurred. 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  He said there were no words spoken.  Basically there was a brief handshake.  He said, four and a half hours, that was it.
