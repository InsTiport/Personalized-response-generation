Q.  Your impressions of the match, how you're feeling at this stage of the tournament. 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I'm happy to have won the game.  I'm not playing at the best of my level.  But is in the next round. 

Q.  What are the areas you're not happy with? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I felt much better in the first match.  I had a little bit more aggression.  The important thing was that I won the match. 

Q.  What do you put down the fact you maybe weren't as much for this match as the previous one? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I didn't know my opponent very well.  His game was a very slow game.  He doesn't give you any rhythm.  He comes out with things that I don't expect. 

Q.  Will you be watching tonight's match? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I'm sorry I'm going to miss this because I'm going to the players party with my wife. 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (In English.)  And friends. 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  And if they repeat some previews, I'll have a look. 

Q.  Have you spoken to Chela at all today about tonight's match? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I didn't get time to see him because I was playing.  Chela was preparing for his match.  I think it's going to be a good match.  I don't think anything like last year is going to happen, repeat itself.

Q.  Why not? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  They are good professionals and they clear enough not to be so stupid. 

Q.  "To make the same mistake."  He didn't say "stupid." 


Q.  Have you spoken to Hewitt of late? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  (Translated from Spanish)  I regret all the things that have been said since Davis Cup.  I haven't had a chance to talk to him.  I don't think anything like that is going to happen again.  It's no good for tennis.
