Q.  Can you just tell us why you've been playing so well lately? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  That's because I've been playing a lot lately, and so that inspires me to play better.  So that's why I've been doing so well lately. 

Q.  Does it feel different, being one of the hottest players this summer?  Probably Andy Roddick and yourself are the hot players of the summer.  Do you feel different? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, because he's excellent playing on the surface.  I play better on clay, but he's a real good player.  In the future, yeah, I hope to be like him. 

Q.  Roddick? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah. 

Q.  Today was a very tough match.  How do you feel you were able to win it? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, it was really hard, but thank God I got to break the serve.  Yeah, I just won. 

Q.  What happened last week?  You retired in your match. 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, I was tired and I didn't want to get hurt.  Because I came from a really long tournament, I just wanted to get some rest. 

Q.  You are a clay court specialist.  How do you keep the momentum going now on the hard court surface? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  I play in the same way, but I need to be a little more aggressive maybe. But it's basically the same.  Yeah, I don't really change my techniques or anything.  I just try harder. 

Q.  Do you feel that is a strategy that will work for you on hard courts in the future, that you'll be able to win on hard courts? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, I feel confident on this surface, on hard court.  I feel confident playing on it.  My dream is just one day win the US Open or something.  But, yeah, I definitely feel very confident playing on the hard court.

Q.  Why the US Open? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Whatever tournament, I'm open to whatever tournament.

Q.  Not the US more than the French, or...? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  I prefer the French Open.  It's the dream of every Argentinian, winning the French Open. 

Q.  Do you know Guillermo Vilas?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, I know.

Q.  You were named after him?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes, I'm named Guillermo after him.

Q.  Has he helped you or been kind to you or anything in your career? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yeah, sometimes we just meet each other at tournaments and just help each other out.  He gives me advice and stuff.  He's helped me.

Q.  But you don't remember him playing at all?

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No, no.

Q.  Way before...

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No.
