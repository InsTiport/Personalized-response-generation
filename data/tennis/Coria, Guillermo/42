Q.  Good win for you again.  Ferrero is now out of the tournament.  Do you feel you're the favorite here?  Are you confident of winning the tournament? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  No.  When I enter into a tournament, I don't think about one particular player, being Ferrero or any other, who could put me under pressure.  The important thing is to think about myself and play match after match.  It's important, though, that Ferrero is no longer in the tournament, because he played well here in the past.  But now I consider the tournament as being quite open.

Q.  Tell me about your Italian parents.  You have Italian parents or grandparents.  Do you remember them?  Where are they? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  I don't know where exactly.  Yes, I remember my grandparents, but I don't know exactly where they come from in Italy.  The name of my grandmother is Esther, and she lives now in Rofino. 

Q.  How confident are you with your clay court form at the moment? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  My confidence right now is very high.  I'm very positive for this tournament.  I feel at ease on the court.  I feel well on the court.  It's important that I won those two matches the way I did  - playing very deep, with a lot of confidence.  Hopefully, it will continue for the rest of the tournament. 

Q.  Scores like 6-love, how can you explain that? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  You have to remain concentrated and give no presents to your opponent because at any moment a match can turn around.  Very often, it's 6-love in the first set, then the situations become a lot more balanced and a lot tighter.  So you have to play each point. 

Q.  Do you feel confident in your game? 

GUILLERMO CORIA:  Yes.  You saw the score, 6-0, 6-3.  I mean, I am playing with a lot of confidence, and I am feeling good with all my shots.  There are no special shots of the game, everything is all right.
