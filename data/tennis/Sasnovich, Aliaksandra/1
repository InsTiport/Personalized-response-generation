THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It's tough, eight matches in nine days.  Do you start to feel it physically by today?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Yeah, it was tough tournament for me.  But anyway, it was good tournament for me.
Sorry for my play today.  It was tough.  I don't know.  Elina was playing very good, but I can play much more better.  But yeah.
Q. When you woke up this morning, how was your body feeling?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Of course, tired.  But I tried not to think about it too much, you know.  I just tried to relax a little.  Of course, everyone understand that it's a lot of matches.  I understand it's a lot of matches.
The body is tired, but I try not to think about it.  But yeah.
Q. Did you feel pressure going out there or did you feel sort of mentally quite free given how well you had done this week?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: I don't feel pressure mentally.  Maybe I was, like, you know, just -- I don't know why it's like this, why I play so bad.  I don't know, to be honest.  Sometimes it happen.  I played some good matches and this one was bad.  Yeah.
Q. What do you take out of this week?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: I think I prove a lot compared to, for example, six months before.  And as a player, like, with better serve, but today I served very bad.  With better baseline, volleys, all my shots I'm improving too much, but today...
Q. Does this week change your expectations at the Australian Open at all?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Yeah, of course.  I have time to prepare for Australian Open.  Yeah, and I hope to be ready mentally, physically, yeah, to be good there.
Q. What do you do next?  Go straight to Melbourne?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Yeah, we are going on Monday to Melbourne.  So today off, and then we go to Melbourne and on Tuesday start to prepare.
Q. What is your favorite memory of this week?  Seemed like you had a lot of fun before today.  What are you going to remember most?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: What I have to say, risotto with mushrooms (laughing).
Yeah.  Was a lot of good matches.  It was third match in quallie I play against Monova.  I was 6-2, 4-2 down, something like this, and three times advantage for her.  If I lose this match, you know, not possible to play in final.
And with Mladenovic as well.  It was 6-1, 2-1, something like this.  Yeah, it was too close to lose, you know.  And then now I'm in final.  Yeah, there's some good memories.
Q. Is there a win that you got this week that stands out for you?  A victory that you got this week that means the most?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Which victory?
Q. Whichever one from this week.  Is there one match that you think maybe means the most to you?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Yeah.  I think against Monova, the match against Monova in the third round of qualification.
And against Kontaveit, yeah.  Because when I was health, you know, my health was really good, I lose to Kontaveit, like, almost all the time.  And now when I felt bad, yeah.  I won, you know?
I don't know how it's happened.  It was mentally maybe today -- mentally, yeah, like you said, I was a little bit, you know.  Like, it was my maximum possible, my maximum yesterday was -- yeah.
Q. Did it feel much different as a match?  It's a final.  You get flowers when you walk off the court.
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: Well, of course, the final is a special day to play final.  You're not all, like, each day play finals.  I don't remember my last final.  I think it was three years ago or two years ago.  So it was really nice.
But after the final, I'm not so happy to be honest, of course.
Q. Do you have a favorite restaurant in Melbourne that you'll go to?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: No.  I don't have.
Q. You have to find one?
ALIAKSANDRA SASNOVICH: We have to find something.
