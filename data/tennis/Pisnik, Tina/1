THE MODERATOR:  Tina, congratulations. 


Q.  How did it feel to win that first rubber?

TINA PISNIK:  That's unbelievable feeling.  That's what we were hoping for.  Our dream came true.  It's good to feel that we're 1-Love ahead of USA. 

Q.  You told me yesterday that you wanted to go out first and begin the tie and really get the team off to a great start, which you did.  What do you think the key to the match was? 

TINA PISNIK:  Certainly the crowd.  They were unbelievable support.  They kept me going the whole match.  Even when I was losing games, they were behind me and really trying to get me on top of my game, which I played for couple games.  But hopefully tomorrow I can be steadier and play a good match all two or three sets. 

Q.  Could be Venus Williams.  It's certainly scheduled to be for your next match.  Is that a match that you really look forward to, to see how you get on against someone like her? 

TINA PISNIK:  Sure.  I don't get opportunities to play top players every day.  So to play Venus at home on clay with heavy balls, I think I have a good chance.  I'll go out there, give it my best.  Hopefully we'll get a good match like today.
