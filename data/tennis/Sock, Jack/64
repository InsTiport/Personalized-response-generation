 SOCK‑POSPISIL/Bolelli‑Fognini
  6‑4, 6‑7, 10‑7 
   
 Q. Jack, walk us through the match.   Obviously looked pretty comfortable a set and a break up, but it got tight in the end.   Walk through the closing stages.   
JACK SOCK:   Yeah, we came out on fire.   Yeah, actually me, I came out firing and playing very well.   I was kind of seeing the ball big and was able to really dictate a lot of play.  
And then my service game in the second, it was definitely my fault.   I played a very sloppy game.   (Indiscernible).   Double faulted at one point.   (Indiscernible.)   
I think momentum swung their way a little bit and they started playing better and then we were able to raise the energy after Vasek's big shots there at the end.   We played some good doubles in the end and were fortunate to get the win.  
   
 Q.   You went for a few match points before you took one.   Were you getting a bit nervous at the end there?  
JACK SOCK:   Me?   No.   I think maybe Vasek and my team was a little bit nervous.   (Indiscernible.)
