THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough loss, Jack.
JACK SOCK: Yeah, it was.
Q. What was the difference then?
JACK SOCK: Got broken at the end.
Q. You were there for a long time, lots of ups and downs in the match.  Describe some of your feelings.
JACK SOCK: Yeah, I mean, utter disappointment when you're up two breaks in one set, a break in the fifth.  Choke it all the way, so.  Really sucks.
Q. There was a ton of momentum swings in that match.  Anything particularly about your matchup that made it so topsy-turvy?
JACK SOCK: Maybe could have not been so topsy-turvy if I hold once in the second, I'm through in four the way it was going.  He's a tough player.  Makes a lot of balls.  Clearly was cramping pretty hard there in the end, running down everything.
Q. What were your expectations coming into the tournament?  Were you healthy and fit?
JACK SOCK: Was I healthy and fit?  I mean, I just played four hours and was fine.  So, yeah, I think I was pretty healthy.
Q. Coming into the tournament, you mentioned an injury at Wimbledon.
JACK SOCK: Yeah, felt great.  I just lost a match.
Q. You had a very good start to the year.  The trip to Australia, disrupt your momentum at all?
JACK SOCK: Yeah, I don't know.  Everyone wants to talk about the start of the year.  Yeah, obviously, things aren't going as well right now.  Yeah, got to get back on the winning streak.
Q. You've been hitting with Nick as well?
JACK SOCK: Hit a lot, yeah.
Q. Sort of looking back, anything you'd do differently?
JACK SOCK: Hold serve would be a good start.
