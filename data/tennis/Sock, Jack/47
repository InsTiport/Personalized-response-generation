6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Hi, Jack and John.  You guys are both great singles players.  How do you keep the balance between singles and doubles?  Also, will you play doubles together in the following seasons?
JOHN ISNER: Good question.  Yeah, I mean, we both definitely prefer singles, but we also have a lot of fun playing with each other in doubles.  I think that's the No. 1 reason why we did so well this week is because we are having a lot of fun with it.
It wasn't really about strategy.  It was just about going out there and having some laughs and having a good time out there.  I think that helped us a lot.
JACK SOCK: Yeah.  I mean, I'd have to agree.  You know, it's always fun playing with a good friend.  John is probably my best friend on tour.
JOHN ISNER: Dude.
JACK SOCK: I know.  Oh, man.
So, yeah, it's fun to get out there.  Obviously to play with him makes my job easier when he can serve matches and, you know, my job at the net is more fun that way.
But, yeah, like he said, we just had a lot of fun.  Laughed a lot.  Kept it light out there.  I think that's why we played pretty well.  I think this momentum will carry us on to hopefully making London the end of this year and continue to play for the next six, seven years consistently.
Q. You both will play Stockholm next week.  Especially, John, you play Del Potro the first round.  Will winning this trophy help you face this tough opponent in Stockholm in singles?
JOHN ISNER: Yeah, it's a very tough opponent.  So I'm going to try, both of us, we're going to try to get to Stockholm as fast as we can.  It's a tough tournament.  That's what you get at the end of the year.  Everyone is trying to finish the year strong.  So very tough match for me in particular, and we'll see what I can do with it.
