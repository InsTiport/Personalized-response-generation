THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  So that was fun, right?  Nick, you have been enjoying yourself on the court and on the bench with the guys so much the whole day.  Do you feel like this is what tennis needs to get or to be more like sports, team-oriented sports, than every man for himself all the time?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I think the more  events that we have like this, I think this has definitely got a lot of potential to be an event that's going to last a long, long time.  Events like this are perfect, because you create friendships, and if you win an event like this, then you're never going to forget about that.  You have amazing memories, but at the same time it's very competitive out there.   
You saw the matches today were extremely high level.  Everyone was giving 100%.  I thought that doubles was very high level.  It's one of the best doubles I have ever played.   
So I think that it was unbelievable.  You saw the chemistry on the bench.  Everyone was supporting each other.  That's what tennis needs.  I think these days it's too individual.  Everyone sort of doesn't want to get into everyone's business, but now, hopefully with events like this, it's perfect.   
 Q.  You just mentioned the bench.  When you're playing on the court, you guys are really serious, and off the court obviously they are supporting you and doing their thing.  How difficult is it to focus when that is happening or keeping a balance between...  
NICK KYRGIOS: I think it's easy to focus.  They are only doing it because -- for me, personally, it's perfect.  It keeps me relaxed, and I know they're getting behind me and Jack out there.  It's perfect.   
Whether it was Denis today, Frances, or Isner, everyone showed up.  I thought everyone was there the whole match supporting them.  It's unbelievable.
