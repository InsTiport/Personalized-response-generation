 Q.  Congratulations. Given the scoreline, you were 7-3 down coming into this match. How did you produce your best tennis under so much pressure?  
JACK SOCK: Yeah, there was a lot on the line there. I felt like obviously we wanted to keep the overall weekend close, but being down 9-3 is different than 7-5.   
We have had so many chances this weekend, it's been crazy. I feel like the score could definitely be the other way.   
We just came out with a lot of energy like we always do when we play doubles. I thought we gelled really well together tonight. I thought it was a very high quality match. We are definitely, definitely happy to get the win and keep us close.   
 Q.  Nick, what is it about Laver Cup and playing with Jack that makes you play such brilliant tennis?  
NICK KYRGIOS: Yeah, I mean, the Laver Cup is the week I look forward to out of the whole year. Especially playing with Jack, he had some tough injury, and to come back, to put on a performance in singles and not only be our best doubles player is amazing.   
Our whole team is coming together. As he said, the score could be different, but I'm glad we're going to ride the momentum into Day 3.   
 Q.  You were fantastic today. You have also got one of the doubles greats in John McEnroe as your captain. What was the message from John throughout the doubles, particularly when they came back at you in that second set?  
JACK SOCK: I mean, just keep our intensity up. I thought we had some unlucky stuff go our way in the second. We still fought back, getting it back to 6-3.   
Yeah, he just said keep the intensity up, make sure you focus every point and play some solid tennis. The breaker was high level from everyone. We were definitely happy to pull that one out.
