S. WILLIAMS/K. Nara   
6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  What was it like to play Serena on that court and how did it go for you?  
KURUMI NARA: It's very special.  I mean, she's best player, for me.   
So today I lost, but I'm very happy to play with Serena on center court.  It's very special for me.   
 Q.  Is there anything you could have done differently to make it a closer match or maybe to beat her, do you think?  
KURUMI NARA: I think today I did the best play because my physical, it's a little bit tired today.  But I did best play today on center court.
