THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A tough day for you.  What didn't happen?  How come you weren't hitting your form today?  You looked good the other day.  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I don't have my best day on court.  And he played really well.  He served so strong all the time.  I couldn't break his serve during three sets.  I think he's a very dangerous opponent to play on grass, and he did much better than me today.   
 Q.  It was very hot today and you could tell that the heat was affecting you a little bit.  Could you tell us a bit about that?  Did it affect your play, do you think, the hot weather?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no, no.  We been drinking a lot of water, and I think the weather conditions are great to play.  It's better when you have the sunshine and not the rain (smiling).   
So I think everybody enjoy the sun.   
 Q.  I think you helped somebody that fainted in the crowd; is that right?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: The doctors help a lady.  We were scared about the situation, but it was nothing.  Nothing happened in the end.   
 Q.  On paper this looks like your worst result on tour because of Ernests' ranking.  He's a better player than his ranking, isn't he?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, of course.  Everybody knows that.  Last year I was 1000 in the world, and nobody believe in that ranking to me.  So I know how good is Ernests on grass, and if he has a good day, he can beat all the guys, because he already made it in the past.   
 Q.  He plays Novak next.  Has he got the game to give him a challenge?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I think Novak has a better return serve than me.  I think he has a little chance to win Ernests.   
 Q.  What's next for you?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I go home (smiling).   
 Q.  Take some rest?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, take some rest.  And then I will be playing in America.   
 Q.  No injuries?  Not taking any injuries home?  You're still fit and healthy?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I hope, I wish.
