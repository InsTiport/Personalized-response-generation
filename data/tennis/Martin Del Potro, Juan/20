J. DEL POTRO/H. Chung   
6-2, 6-3   
 Q.  Incredible match.  You've never played this guy before.  You obviously figured it out.  A little challenging in the second set, and then you won five straight games.  You have to be happy to close this out pretty quickly.  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, of course I am happy to beat these young players.  He has a big future, and he is a nice player.   
I am glad to go through, and hopefully I will be ready for my other match.   
 Q.  What do you do to get ready?  I know your fans were ready, looking forward to seeing you.  You have one more match tonight.  How do you get ready to turn around so quickly?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know.  (laughter.)   
I will take a shower now and then some stretching.  I will eat some food and then hopefully be ready.  But you never know what could happen, and if it rains again, it will be better for me.
