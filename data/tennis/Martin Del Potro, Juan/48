J. DEL POTRO/K. Khachanov   
6-4, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  (Off microphone.)  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, it was really difficult to play.  Almost 40 degrees out there is too much for the health, you know.  We did a big effort to play good tennis.  The weather condition was too high for playing tennis.  Also you can see the crowds, nobody was there watching under the sun.   
But I did a big effort.  I survive.  I will play after tomorrow I hope in different conditions.   
 Q.  Have you ever known anything as tough weather-wise as that before in your career?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I think many years ago playing here was similar weather conditions.  But today I had to be mentally strong enough to support the sun.  I saw my opponent in very good shape during whole match.  I couldn't show my good conditions to him.   
I play good in specific moments of the match, and that was the key.   
 Q.  There's a potential matchup with you for Roger Federer in the quarters.  What do you think of the matchup?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: First, I have to think about Berdych.  Is going to be a difficult, difficult challenge to me.  Tomas is one of the player who has the power to beat all the guys on tour.  When he's feeling good, he's very dangerous guy.   
I will try to feel better for that match and then see if I am still winning.
