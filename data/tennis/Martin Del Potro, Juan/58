6-4, 7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you just describe how you felt out there today, how the match went for you?  Can you talk us through the match today.
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, what I say, it's a great honor to be part of this event, playing in the stadiums.  I got great memories from this tournament.  I had all my best memories playing in Arthur Ashe Stadium, and it's amazing to have chances to play a match in that stadium.
Q. This particular match, did you feel well out there?  Can you talk about how you felt physically out there?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, I think to play my first round, I play good enough.  I need to improve something for my next round.  But also, it's not easy to come back and play the first round on Arthur Ashe in front of all the crowd, but I did with all that pressure and I did well.
