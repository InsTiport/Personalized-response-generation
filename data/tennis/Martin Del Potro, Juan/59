7-5, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A nice response from the Montreal crowd.  What is it like to be back here and have the crowd behind you like that?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, it's amazing for me.  I miss a lot this tournament.  I couldn't play the last editions because my wrist.
But now I'm in good shape.  I have the chance to play after many years.  And I start to winning a good match against Isner.
So the sensations are great.  I looking forward to keep improving my game, to still win matches.
Q. The director of this tournament said this game against John Isner could be the semifinal or a final of a lot of other tournaments.  How did you feel having to play this quality player in the first round?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, John can reach finals in all tournaments.  He has a great serve.  His movements from the baseline are getting better.  Is, of course, a tough first round for both.  Could be a quarterfinals, could be a semifinals of any tournaments.
But we play today, and I got lucky to win tonight.  Hopefully I can take another draw in the next tournament because nobody wants to play against John in the first round.
Q. There's been a lot said about your health.  Are you back at 100%?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, yes, I'm healthy.  I'm getting better week by week.  I have the chance to play this tournament in a good shape after many years, which is nice for me.
I think, looking forward to playing in New York, it's a great preparations this tournament.  The next week, as well.  Also I love to play these tournaments before New York.
