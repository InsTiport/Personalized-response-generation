J. DEL POTRO/F. Krajinovic
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. We saw you played a strong game today.  Moving forward, is there anything you want to improve on or are you performing where you want to be?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I think I play well.  I been training hard to play in this level.  Today works everything good, starting from my serve, from my forehands, backhands.  That is the game that I need to go far in this tournament.
Q. Next round you play Fabio Fognini.  What do you see from that match?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: It's going to be a difficult one.  Fabio beat me in the Mexico finals this year.  He's playing very well already.  He's a smart player also.  It's going to be an interesting match to play.
But Fabio has a lot of chances to win that match, too.  I have to play my best, for sure.
Q. What are some things you think you did well in the match or you can work on?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I think I played solid.  I took all my chances during the game.  Filip played good at the start of the game, but I was there playing solid game from the baseline, hitting good forehands, good backhands, then I hold all my service game.
Is tough to play when I feel like this.  I think he does a good game anyways, but I played a little bit better in the important moments.
