6-0, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you like the new stadium?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I like it a lot.  The stadium seems so good.  I like to be closer with the people.  The sounds of the ball are great.  I think the people could create a good atmosphere for the next matches.   
 Q.  Did you think Manu might play one more year or retire?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He said to stop already.   
 Q.  Did you think he would play more?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He has the talent to continue playing for five years, but we have to respect his decision.  Us Argentinians, we are so proud of him.  We wish all the best in the new life.   
 Q.  There were some breaks in the second and third set, you broke back quickly.  What were your thoughts on putting him away efficiently?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I was thinking just to do my game.  I didn't serve really well basically in the third set, but I feel confidence enough to break his service game.  I was there all the time trying to find a way of the return games.  I broke in the important moment of the match.  It was in the 4-All in the third set.  I played good game to close the match.   
 Q.  Did 6-0 feel good in the first match?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I feeling good on court.  It's not easy to start a tournament like that.  It's very important for me.  I have high expectation playing this tournament.  But I have to be calm and doing my way, just thinking about next round, and that's it.
