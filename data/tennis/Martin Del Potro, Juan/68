R. FEDERER/J. Del Potro   
6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Is this the best Roger has ever played?  Federer's backhand actually broke down the Nadal forehand in Indian Wells.  We had never seen that.  People say he could be at his best right now.  Do you agree with that?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, he always has a good backhand, but at the moment even better because he is moving so fast so that backhand and his legs are moving faster than years ago.   
I think that is the key of his improvement with the backhand.   
 Q.  Did he play the way you expected him to play?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, it's not easy play against Roger because he has good forehand, good backhand, slice, dropshot, everything.   
But think I did my best, and I had chance in both sets and I couldn't take it.  He played well in the break point moments, and I think that was the only difference of the match.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: And Acapulco.  Someone has to play with them.  Hopefully in the future I can change for a good draw.   
 Q.  I got in late.  I don't know if this was asked.  You haven't played him in quite a while.  The difference between Federer now and the last time you played, can you comment about that and how you're feeling about his level.  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He always play good tennis.  He's the best of the history.  I think today he made (indiscernible) better than me.  He played solid in the important moments.   
He's the guy winning the big events on this season, and I wish all the best to him.  Would be great if we see him in the top positions again.   
He's done so good, so maybe in a very short period he will be there.   
 Q.  (Regarding wrist strapping.)  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Because I was sweating too much.  Nothing important.
