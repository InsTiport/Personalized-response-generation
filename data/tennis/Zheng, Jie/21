 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How did the match go for you?

 Q. It was a good score line for you. 
 JIE ZHENG: Uh-huh. 

 Q. Was it easy, or what did you do to win?
 JIE ZHENG: Yeah, it's a little surprise so easy a win for this match, because I know she's play more aggressive. 
 So beginning I go to the court, I play more aggressive for her, then put a lot. I do so well in the beginning, first set. 

 Q. Your next round, what are your thoughts on that?
 JIE ZHENG: Yeah, I saw the TV. I play Kuznetsova and the sister of Alona Bondarenko. Both is very tough, because Kuznetsova is very stronger. I never beat her before. 
 I just want try my best, step by step.
