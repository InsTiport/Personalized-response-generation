THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Do you know much about your next opponent, Casey Dellacqua?  
JIE ZHENG:   I know her.   I play against her doubles US Open last year.   I don't play many times singles.   I play her many times for doubles.   
I know she's playing so aggressive and she do so well last year, the doubles.   Yeah, tough player because she's from here, is hometown for her.   For sure is many person support her.   
I just want focus for the match.   First I was so happy win today because Madison Keys is very tough.   I was so happy.   I don't thinking for next match too much.  
   
 Q.   She had a comfortable win.   Do you feel like you will recover well in time to meet her?  
JIE ZHENG:   Yeah, of course.   I saw her 6‑3, 6‑Love, right?   But Grand Slam have one day off.   This is a good news for me, yeah.
