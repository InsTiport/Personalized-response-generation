J. ZHENG/K. Clijsters
  3-6, 2-1 (Ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How do you feel the result for this match that your opponent Clijsters retired so you can go to the second round? How do you feel?
 JIE ZHENG: Third round.

 Q. Third round. Sorry. 
 JIE ZHENG: Yeah, I'm so surprised she retired, but I can feel she have maybe some problem. I don't know where, because she don't use the hard serve. She just kick serve.
 But for me on the court I just focus the match, so I don't know. I'm surprised she retire. 
 But is tough match for me. She is very good player. It's -- for me, I need fighting for every point, but today I feel like I play not so bad. Just first set I miss some breakpoints, yes. 

 Q. Did Kim say anything to you after the match or when you got back inside the change room?
 JIE ZHENG: No, I don't see her. I just go to the fitness room to do some stretch.
 But she retired. She coming to tell me she have some problem for her stomach muscle, yeah.
