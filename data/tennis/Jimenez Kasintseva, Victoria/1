5-7, 6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Must be very thrilled with that, not just for yourself personally but for the country you're representing, Andorra.  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Was a very tough tournament. I actually didn't think that I would win. I guess I fighted a lot for it. I was about to lose in some matches, and I just kept fighting. I guess that's how I won.   
 Q.  Can you tell us the story of how you started to play tennis.  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Well, I picked up my first racquet at three years old. But I started playing at six with my dad. He had a little academy. No, actually a big one. Yeah, I started there with other kids.   
I kind of started, like, professionally practicing two years ago when I moved to Barcelona, from Andorra to Barcelona. I still live in between them two. Yeah, that was when I started practicing.   
 Q.  You say you live in Andorra, but based in Barcelona. When it comes to representing a country, do you represent Andorra or Spain?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: No, I only represent Andorra. Yeah, I live in between them two.   
 Q.  You said yesterday it was crazy for you to be into the final. How do you express the emotions now to be champion?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Crazier (smiling).   
It's incredible. I'm just very, very happy to be here.   
 Q.  You fought very well today. What were the things that you were trying to change after she took the lead and won the first set?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: I started a bit nervous. I mean, playing on Rod Laver, there was people watching, I felt a bit, like, nervous. But then I calmed down and I started playing my tennis.   
I found a way to play better to her. I guess that's how I got the second set. The third set I managed to play like the second set. I think I started a bit nervous, so that's why I lost the first set.   
 Q.  What do you do when you're not playing tennis? Is there anything else that you are very good at?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Well, I only play tennis. Yeah, I mean, I don't really think I'm good. Yeah, I only play tennis.   
 Q.  Barcelona, is that an academy? Where are you splitting time there?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Yeah, I'm in my father's academy. Well, he has a small one. Yeah, sometimes I practice with other players. I try to play matches with other players. It depends.   
 Q.  Where is your next tournament?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Well, I'm going to do pre-season now, like one month of studying, a lot of physical preparation. Obviously I'm going to try to improve my shots. Then I'm going to play my first tournament, it's a 15K in March I think in France.   
 Q.  How do you manage your studies and tennis?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Well, I have teachers coming to my club. Yeah, I have a schedule.   
 Q.  On court you're a big fighter. Is that stubbornness part of your personality or just how you are on court?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Yeah, I have, like, very strong personality in a good and in a bad way. Yeah, I guess I have this power inside. I guess that's how I do those shots.   
 Q.  You won in Mexico. Was that the biggest title before this one?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Well, I've had some titles. For example, Roland Garros under-13, Godo under-14, of the other ITFs I won. Yeah, I think that was one of my favorite tournaments that I played until now. Well, I like them both. That was a very good tournament.   
 Q.  All of those victories, since this was your first Grand Slam, do you feel you were building to this?  
VICTORIA JIMENEZ KASINTSEVA: Yeah, I try to go step by step. I don't know. Now there's three more Grand Slams to go. I will see. I just go little by little. I don't want to rush. Tournament by tournament.
