 MODERATOR: Questions.  
 
Q. Congratulations on reaching the final of your very first attempt at the US Open. How
do you feel? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah, this is my first time and of course I'm so happy because I
was playing at US Open first time and from first time in the Finals, it's very good. Yeah,
today I was playing okay, but I think Maria Salerni, she was playing much better than me,
that's why maybe I didn't have enough (inaudible). But I'm so happy that I'm in the final
of a big tournament and from the first time.  
 
Q. How does this compare with the final at Wimbledon? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Sorry?  
 
Q. At Wimbledon, you also met Maria in the final. 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah, yeah.  
 
Q. Is this very different here? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah, that was big problem because they put the final on Court 1,
it was like Centre Court.  
 
Q. Is this in Wimbledon? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: And there was a lot of people and, like, maybe 5-6,000. I couldn't
do anything with my emotion. That's why it was a big problem with me to play there.  
 
Q. That was at Wimbledon?
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah.  
 
Q. But here?
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: No, but today, I like when the people are supporting me and it was
very good.  
 
Q. Overall, results aside, were you happy with the way you played today? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: What happened?  
 
Q. How did you play today? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: I played okay, but I felt a little bit tired because last few
matches I played three sets and she played her matches very easy, like 6-2, 6-1. I played
a lot. I felt tired. 
 
Q. Do you have an agent?
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah, I have.  
 
Q. Have you played any pro events? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: I played some weeks ago $50,000 in Turkey. I won the tournament.  
 
Q. Is that the only tournament? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: Yeah. My ranking, it's 211 now.  
 
Q. Will you play any more junior tournaments? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: I'm going to play last tournament now in New Orleans, Sugar Bowl,
and I think it's gonna be my last tournament.  
 
Q. Where do you train? 
 
 TATIANA PEREBIYNIS: In Ukraine.
