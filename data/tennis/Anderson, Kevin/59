THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Kevin.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the match, your impressions of James.   
KEVIN ANDERSON:   No, it was tough.   James played a couple games where I missed a few first serves, he really made me pay for it.   Two or three return winners.   
Just needed to serve a little bit better.   Not that I was serving poorly; just not making enough first serves.   I think he made it pretty tough for me.   
   
 Q.   You both played in Washington, would have met if you would have advanced.   Have you played him before?   
KEVIN ANDERSON:   It was the first time I played him.   
   
 Q.   What did you know coming in?  
KEVIN ANDERSON:   I watched James playing for a number of years, growing up watching him playing.   Obviously he's had a great career.   I've practiced with him a few times.   
I kind of sort of had an idea of what was coming.   He played true to his game style.   He played aggressive.   He went after it.   I thought he served pretty well.   
Not too many surprises on that front.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how your summer has gone so far.   
KEVIN ANDERSON:   Yeah, not the best so far.   Yeah, a couple tough matches now.   Definitely not playing the way I probably want to be playing.   Haven't had the form that I've wanted over the summer so far.   
I guess it's tough.   Sometimes it's a pretty long journey.   Just got to try to put it all behind me and keep looking ahead.   Sometimes it's pretty tough to do.   There's days where you're playing well and days where you're not playing so well.   Sometimes it lasts more than just one day.   
I just have to try to move on, use the following days just to try to keep getting better, maybe try to find a little bit more rhythm, and hopefully have a good Winton‑Salem leading up to the Open.
