A. MURRAY/K. Anderson
  6‑3, 6‑4

Q.   It's tough to play Andy when he's in that mood? 
KEVIN ANDERSON:   Yeah, it is.   He's a terrific player and has had such great success on all surfaces.   You know, it's just tough playing him here. 
I played him last year.   Always pretty tricky but great fun and wish him all the best for Wimbledon coming up.

Q.   You have had a great week yourself though. 
KEVIN ANDERSON:   Yeah, it's been terrific.   Close in that first match.   Managed to get through.   I really felt like I played some good tennis throughout the week.   I had some close matches.   My game went really well.   I can take a lot of pleasure from this week.

Q.   Everyone has enjoyed watching you play this week.   It's sort of perfect preparation for what's around the corner. 
KEVIN ANDERSON:   Well, thank you.   You know, I hope everyone has enjoyed my matches.   Some of them have been very close.
It's really fantastic playing here.   It's honestly one of the best.
