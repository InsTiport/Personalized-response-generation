  ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I would like to say hello and welcome to this press conference so we can make together a brief assessment of this 119th edition of the Monte‑Carlo Rolex Masters.   On behalf of all the organization, I wish to thank you once again for your presence and your loyalty.   
As has been the case for several years now, the Monte‑Carlo Rolex Masters was launched in the heart of Port Hercules in this exceptional surrounding of the new building of the yacht club of Monaco.   It has a panoramic view of 360 degrees over the palace, the casino, and the Mediterranean.   
Top No.1 player Novak Djokovic, a member of the yacht club, and then the holder of the trophy here, Stan Wawrinka, have participated in a mini tennis exhibition proposed in the framework of the Stars Program in cooperation with the ATP on the upper terraces of this spectacular building that was designed by Norman Foster and inaugurated last June.   
Then we went inside the yacht club for the draw that was done by the 2014 holder of the trophy of His Highness Prince Sovereign, Stan Wawrinka, always in this very nautical atmosphere.   
The highlights of that first day took place on center court in the Monte‑Carlo Country Club, with the exhibition called Marin and Friends.   That was a great success with the children because Marin Cilic, as a Monagasque resident, and winner of the last US Open, wanted to support two charity associations of the principality:   Special Olympics, the godmother of which is Her Highness Princess Charlene of Monaco, and Fight AIDS Monaco, chaired by Her Serene Highness Princess Stephanie of Monaco.  
I'd like to take this chance to thank Marin for his commitment and generosity.   He was surrounded by other players from the top 10:   Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic.   
There was also, apart from these activities, a private lunch organized in the Prince's palace between Their Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Monaco, and Roger and Mirka Federer.   
It is our tradition here.   Sunday is for children.   We had our Kids' Day organized for the great pleasure of 1,600 children who participated in the various activities in our animation area with the valuable support of our partners who offered many presents throughout the day.   
We also played tennis.   We must underline here that we broke a record in terms of quality of our draw and field.   It's the first time in the history of a Masters 1000 that 15 out of the 16 seeded players were able to reach the Round of 16.   I really would like to thank all the players for their loyalty to this tournament.   
This year, it's different from other years because in 2014 the Monte‑Carlo Rolex Masters had an unprecedented final that was 100% Swiss between Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.   But this year neither of them has reached the quarterfinal.   
This year, in 2015, it confirms the return of Rafael Nadal, and also that Novak Djokovic, No.1 in the world, is in control.   They both offered us a beautiful semifinal yesterday.   We should not forget the good progression of GaÃ«l Monfils, who was able to use best his wild card by reaching for the first time the semifinal in our tournament, playing Tomas Berdych.   
At 2:30, the audience will be able to watch a fight between two Monagasque residents, Novak Djokovic, No.1 player in the world, who is trying to get his second title in the principality, and Tomas Berdych, who is a seeded player No.6, and top 8 in the world, trying to conquer his first title on the courts of the Monte‑Carlo Country Club.   
Now I'm going to give you some figures.   For tickets, this year was a very good year.   It was a great success with a total amount of 134,795 spectators.   We also reached our maximum capacity on a daily basis, and from Tuesday to Sunday we were sold out.   
What is exceptional is that we had anticipated bookings and purchases even for the Prince's Court, which was also full as far as bookings on Wednesday and Thursday, even before the tickets started to be sold.   
You, too, my friends, you have never been so numerous.   We were very pleased also to welcome newcomers from Japan, Taiwan, and also we are happy to have CNN back with Pat Cash.   
You were more than 370 accredited journalists representing approximately 20 countries.   This means we need to keep improving and developing your conditions of work.   We are already working on our 2016 edition for that.   
Now we are going to watch the doubles final starting at 11:30, then the singles the 2:30.   
In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention that at 2:10 this afternoon, you will have than a exceptional ceremony taking place on center court just before the final with the presence of the Carabiniers Company of the Prince, for the first time here in our facilities.   
Before giving the floor to Alain Manigley, who will give the awards to the winners of the photo competition, and to Stephane and Yann, that I thank for organizing this press tournament, sponsored by Sergio Tacchini, who will be offering to all those who participated a complete outfit.   
I would like to thank you all very warmly.   I would like to make an appointment with you for our next edition of the Monte‑Carlo Rolex Masters, which will take place from the 9th to the 17th of April, 2016.   
I will be available answer individually your questions.   
   
 Q.   When we work here, we are in a family, so to speak.   It's always the same people at the desk.   Everything is nice.   The thing I would ask is to have complete statistics on paper, not only on the TV screen, because we have to do a very difficult job with our fingers to get the statistics on the screen, then they disappear.   We would need something in a printed version.   Here it's fantastic, but I would like to see we would need a red light to control the people going back and forth to the lunch.   This is more a joke.   Also we would need the statistics about the nationality of the spectators.   For example, it would be interesting for us to know there are 9% Italian spectators, for example.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   Well, for the first question about having the statistics about the forehands, backhands, unforced errors, I would need to talk with the ATP, try to find a technological solution to this.   
As to the red light, well, it was a joke.   
   
 Q.   And also I have a major complaint.   The transcripts come too quickly (laughter).   I don't even have time to leave the press conference room and go to my desk and they're there.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   I can tell you right now we had 87 nationalities this year.   We'll have more statistics about the major countries, France, Italy, Monaco, and major European countries.   
   
 Q.   This tournament does a lot in a very small space.   Maybe you should investigate among the Italian clubs nearby whether there are some improvements to be made in terms of queuing up for the tickets, prices for the food.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   We regularly carry out complete studies, not only in the nearby Italian clubs, but it's a general study.   We had two or three years ago students in marketing doing for us a study of that kind.   Thanks to the results of that study, we lowered the price for sandwiches, to give you a detail.   
Generally speaking, we have no major complaints or remarks from the crowd.   They seem to be okay with what we do.   
   
 Q.   Having been here 40 years, I'd like to congratulate for the constant progress that you have done year after year.   I'd like to know if you're thinking about some more improvements for next year, if you have ideas already.   Secondly, I would like if you could come out with a solution for the interviews because in certain tournaments you're allowed to take pictures, in some others you're allowed to take videos, in some places they say they have to protect the TV rights, but then maybe there are no TV in the past days to film Fognini and Bolelli after their match.   In my opinion, it would be better to have something than nothing.   If there is no other TV, why ask to the websites to not film.   It's communication that could be spread around the world.   I'm just suggesting that a policy should be found for that, because it's a little bit unclear.   We never know exactly what to do.   Two years ago there were people taking pictures or sending movies through the telephone.   They said that you can only do it if you're a professional.   This year we didn't know what to do.   I think in general it should be considered in a way, even if you want to protect your TV rights, you could say, No more than three minutes and you have the rights to show what is happening.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   First of all, thank you for the compliment, from someone that comes here for 40 years.   We do appreciate that.   
The question about the new projects.   Yes, we have a short‑term, medium‑term and long‑term projects, whether you think it's possible or not, because we are operating with a relatively small space.   
The first short‑term project is taking place already.   After the tournament we will start enlarging the players' area.   It's under the building where the boutique is.   You cannot see it from here.   We'll get more medical services, the gym will be there.   I think the players are a priority so they will get the benefit of this project first.   
There is a medium‑ and long‑term project that concerns the area of Entrance No.4.   It's from the Esplanade du Prince, you don't know exactly what it is.   There is a major project there that we will build already parking for our TV compound so we will leave free the whole area where the TV compound is, they will be able to put their trucks and installations.   
In the same area there will be another building where we could put some more restaurants, we will be moving maybe the press interview room.   We know this is not the best solution.   There will be a press interview room, mixed zones and everything, concerning the press.   As I said, this is medium‑ to long‑term project.   It's a costly project because the land is very expensive here.   
I hope we can achieve that in a couple of years.   
   
 Q.   I'd like to like to add my compliment to ASAP and the transcripts because it's a great service and I'm asking in 10 years in Rome to have that.   It's a great service.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   Sure, we will put that down.   
In answer to the most sensitive question.   You said the policy was not clear about images and videos here.   Well, it is clear.   It is extremely clear.   Only the right holders have the right to film here.   This is to protect the rights of the rights holders.   
The ATP media was clear with us.   Only the cameras from the rights holders are allowed to film here.   
   
 Q.   But the ATP said it was a gray zone.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   Well, it no longer is.   Now it's very clear.   No mobile phone filming, no websites, only the right holders in this interview room.   
   
 Q.   How important is it to have CNN, such an international media company, at your event?   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   Yes, it's very important.   It's extremely important to have such an important media, world famous, one of the most important players in television and media field in the world interested in our event.   
They came last year.   Although they are not filming the matches and stuff, they are interested in the event.   It's an enormous exposure for our event.   And Pat Cash, a former player, he knows tennis, the tournaments and the players.   He can do nice and very useful interviews with the players or with the organization.   
   
 Q.   Especially because it is the first season tournament of the clay season so it's an important event to have shown worldwide.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   We feel it's important because, as you said, it's the first Masters Series in Europe.   It's a reputable event.   It's prestigious and known in the world.   CNN was looking for something like that.   I'm sure they have other events on their agenda and schedule, but they started in Monte‑Carlo, and we were very happy.   
   
 Q.   A suggestion about the stats.   In Miami, SAP sign with the WTA.   They have been doing a great job.   They have all the stats.   Miami we have the social media wall they created.   You have a lot of stats with you to download on your food.   They're developing something with the players.   The coaches are going to have this information, as well.   How many backhands Serena missed or how many first serves.   It's something that is working really well.   Maybe something that would work well with you guys because they're really doing a good job.   
ZELJKO FRANULOVIC:   We're working on improving our technology.   This year we did our app.   We are not the fastest, but we like to do things properly, well‑studied.   The app was new technology this year.   I'm sure we can improve on this field also.   
Thank you very much.
