K. PERVAK/A. Petkovic
  6-4, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What went wrong today?
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: I think I just had a black day. I just didn't feel the ball at all. I didn't move well. 
 I think when I started waking up, she played better in the important moments.

 Q. Because you looked like you had it back in the second.
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah, I think I was doing better in the second, and I feel like -- I felt like the match is going to turn now.
 But I think also she played really well in the important moments. Maybe she played better than me definitely in the important moments. Yeah.
