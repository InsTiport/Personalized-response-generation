A. PETKOVIC/K. Flipkens
  6‑7, 6‑3, 6‑2

Q.   Give us your verdict on the match today. 
ANDREA PETKOVIC:   Well, I think I played really well in the third set.   I played well in the second, and I played so‑so in the first. 
But Kirsten is not a great match‑up for me.   I always struggle against her.   I don't necessarily like the players that change the rhythm a lot and they play a lot of slices.   I always struggle with those players and I always struggle with Kirsten.   And I think she played really well, especially in the first set. 
I'm just very happy to get through.   I was able to step up my game in second and third set. 

Q.   How do you find the conditions here?
ANDREA PETKOVIC:   Actually today was pretty good with the wind.   Yesterday and days before, it was very windy and it was difficult to serve, but today was actually‑‑ it was kind of windy, but compared to the other days it was still.   So I felt really good on my serve and I think I served really well.   So that was nice to play in.
I thought timing was really good for me, the time of day, because it was really nice to play.   It wasn't as cold.   It was beautiful.   The center court looks really nice.   It was a pleasure to play, definitely.
