Y. PUTINSEVA/A. Petkovic   
6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Singles match didn't go your way.  What are you thinking of your confidence level on court?  What wasn't working, I guess?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: I think it was just a no-show.  I don't know.  I wasn't feeling like my strokes were bad, it was just that I -- God, I have the French word in my head -- my footwork.   
Sorry, my footwork was just not on pointe.  I was always a little too close, too far, and I missed a lot of shots just for a few centimeters.   
In the end that made huge difference.  I would say my legs were not there at all.  Once they arrived it was already too late against such a tough player like her because she was already leading.   
She was so much in front tat it was too late for me to pick it up again.  She is definitely an uncomfortable player.  I feel like I have the weapons to beat her normally.  It was just not on pointe today.  Not at all.   
 Q.  Just wondering where is your head at the moment?  How are you feeling in general about your tennis?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, I'm definitely disappointed and I'm definitely feeling like I should do much better.  I feel like my results should be better, especially after two great weeks in Dubai and Doha.  I was playing very well.   
I feel like I lost a few close matches in Indian Wells and Miami, and I lost my confidence after that.  Was really difficult for me to regain it.   
I had a couple tough draws with Madison Keys in Rome first round and Bacsinszky in Madrid, and then it's difficult to get back in the groove.   
Yeah, definitely not happy with the place I am at right now.  The most important part is that I'm willing to work; I'm ready, too.  I've been through much worse than a couple of bad results.   
It's not a thing of attitude or lacking of attitude or work.  It's just a matter of lacking of confidence, and I'm ready to dig myself out of there.   
 Q.  Is it tough to dig when you have grass coming next?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, I will dig, but maybe literally on the court.  (Laughter.)   
Yeah, definitely doesn't help.  I would prefer to have a few more tournaments on clay right now.  Last year actually played quarters in Eastbourne and I did a couple of third rounds in Wimbledon.   
So I'm just going to go out there, keep fighting, keep working hard and waiting for my moment, even if it's on grass.  (Smiling.)   
 Q.  I know you talked about this being your first Olympics.  How big a motivation is that for you?  We've seen some players be less than enthusiastic.  For you, are you still all in on getting that dream done?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah, I definitely am looking forward.  Honestly I haven't thought about it so much because I really don't know what to expect at all.  It's difficult to look forward and be happy about something when you don't know what to expect at all, especially I've never been to Brazil, never been to Rio, never been to the Olympics.   
So much new things going on that I don't know what I'm looking forward to, but I guess I am looking forward to it.  Just the excitement of being around so many athletes and feeling the atmosphere.  Yeah, we'll see.
