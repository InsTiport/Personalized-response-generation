  6-1, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How did you feel about this match?
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah, I think I rushed at the beginning. Especially I think in between the points, I tried to take my time. But the points I rushed, I tried to go for the winner too fast. Vera, she moves unbelievably. So this was really just the wrong approach. 
 But I was nervous definitely for the first time, playing for the first time in Arthur Ashe in a night match. 
 I think I take it as a big experience, so I have this also, check, and moving forward now. 

 Q. What was the thing that was the most interesting or difficult about being out there? 
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: I think it was just, uhm, I didn't keep -- well, I was trying to focus, but there were so many things. You know, it's difficult to explain. But, you know, you see there is so many, like, coming to you.

 Q. Stimuli?
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah. I had my cap, and I tried to pull it down, but it was a disturbing so it was just a new situation. 
 I think in the end I got into the match, but it was far too late already. But I think the next time it will be definitely a different story. And I'm happy that I have this experience now. Because the last time I was on a similar stage, I tore my ACL. So I think I move forward from there (smiling). I will, yeah, move forward in the future as well.
