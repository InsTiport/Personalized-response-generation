 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Talk me through your match today and how you were feeling on the court.
 ANDREA PETKOVIC:   Yeah, I felt great from the middle of the second set.  I think I just started really, really slow, just couldn't find my footing and my rhythm and obviously Ons was playing well.  She just has definitely a game that -- whose goal is it to throw you off the rhythm and she managed to do so.
 But then once I found my footing, once I found my footwork and my strokes I felt really good, and then I lost the third set with one break, which was very unfortunate, and I'm probably going to dream about that one double fault I hit on a game point, but all in all I think if I just look at the second and the third set, I can be somewhat satisfied -- okay, not satisfied, but somewhat okay with how I played.
