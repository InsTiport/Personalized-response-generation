 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. A tough match?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah, I think I slept in the first set a little bit, but afterwards I think it was a tough match. It was a good match.  
 Caroline, she did what she always does: she force me to errors in the tiebreak. I gave a little bit too many presents, three or four unforced errors, and that's the difference against her.  
 But I think after I found my rhythm in the second set it was a good match. The first set I was sleeping. My legs were not moving at all.  
  
  Q. But why were you asleep?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: I don't know. I warmed up really well, and I always warm up for an hour or so. It cannot be that. I was just -- I don't know. You know, it sometimes happens. After two days waiting it can happen.   
 Caroline started off pretty well. She didn't miss at all, and my legs were not moving well, and afterwards when I found my rhythm it was fine. It was just a couple of balls that made the difference, and unfortunately it didn't go my way.  
  
  Q. Do you think Caroline has a chance against Serena in the semifinal?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Oh, I think so. I saw the match against Anastasia today, and I think if Caroline plays really well and if she changes up the rhythm and plays as consistent as she is always, she definitely has chances.  
 I think Caroline is one of the most underestimated players out there, because you have to win each and every point against her. If you don't do it, you lose.  
 If Serena plays well, it's tough to beat her. But anybody, you know, can -- will lose against her if she's on fire. But if Serena, you know, struggles a little bit and Caroline plays consistent, she definitely has her chances.
