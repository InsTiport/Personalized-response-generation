S. HALEP/A. Petkovic   
7-5, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  The other day, in our fun press conference, you said that you would write about the tournament maybe first as a tragedy, but then you changed it to a comedy.  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  How would you write about today's match?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, it was two different matches, right?   
In the first set, I played really well.  I played what I wanted to do.  I really stuck with my game plan.  I came to the net a lot of times, and I managed to do everything I wanted.  And I think it was a set on a very high level from both of us.   
And then this thing with my knee happened.  I knew immediately it wasn't something terrible, because I had had it before, but I pinched -- it's complicated.  I had my ACL surgery there, and so the ACL that they put in is not as firm as the one before, so I have a little more give than normal knees.   
And so when something happens -- so I wanted to slide, and there was not enough clay.  So I kind of got stuck, and then I pinched one of the ligaments in my meniscus.   
And it happens every now and then, so I know what it is, but it's really painful.  And then it kind of throws me off my focus.  And it's really painful for, like, two or three days, and then it sort of subsides.   
So I knew it was that, so that's why I tried to fight through.  And I took a painkiller and I tried to play with the tape.   
But against a player like Simona, it's impossible to be -- then I tried to go for more and just tried to hit winners from one shot, which is ridiculous against Simona so...  and then everything sort of just crumbled from there.   
 Q.  So just talk about the importance of a healthy body, without that, you know just in our sport.  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, obviously, against the best players in the world, you have to be at 100%.   
I played a really good first set, and I still lost it.  So with just half of it, it's not going to work.   
You know, it's a Grand Slam, so you're going to put everything in it and try everything you can.  But it was pretty clear that that was not going to work, unfortunately.   
And I was so annoyed just because it was such a great atmosphere and so nice to play there.  And I knew I couldn't play at my best after that.  So I was just super annoyed.   
 Q.  You just touched upon it towards the end of your answer.  I wanted to know is it a mixed kind of emotion?  Because you showed yourself that you can go toe to toe with her in the first set.  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  But at the same time, this happened, and as you know your history with that part of your body.  So what kind of emotions do you have?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, I think that was the thing.  I was very, very annoyed.  I wasn't, like, sad or anything.  I was just so annoyed.   
Because I wanted to put up a fight and also give the fans what they came for, because it was such an awesome atmosphere.  There were a lot of Germans, a lot of Romanians, so it was really so amazing to play.   
And we played really, really great level in the first set.  And I just wanted to continue that, no matter if I lose or win, and then afterwards I can sit down with my coach and make an analysis of it and try to learn from it.   
But like this, I knew it wasn't going to work against Simona, but then also I don't want to retire.  So it's just annoying.  That's the right word, I think.  It's just annoying.  And, yeah, I'm still kind of annoyed by it.   
Because at least if I break my knee, then I can go, like, "Ahhh," and get carried off the court or something (laughing).   
But I know I'm going to be fine in three days.  I know exactly what it is.  But it's just painful now for these couple of days.  And that's not enough against a player like Simona.   
 Q.  There was a bit of an outrage on Twitter and online about just the fact that this match was on Court 18, which is actually a nice court, as you said.  It's new.  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  Were you surprised that the match was scheduled there?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: I was surprised, yes.  And not because of me, but, obviously, Simona is the No. 1 in the world.  So my coach just texted me, So you're playing third match on Court 18.   
And I was surprised, but then, when I looked at the schedule, honestly, I wouldn't have known how to make the schedule either.  There were so many amazing matches.   
And in the end, a lot of matches were very -- is it a word?  Lopsided? -- yeah, lopsided.   
But just by the names of it, you know, it was so many matchups that are amazing.  It was difficult to make the -- I wouldn't have wanted to be in those shoes.   
And then when we went out on court, I think both of us were -- I don't know about Simona.  She's, obviously, the one that is used to playing the bigger courts in the last years.   
But, for me, when I came out on court, it was just an awesome atmosphere.  It's really beautiful court, yeah.   
 Q.  We're not going to see you for a little while probably till Wimbledon.  So please allow me to ask a question relating to the last press conference.  I was fascinated by your work with movies.  Is there a movie or two that really somehow relates to sports or that touches you?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, I don't want to be the pretentious ass here, like, always.  But I don't really watch sports movies.  I like art house movies.   
So I don't know.  I like the weird French "nouvelle vague" stuff that are really boring, but really pretty people look melancholily out of the window.  And there is always, like, a triangle sort of thing, nobody is happy, and somebody dies in the end.  Those are the movies that I really like.   
 Q.  So that is good drama?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: Yes, I guess so.   
 Q.  How difficult is it to play against Simona?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: It's great, actually.  I love playing against her because she's such a great player, and she pushes you to play your best tennis; right?  And she also allows you -- because she's not like Serena who overpowers you.  She's not as strong and tall, so she needs to use all of her talent.   
And she really makes you go the extra mile and play the extra shot.  She made me play a drop shot and go to the net.  So well done Simona; right?   
But you really need to pull out the whole repertoire to be able to beat her because she's just so crafty and smart.  She opens the court really well.  And when you play little short, that's really -- that was maybe the most amazing thing today.  I knew right away from the get-go in the rally, if I'm going to win it or not.  Because the moment I got deep, I knew I would have the chance to make the point.   
But as soon as you're a little short, she starts opening you up and you run and run and run, and you hope and you pray to God for your life, but in the end you still lose the point.  So that's kind of annoying too.   
But it's really amazing to play her because it's really old tennis.  "Old tennis," I put it in quotes, quotation marks, just because it's -- she has to build the points, especially on clay.  Maybe it's a little different on other surfaces, but on clay she really has to build the point.   
And she makes you -- she opens the court, and she plays it very geometrically, which is beautiful to see, not so beautiful to play against.   
 Q.  And if you could just take a moment and sort of the story of the tournament is Rafa going for his 11th.  As an elite athlete, what does that mean to you that this guy is going for his 11th?  
ANDREA PETKOVIC: It's awesome.  I mean, I don't have one, and he has 11 of these ones.  So that gives you an idea.  No, I mean -- and best of five, and he's just...   
But this is such a blessing to be part of this sport, just to be -- just to be a part of these legends.  You know, may it be Rafa or Roger or playing against somebody like Simona, and be in the same locker room like Serena Williams and all these players.  It's just a blessing.  I'm very thankful for that.   
And I appreciate and cherish every moment that I get to spend on tour because it's not going to be a lot longer.  I'm old now.  I'll really old.   
Young for life; old for tennis.  That's my new motto.
