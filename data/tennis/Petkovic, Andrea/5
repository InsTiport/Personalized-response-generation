THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I won't ask you about the match.  If you let me, I'd like to ask about provocation in tennis.  Have you ever experienced some opponents told you something rude or did something to make you lose your concentration during the match?
ANDREA PETKOVIC: No.
Q. No, never?
ANDREA PETKOVIC: No.
Q. What's your opinion about this kind of tactic?  Fair, unfair?
ANDREA PETKOVIC: I have no opinion on that.  Sorry.  I cannot help you.
