 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. When are you gonna run for prime minister?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: That takes a while, like another 10 years.  
  
  Q. What are your feelings about New York?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: I love New York and the I love the energy and the life going on in the city. I'd really like to take a stroll through the city and just feel the life and the energy. I really enjoy myself here.  
  
  Q. How would you describe the energy?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: It's just something like something vibrant. I love the culture. There is something artistic in the air, free spirits, a lot of creative minds out there.   
 Yeah, it's very vibrant and creative.  
  
  Q. Most players just stay by the hotel, but do you go down to the Village or explore?  
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, I just like to take a stroll through the city, but just away from the tourist attractions and by inspiration go and see and discover what happens.   
 But of course not for five hours because I have to play matches, obviously. But, yeah, that's what I try to do sometimes when I get some time.  
  
  Q. What will a successful Open be for you today? This year?   
 ANDREA PETKOVIC: Well, you know, I have been struggling a little bit with my physical state right now, so it's already a big success for me being in the second round. I didn't expect to play at all, so for me, being able to play is a big success.   
 So I don't really focus on results this much at that point of my state that I am in.
