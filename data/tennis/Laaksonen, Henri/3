J. ISNER/H. Laaksonen
4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Severin, thought on those two matches.  At times the first one was close; certainly the second one was very close.
SEVERIN LUTHI: Yeah.  I think we had a good start in both matches.  Marco's match I think it was maybe the same level in the first set, then, yeah, I think at one stage you saw a little bit the different.
Then I was happy how Henri started and hung in there.  Yeah.  I would love to see a fifth set there.
Q. Henri, your thoughts on that match with this start.  Isner picked it up in the second and third sets, but, again, could have been a five setter with that fourth set.
HENRI LAAKSONEN: I mean, I started really well.  I was holding my serve and then I got some break points in the 4-3 game and then I break him to 6-4.  I was holding my serve I think quite easily and felt comfortable on my own serves.
Yeah, I knew that I will have few chances on his serve and he's serving big.  I think -- I don't know if I had break chances on every set, but I could create some break chances at least in the first set.
I don't know if I had in beginning of the second set, and then fourth set I had as well some break points.  I mean, just, yeah, I didn't serve that well that he could win the second and third set a bit too easily.
Then I hung in there the fourth set.
