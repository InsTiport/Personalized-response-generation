  Q.  How are you feeling now?  I mean, how happy are you?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  I'm very happy.  I felt like I went out there and, you know, executed my game plan and, you know, played with a lot of energy and of course, you know, she's a player that I have so much respect for.  I think she's 3 in the world right now.  So I'm feeling very excited right now.   
  Q.  What went right for you today?  What was the difference today?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  You know, I feel like I served really well.  I don't think she had one breakpoint the whole match, which is a very good stat for me.  An also, I felt like I was hitting my backhand down the line very well, which was opening up the points, and coming into the net to finish the points quite a bit.   
 Overall, I think I played a pretty solid match.   
  Q.  I covered the match when you beat, I guess, Venus.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Uh-hmm.   
  Q.  When she was No. 2 here in 2003 I believe.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Yep.   
  Q.  How does this one today compare to that?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  It's different.  I mean, they were both pretty special matches.  This one is very special because I've been struggling lately, and haven't been playing my best tennis.  So to go out and play a match like that against Justine, it means a lot to me and I'm hoping to use this to really gain some confidence and start playing really well.   
  Q.  This was your best match in how long, to give perspective?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Probably a couple years.  I mean, it's, you know -- it's not often you beat a player like that.  So it's been a while.   
  Q.  What's happened in the past couple years?  You said you've been struggling.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  You know, I'm 26 now.  I've been on the tour for 10 years.  There's always ups and downs in careers.  I've just had a little bit of a bad patch the last couple years.  I think that I can use this match to really start turning things around.   
  Q.  Your plans after this?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  From here I'm going to go to Amelia Island and then Charleston, go home for a couple weeks and start in Europe on the clay.   
  Q.  Did you hear about Andre Agassi pulling out.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  No.  What's going on?   
  Q.  He had a big press conference and said with all his injuries, he wants to take some time off.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Uh-hmm.   
  Q.  Perhaps a very long time off to try to get better.  He still thinks he can play, but he can't win now.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Uh-hmm.   
  Q.  That was all going on, I guess, while you were playing.   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Yeah.   
  Q.  A lot of people here.  I don't know if you know him at all or...   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Yeah.   
  Q.  Any comment on that?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, I think, you know, Andre will definitely know his body and knows when he needs some time off to get stronger.  I think if he believes he can still play, I mean, it's obvious that he can so, you know, he's gonna do it the way that he needs to do it.   
  Q.  Is he a player that most other players, men and women, respect?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, he's achieved so much.  He's a great person.  I mean, I have so much respect for him.   
  Q.  Do you feel like your opponent today had any injury problems or was struggling?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  I know she had her knee wrapped up.  I know she's been feeling something going on in her knee, but I don't know much more about it than that.   
  Q.  You said in 2003, after you had defeated Venus, "I love for these times."  Does that still hold true, when you get a big upset?   
 MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, you know, to go out in a tournament like this on center court, playing against a top 5 player, it's just so much energy out there.  You know, that's what all the hard work and all the training, those are the times that I play for.  I think most players do.  It's so exciting, you know, with all the public.  It's a great feeling.
