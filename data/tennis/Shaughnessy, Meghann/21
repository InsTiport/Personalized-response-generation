MODERATOR:  Questions for Meghann.  
 
 
Q.  When you play here, how similar is it to the Arizona desert?  A lot of similarities or differences?  Is it pretty consistent?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  It's pretty similar.  The weather, it's nice and warm, conditions are dry.  It's pretty similar to playing at home in Arizona.  
 
Q.  What was your injury?  It was a back injury?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Lower back. 
 
Q.  And how is that feeling so far? 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Very good.  After Australia, I had five weeks of rehab.  It's holding up well.  I don't have any more pain.  It's staying strong, so hopefully it will maintain itself. 
 
Q.  Has it been a drastic change in your comfort level from Scottsdale to here?  What did you do to get ready differently?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Definitely.  Scottsdale, I was still a little bit tentative.  I hadn't really been able to test my back yet.  That's not an excuse.  I mean, Dechy played very well.  Here, it felt good.  It felt good during my match in Scottsdale, so here I was much more confident with it. 
 
Q.  Maybe the injury in Scottsdale, it was more mentally trying to get over it? 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Definitely.  Because it felt fine while I was playing in Scottsdale.  It was just mentally I was a little bit hesitant, didn't know how far I could push it.  
 
Q.  Dechy is having a pretty good tournament here so far, too. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Yeah, she's playing great.  
 
Q.  Did you get a chance to watch any of her match yesterday?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  No, I didn't.  
 
Q.  With a lot of the Americans not playing, have you started taking a look at the draw closely?  I know you guys try not to.  The temptation must be there a little bit. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Not really.  I'm just taking it one match at a time.  It doesn't matter what draw anybody has; you just have to focus on yourself and worry about playing good tennis.  
 
Q.  Have you won a Tier I yet?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  No. 
 
Q.  Do you feel like this could be maybe the breakthrough?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Of course.  That's the attitude I have.  You know, I'm playing well.  Hopefully I'll just keep gaining confidence and play better with each match. 
 
Q.  Seems like you got stronger as this match went along, once you got to the second set. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Definitely.  I played pretty well in the second round.  Today I even played much better.  I think I'm just going to keep improving from here.  
 
Q.  Last year was your first year here at this tournament. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  No, I've been here many years  - in qualifying. 
 
Q.  Last year was your first main draw?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Maybe my third.  I think I was here two years before in the main draw.  Maybe you're right.  I can't even keep track.
