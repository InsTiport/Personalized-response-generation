THE MODERATOR:  That must have been one of the toughest matches you played.  
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  Thanks.  It was a tough one.  Couldn't have been any closer.  Like I said, I'm so happy to pull that one through.  I struggled a little bit finding my rhythm the entire match.  But gave it all I had.  I was happy to come out with a win.  
 
Q.  I put it to Billie Jean, you're a bit of a fall guy in the sense it seemed all about her, you had a lot to lose, she had nothing to lose. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  It's her first Fed Cup.  She's 17 years old.  I'm the much higher-ranked player.  She was going to go out there and go for it.  It's dangerous when someone is not playing with much pressure, they're a little bit looser and they go for their shots.  It's always a little bit dangerous. 
 
Q.  One of the features of the way you played from 3-5 down in the third set was you hardly made any mistakes. 
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  I tried to just play solid.  At the same time I wanted to go for my shots because she's a pretty aggressive player.  I knew if I didn't go for it, she would.  I was also trying to do that, as well. 
 
Q.  Is there a feeling in the team that having won this one, that's the semifinal pretty much done?
 
MEGHANN SHAUGHNESSY:  No.  You know, we've got to take it one match at a time.  We have three matches tomorrow.  We'll have to play well to win them.  We're going to get a good night's sleep tonight and hopefully play some great tennis tomorrow.
