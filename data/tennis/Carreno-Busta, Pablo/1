  P. CARRENO-BUSTA/J. Millman
 6-2, 6-4
 Q. How important was it to get your team to a winning start?
 PABLO CARRENO-BUSTA:   Obviously it's very important to us to win the first match.  When I woke up I didn't know if I wanted to play or not.  Finally Rafa couldn't play, so I am here to try to help my team.  Obviously the first match of the season is always difficult, but I think that I played really a good match, feeling very comfortable on court, so happy for the victory.  Of course now continue fighting, because they play at home and they're a really good team and we have to continue.
 Q. What was the key to winning?
 PABLO CARRENO-BUSTA:   I think that I play with a lot of rhythm, good rhythm.  Probably I play with confidence also.  I didn't get off to a good start, but I think that probably I play better than I can imagine before.
 Q. Talk about the honor of representing your country and winning in the ATP Cup.
 PABLO CARRENO-BUSTA:   Yeah, it's very special, no?  To represent our country, Spain, it's very important to us.  It's a different feeling that we play like a team, it's very special and I like it, no?
 So I'm happy for the victory and, like I said before, it's very important to us to start with this point, with this victory, so now try to enjoy the moment and continue.
