THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was that a useful experience for you?  
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah.   I'd say it was a very useful experience.   Obviously I've never played a guy that ranking or that level before.   It was a big eye‑opener for what I need to improve on.   I think you learn from your mistakes, and I'll push on from it.   
   
 Q.   Difficult to play someone who serves quite that huge in your first grass‑court experience and something like the conditions like this, isn't it?   
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah, and obviously on grass, as well, the serve is going to come down at you pretty quick.   When I saw I was going to play Gilles, pretty obvious he was going to serve pretty big.   
I've seen him play before, and that's probably one of the biggest assets of his game.   I think his favorite surface is probably on the grass.   That's probably the main reason.   
I think I actually handled it a lot better than I thought I would, especially at the start.   I had a few break points and a few Love‑30s on his serve, and he played a few good points, put down a few aces which you've got to expect against him.   On that day he was just too good.   
   
 Q.   What are the main positives you can take from that?  
LIAM BROADY:   I mean, obviously I don't think I played my A game.   I think I could have played a lot better.   Off the ground I think a lot of the time I was 50/50 with him.   
I think obviously first ATP, first round, it was good to get the experience under my belt almost for maybe another time or hopefully in a year or two's time play another ATP.   I think it's just a good way to get started.  
   
 Q.   What would you say is the main difference between someone like him who has been around for 10 years, more than that, maybe, and someone like yourself just starting?   What's the general feeling out there?  
LIAM BROADY:   I think there's a few differences.   I said it earlier.   I said, you know, it's just consistency.   He's very consistent with his game.   He knows how to play on the bigger points.   He knows where to put the ball.   Obviously the serve, as well.   He's got a much better serve than I have.  
Yeah, that's all I can stress, really.   He's very calm and very collected and he never really looked in doubt.   I mean, he's beaten some fantastic players, as well.   So obviously, like you say, he's been around for a long time and knows what to do.   
   
 Q.   As a fellow left‑hander, do you get my hints, or does it go by too quickly?  
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah.   I mean, obviously off the serve I think every left‑hander knows that you need to use the swing out wide a lot and those sort of things, and into the body and all that sort of stuff, but I actually think his second serve was very decent which obviously at that level it has to be, as well.   That was probably one of the big things I noticed.     
Off the ground, like I said, he was very solid.
