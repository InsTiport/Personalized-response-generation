D. GOFFIN/L. Broady
  7‑6, 6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Did you feel that getting away from you a little the moment it went?
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah, I think obviously he's a very good player.   It was a very tight first set, nip‑and‑tuck, which is very positive for me considering he's 50 in the world. 
I think the longer the match went on, the more fatigued I became, which is obviously again something to work on. 
Started missing first serves, which then makes it even harder, because he's a fantastic returner.   He just didn't waiver for the entire match, and that's why he is where he is. 

Q.   When you were broke first game second set, I think that was a bit of a turning point. 
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah, I think, again, you know, he was just so solid for the whole match.   He knew when to apply pressure and when to sort of soak it up. 
I tried to fight until the end.   Sometimes it's tough because against these guys, if your legs are slightly tired or you are slightly off on the day, they take advantage of it.   That's what happened. 

Q.   The way you removed your shirt, what is that?
LIAM BROADY:   One is a lion, the other is Achilles. 

Q.   What is the story behind that?
LIAM BROADY:   The Achilles I had done about six months ago, and the lion about 18 months ago. 

Q.   Why those?
LIAM BROADY:   I don't really want to say (laughter). 

Q.   How long did it take? 
LIAM BROADY:   The Achilles took six hours.   The lion took four. 

Q.   Have you enjoyed the limelight the last couple days, feeding off the crowd?
LIAM BROADY:   I've absolutely loved it.   It's been fantastic.   You know, I felt at home, again, on court against David.   You know, he's 50 in the world, that first set, I felt fantastic.   We were pretty even.   He was a bit nervous maybe.   I was a bit nervous. 
But off the ground, it was grueling, as well.   I have to get used to that because the very best guys play with incredible intensity. 
Yeah, I've always said, I think I said before I played Marinko, and I said it after I played Marinko, I play well on the big stage, and again today, before the match got away from me, I played well.

Q.   Any unusual requests or anything happen the last couple days?
LIAM BROADY:   Not really, no.   I've seen a bit of talk about my beard.   Apart from that, no. 

Q.   What about the next few hours and days, what have you got lined up?
LIAM BROADY:   Well, obviously doubles tomorrow.   I'll have to go back and be sad this evening and get up tomorrow morning and be ready.   My tournament's not over. 
Play the doubles.   After that, I think I'll fly out to America.   I'll have a couple days off with a family in Pittsburgh that I know from playing futures last year.   I'll just switch off, not think about tennis for a few days, then I'll go again.   I'll have a training week and then I'll hit the ground running hopefully at the Binghamton challenger. 

Q.   Playing mixed doubles with Naomi?
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah, we signed in, but we didn't get a wild card.   I think there were some pretty strong entries, so...

Q.   Is that another sofa in Pittsburgh?
LIAM BROADY:   Well, they have a massive house, the family that we stay with.   How many players were there?   There was I think four or five British players staying there, and maybe three American players. 
I was sharing a bed there actually last year.   This year I don't think I will be. 

Q.   I saw your sister was there today.   Was your dad there today?
LIAM BROADY:   I don't think he was, no.   You know, he's my dad, he'll probably keep track of the scores and stuff I'm sure, because I am his son at the end of the day. 
I think it's best for me and for him that he stays away from the court.

Q.   Back to the travel and stuff.   What is the longest since you've been on the tour that you've stayed in one place?
LIAM BROADY:   One country or...? 

Q.   One house even. 
LIAM BROADY:   I think at the NTC maybe for a couple weeks, two, three weeks, yeah. 

Q.   Does it get to you?
LIAM BROADY:   Not massively.   When I was back in Manchester over Christmas, I start to get itchy feet to be honest now.   It used to get to me when I was younger.   I've grown to love it and I feel like sitting still at home and not doing anything, I feel like I need to get back out there and get to work again. 

Q.   Right at the end someone shouted, Finish him off.   You looked like you enjoyed that. 
LIAM BROADY:   The crowd, they've been fantastic these last few days.   They've made the experience for me.   Again, asked on Twitter yesterday that I could have one of the loudest crowds.   Considering the way the score went, they were in it for the whole match.   Even 7‑6, 6‑1, 5‑1 down, everyone was fully involved, having a laugh. 
I was enjoying myself.   Might not have seemed it at times, but I was enjoying myself.   I can appreciate that. 

Q.   Your beard actually has a Twitter account. 
LIAM BROADY:   Has it really? 

Q.   Are you planning to keep it?
LIAM BROADY:   I think I might give it a little trim, but I'll probably keep the majority of it, yeah. 

Q.   Does this drive you on, the experience of the last three or four days, drive you on to achieve even more here next year?
LIAM BROADY:   Yeah, it does.   I said to someone, they asked me how it felt after beating Matosevic.   I said I've got direction again.   As everyone knows, the tour is a bit of a slug and a grind.   It's tough to see the end.   That's the fantastic thing about slams, light at the end of the tunnel four times a year. 
Just, again, to know that I can compete with these best guys and still have so much to improve on and be reasonably tight with Goffin, it's immensely uplifting. 

Q.   BBC have compared your beard to Marty Smith in form.   Is that an insult?
LIAM BROADY:   I don't even know who that is.

Q.   He was from Manchester. 
LIAM BROADY:   Oh, God, was he (laughter)? 

Q.   In the middle of the second set, you gave us an interview halfway through, I'm just not making my first serve.   What's going on? 
LIAM BROADY:   It's frustrating because at times I serve really well.   Again, against Goffin, I served really well.   It tends to come in sporadic like.   I'll serve well three, four serves, maybe not again. 
But I think probably for the majority of the second and third set, my first serve dried up.   Against Matosevic in the third set my first serve dried up.   Sorry, in the fifth set against Matosevic. 
But I've been working on my serve since I first went to the National Centre.   That's one of the reasons why I went because they had good technicians in a sense there, and that was what really needed working on, was my serve technically.   I completely tore it apart. 
I remember, I was a meter from the net that first session, starting here, going like that.   I've slowly built it up over the years.   The last six months it's started to become a weapon.   I've started to get free points.   When you're going after the serve a lot, you're going to hit errors, as well.
