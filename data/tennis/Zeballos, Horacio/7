H. ZEBALLOS/I. Karlovic   
7-6, 7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  What was the key of this match and especially the tie-breaks?  
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: I think one of the key was to play on clay court.  He's a great player but, of course, he play better on hard court.  So today I have a little bit more time to know where he was serving.   
And I think I was playing very good, very solid.  I didn't do many mistakes, and I think that was the key.   
 Q.  I know it's a little bit straight to go so fast to the third round, but what do you think about your next opponent who is David Goffin?  
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Of course I know him.  I play against him many times.  I know he's a really good player.   
But like you said, let's enjoy today.  It's my first time I'm in the third round.  I have doubles tomorrow.  So I going to keep focused day by day, and then I will have time to think about Goffin.   
 Q.  Can I ask you what will be the key?  
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Of course it's going to be a really different match from today.  But I will try to be aggressive, to make him run.  And I hope I can be as solid as I be today.
