GRANOLLERS-ZEBALLOS/Chardy-Martin
6-4, 5-7, 10-8
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations on the win today.  I just wanted to ask you a little bit about how much this win means to both of you and what you were thinking specifically at 8-all in the match tiebreak when you decided to take the forehand up the line.
HORACIO ZEBALLOS:   Of course I think this is one of the best moments in my career.  You know, this tournament has a lot of history, and I watch it many, many years since I'm a little kid.
So this tournament is really important.  Winning Rome is a huge thing for me, and for sure for Marcel too.
What can I say?  I'm so happy, and you could see it in our faces when we finish the match, right?
Q. Marcel, you have won three titles and four clay finals this year.  You've got a 16-1 record on the surface this year.  I wanted to ask you about these achievements and what makes you guys so tough to beat on this surface.
MARCEL GRANOLLERS:   Yeah, I think before the first clay tournament of the year in Buenos Aires, I was long time without winning one match on clay, because last year I didn't win one match on all clay season.
So after Buenos Aires and Rio, I think we felt very good on court, playing together.  I think we both grow on clay playing when we was young.  We feel very good on clay.  I think we can play very good.
Yeah, we are very happy to win our third title of the year on clay.
