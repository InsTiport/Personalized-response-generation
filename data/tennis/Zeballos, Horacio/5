KONTINEN-PEERS/Mayer-Zeballos
3-6, 6-3, 10-2
Q. You must have felt good after the first set?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Yeah.  I think we played really good match.  They are such a really tough team.  They are No. 3 and 4 in the world.  That's why they keep focus and they won, no?
But it felt really good.  And to be second in such a big tournament is something very good for us.
Q. Yeah, it sets you up nicely for the year.  You get a lot of confidence from the tournament?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Yeah, of course.  This is the first tournament and we are in finals in doubles, and I won a match in singles.  So it's a really good performance for me for the first week.
Q. And the crowd out there was obviously on their side but it was a good atmosphere?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Yeah, they were very nice.  I mean, they wanted to see a good show, and I think it was a very nice match.  So I hope they enjoy it.
Q. And on to the Australian Open now, is it?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: To Auckland and then, yeah.
