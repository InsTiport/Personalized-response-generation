H. ZEBALLOS/D. Goffin
4-5, [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What did you see happening during the match when Goffin slipped?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: I was really -- I didn't see that.  I was running backward and I didn't saw the moment that he fall down.
But, of course, I'm very sad for him.  He's a great person.  I play against him many times.  Like, he always was really nice with me.  I hope he can come back as soon as possible because I always enjoy when he's playing because he's a nice player.  You know, so I hope he can come back soon.
Q. It's your best result here in Paris, but I guess it's not easy to enjoy it after this.  How do you feel?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Yeah, I don't know what to feel.  You know, of course, one part I'm a little happy because it's my best tournament.  But also I'm sad for him.  Like I said before, he's a really nice person.  So it's like mixed emotions.
Q. You said you didn't see it.  I don't know if you heard, but he ran into the tarp in the back of the court.  Have you ever seen a player do that, hit the tarp, and are you ever worried about running into the covers?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: Yeah, it's very dangerous.  The thing with this court is that it's very big.  It's huge.  It's six meters from the baseline to the end.  But still, of course, it's a little danger.
And I didn't see that moment.  I was running and I hit the ball.  And I couldn't play because I missed that ball, and then I saw him over there.  Of course, I went as soon as possible to see how he was, no?
But, yeah, of course it's pretty dangerous, you know.
Q. Do you think maybe they shouldn't have those on the courts?
HORACIO ZEBALLOS: I think the rule say that it has to -- at least the crew as to have, like, five or six meter.  And I think there are six meters, no?  So I really don't know.  I mean, I don't know.
