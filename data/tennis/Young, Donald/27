Q.  What did you learn out there today, anything new? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  No, about the same pretty much. 
 
Q.  How do you explain your fast starts, I guess, in both sets? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  I don't know, I think I just caught him by surprise a couple times.  I was playing well at the beginning of the set.  
 
Q.  You're up a break in the first set, a break in the second set.  Is that progress?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yeah, a lot of progress, yeah.  Coming from my last three matches, I was always down a break; I was never up. 
 
Q.  Are there other ways you measure progress in this match? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Getting more games than I did the last couple times.  I got a lot more games.  
 
Q.  Do you feel more comfortable out there at this level, or is it just on an opponent-by-opponent basis?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  I feel a little more comfortable, but I still feel it's okay.  
 
Q.  He was going for the final break at matchpoint.  You held firm there on several occasions.  Does that show some growth on your part, do you think, and just maturity in your game? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yeah, I'm getting a little more confident, yeah, I guess.  
 
Q.  Do the losses affect you?  Are they hard to take?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  No, not really, because I know a couple years I'll be here.  It took me this long.  Like in Juniors, I was losing first round Wimbledon, first round US Open, first round French Open -- or I won my first round Wimbledon, and I just won the Australian Open and I'm No. 1.  So hopefully it happens like that (smiling). 
 
Q.  Do you understand, your mother was just saying the whole intention of you being here is not necessarily to advance far, but to just grow.  Do you understand that?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yeah, it was a little hard at first but now it's a lot better.  Yeah, I understand it.  
 
Q.  What's the big difference between playing at this level? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Like I say, like in the Juniors, when I was up like 5-3, they were probably giving me that game.  Instead, he kept playing and came back and won the match.  So, I mean, they just don't stop, I guess.  
 
Q.  Players are mentally tougher at this level, right?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yeah.  And they're better, period.  
 
Q.  That, too. 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Right, yeah (smiling).  
 
Q.  How about physical strength, how much of a factor do you think that is?  I mean, just because you have to grow into a man, obviously. 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Right. 
 
Q.  How much of a factor is that for you?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Well, this guy wasn't -- I mean, I was taller than him.  I mean, he's bigger, obviously, because he's grown.  I guess it will come when I get older and grow into my body and everything, yeah. 
 
Q.  A lot of players say when they're growing a lot they feel a little awkward on the court; they can't get their footwork right.  Do you feel some of that in your game right now?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  No, my feet are just really big.  That's the only thing that I feel awkward or can't control.  But everything else I'm in control of. 
 
Q.  You trip up on them sometimes?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Sometimes, yeah, I do actually.  
 
Q.  What size are those big feet?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  12 and a half. 
 
Q.  Do you feel any difference going back and playing the Juniors after having played ATP Tour level matches?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  I'm going to go play Juniors soon, so I'll see if there's going to be any difference.  But I think it will be a lot different.  
 
Q.  Are you enjoying it?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yeah, I'm having fun.  It's fun, yeah.  
 
Q.  When are you playing next on the tour, do you know? 
 
DONALD YOUNG:  When is the next time, Houston.  Men's clay courts I think, yeah. 
 
Q.  Are you going to Europe?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yep, I'm going to play Italian Open Juniors, French Open Juniors, and then I'll come back. 
 
Q.  You will play Juniors in Europe?
 
DONALD YOUNG:  Yep.  All Juniors, yes.
