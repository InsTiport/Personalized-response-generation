THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is it about the Open that brings out the best in you?
DONALD YOUNG: I just love playing here.  The crowd is awesome.  It's always packed when I play.  I love playing here.  They're usually always for me.  The only time it really hasn't been that way was when I played Blake and it was kind of even and then I played Roger.
So it's awesome.  Then you have good memories here, so when you step on the court you automatically feel good about yourself.  So it's a great feeling.
Q. Speaking of Roger, since you mentioned him, what is your feeling about him being so close to No. 1 right now and having the year that he's had?
DONALD YOUNG: Yeah, it's crazy to come off that layoff and play so well in Australia.  He was like tuning guys.  It was awesome to see.  He's continued it the rest of the year.  I think he's only lost, like, three or four times.  It's crazy.
I mean, it's kind of expected.  He's an all-time great.  Amazing player.
Q. Did you get a chance to see his match last night?
DONALD YOUNG: I did.  I watched a little bit, fell asleep right before the fifth because I had to play.  It was great to see Frances, a good friend of mine, also playing well.  And to see Roger deal with some adversity and come through it, as well.
Q. How do you feel about this year being, you know, the best year of your career, I believe, mostly, and really coming together?
DONALD YOUNG: It feels great.  I mean, whenever you have the best year of your career it feels good.  I don't care if it's early or later or whatever.  It feels awesome.  I'm excited.
Hopefully I can keep it going and make this the norm and the MO.  So I'm happy about it.
