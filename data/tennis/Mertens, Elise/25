THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A lot of players at this level express the feeling of playing with a clear mind.  How important is it for you to play freely?  And what does having freedom on the court mean to you?  
ELISE MERTENS: I think freedom on the court is very important.  Of course you have to control your nerves.  It's not easy every time.  But of course in the first round you're, like, I really want to win this one.  I think mentally you really have to be stable, also work on your mental ability.   
So, yeah, I think every year is different.  Every year everybody starts from zero.  I think that's really important to keep in mind that everybody can win against everybody, but also just not really think about the points.  And just, yeah, I think clear your mind, not think about the point but about the game you want to play.   
 Q.  So this year you had quite a big success in doubles.  
ELISE MERTENS: Yeah.   
 Q.  You won with your pal Sabalenka.  And does this impact somehow how you play similar on grass, the volleys, the way you return?  And now it will be Niculescu?  You will have Niculescu, who is quite tricky?  
ELISE MERTENS: Yeah, of course.   
 Q.  Do you think you will put on court some of your experience and good sensations that you had in doubles?  
ELISE MERTENS: Yeah, I hope so.  I think the serve is very important on grass, the first four shots.  I think when I can come to the net I feel more comfortable than I used to be a few years ago.  That's really what helps me when I'm playing doubles and singles.   
But, yeah, I had some success in doubles.  Of course with Aryna it's a lot of fun to play and we go for every point.  It's also kind of relaxed.  I also try to bring that feeling into singles.
