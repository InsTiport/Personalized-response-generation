E. MERTENS/V. Lepchenko
6-7, 7-6, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Let's talk about yesterday.  It was really a very tough match and you were lead twice, 5-3, in both sets.  How did you fight back to counter the situation?
ELISE MERTENS: It was very difficult yesterday.  She played very well, very few mistakes.  She was running everywhere.
As for myself, my level was not as before.  It was not so bad either, but it was very difficult yesterday first set.
We were very close, four set points.  But it's tennis.  And yesterday when she was leading 5-3, 5-4, then it was very difficult mentally.  But I was ready -- I was there when she was leading 5-4.  I was in the match even more than before.
So I'm very happy that I was able to win the second set.
Q. Today, when you come back, it seems trivial, but during the night, you suddenly imagine scenarios of end of match?
ELISE MERTENS: After the rain, it was 3-Love for me.  She wasn't present in the third set, because she didn't want to the play under the rain.
But mentally, I was leading by 3-Love.  And so, for me, I just needed to win three games and she had to win six games.  So it was a positive for me, so I wanted to keep playing.
But, today, I played very well, even better than yesterday.  But mentally she was not present anymore.
Q. Talking about mental, you were very strong mentally.  Do you think it's your good season on clay which is leading you to believe in your chances even on clay?
ELISE MERTENS: Yes, I think so.  I want to win, to play well.  And when the level is there, I know how to play.  But it's always difficult in the first round against a left-hander.
And also thanks to these matches, to such matches, although it's difficult, it's tennis.
Q. You had a very high level of play yesterday, although it wasn't perfect.  As you said, she was missing nothing.  We felt that on each point you had to attack, three, four, five, six times.  How do you manage these long points and even if you do your best it's not enough?
ELISE MERTENS: I want to win every single point, so I try to fight back on each ball.  Playing aggressively is important, but I think that the level of yesterday was different with respect to today, maybe thanks to me or maybe because of her.
But I'm feeling perfectly well physically.  I'm feeling 100%.
