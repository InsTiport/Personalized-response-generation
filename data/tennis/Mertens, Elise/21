E. MERTENS/D. Parry
6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Facing a 16-year old player, this doesn't happen often.  How did you approach this match?  How did you feel?
ELISE MERTENS: It was a match like any other.  She played well.  First serve, second serve, it was there.
It was not my best level, but I still won.  My level was comfortable.  How shall I put it?  It was just enough to win today.
Q. When one plays against such a player, do you actually worry for her, especially when you are up 30-Love?  Do you think, I'm not going to crush her altogether?
ELISE MERTENS: I'm just trying to be focused on every point.  I'm not going to say that I'm going to win 6-Love.  It doesn't really matter.
Q. When you said that your level wasn't there, does it mean that you didn't have your bearings?  Your feelings?
ELISE MERTENS: Well, it was not the same as for the first round.  I wasn't 100% there.  Luckily it was enough for today.
Q. Was it because you were a favorite that you knew that you had to win?  Were you nervous?  Anxious?
ELISE MERTENS: Yes, I was the favorite.  I was a bit anxious, but I don't know how I should assess it.  Was it my day?  Not my day?  With tennis, this is the way it goes.
Q. Are you worried for the next match or does it mean that it's just a rainy day today?
ELISE MERTENS: No, every day is different.  It depends on your opponent.  I'll give everything for the third round.  I'm very happy to be there already.
Q. You certainly will play Sevastova.  Do you have any experience playing her?
ELISE MERTENS: I played her once.  It was grass.  It was a grass court in Mallorca.  It was in 2017, I think.
She runs well.  She can hit sliced strokes.  As to the rest, I don't know any more.
Q. For the third round, one could think that you could actually play top players.  So it could actually be a good draw for you.
ELISE MERTENS: Well, with female players, you know, everything is possible.  We all have our chance to win.  So it's up to me.  I have to be match focused.  Of course the identity and quality of the opponent helps, but I have to be concentrated on my own level.
Q. Do you want to hit some balls again?
ELISE MERTENS: No, because I have doubles tomorrow.  I have to see the physio.  I need some massages.  So two hours' of treatment.
Q. Please talk about tomorrow's doubles.  You did not hesitate a second to do both the singles and the doubles.
ELISE MERTENS: I like playing doubles.  It's different.  It's nice to play.  It's funny.  One wants to win, of course, but it's really a different kettle of fish.
Q. So two wins on clay in Grand Slam.  This will certainly give you confidence.
ELISE MERTENS: Of course.  It's a Grand Slam, so I need to have results.  I have more confidence.  I have to work on some hits, mentally speaking, as well.  We'll see for the next round.
Q. The atmosphere was wonderful with a fight between a French person and a Belgian player.  Did you feel like a Fed Cup atmosphere?
ELISE MERTENS: Indeed it was entertaining.  The atmosphere was great.  The court is bigger, as well, so it was fun.
Q. Do you feel like an outsider?  The second week it would be good because you've been close to the top 10.  Would it be nice to have a second week?  What do you feel exactly?  What do you think?
ELISE MERTENS: I don't know.  I will try for sure.  The third round will be against a seeded player, so that will be harder.  I like playing Grand Slams.  I don't like to lose during the first round, of course.
I will try anyway.
