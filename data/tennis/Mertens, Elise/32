E. MERTENS/D. Gavrilova
7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Down 0-5, how did you pull that out?
ELISE MERTENS: I mean, she was playing great.  All credits to her.  I wasn't really feeling -- I didn't really have a good feeling at the beginning.  Maybe a bit slow because I had to wait so long.
But I'm happy that I kept on fighting, because you never know in tennis.  Yeah, I'm really happy about the level I played.  Afterwards it's not easy.  I have also a lot of matches in my legs.  But mentally I was still there.
Q. What adjustments did you make that made the difference?
ELISE MERTENS: I guess I wanted it a bit too much at the beginning.  Maybe a bit too many unforced errors.  After that I kept on rallying.  If I had my chances, I tried to come a little bit forward.
Q. The match being so late, what were your thoughts?  Would you have preferred to play on Thursday?
ELISE MERTENS: For me it doesn't really matter.  For me, if the schedule is out, I play.  Thursday, Friday, for me it's the same.  I'm always prepared to play what time, whatever.
Q. How did you prepare for that?  You mentioned it was a challenge waiting around.  What did you do?
ELISE MERTENS: I rest.  Like I said, I played Hobart before, so I already have some matches in my legs.  But I rest.  I prepare mentally.  Physically, yeah.  I think it's just to keep the energy up.
Q. You just missed out on playing this tournament last year.  Now you're in the third round.
ELISE MERTENS: Whoo-Hoo.
Q. How do you contextualize the last 12 months?
ELISE MERTENS: Special feelings.  The first time in the third round, especially here the first time I'm in main.  Of course, I played at the French third round.  It's still the second time I'm playing third round, so it's special for me.
Q. Cornet next.  Sorry to ask you about it so soon after this match.
ELISE MERTENS: No, it's fine.
I didn't play her yet.  Of course, she's a very experienced player.  Yeah, I'll still have a day to recover and see what I can do after.
Q. Do you feel like you're on autopilot at all?
ELISE MERTENS: Maybe just a little because I love to play matches, I love to compete, love to fight.  If I'm physically still able to, and I am, yeah, I think so.
