  E. MERTENS/E. Svitolina
 6-3, 5-7, 10-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Obviously fantastic to be on court.  Just talk to us about your really entertaining match with Svitolina.
 ELISE MERTENS:   Yeah, I mean, I started well.  Everybody held serve.  I really felt good today.  I knew I had to step in the court to get a lot of balls back.
 Yeah, first serve was also important to get the advantage.  But, yeah, second set I was 5-2 up, serve two times for the match, I had a match point.  Yeah, you know, that's tennis.  Anything can happen.
 Yeah, I think mentally was prepared for the third set, was a super-tiebreak.  I just started from scratch again, just like I have to win 10 points.
 But overall I was pleased with my performance.
