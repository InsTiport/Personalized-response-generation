 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match and how you were feeling on the court today?
 ELISE MERTENS:   I think the first set was really tight, how she got to the ball.  So I was really happy just to get it done in two sets and especially win the first one.
 I think I played a bit more aggressive in the second set, a bit better, first serve was coming in more so that definitely made a difference.
