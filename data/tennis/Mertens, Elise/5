E. MERTENS/K. Kanepi
6-4, 7-5
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Please comment your game today.  Are you happy with your performance?  What do you say about your opponent?
ELISE MERTENS:   Yeah, I'm pretty pleased about my performance.  I think I served better in this match, and I really had to put pressure, because she's a good, hard hitter.  When she's directly to the ball, she can hit very hard, she can hit those angles also first serves when it's in.
She has a really good first serve, so I'll try to play a bit more aggressive, because otherwise she was getting into the court.
Q. I'm curious through the first week so far, have you noticed that the conditions have changed at all?  Obviously I'm not there.  I don't know what the temperatures are and things like that, how wet it feels.  Were the conditions any lighter today than they were the last time you played?  Or is it you're just getting used to it?
ELISE MERTENS:   The conditions are a bit different, yeah.  It was hotter today.  The conditions were -- I mean, the court was a little bit faster than had on Sunday.  I guess because the temperature is a bit higher.  Also the sun was coming out a little bit.
Yeah, it was hotter.  I could play in my shirt.  Yeah, it was nice conditions.
Q. Then you'll play either Caroline Garcia or Sasnovich.  Can you just preview each one of those opponents?
ELISE MERTENS:   I played Sasnovich in Palermo.  It was the first match back, so that wasn't my greatest match.  Yeah, I have a lot to learn about that match.
For the second one, Garcia, I don't really -- I never really played her before I think.  Maybe in the past, like, years ago.
But I'll definitely look at the match they are playing today to just know how they are playing on clay.
