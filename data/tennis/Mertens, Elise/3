 7-6, 7-5
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously it was a very tight match.  Can you just give us your thoughts on the match.
 ELISE MERTENS:   Yeah, it was a very tight one.  Yeah, I mean, she played pretty consistent throughout the whole match, good first serve.  It was very difficult to break her.
 But, you know, I left everything on court I had today.  I kept fighting till the end, but of course I'm a bit disappointed about the loss.
