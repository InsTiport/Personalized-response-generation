 6-2, 6-1
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you give us your thoughts on the match?
 ELISE MERTENS:   Yeah, I didn't expect it to go this quick but still, she's a great player, so she can go back in the game any time.  So I really had to stay in my bubble, do my thing.  My first serve was working today, so I had an advantage with that.  Yeah, it was just a good day at the office.
