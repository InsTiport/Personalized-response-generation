  6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   That was a very good start.   You are playing well right now.   You have a good game.   You are well physically.   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Yes, everything's good.   Today I was a bit tired.   But, in fact, it didn't show on the court.   There are green lights everywhere.   
   
 Q.   It's the first time you qualified for the tournament.   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   That's right.   I had a very good beginning of the year ‑ the best in my career.   I had never gone beyond the quallies here.   It's my first time.   It's important for me.   
   
 Q.   Why is it more important here?   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, because it's 'France' and I have friends here and family.   It's my favorite tournament.   
I was never able to play well here before, so I'm very pleased.   
   
 Q.   Will you be impressed playing on center court next match?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, you want to play those matches.   I'm very happy that I will play on this court.   Court 9 is fine, but you don't dream as much of that court as you do of center court.   And against Murray, it's going to be great.   
   
 Q.   Talking about Murray, among the top four, which one do you prefer to play?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, I certainly wouldn't like to play Nadal, even now.   Maybe Djokovic with his ankle right now.   I never played those big guys before anyway, none of them.   
   
 Q.   You played against Murray in 2012, and the score was pretty good, wasn't it?   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, I have good memories of that match.   I was a bit tense at the beginning.   Anyway, Wednesday I will be there.   If there's an opening, I will certainly take it and I'll be there.   
   
 Q.   But he's a better player than he was last year.   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   I am, too.   Of course, there's a great gap between the two of us.   But in some tournaments, sometimes surprises can happen.   
   
 Q.   What are his weaknesses?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, it's tough to point out a weakness.   He's top two in the world.   
   
 Q.   But you might try things to give him trouble.   
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   What I need to do is try not to let him play his game.   What he likes is to do his own mix, dropshots, higher balls.   I need to try to be aggressive and not let him have time to adapt to the surface since it's his first tournament on clay.   Otherwise it's going to become more and more difficult for me as he will get more familiar with the conditions.   
   
 Q.   You do have family here on the French Riviera?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Yes.   In fact, my parents‑in‑law are here, in Nice.   They came to watch me play the quallies.   
It's always nice to have friends and family around the court.
