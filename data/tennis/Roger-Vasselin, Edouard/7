THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   The match seemed difficult to play.   Is that right?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Yes, extremely difficult.   I didn't realize it was going to be so difficult.   I was happy and everything, but it was much too difficult for me today.  
   
 Q.   Can you explain why?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Nothing to do with my state of mind.   I was positive.   I was happy to play on center court.   I wanted to do well.   But I had no energy whatsoever.   It was extremely difficult.   I don't know if I can compare, but I was like a tortoise or grandfather.   
It was difficult.   I was very far from my own level, and I need to be at a top level if I want to beat Kohlschreiber.   So I couldn't make it today.  
   
 Q.   Nights were short lately.   Can you tell us how many hours you slept after that birth?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, they were still in hospital, so I think it was mostly emotionally that I was drawn and tired.  
If you're able to sleep five or seven hours, it's okay.   But emotionally I think I have a letdown right now.  
   
 Q.   So in spite of that loss, I think you still have a good goal for the end of the season?   The Masters in doubles.   So what is going to be your schedule?   You're playing doubles here, and then what are you going to do?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, here it's going to be a very good preparation for me to play with Julien in doubles.   We are hoping that we'll be able to play many matches.   We played already often together this year, but we are hoping to do well here, also, especially because it's in Paris.   
And after that we'll have time to rest and enjoy for what is called the best moment of the year, because everybody says London is incredible.   So I hope we'll be able to play well there.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you will be able to find your energy back for the doubles?  
EDOUARD ROGER‑VASSELIN:   Well, if I have no energy just to play a doubles match, one hour and a quarter, then the situation is really worrying.   I think I will be able to do something.
