  THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  For the captain, are there positives that you can take out of today?  Although you didn't get a point, both matches were very close. 
 CAPTAIN SCHALLER:  Of course at the moment it's not easy to say it's a positive day, but all along I would say we had really great matches.  Both players, I mean, they were very close to win a point.  The atmosphere and the tennis was alive, so it was really nice to be in the stadium. 
 It was for me a nice place to be with these players, with my team, to face the U.S. team.  Unfortunately we didn't make a point today, which was our goal. 

 Q.  What do you tell your team going into tomorrow? 
 CAPTAIN SCHALLER:  We have nothing to lose.  Against the Bryans anyway it will be very, very difficult.  But if we manage to make a point tomorrow I still believe in our chance, because I think Stefan is capable of beating Roddick and I think Melzer is capable of beating Blake.  We saw it today.  It was very close. 
 If we make a point tomorrow, the chance is alive. 

 Q.  Stefan, what happened after the first set when the momentum changed in your match? 
 STEFAN KOUBEK:  Momentum changed. 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 STEFAN KOUBEK:  That's what happened. 

 Q.  Was there any particular reason for it? 
 STEFAN KOUBEK:  I mean, I gave it away in the second set.  He started to play unbelievable.  I heard he said it was one of his best matches, maybe the best match ever on clay.  I believe him. 
 I didn't know what to do anymore.  I was only reacting from the third set on, and I tried to stay in there.  I thought he's not going to play through, but he did, and I mean, that was -- at the end it was too good. 
 The second set he was risking and winning, and I made a lot of unforced errors in the wrong situations. 
 I gave it away the second set.
