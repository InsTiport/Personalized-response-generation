 K. ZAKOPALOVA/E. Vesnina
  4‑6, 6‑0, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you explain what happened after that first set.   Second set was 6‑0.   
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, I told myself that I had nothing to lose, just try to relax and play every point.   Suddenly I started to play much more better.   I was playing without any mistakes the second set.   
   
 Q.   You were up 5‑2 in the third set.   She started coming back there.   
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, I was very nervous when I had 5‑2 and serve, so I served really bad that game.   When it was 5‑4, she has advantage for 5‑All.   
I was just fighting for every point.   In the end I was a little bit more lucky, I think.   
   
 Q.   First time they've had a semifinal here with two Czech players.   How well do you know Petra?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, we are good friends.   But she's not from Prague.   She's from the other part of Czech.   So we are not practicing together so much.   
I played against her last year in Indian Wells, so she won easily.   I know what to expect.   She's a very good player.   I admire her a lot.   She's a Wimbledon champion.   
I have nothing to lose and I try my best tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Do you think this will be watched very closely back home?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Who?   
   
 Q.   Back home in Czech Republic, do you think this match will be watched closely?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   I think so.   It's always good if two Czechs are playing semifinal of such a good tournament like this.   So I think a lot of people will watch it.  
   
 Q.   Third semifinal since you got married.   Is that the secret?   
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, I don't know.   No secret at all.   I don't know.   I just changed my coach, so maybe it starts to work a little bit better now.  
   
 Q.   When did you change your coach?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Eastbourne, before Wimbledon.   
   
 Q.   What is the main difference with this coach?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   I think we started to practice more my serve and I start to practice more physicals.   That's maybe why.   
   
 Q.   It's been a few years, but you have had some success against Petra.   What are you going to have to do to be able to beat her?   
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Yeah, was long time ago.   I remember.   
She's serving very good, so I have to be ready for her good serve.   She's playing very flat and very fast, so I have to move very well and try to fight for every point.   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   Was there a difference emotionally playing in front of such a sparse crowd as opposed to playing on the stadium court?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, I don't care.   There were some people watching and they were very nice with me.   
I'm looking forward to playing on stadium tomorrow.   But there is no difference.   
   
 Q.   You're supposed to play on stadium, then with the weather, how difficult is it to play with a couple rain delays?  
KLARA ZAKOPALOVA:   Well, we are used to because it's really often on tournaments.   Well, we were talking with Petra before her match.   It was okay.   No problem at all.
