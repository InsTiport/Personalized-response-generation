Q. How were you able to pull away in the third set there?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Well, I was tired and he was tired also,
but I think he got kind-- he throw the match. He throw the match
in the third set.

Q. He threw the match?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: I think he didn't try as hard as he tried
the other two sets. In the third he was tired, but I don't think
he tried his best.

Q. Is that pretty common for him to give up?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Yeah, like --

Q. Did he just get tired or he just quit?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: I think he was tired because I was tired
also and he is heavier than me and he usually gets tired than
other persons, but he got mad with the umpire and that also make
him like get mad through the match and give up in the third set.

Q. Would you ever give up?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Not usually, but I never gave up, but maybe
some day because, I don't know, the conditions are not good or
I don't feel well, but I probably give up, but until now I never
gave up.

Q. He beat Edberg, I guess, last week, so I guess he was playing
a lot better, but you were still able to beat him?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Yeah, he played in Scottsdale. He played
Edberg. He beat him. And he was playing well. But I know the way
he plays, we -- I play him a lot of times and Edberg never play
him. It was the first time. And maybe he didn't play as well as
he played against Edberg, but made a good match.

Q. Still able to beat him?

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Yeah.

Q. Thank you.

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI: Thank you.
