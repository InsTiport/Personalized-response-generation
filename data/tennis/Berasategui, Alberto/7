Q.  Are you hoping to be able to play on?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Well, I think so, but I  have to see what the doctor says and how the treatment  goes and I hope I will be able to play the next match  against Bruguera.  


Q.  You have one day off tomorrow?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Yeah, I have one day  off so I think that will help me.  


Q.  Could you just take us through what happened  today exactly and how the decision was made for you to  play?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Well, I wasn't 100%  able to play today, but I think I work hard enough to  make it here and the ATP didn't want to hold my ranking  if I wasn't going to play today, so I think there is a  lot of benefits for me if I stay in this ranking, so  that is why I went to the court.  


Q.  What do you mean, they wouldn't let you stay  No. 7, is that what you are saying?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Yeah No. 7 or No. 8,  depends, so I went to the court and I mean, like I  telling you, I wasn't 100% able to play.  


Q.  You saw a doctor this morning?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Yeah, I saw the doctor  and he told me that I could play, but he wasn't sure  that I was going to be 100% either I mean, they did  everything that was possible on the hand, but...  


Q.  Did you get a pain injection or anything?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  No, they didn't want to  do that because that could hurt after -- not today, but  for maybe a month or whatever, so they didn't know if  it was going to be bad for me.  


Q.  How much did it hurt you today on the court?  How much did it hurt your game?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  I think a lot because I  cannot hit my forehand the hardest I used to and if I  cannot hit my best shot, the game is over for me, and  it hurts for my serve also.  Usually I don't hit very  hard my serve, but with this, I can only hit one good  first serves.  


Q.  It wouldn't have been 6-1, 6-0 if you would  have been healthy?  

ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  I don't think so.  Maybe Michael would have beaten me, probably so, but I  don't think it would have been 6-1, 6-Love.
