Q.  Has it been a long year?  
 
ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Well, it has been a  long year for me.  I played a lot of tournaments to  make it to the Masters for Frankfurt and it has been a  high year for me because I had to play a lot of  tournaments, but in the other way I think it has been  my best career year, so I am proud for it.   
 

Q.  Pete Sampras said he thought that the court  was rather too fast for comfort.  He thought it might  be better if it was a little slow.  What do you think?  
 
ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Well, for me it would  be better if we were playing clay court, but I don't  think that is possible, but I think it is much faster  than the court in Frankfurt, and I am not used to  playing on these kind of courts, and -- but anyway at  the second set I got a little bit into the match and I  could play better, but I think the court is a little  bit too fast.   
 

Q.  What are your goals for next year?  
 
ALBERTO BERASATEGUI:  Well, I am going to try  to maintain my ranking that I had got this year, but I  am going to try to prove mostly on hard court and try  it play more a little bit more tournaments on these  kind of courts, and my biggest goal is to play at  Roland Garros and if I don't win it this year I will  try to win it some year.
