Q. Was it a fairly easy day for you? How would you describe your play today? 

MARKUS ZOECKE: It wasn't easy, but I think I started very well. I was up 6-1, 5-2. I
was maybe too good, then I started thinking, then, I lost my serve twice, but I think
finally I played a very good match today and I like to play against players like him
because his game is very good for me. He is always hitting topspin shots and, so, can make
a lot of power. 

Q. Coming off the big win against Goran, was it hard to -- were you worried that your
game would not be at the same level because it is hard to reproduce that type of tennis? 

MARKUS ZOECKE: That is right. But I felt good the whole time, the whole week and I
thought it is a good chance for me to reach the third round and I think I didn't put too
much pressure on myself and I think I handled it pretty well today. 

Q. What do you feel about your chances; how far do you think you can get; have you
looked ahead in the draw? 

MARKUS ZOECKE: Depends who I am playing. I don't know which guy I am playing. I don't
know. I feel very good. I told you, and I think I have a good chance to win another round.


Q. How does this compare to the way you are playing now to any other Grand Slam
performance you have had? 

MARKUS ZOECKE: Actually, I played quite well at Wimbledon this year. I won two rounds
as well, and I mean, these are my first two rounds I have won here, so I am pretty
satisfied with that so far.
