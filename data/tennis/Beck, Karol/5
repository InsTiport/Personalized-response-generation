Q.  Looks like now it is four against two.  Do you still feel okay?

CAPTAIN MECIR:  It happened earlier also many times that singles players played doubles in our team.  As the referee said, the doubles team may be changed one hour before the match.  I don't see any problem with playing with two players.  Of course, as I said before, the US team is a big favorite in this match. 

Q.  Karol or Jan, nothing to lose playing in this match this weekend going against Sampras or Roddick; play loose?

JAN KROSLAK:  Yeah, I think -- I hope that we'll lose the nerves and I think we have nothing to lose and we'll put our hearts into the game and we'll fight.

Q.  Karol, how do you feel about opening against Sampras tomorrow?  

KAROL BECK:  I would like to play second match, but the draw is the draw.  Jan would like to play first.  I would try to do my best.  I am very happy that I can play against Sampras.  Maybe he'll finish his career and I can tell I was playing Pete Sampras.

Q.  Karol, I understand that you played Andy in Sunshine Cup.  Can you talk a little bit about that match, maybe what you learned about Andy during that match?

KAROL BECK:  It was  a couple years ago and it was different player, good serves, very good forehand, he plays very good game.  That's different in juniors and mens.  He had a good season.

Q.  Have you seen him become that much better of a player?

KAROL BECK:  Yes.

Q.  Jan, or any of you, what do you think about the fact that you have been given the black hats to wear?

JAN KROSLAK:  Yeah, we wanted the black hats.  We were trying the white, but we said we would like to have black because we eat like pigs and they get dirty so we would like to have a dark one.  You don't have to wash it so often.
