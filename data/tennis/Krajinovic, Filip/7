THE MODERATOR: Let's start with this press conference, just five questions. Any questions in English?
Q. Hi, Filip. I'm going to ask you a question about Janko, since this is his swan song. Can you tell me a little bit about what he's meant to you as a player, as a person, influence he had on you? What you think of when you think about his career and his person?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Janko is my very close friend and my agent. He had a amazing career, top ten. He was fighting.
He was one of my idols, so I'm sad that he's leaving us from the professional tennis. But I know that's the best thing for him right now because he went through so many injuries, so many operations, surgeries. So for him it was very tough last five years. So he decide to quit and to move on. And he's been doing well off the court with the business.
So I'm happy that he's doing well right now. At the same time, I know we're going to be friends forever and he's going to be, he's going to be next to me for sure.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Serbian.
