THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  In English.
Q. I suppose you have two different feelings inside your head.  Sadness to not play Rafa on center court.  That would be great for you.  And the other side the first semifinal in a Masters 1000 event.  What do you think?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: I mean, I didn't expect this, to be honest.  I'm shocked right now.  They just told me that he pulled out.  I was ready to play.  You know, for me it's good opportunity to be next to the No. 1.  It's pretty much for everybody goal.
That's why you practice and that's why you're playing tennis and then all of a sudden I'm in the semis.  And I'm also happy first time playing semis Masters.  Didn't expect that for sure.
Yeah, it was unbelievable year for me anyway after being injured last year and coming here, nothing to lose.  Coming for the quallies.  And then match by match and now I'm in the semis and it's unreal, to be honest.
Q. Looking forward to the match tomorrow, probably the fact that you don't play today gave you an advantage because you have nothing to lose tomorrow as well probably and you are one more day to rest.
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Yeah, I'm going to probably practice now, little bit watch these semis, but at the same time again, I'm going to play free.  So if anything happen, it's all good.  You know, for me, it doesn't matter right now what's going to happen.
But, of course, I'm going to give my best tomorrow for sure.  But so far I'm going to enjoy today and then we'll see how it goes tomorrow.
Q. Not many victories this season on the main tour and suddenly here a lot of victories.  How do you explain that?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: My goal this year was to play challenges to pick up the points for the next year to play against those guys.  I was already top 100 two or three years ago, then I had that bad luck with injuries.
I played already with those guys, with French, Monfils 7-6 in the third.  So I played a lot with big guys.  But the goal was to play the tournaments small to pick up the points.  I did that and I said now I'm going to just play ATPs all the time.
And I know I have a game that's for sure, just I need to believe and to play with those guys every week.  So next year it's going to be like that, playing with those guys.  So I'm going to be ready and then we'll see.
Q. The decision about your injury, what was it exactly?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: I had a wrist problem.  I had an extra bone in the wrist so I had to take care of that.
Q. Obviously, disappointed about not playing against Rafa.  What do you think a match like that would have taught you about your game, about your confidence, your situation?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Excuse me, what was the question?
Q. The question was obviously you're not going to play Rafa.  But what do you think a match like that --
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: If I step on the court to play?
Q. What would it have taught you?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Of course, my only chance to play against him is to be aggressive.  I know that he don't have that big results in the indoor hard.  Obviously is unbelievable dangerous and I know that.  But my only chance is if I have a chance, any chance, it was to be aggressive the whole match.
I was ready for that.  You know, so I know I have a little chance but at least I will try.
Q. If it's possible, some thoughts about the opportunity for tomorrow between Isner and del Potro?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Yeah, pretty much they're playing similar game, aggressive.  Both guys are tall, serving well.  So I don't know.  To be honest, for me the same.  Whoever wins is okay.
