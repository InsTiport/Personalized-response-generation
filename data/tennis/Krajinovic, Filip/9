F. KRAJINOVIC/M. Baghdatis
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had to fight off a lot of breakpoints, didn't you?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: Yeah.  It was a tough match.  I faced a lot of breakpoints.  I think I played really aggressive on that ones.
I'm really happy to play in quarterfinal.  Beating Baghdatis for me is good win.  He likes to play here.  He played semis and final.  I am excited about quarters.  I'll be ready for tomorrow.
Q. What did you think you did particularly well?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: I think I play aggressive when I needed.  I served well when I needed.  That was the key.  I stay with him.  Yeah, it was a patient game.
Q. Did you expect the match would end in just two sets?
FILIP KRAJINOVIC: I didn't know.  I'm always preparing to play a long match, same I did today.  I think he start better than me, 2-0 up, Love-30.
I come back after that.  It was equal match.  I think I play really well in tiebreak.  I'm happy to finish in two sets.  I think we play 1 hour and 30, 40.  So was long match.
