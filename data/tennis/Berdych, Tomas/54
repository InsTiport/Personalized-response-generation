T. BERDYCH/G. Monfils
  6‑3, 3‑2 (ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How was the game?   It's a little strange to win in that way. 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, game, I mean, it starts pretty well.   It was a very good set for me.   I was playing really well.
It was the way I want to play, which is always good, always very helpful. 
Well, yeah, in the end I feel sorry for GaÃ«l.   That's not the ideal way to finish up the match.   But, yeah, I mean, in the end I'm through.   That's what matters, that's what counts. 
So I'm happy with the win.   Really just it's not the way that you want to finish the match, but that's how it is.   So we need to move on and just go for the next one.

Q.   The way you were playing, as well, you looked so confident and solid out there, especially from what we saw of that first set.   Is that the way you felt you were playing, that there was not much you could do wrong?
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, I mean, yes, I felt pretty good from the beginning of the match.   I felt confident.   I felt much better.
I mean, the conditions were much more pleasant than the last time I played, so I was really enjoying that fact, as well.   I mean, to be back on the center court and really playing with those nice conditions, not the wind at all, and then you get a much, much better feeling for the ball.   You can hit it nice and clear, which is also very helpful.
You can build up the game right with the good conditions.   Yeah, everything was going pretty well for me today.

Q.   Is that what really made the difference for your serve, the conditions?
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, yeah, I would say so.   Because my serve is, well, based on quite a high toss, and with tricky wind it's not easy to get good rhythm with it. 
I mean, even though today wasn't quite windy, but it was going one side to the other, which is easier to predict and you know what to do with the ball.   But when the wind is really spinning all around, it's very difficult.
Yeah, today it was much easier, and I think it was a reward for winning the previous match.
