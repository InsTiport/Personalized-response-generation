  J. TSONGA/T. Berdych6-3, 6-2, 6-7, 6-3THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.Q. You were close to maybe making this turn around, but it doesn't look like you were feeling comfortable at all on the court today.TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, I don't think that's a really realistic view on that.  I was nowhere near to that.  I was just trying to hang in there as much as I could. But definitely I was way far from my best tennis that I can play, and it's definitely a very disappointing loss for me.  It's not the time that I want to go home from this event. But yeah, that's how it is.  I need to take that.  I need to look back also to see the last four months that I have done and which moves me ahead, and that's it. So the season is keep going, and that's what I need to see now for the future.Q. Even with the ball for 4-1 in the first you were not feeling at all that you could be close to make this turnaround?  At no point you felt you could today?  Because of the wind or because of, I don't know, fitness or anything?TOMAS BERDYCH: No, that's all good.  The conditions were as they are, and that's absolutely fine. Yeah, only what I said.  You know, I was just trying to hang on there, trying to be as close as possible with him.  But, you know, as I said, I just would be repeating all the same thing again.Q. You had a good record against him before this match.  Has he made something different today?TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, he played a very good game.  That's for sure. But as I said, you know, I was playing very far from my best from the tennis that I am able to play, and that's what's makes the difference today.
