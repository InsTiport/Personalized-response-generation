T. BERDYCH/M. Jaziri
6-1, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you tell me what was the main challenge against Malek today?
TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, it was a good test.  I think Malek, I think his strength of the game is he's quite unpredictable what's going to come up on the court.  Even though I had a great start, win easy first set, then I was in one game really up on my serve, and then made couple of mistakes, and he just come up -- he just come up very strong back.  He was playing all over the court.  He was playing really well.  Took the second set.
Same thing in the third, you know.  It was quite easy, quite easy for me.  And again, it was a big fight in the fourth set, especially the game on 4-3.  I think it was a good test for me, good challenge.  I manage it well.
You know, I think it's good to have matches also like that, and just get through it, and, just, you know, keep on going.
Q. Your next opponent is Pablo Cuevas.  You have only played him once.  What do you expect of the match?
TOMAS BERDYCH: Yeah, it's going to be very tough opponent.  I mean, yeah, we played once last year, but I think it's been probably, for me, one of the worst conditions that I ever experienced on the tennis court.  But, you know, that happens also.
But here I'm really expecting a tough match, tough battle.  I mean, he's playing really well.  He's playing really good.  Especially on the clay.  He's a very dangerous player, so I'm going to really have to push myself for the good game, and, you know, just try to refocus back again and come up with some good tennis.
