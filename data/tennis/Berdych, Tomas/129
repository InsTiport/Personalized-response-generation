D. FERRER/T. Berdych
      6‑2, 6‑3, 7‑5

    THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, we have the press conference with Tomas Berdych. 

Q.   Tomas, was there anything more you could have done out there today or was David Ferrer just too good?
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, if there was something, I didn't know what was it. 
    I was quite, you know, always a few steps behind him.   You know, he just showed that probably this time, this period of the year, there is probably maybe only Novak Djokovic who is playing better or playing like him. 
    He just showed, yeah, he's just playing too good today. 

Q.   The fact that he was obviously fresher than you, was that a big factor, Tomas?
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, I don't think so, because that's even a harder fact for me to take.   You know, I was feeling really well.   I had a quite good feeling.   I had almost the same one like I start on Friday. 
    So that was definitely not issue.   That's what I said, it's even harder to me to take that fact, that I was feeling well and he was playing just too good. 

Q.   Have you given Radek any advice to face Nicolas Almagro? 
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, probably he saw many from my match.   Our team and all the people that are around the team, you know, just did all the work that has to be done. 
    Of course, I tell him some few things.   But, you know, he's the one that knows best what to do on court. 

Q.   I think you played nine times.   Do you think it's the best match he played against you today? 
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, there's no question about it.
