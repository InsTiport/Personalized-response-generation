T. BERDYCH/V. Hanescu
  6‑7, 6‑1, 6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Not related to this particular game, but have you got any thoughts on John McEnroe's comments about getting rid of umpires and letting players call their own shots?   Have you heard that?
TOMAS BERDYCH:   No, I did not.

Q.   Do you think that that would be...
TOMAS BERDYCH:   No, I don't think so that would be good one, because especially today I think I have a call that the referee was asking basically asking the guy if he touch the ball or not.
He said not, and I can clearly heard that he touched the ball.   He just didn't say that, so it was already one case that it wouldn't be the way that it should be.
So I'm definitely not with him.
