You know, that's something what's now nice about tennis.  You know, he played a first round which he was almost, you know, packing his bags going home.  He come up from two sets down and then he won. Basically he has nothing to lose.  Always matches like that helps.  You know, he played really good tennis.Q. He took you to five.  No tiebreakers.  What do you take from that going into the next round?TOMAS BERDYCH: Yeah, it's a good challenge, you know.  The conditions were tough again.  You go from day till early evening.  You start with the sun, then you end up with the lights.  It was quite windy, as well. Really, I mean, he play good, so I'm happy to have that on my belt, to win another five-setter, and just go forward.Q. What do you expect out of Gabashvili?TOMAS BERDYCH: It's another guy that can play.  He can play really well.  He has nothing to lose.  He's a talented guy, very strong. Again, I just need to get myself ready, prepared, and be ready for the next one.
