 Q.  The key to the match today was the first set tie-breaker?  
TOMAS BERDYCH: Yes, even though I was the first one who was the break down in the set, then I managed to come back and in the tie-break, yes, I was three set points down.  I came back strongly with my good serve and then a very good volley, so, yeah, there was definitely the turning point of the whole match.   
And I'm very pleased with that because I also managed to use that momentum of the situation for me.   
 Q.  You were away from the game a few months last year.  You must be satisfied with this that you did everything right.  It's a good result to come here?  
TOMAS BERDYCH: Not satisfied yet, because there is still one more to go, but potentially.  So that's right now on the edge.  But overall yes, I did some work, I did some very important decisions in last couple of, or last six months, and so far all of them seems they were right.   
It is very early to judge.  They still have to be very patient, even though the results right now are clicking and it's all going well, but I really just need to stay, you know, very focussed and hope to go all the way because the season and everything will be extremely long.
