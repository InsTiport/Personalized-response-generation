THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. First of all, it was an intense game with three sets.  But as we are speaking, just a quick answer on that.  With Federer and Nadal, those greats playing together right now, in your opinion, what did they bring or brought and still bring to tennis and what's their legacy?
TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, I think this is definitely making history to see them both on the same side of the court playing doubles in such an event such as Laver Cup.
I think it's just a great sign of the commitment for the event and for the commitment to try to win as Team Europe.
And that's it.  I think that everyone was waiting for this moment since they announced this event is gonna happen.  This is the time.  So I think it's almost like a celebration of tennis.
