T. BERDYCH/J. Isner 
      6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑4

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   Congrats.   Early breaks.   Good serve.   You should be very pleased with this victory. 
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, exactly like you said, you know, there was quick breaks in each of the sets.   That's something which really helps through all the match, especially with a guy like John.   He likes to stay as close as possible, serving well. 
    And, you know, as I said, you know, I think it's a good thing to avoid playing the tiebreaks with him.
    So that was one of my plans in the beginning, and I'm really glad that it was working pretty good.

Q.   First quarterfinal since 2010 here.   How confident are you for the next match against Ernests or Roger? 
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, of course I'm confident if you win four matches.   Then you feel good.   That's my case, and whoever is gonna win and it's gonna be my opponent, I'm going to be ready and I'm going to try to do my best and play good tennis.
