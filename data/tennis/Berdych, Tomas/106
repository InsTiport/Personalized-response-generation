 T. BERDYCH/J. Benneteau
      6‑0, 6‑3, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How was your play today, and how do you feel like going to the next round?  
    TOMAS BERDYCH:   Today it was good.   It was a bit hot, a bit humid, but otherwise tennis was good, you know.  
    Finally I managed to stay focused from the first point till the last.   You know, didn't do any ups and downs, just took all my chances that I had, and win in straight sets.
