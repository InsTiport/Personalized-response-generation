 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. The match for you must have been a nice way to get into the tournament, fairly comfortable?  
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Yeah, of course. I mean, starting like that, it's always a pretty good start, you know, not to make it quite complicated, just go, you know, like focus since the first points until the last one.   
 The match could be long, could turn over in any moment of the match, so just really try to go, you know, point by point and making more and more pressure to the opponent and just try to go through as I did today.   
  
  Q. A nice, short match like that, you must be feeling good afterwards.   
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Of course. Every time that you can save some small amount of energy and keep it for the next one, it's always good.   
 But the other way, if you have to stay on court three, four hours more to make the game win, just how it is. But this is much better option.   
  
  Q. How important was the crowd?  
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, it's nice, you know. I think it's just part of the Melbourne tournament that, you know, kind of these groups from all the countries, you know, just the fans coming to support their player and just having fun, you know, screaming some funny things and enjoying and having fun from the tennis.   
 I think I like it. It's great that I can have the support like this, especially that far away from Czech. Just enjoying that.
