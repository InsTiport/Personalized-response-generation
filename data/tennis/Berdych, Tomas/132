  6‑3, 3‑6, 6‑3, 6‑7, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tomas, are you tired?   Are you going to play tomorrow? 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Tricky question.   What do you think? 

Q.   I think yes. 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, so definitely I will be there tomorrow.   That's the first thing. 
The other thing is, well, yeah, I'm tired.   Of course, we play four hours.   But to be tired is the one thing, but to be not ready for the next match is another thing.   So I'm ready for the next one.   I hope that I'm going to be even stronger tomorrow. 

Q.   Was there any point in that match when you didn't think you would win? 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, I mean, I was quite ahead all the time.   I mean, won the first set, losing the second set, won the third set, I had many chances in the fourth set.   Unfortunately, just one mistake cost me to lose the fourth set.   The same thing in the fifth.   I was the first one who break him up.   Then I lost my serve.   Then again I break him. 
So I was all the way ahead of him.   So, no, I was feeling good until the end.

Q.   Was that a major advantage, serving first in the last set?
TOMAS BERDYCH:   I think yes.   Especially on this kind of surface, it's kind of an advantage because you have a one game kind of advantage that you are ahead. 
Most likely in the fourth set was not the rule that whoever starts serving won the set. 
So, yeah, it was an advantage. 

Q.   Tomas, they talk about home advantage.   How important was the crowd in that fifth set?
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, it was not only in the fifth set.   But the crowd is amazing.   As I said on the beginning, it's our fifth player in the team.   So they help me, us, all the team, a lot. 
You know, there is not the energy to waste, you know, around.   They give you some extra.   You know, it's such a great feeling to play in front of them.
