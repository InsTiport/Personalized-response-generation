THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess today's match out there?  
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, there is not much to say.   I mean, I just totally messed it up with the last game.   It was definitely the worst game I ever played here on this tournament this year.   
That's it.   I mean, that's all what, you know, decides it, what make it feel bad.   That's it.   So you have days like this that the things are going well, and then just on the last moment everything is gone.   
Yep, you are not the lucky one, the winner.   
   
 Q.   Now you go right now in London or you wait a week for recovering?  
TOMAS BERDYCH:   No, I'm just going to go home and try to get few days' rest.   Yeah, I think that's the best way, you know.   What should I do here?   I mean, the tournament is over for me, and really I'm not the one that would like to go and watch the final.   Really not.   
So, yeah, I'm going to go home.   I'm going to rest.   I'm going to just switch off for a few days.   That's all what I did before coming here and it's been a good choice, so same thing.  
Then I think Wednesday is a good day to go to London.   
   
 Q.   Can you comment the way Milos played today and his whole week here.   
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Well, if I can what?   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   Can you just comment the way Milos Raonic played today.   
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, I think it's a really guy that we all need to, you know, watch for the future.   He's just slowly proving that he's going to be really a tough player with all the weapons that he has.   
You know, he's been in a tough situation all this week.   He handle it well.   That's another proof of that.   
But still, you know, it was a close match, which always makes, you know, the final picture of the whole situation a bit different.
