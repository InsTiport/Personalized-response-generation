T. BERDYCH/S. Querrey
  6‑2, 6‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Much different game than what you had yesterday.   Very tough battle out there today. 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   Yeah, of course.   Definitely, it was a very tough one today, especially that we play third time in very short period of the weeks.   That's always, you know, really tough to play one guy that often. 
Even those two matches went on my side, you know, I was expecting really tough one, that he would probably change something and would like to, you know, beat me for the third time. 
But I'm happy with the way that the match end up, you know, happy to go through. 

Q.   Your next point is no stranger to you:   Jo‑Wilfried Tsonga. 
TOMAS BERDYCH:   It's the quarterfinal.   You're going to always see very tough opponent.   Jo is not exception.   We play couple of times together. 
Yeah, I mean, I expect very tough one.   I hope very close game.   I hope I can bring some best parts of my game and try to go one more through.
