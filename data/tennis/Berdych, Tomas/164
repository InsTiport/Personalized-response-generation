 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tomas. 

 Q. You seemed to have trouble with this player. What was it today? What was the difference?
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Different than where? 

 Q. Than past games. 
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, I mean, just only thing was different that I had four chances, four little chances in this very close game, and I didn't took a single one, and he took two out of three. You know, that's how these days tennis is. If you get one chance, you have to be able to take it. 
 Unfortunately today I was not on that side that would take the chances, and that's why I lost. 

 Q. Talk a bit about what your strategy was, your game plan, and if you felt you executed on it. 
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, my game plan, you know, on one hand it's tough to say. You know, I came to the game with the way that I want to be aggressive, I want to serve well, sometimes like to play long rallies, be aggressive from the baseline. 
 Pretty much the game from my side was really solid. But, you know, it's not enough to be just solid because you can play maybe not as you like. And if you have a chance, and you made it one, to make the break, then you can win the game, and even you don't have to play the strategy what you want. 
 You know, probably I would like to be in the other position: that I would play the different strategy and then won besides this. But, yeah, I mean, it was just solid one, which is not enough today.
