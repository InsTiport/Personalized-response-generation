 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Bad way of finish a good match. What was the problem?   
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Yeah, the problem was my left quadriceps. Was not able just to serve, move to the sides, and just feel the pain. It's no chance to just play with this guy in the conditions that I was feeling.   
 So, you know, just didn't make sense to be walking sides and just be able to finish, so that's not my style.   
  
  Q. When did it actually happen, or did it happen slowly?  
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Well, it was coming pretty much from the beginning or end of the first set, and then it starts to be more and more and more.   
 Yeah, I mean, I felt it just too much for the serve and I couldn't serve. So to play Novak, one of the best return players, this time to play without the serve, no chance.  
  
  Q. Was it because of the heat maybe?   
 TOMAS BERDYCH: No. Definitely have nothing to do with the heat.  
  
  Q. Was it a problem you've had before?  
 TOMAS BERDYCH: No.   
  
  Q. What's next?  
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Going home.   
  
  Q. You will try to see something is wrong?   
 TOMAS BERDYCH: Of course. Yeah, I need to get healthy again and get to feel strong and be ready for another two very tough tournaments which are waiting for me in the States.   
 Obviously there is a week of Davis Cup, so tough schedule.
