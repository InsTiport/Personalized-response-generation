  Q.  How do you prepare for a match like that today against a guy who hasn't played singles in two years?   
 TOMAS BERDYCH:  Sorry?   
  
  Q.  How did you prepare for the match?  Daniel doesn't play very much singles.  Did you know what to expect today?   
 TOMAS BERDYCH:  Not too much because I only play with him twice doubles, so that's absolutely different.   
 But I know something, that he's very good serving, he's left-handed, and he's great on the net.  He is always attacking.  That is the thing what I was expecting in the singles.  That's happen on the court.   
 I think little bit the wind was his advantage, so he was attacking every my ball.  He was serving well.  I think he was playing quite good the singles after two years.
