Q.  Welcome to New York. 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Thank you (smiling).

Q.  Quite an opponent there on your first match at the US Open.  How did you feel out there, nervous, overwhelmed, was it kind of an exciting feeling?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Little bit nervous, and then, well, it feels good when I play on the center court.  Then so many people come to watch the match.  Well, anyway, here is good. 

Q.  Do you train in Delray Beach? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yeah, last month I was there.

Q.  Are you sort of based there now or not?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yeah, I will go back there to train more like weeks. 

Q.  What did you think of Serena's earrings, $40,000?  Was that too flashy, or what? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  I never know that (laughing).  Well, if it's that expensive, I mean, must be pretty good. 

Q.  This is your first WTA Tour event? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yeah. 

Q.  Where else have you played?  I mean, did you play on the Asian circuit? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  I don't know. 

Q.  Where did you play your other tournaments?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Other tournaments, yeah, more in Asia. 

Q.  Juniors? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Juniors everywhere. 

Q.  But you've played other professional tournaments?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Uh-hmm. 

Q.  You had points for a 4-1 advantage in the second set, right? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yeah. 

Q.  Did it go through your mind that you could win that match? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Well, just I just try to win first point and then second point.  You know, she's Serena. 

Q.  Did you sense that she was at all unhealthy?  I mean, she's been battling injury.  Did you get a sense out there that she was maybe favoring an ankle injury or anything like that? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Just try my best, yeah.  No.

Q.  Did she seem full strength to you?  I know you never faced her before, but...

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  (Smiling). 

Q.  Were you happy with the way you played? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Sorry? 

Q.  Are you happy with the way you played?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Oh, today? 

Q.  Yes.

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Well, yeah.  But I think next time will be better. 

Q.  How did she compare to other opponents you faced in your career? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  I don't know.  Can you say again? 

Q.  How did Serena Williams compare to other players you have played against?  Is there anything special about her? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Hmm, her ball is more heavier, yeah, and she have a big serve, yeah.  But, I mean, now her footwork is not that good, so maybe next time I have more chance to beat her. 

Q.  Have you played any of the other top players before?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  No. 

Q.  Did you happen to notice the earrings she was wearing?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Her earrings? 

Q.  The earrings she was wearing. 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  I don't know.  Her earrings always big. 

Q.  Where are you ranked? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Where I ranked?  Now is No. 2. 

Q.  Two? 

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yep.

Q.  Who is No. 1 now?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Shaui (ph). 

Q.  You are from Taipei?

YUNG-JAN CHAN:  Yeah, I from Taipei.
