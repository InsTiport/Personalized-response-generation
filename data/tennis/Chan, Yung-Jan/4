CHAN-HINGIS/Hsieh-Niculescu   
4-6, 6-4, 10-7   
 Q.  Can you tell me a little bit about tonight's match?  
MARTINA HINGIS: Well, I think there were lots of ups and downs.  I think they played really well.  I think the court played also completely different at night than during the day, like, when we played on the outside courts.   
But we had to adjust, especially me in the beginning.  You know, I think it's sometimes the teamwork, we pull each other at the end, and I think I left my best tennis for the super-tiebreaker.  At least at some point I got it together.  I think the team makes us win tournaments like this.   
 Q.  Anything to add about the match?  
YUNG-JAN CHAN: Yeah.  I think, talking about the teamwork, I think even we lose the first set, they were pretty strong in the first set, but we still try to be there and believe each other that at some point it will come back.   
So since we were 4-Love down in the super-tiebreaker, and then we still believed that we can come back in the end.  And we did.  Yeah, that's a very strong team spirit.   
 Q.  Do you have any goals going to the US Open?  
MARTINA HINGIS: Well, definitely.  We always won in the past, like, before the French, the two titles before Wimbledon, so hopefully on the third try we at least, you know, get to the semis, finals, and try our best.   
I think it always gives us hope to go for the title.  That's always a nice feeling to have going into a slam.   
YUNG-JAN CHAN: Yeah, I agree.
