Q.  When the rain came, you made a pretty hasty exit.  Were you very anxious to get a fresh start?  You thought the rain delay would help you?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  No.  I was just very upset about my game.  Two sets for him and double break in the third.  No, I didn't think something can help me.  
 
Q.  Considering your recent success against Yevgeny, are you very surprised to lose in straight sets? 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  No, no.  I think if I play like this, if I play like this, I can lost ten times in a row against him in three sets.  But my game, I can lose against him in three sets, no problem for me.  But I have no chance to win one set if I play like that  - like this.  Like that, like this.  
 
Q.  How did he play differently today than in the previous matches? 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Him, I don't know.  I don't think he  -- he was just solid, solid.  But not he didn't play his best tennis today.  
 
Q.  When you hit the ball up into the air, you seemed to be looking at the clouds.  Were you hoping that that would bring rain? 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  No, no.  No.
