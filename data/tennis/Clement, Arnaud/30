Q.  I was just wondering how you handled the heat today.  Was it very taxing?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Can you repeat, please. 

Q.  The heat today, it was very hot conditions.  Was it very taxing? Was it very hard to play in today's conditions?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Yeah, it was very hot, but I think my match court didn't see the wind.  But on the court, a little wind just in the  -- down the court, and it was very difficult to play with this little wind. 

Q.  Are you happy with your form at the moment?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Physical, it's okay.  But my tennis wasn't very good today.  I have to improve my game if I want to play a quarter, a semi here.   I have doubles tomorrow to practice a little bit. 

Q.  You play Greg Rusedski or the German qualifier.  You would have been expecting to play Kuerten at this point.  How much do you have to change your plans?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: When I started, I didn't look to the draw, first round, second round, third round, if I can play Kuerten in the fourth round.  He has to win three matches; me too.   Rusedski is a very good player.  He can beat everybody I think.  Kuerten was not really favorite against him, I don't know.  But, no, it's not a problem for me. 

Q.  Are you feeling good at this point of the tournament?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Yeah.  I'm okay.  No, everything is okay.  Just to play better if I want to go in the semis, quarters, semis maybe.

Q.  What things do you think you have to work on the most now?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: For the tournament or...?

Q.  For the tournament. 

ARNAUD CLEMENT: I just have to be maybe more relaxed on the court because today I was very nervous.  The match was up and down.
