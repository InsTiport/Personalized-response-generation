Q.  So did you think that that last game was never going to end?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I think I was very lucky at the end of the second set because I have so many chances and I didn't try to finish the match.  He made a mistake.  It was very, very difficult.  
 

Q.  How were you feeling during that? Did you go back and forth thinking you were going to win or go into the third set?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I try to think  -- to don't think about this.  Just be focus on the next point.  Because if I think of my chances, my brain can explode. 
 

Q.  Your brain cannot what?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Explode. You know? 
 

Q.  Oh, your brain would explode. 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Explode.  
 

Q.  Did you get nervous at all thinking about moving into the semifinals?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Now? 
 

Q.  I mean in that last game when you had matchpoint, did you get nervous?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  I was nervous because I serve at 5-3.  I don't know how many matchpoints I have.  
 

Q.  Eight. 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Eight.  Unbelievable. (Laughter.)   After this point, my brain was just like this.  
 

Q.  So how do you feel about making your first match in a Series semifinals?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT: It's great.  For me, I'm 50.  The last four of the tournament.  First time, will be a very good - great match for me tomorrow to be on center court with a lot of people.  
 

Q.  Can you talk about playing Thomas?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I played against him two times.  Yeah, two times. I beat him last year in Montreal, I played a very, very good match in Adelaide this year.  I hope it's gonna be a good match to win points and for me to have lot of fun on hard courts.  
 

Q.  Lot of fun?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yes.  
 

Q.  What do you think you have to do to beat him?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I just have to play my game, but the top of my game.  If I make mistake - I can't make mistake.  I have to be very regular also in my game.  
 

Q.  Consistent?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yes, consistent.  In French it's regulier. (Laughter.)   I have to serve better.  He's a very, very good player. 
 

Q.  Does it make you more comfortable though knowing that you've played him a couple times and have beaten him as opposed to if you were playing someone you've never played before?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  I know his game.  I know what I have to do to prepare.  I want to win.  
 

Q.  Could you have imagined when you came in here this week that you would be in this position?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  No.  But just  -- I just have to think of the next match, the next match, and I cannot think before I want to be in semis here, I want to win this tournament.  Just I have to think for the next match and... 
 

Q.  Are you liking America a little better now?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  Little bit. (Laughter.) 
 

Q.  ...(Inaudible)?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  Yeah, good city, LA. 
 

Q.  What have you been doing in your free time?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  In LA? 
 

Q.  Here. 
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Here? Nothing.  Just going around...(Inaudible) I don't have really much time to go out because of the tournament schedule ...(Inaudible). 
 

Q.  You have your own website?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I think I have one, but I don't know the address.  
 

Q.  Oh.  You don't go there?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  No, no. (Laughter.) Unless somebody tell me, I don't go.  
 

Q.  Okay.  So what do you do, just E-mail?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah, I E-mail and surfing.  
 

Q.  What's your favorite site?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I don't have a favorite site. 
 

Q.  Wherever you end up?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  
 

Q.  You're the only unseeded player left.  You're probably the longest shot, the underdog.  Tomorrow the other guy's the favorite.  Is that nice to not be expected to win and more fun to surprise people if you're going to win?
 
ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yeah.  I think I'm in good position.  I feel tighter. I have nothing to lose.  I just play.  I have no pressure.  Just bonus if I can win one more match.
