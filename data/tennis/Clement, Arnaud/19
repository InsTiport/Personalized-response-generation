  Q.  He seemed in very good shape.   
 ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Sure.  He played very well, I thought.  I tried to play the way I thought I had to to beat him --   
  
  Q.  Being aggressive?   
 ARNAUD CLEMENT:  Yes.  I thought he was defending very well.  I knew beforehand that he was not going to make any mistakes from the baseline, but he also defended very well.  He made me play many low volleys.   
 For example, I really needed to play the perfect shot to put him in a difficult position.  I should have served better.  Today I made four double faults.  This is not possible at this level.  It was not due to the tension but it was lack of aggressiveness, concentration.  This is not acceptable.   
 But it was very difficult to win points against him.  It's even worse over on clay than it is hard courts.   
  
  Q.  Is your goal already the French Open, or are you trying mainly to practice on clay?   
 ARNAUD CLEMENT:  I am trying to add up many hours on clay.  The French Open is always my main goal, but when I switch to hard courts it's very easy for me to find my game again because it's a natural game.   
 On the contrary, on clay it is not my natural game.  In order to prepare for the French Open, I need to get used to a different game:  Sliding, et cetera.  It does not come to me natural.  I need to play a lot.
