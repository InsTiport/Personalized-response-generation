MODERATOR: Questions for Arnaud. 

Q. You've had a very successful summer on hard courts. You've reached as far as you've
reached in your career in a Grand Slam. Can you leave this tournament feeling like you've
made great progress and feel good about your performance here?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Yes. But, you know, it's my first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam. Today
it was so bad. Maybe later I can think about that, tell me, "Okay, it was a very good
tournament for me, maybe the best of my career." Today I lost. I play so bad. I'm not
happy. 

Q. Was it problems with concentration today? Lleyton was too overwhelming in his play?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: No. I was sleeping the first two sets. After he said, "Come
on," I wake up. In the third set, he was just better than me. For me, I really play
the third set, not the first two.

Q. Can you see in your mind him playing Sampras?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: No.

Q. Do you have any thought on that? Do you have a thought about him playing Sampras?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Sampras has to won against Krajicek, no? 

Q. Can you visualize?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: No. I don't care really. 

Q. When the tournament started, did you look to see who was ahead of you, who you might
play?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Just was focus for the next match, the next opponent, not who I can
play in semis or I can play in quarters. No, just the next one. 

Q. How good is Lleyton Hewitt? Is he good enough to win a Grand Slam? 

ARNAUD CLEMENT: I don't know. Today he was just -- he didn't make any mistake, just put
the ball on the court, and me, I made lot of mistakes. That's it. I don't know. He can
play better than today. I don't know if he can. 

Q. He's not known as a big server, yet he was hitting a lot of aces against you. Can
you explain that?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: At the beginning, I told you, I was asleep. He did lot of aces. Just I
didn't move on the court. Today he served well, yeah. I don't know why.

Q. Why could you be asleep in such an important match?

ARNAUD CLEMENT: Why? I don't know why. I don't know.
