Q.  Pete, you must be terribly disappointed, three tiebreakers? 
 
PETE SAMPRAS:  Yeah, I mean, I just played three really tentative tiebreakers hitting a number of doublefaults, and he just seemed a little bit looser, a little bit calmer in those situations.  I thought he played about as well as he could play but it comes down to a couple of points here and there.  Especially the way we played.  And how fast the court is.  Unfortunately, I didn't hit any of those points in the tiebreakers.  That is what it comes down to.  
 

Q.  Do you feel you really played well? 
 
PETE SAMPRAS:  I thought I played pretty well.  I mean, I didn't play great.  I mean, return of serve was a bit inconsistent but I thought I serve and volleyed pretty well.  I only had my serve broken once the whole match.  I thought it was a pretty well played match.  The court is extremely fast.  It is really tough to get a good rhythm from the backcourt.  I thought I played reasonably well.  
 

Q. You must have felt that you had a great chance making it into the fifth set when you broke back? 
 
PETE SAMPRAS:  Yeah.  
 

Q.  You must have felt really good? 
 
PETE SAMPRAS:  I felt as if I did.  I was having a hard time breaking his serve all day.  To break him there, he got a bit tentative on a couple of volleys.  It put me back in the match.  I had a good feeling he was going to go into another tiebreak consider.  I am not sure if I am making the wrong decision, if I am not serving at the right place, I don't know exactly what I did wrong.  But it just didn't play right -- I didn't play well on the big points.  That is what it came down to.  
 

Q.  Anymore questions?
