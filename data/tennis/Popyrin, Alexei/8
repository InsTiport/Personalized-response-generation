3-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How important was the serve today?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Definitely very important.  You know, got me out of some tight situations.  But it's something that I work on every day, and I'm glad it came in handy today.   
 Q.  Going back to Melbourne when you had a great run and you've got a real crowd you're feeding off, today you're up against a Frenchman who's got everyone and you've got a pocket of your own supporters, tell us the differences.  Do you enjoy where you perhaps haven't got that crowd support where it can sort of spur you on a little bit?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, definitely I enjoy it.  I enjoy playing in front of big crowds no matter if they are for me or against me.  Obviously I prefer when they're for me.   
But playing in front of crowds like that, you know, you've just got to keep focused and focused on your game, and that's it.   
 Q.  How do you think you turned it around there?  He was quite dominant early, but you slowly seemed to turn the tide today.  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Yeah, definitely he was very dominant.  He played unbelievable first set.  I don't think he had many unforced errors at all.  I didn't do much wrong, but he was playing really well, and he was holding his serve very, very comfortably.  I don't think I won a point on his serve the whole set.   
But I definitely just stuck with it, concentrated on my serve, tried to get my serve and figuring out a way how to break him in the second set, and I got to do that at 2-All, I think.  No, 2-1 I did it.  2-1 I broke him and then he broke me back straightaway.  And then I broke him back straightaway.  And then it kind of went on like that for a while, and I got more comfortable on my return.   
 Q.  What gains do you think you have made since the Australian Open?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: I think I have made a couple of gains.  I just feel more and more comfortable.  I'm getting more and more comfortable playing on this level.   
Had a couple bad results here and there since Aussie Open, but I'm just glad to be on the right track right now and glad to have gotten past my first round.   
 Q.  Have you had a look at the draw and have you thought about what you could achieve this week?  It's sort of opened it up a bit for you.  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: No, not really.  I haven't looked past the second round.  I know I've got Laslo Djere or Ramos-Vinolas, but I have no clue who I have in the third round.  I just try and take it one match at a time.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Generally on the clay, and obviously you have had success here in the juniors, but it looked like you were feeling pretty comfortable there eventually today on it?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Yeah, definitely felt very comfortable.  Not in the first set, obviously.  No, but after the first set definitely felt very comfortable.  Found my ground.  I found my point of contact on the ball and I started hitting the ball a bit harder and started moving a bit better and generally started playing better.   
 Q.  Have you set yourself a rankings goal for this season?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: No, I'm just looking to break the top 100 sometime soon and then I will set another.  I'll set myself another ranking goal.  I haven't set one yet.   
 Q.  In a pressure environment like that today, there's a lot going on and there are line calls happening, as well.  Just to be able to hold your nerves, is that something you have really worked at?  Sports is emotional, and it's going to carry over at times.  I thought your temperament was pretty impressive.  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: I'd say I have always had a good temperament?  On tough points, I have always tried to keep a cool head, and I've always managed to do that.  That's something that's really helped me a lot, and I hope it will stay (smiling).
