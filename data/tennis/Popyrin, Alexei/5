D. MEDVEDEV/A. Popyrin   
6-4, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you see the match overall?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: I think first set was a fight. He got the early break. Yeah, he got the early break on a 40-30 point. The rest of the way we were both holding serve pretty comfortably.   
I reckon I pushed him a little bit on his serve towards the end of the first set. Then the second set, he kind of grabbed his game and started playing really, really well, hitting the ball deep.   
Yeah, once he gets on a roll like that, it's tough to beat him.   
 Q.  What was the injury?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: My hip. I kept feeling pain every time I would jump up on my serve. I felt restricted when I was changing direction or moving. Not the best place to get an injury.   
 Q.  How close were you to pulling the pin that third set?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: I couldn't. I just couldn't pull the pin. My first time on Rod Laver, I just wanted to dig it out and fight. I kept telling myself to fight throughout the match, even with injury. I still believed in myself. I still thought I could at least push him.   
I think I did that pretty well. I changed up my tactics a little bit, slicing a bit more, trying to invite him to the net.   
 Q.  What was the experience like?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: It could have been better. If I didn't have a hip injury, it could have been better. Overall this was an unbelievable experience. The fans were unbelievable. The crowd was amazing. They kept me fighting. They kept me going.   
They kept chanting my name. They kept doing Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy, all that stuff. It was really amazing.   
 Q.  What do you get out of this week?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Last year wasn't a fluke (smiling).   
Yeah, so, no, I think I perform really, really well in Grand Slams. Hopefully I can keep performing like that.   
 Q.  You've been selective with your schedule. Will you do the same again?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: Yeah, definitely. ATPs all the way. Not going to try to go down in challengers. I believe in my game. I believe I can get the ranking by playing ATPs. Hopefully I can do that this year.   
 Q.  What is your plan the next two months?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: First I have to see how the hip is going, see what is wrong with it. The plan was to play Montpellier, all the indoors in Europe, then play Dubai, Indian Wells, Miami. All the ATPs I can play.   
 Q.  Do you think the hip injury might restrict you over the next month?  
ALEXEI POPYRIN: I'm not sure. We'll have to see. I'll have to check with my team, my physio, my fitness coach, everybody involved.   
What I felt on court, I really can't tell you.
