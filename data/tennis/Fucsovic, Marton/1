 THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to you to win?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: I feel very happy now. Like I was playing very good today, and I hope I can play like this in all the year.   
  
  Q. What was the whole experience like this morning? Were you nervous? What were you feeling?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: Yes, I was very nervous in the match. In the whole match I was very nervous, even when I was on the match point.   
 I didn't know what to do when I won the last point. I was really happy (smiling).   
  
  Q. He started quite strongly, quite well. What were you thinking early on?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: I felt that I will win this match in the beginning, but he was playing very well. I already played against him in Australia, and now he was playing much better.   
  
  Q. So you thought you were going to win because you'd beaten him before?  
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: Yes. I was very, very confident on the match.   
  
  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about your background in Hungary. You're the first Hungarian boy to win any Grand Slam junior title, which is pretty amazing.   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: Yeah, last year I won the US Open in doubles, so it was also the first for the Hungarian tennis. Now this is the second. The Hungarian tennis is not so big yet. I hope I can be the first very good player.   
  
  Q. What is the coaching system like in Hungary? Did you grow up all the time there playing?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: I am practicing in Germany since three years. When I'm at home, I have one coach. I used to practice with him, but only for a few weeks.  
  
  Q. Where in Germany is that?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: In Stuttgart.  
  
  Q. What about Hungarian history? There are some very good players if you back a little bit, Taroczy, et cetera. Do you know those players? Have you met them?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: Yes, I know Taroczy. He won here doubles championship. I think he's here. I met him before the match. I hope I can be the second or even better than him.   
  
  Q. Did he give you any advice before the final?   
 MARTON FUCSOVICS: No, nothing (smiling).
