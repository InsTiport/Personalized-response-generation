 Q. After having some success in this tournament in the past; kind of maybe being a dark
horse to advance pretty far, this must be kind of tough on you. What happened today?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Only thing I can say, I played badly. That is about it. 
 
Q. Was there anything that he took away from you that you normally do or was it
unforced --
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: No. He really didn't do anything, really. 
 
Q. Where were you having the most problems?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Everywhere. Everything. 
 
Q. What do you mean specifically?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: I didn't do anything well today. Nothing was good. 
 
Q. Is there any reason for that?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Not really, no. No real excuse for that at all, no. Been playing; I
have been practicing good; playing a lot; came in pretty confident; just couldn't do it.
That is all. 
 
Q. Where did you project yourself advancing?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Further than that. 
 
Q. Realistically?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: In the quarters. I was looking forward to playing Agassi in the
quarters, maybe. 
 
Q. Windy out there?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: I wish I had an excuse. I am afraid I don't. Don't have an excuse for
anything. 
 
Q. Did he play so well?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: No, I mean, I just played all right. He didn't really have to play too
well, I don't think. I am not sure. I have never played him before, so I don't know if he
played well or not. He really didn't need to. 
 
Q. Wayne, pretty bad end to a pretty bad hard-court season?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Yeah, wasn't really good. Didn't have any good tournaments on the hard
court season. It is disappointing. 
 
Q. Where did it go wrong today?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Right from walking on the court, I guess. I didn't start off well.
Didn't finish well. Didn't do anything really well.  
 
Q. And yet if you had pulled out that second set tiebreaker do you feel --
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: I think it would have been a lot different story. I would have maybe
been more into it more; more pumped up, I guess, and maybe make it tougher for him. But
the second was probably the key. 
 
Q. How disappointing is it after such a good first half of the year?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: Well, it's disappointing. Everyone goes through bad patches. I just
have to get over it. It has been -- the last four weeks have been really tough. 
 
Q. Where did you go from here?
 
 WAYNE FERREIRA: I go to play Bordeaux and off two weeks I think from there. This one
was a little bit short. It should be all right. Get out; practice; win a couple of matches
there.
