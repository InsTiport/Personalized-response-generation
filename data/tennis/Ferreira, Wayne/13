MODERATOR:  Questions for Wayne.  
 
 
Q.  Is this your favorite tournament?  You have a good record here. 
 
WAYNE FERREIRA:  I mean, it's a good one for me, definitely.  I've always had some good results here.  I've always played well here.  I can't say why.  Maybe it's just beginning of the year, still fresh.  I enjoy everything.  I like the court surface.  The ball's a little faster, more opportunity to be aggressive, serve and volley a bit.  It's a little different from the rest of the year where everything is slowed down so much.  I just like being here.  I've always had a great time here in Melbourne, always had a lot of fun, enjoyed myself. 
 
Q.  Have you given any thought to how long you'll keep on the circuit?
 
WAYNE FERREIRA:  As long as I enjoy what I'm doing, I do it well, I can compete at a level I'd like to compete at, and I'm healthy.  That's about it.
