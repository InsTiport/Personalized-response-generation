Q.  How do you feel when you were playing in the third set for the match?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  I felt fine.  I don't think I played too badly in the game.  Played pretty well for 5-4.


Q.  Do you think the crowd was an influence a little bit?

WAYNE FERREIRA: No.


Q.  What were you saying to the woman in the crowd, she was yelling, saying something to you or yelling to you?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Well, somebody said I must go home, so I thought --


Q.  She told you to go home?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  I don't know if it was a he or she, but somebody said it.


Q.  Do you think this is going to help you in your training for the U.S. Open?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Why would it help?  I don't think it will help much, no.


Q.  Was the weather a factor out there?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  It was hot.  I felt pretty fine throughout the match.  I'm in good shape.  I think it would help me a little bit more.  I thought Andre would be tight, but he had a lot of energy the last two games.


Q.  That breakpoint in the -- late in the third set, the ball actually on the television replay was in.  Could you actually believe that it was called out?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  I don't remember, to be honest.  There were a lot of bad calls, but it went both ways.  I don't think anybody had it any worse than any other.


Q.  Wayne, did you think you had the match at one point and you let it get away?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  No, I don't think I did.  I think I played -- I maybe could have got a couple more first serves in.  I lost two serve games.  But besides that I played good enough to have won it. Andre lifted his level a little bit and played pretty well in the last few games.


Q.  Do you remember coming that close to beating him?  Because both of you played obviously a great game.  The stats were pretty even.  So do you remember coming that close?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Against him?


Q.  Yes.

WAYNE FERREIRA:  It's the first time I've actually won a set against him.  It's probably the closest I've come.


Q.  Is that why you were so upset at the end?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  That could be a reason, sure.  Among many.


Q.  What could the others be?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  I'm not going to tell you.


Q.  Okay.  If I say bad calls, would you answer?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  No, I wouldn't say that, no.  I don't think the calls were a factor to me.  You're going to get that on matches, it happens all the time.  Most times they do, but today I didn't really have a problem with them, and I didn't really let it bother me at all.


Q.  So you leave it to our guessing?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  You can guess all you want.


Q.  Was it difficult to play Andre?  I know you said the crowd  wasn't a factor for yourself.  But he seemed to feed off it with an American crowd?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Playing someone like Andre, it doesn't matter where you play him, it's the same, it's always the same in crowds, always the same.  You just get used to it.


Q.  Were you upset by some of what Agassi was saying?  Was that a key factor?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Saying to who?


Q.  The audible obscenities?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Well, to my opinion I honestly believe that he should be kicked off the court for the things he was saying.  They were pretty rude and actually -- the worst I've ever heard anybody say.  I'm surprised the umpires took it so lightly.  If I was sitting on the chair I probably would have done something different.
