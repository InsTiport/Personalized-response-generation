Q. Wayne, what happened? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: He's a good player, seems to me a little hot and cold and a few bad
ones. He hits the ball really well. He's not really aggressive enough, and if he came in a
lot more, he probably would have won a lot more points, especially on his serve. 

Q. He hits the ball pretty hard from the back court, though. 

WAYNE FERREIRA: He does, but he misses a lot on it as well. He's a good baseliner. Like
I said, you know, just maybe he should try and be a little more aggressive. 

Q. Wayne, in your own free time, do you ever go out and play any other sports besides
tennis? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: Yeah, I play golf. 

Q. What's your handicap? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: Six. 

Q. Six? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: Yes. 

Q. Wow. Are you playing here at all? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: Yeah, I played on Sunday, went and played at Wingford. 

Q. Did you like it? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: Yes. 

Q. What did you get? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: I got about a 79 or an 80-something. 

Q. What about the Cricket. Are you doing any Cricket? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: I don't play any, no. I try and watch a little, but -- especially here
in the states, they aren't giving any results or anything. And like now, I think they're
touring England. You can't see a thing. 

Q. Are you living here now full-time? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: No, at the moment I'm staying in Paris. 

Q. How do you like this -- what's your favorite Slam and how do you like this one? 

WAYNE FERREIRA: I like -- I mean, out of the worst I think the French to me is the
worst from surfacewise. Clay is not my favorite surface. Each one has good things and bad
things, this is a little too far out, a little bit too much going on, too many people, too
big. By the end of this, when you leave this, you have to really go somewhere and try and
relax a little it. It's very stressful.
