MODERATOR:  Questions for Wayne. 


Q.  How encouraging is it to survive a rather tough first round match?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  It was pretty good for me.  I mean, I actually hit the ball pretty decently the last few weeks and lost some matches that I hoped to do better in.  I was very disappointed with that.  I came in here not expecting too much or hoping to do too well.  I had some good memories.  I actually played really well.  I'm kind of happy with the outcome. 


Q.  How important is the fact that you won this last year?  Does it make you more motivated?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Oh, it's difficult for me right now at this stage.  I've had a very poor year this year, a lot of different injuries and things like that.  Last year I came in here ranked 18 and felt that I was playing well and I had a chance to do pretty good, and did well.  This year, I came in here just basically hoping to survive a couple matches.  So it's a bit of a different outlook in the way that I'm playing.  I'm still struggling injury-wise with a few things.  So I'm not really asking too much from myself.  I played a very decent match today.  If I do carry on playing like this, I mean, I have the ability to do well, just depends if I can hold up.


Q.  What are your injury niggles?

WAYNE FERREIRA:  I have a back problem.  It's more of a hip and a back problem.


Q.  That's always kind of been around. 

WAYNE FERREIRA:  Yeah, it's much worse now, the last few months.
