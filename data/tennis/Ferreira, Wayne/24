Q. A pleasing start on clay, obviously. You must be pretty pleased with the way you
played?

WAYNE FERREIRA: I don't really particularly like the clay. I come here because it is
part of my tournaments that I need to play. I do okay. It is not something that I look
forward to, but I played all right today, so I can't complain.

Q. You seem to be a lot more patient than him and willing to play the clay court
tennis; whereas he didn't seem to be quite as patient; is that fair?

WAYNE FERREIRA: Yeah, I actually don't do bad on it. I think I know how to play the
game. It is just I like more players that are tougher to play and a lot more people that I
feel that I can lose to. He is, fortunate for me, probably one of the guys in the draw
that probably don't like playing on it as much as I do. So I was quite fortunate to get to
play him. I played a smart game. I tried to make him force the pace. I tried to make him
go for winners, he didn't really do that well so it was a good match for me.
