Q. Wayne, two big wins coming into this match. Henman, Gimelstob on center court. Did
you have a good game today?

WAYNE FERREIRA: No. I didn't really play well today at all. A little bit disappointing
because I've been playing well throughout the whole week. I was feel good going into
today, had a lot of confidence. You know, I was hoping to play well like the other ones.
Didn't get going.

Q. Specifically what was it?

WAYNE FERREIRA: Not playing well. No excuse. Everything was feeling good. I was playing
well the days before.

Q. Can you talk about the second set tiebreak?

WAYNE FERREIRA: I had a couple of chances. I had an easy pass at 3-2, and I played a
good point at 3-All. He came up with a good pass there. You know, could have been up 5-2
instead of being down 4-3. If I got through the second set, I think things would have been
a lot different, a lot closer. You know, when you're up two sets to love, it's a little
bit easier than being a set all. I think that was, you know, the set I needed to win
badly.

Q. As far as Magnus goes, what kind of game did he have today?

WAYNE FERREIRA: I don't think either of us played special tennis. None of us played
great, spectacular, exceptionally good. I think the only thing is he just served better
than I did when he needed to. I had a chance on his serve. He served well on those. He had
a lot on mine; I served bad. That's all it came down to, I think he was a little bit
better on the serve.

Q. As far as you know playing as well as you wanted to, did that have anything to do
with injury?

WAYNE FERREIRA: No. Just no excuse really. Just one of those days that I didn't play
well.
