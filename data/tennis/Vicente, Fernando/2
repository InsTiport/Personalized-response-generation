THE MODERATOR: Questions?

Q. (Inaudible)?

FERNANDO VICENTE: ...(Inaudible.) If I go to return the ball, then no mistakes, I do my
best. 

Q. (Inaudible)?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, he do in double-fault, I feel like I gonna win for sure, you
know? No more, I feel like I don't want to -- I don't want to lose again. I have to do
now, you know. I prefer to raise. You know, when I was 6-4 up, I hit the first serve.
Normally I put the ball, you know? In the last three matches, I only lose, I put myself --
THE INTERPRETER: When he was at matchpoint, he took the risk of serving hard. He says
he didn't do that in the other two matches and he just put that ball in with the kick.
...(Inaudible).

Q. At 5-4, just to belabor this point, I thought it was impressive that he didn't try
to overpower his serve. Were you thinking consciously about playing the net at that point?
It looked like you tried to serve an ace. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: I try to make ace. 

Q. You were trying to make an ace?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah, I try but...
THE INTERPRETER: He tried to go for the ace when it was 5-4. 
FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah, because on hard court is different story, you know. On clay,
normally we put the serve, kick serve. Here you have to hit the ball all the time.

Q. Could you talk about being in the quarterfinals of a big tournament like this and
what it's like for you?

FERNANDO VICENTE: For me it's very, very great, you know, because this is my second
time, you know, in one Super 9. Tennis Masters Series. (Laughter.)

Q. We got the interpretation. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: It's great, but I want to -- tomorrow I would like to continue, you
know. I want to win tomorrow, and I gonna give my best for sure on the court. 

Q. Have you been able to adjust to being over here in the United States? I mean you
played qualifying, right?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No. 

Q. No?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Here?

Q. You've been able to adjust pretty easily being over here in this country?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I was playing in Toronto. Is like here, you know. So many amigos. The
red wine...(Inaudible.) It's different in the States, you know. It's different here. Life
is --.

Q. We have red wine. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: But is, you know, so many -- like that. 

Q. Yesterday, some people, fans, might say you got lucky because Andre got hurt. Is it
more meaningful today when you win a very tough match again against a good player?

(Inaudible.)

Q. Some people might think you weren't going to win the match yesterday with Agassi the
way it was going. Now, you won. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: ...(Inaudible).

Q. What do you like to eat?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Paella...(Inaudible).

Q. What else?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I have cheeseburger. (Inaudible).

Q. You would play his matches and he would play your match?
