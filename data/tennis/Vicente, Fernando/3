THE MODERATOR: Questions?

Q. How do you feel? Strange?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Not really. Always when you play with a top one, always it's another
story, you know. I was 6-3 down, you know, he was playing well. I try to play. The balls I
was hitting. I was staying up and down because he hit the ball too flat to me, you know? I
don't know, 1-Love, but I don't know why he's retired. I don't know what he say, you know.
I am happy, you know. I try to do my best. I don't know -- I don't know him, you know. 

Q. Did he say anything to you?

FERNANDO VICENTE: To me?

Q. Yes. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. 

Q. Nothing?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. But for me, you know, I was tired in the beginning of the
match because it was so hot for me, and I was running too much. 6-3 for him. And I think
too tired, you know. But he was -- he start to make mistakes, you know and I was coming
back to the match so...

Q. How do you think he was playing?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Him?

Q. Yes. I mean did he seem hurt?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I don't know. I don't know. In the beginning was perfect, you know?
He was fast. He was hitting the ball hard and deeper, you know? I try to do my best, you
know? It was 6-3, but I don't know. What can I say?

Q. Did you ever notice that he seemed not able to get to a ball?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I don't know. Maybe he was tired or I don't know. I don't know. Maybe
he said oh, I cannot lose with a Spanish guy, I don't know. (Laughter.) I don't know. What
can I say, you know?

Q. What were you thinking when it just ended?

FERNANDO VICENTE: What I think when?

Q. When it just ended. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: I cannot believe, no. When you play a top player, you know, sometimes
it's -- that's the thing, you know. Because you don't know why, but he left the court, you
know. For me, I need matches because I don't play like him, you know. I need to stay in
the court all the time, you know. I don't know, is different story for me and for him, you
know. He is top player.

Q. Is this a great opportunity for you?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I have to be positive now, you know. It's nice draw, you know. 

Q. How have you done against Philippoussis?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Hmm?

Q. How have you done against Philippoussis?

FERNANDO VICENTE: He's going to be tough. 

Q. Have you played him?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No. 

Q. (Inaudible)?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I do third round in Australian Open. I beat Todd Martin in third
round. And here is good for me. I'm typical Spanish player, you know. 

Q. (Laughing.) They're all dropping out there.

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. 

Q. What do you think about playing against Philippoussis' power?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I never play with him. Is going to be tough. He destroyed the ball,
right?

Q. Yes. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: I don't know. I try to return, you know. My serve, I try to play the
best I can. 

Q. Had you played Agassi in the past?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. No, I never played with him. 

Q. Before he retired, when you were playing him, what did you find about his game that
was challenging for you?

FERNANDO VICENTE: In the beginning of the match?

Q. Yes. What was the hardest thing in that first set playing a player like Andre?

FERNANDO VICENTE: You know, when I start to play, you know, I try to absorb because I
never play with Agassi. I feel lucky. I go to the court to enjoy. I will have to do, you
know -- was 6-3, but I didn't really touch really the ball. It's hard because he hit the
ball so flat, you know? But for me it's tough. You know, I play with him and I don't know
when the ball is coming, you know. But after, I do better, you know. But that's all, you
know. I got to do myself. 

Q. Did you change anything in the second set?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. 

Q. You still played the same, it just worked better?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah, I try to play up and down, you know, balls, you know. Because
if I hit it like he, it's going to be... (Whistling.)

Q. I read that you took a shirt from Andre when you were 18. You came out today and had
the same shirt on. 

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yes. 

Q. Is that a coincidence?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah, I think so, yeah. 

Q. What year was it when you took the shirt? What year?

FERNANDO VICENTE: What year?

Q. Was that Roland Garros?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. 

Q. Do you still have it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. 

Q. It's like a souvenir?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. 

Q. You don't wear it ever?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No.

Q. Did you wear it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. 

Q. Did you ever tell him?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. I never tell him. 

Q. Were you going to tell him today?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no. (Laughter.)

Q. Are you worried that he would find out?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No. 

Q. When did you take his shirt?

FERNANDO VICENTE: You know when I was playing in Roland Garros Junior, you know, he was
playing with -- I don't know, fourth round I think. But I saw him in the, you know, in the
locker room. He was with his coach, you know, same one. He goes to make massage or shower
and I stay together with a friend. He was playing too in Roland Garros Junior, and Tony
Saad (phonetic spelling) is the name. I said, "Look," we cannot believe, you
know. I said, "Well, why cannot take the T-shirt." And we take it. Five minutes
later, he had to go to the club. I don't know if he -- he has so many, you know. 

Q. He didn't miss it then?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No. 

Q. Do you have it framed, in a frame? Where do you keep it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: In the -- no, I don't know. In his locker, you know.

Q. Where do you keep it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no, I don't know where.

Q. You don't know where it is?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, I don't know where it is. We take it just to say we have it.

Q. You lost it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. I don't know where it is. I play with it.

Q. You played that day?

FERNANDO VICENTE: Yeah. I was playing with. 

Q. Did you win that match?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I don't remember. 

Q. You wore it?

FERNANDO VICENTE: I lost in Roland Garros first round, right?

Q. Oh, so it was not lucky?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No.

Q. You wore the T-shirt that day?

FERNANDO VICENTE: No, no, no. Okay, that's all?

Q. Yes. Thank you.
