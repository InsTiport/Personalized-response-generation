MIKI SINGH: Questions for Vince. 

Q. How is your shoulder? Looked like you were playing in a bit of pain maybe.

VINCE SPADEA: No, I don't think I have pain. I wasn't playing in pain. I was just
playing. It's feeling better. Every day it gets better. 

Q. Are you still tentative at all? Do you feel like you're at 100% right now?

VINCE SPADEA: By the looks of my serving speed, I don't think I'm going full on. I
mean, I'm also trying to do a few things in my game, you know. Also, you know, I don't
want to serve as hard as I can on every ball at the same time. You know, I'm also trying
to get a few more first serves in, just trying to go for better accuracy.

Q. Are you inclined to stay with Joe? What are your plans there?

VINCE SPADEA: I haven't made my decisions about what I'm going to do. I just started
with Joe last week. It was kind of a last-minute thing. 

Q. When is Houston?

VINCE SPADEA: It starts after the finals here, Monday or Tuesday.

Q. Are you planning to go?

VINCE SPADEA: I'll probably go, yeah. I'm committed to go.

Q. Do you remember the last time you had a stretch like this?

VINCE SPADEA: Uh-huh.

Q. Do you remember when it was?

VINCE SPADEA: It was a few years back. I had a stretch like this. Work out of it.
