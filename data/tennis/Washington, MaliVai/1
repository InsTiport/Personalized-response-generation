Q. How do you think you will feel tomorrow?

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: I'm going to be anxious to see how it feels tomorrow, because
that's kind of the problem I've had in the past, just following a tough day off. Today
wasn't that tough, but playing back-to-back days in matches; so, it will be interesting to
see how it feels tomorrow, and I'm going to try to hit some balls tomorrow and try to push
it tomorrow and see if it feels pretty strong, or see how it feels compared to today.

Q. Are you staying here?

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: I think I'll probably stay around, because I'm scheduled to go to
Indianapolis and play there.

Q. By the time you start the match, will you be able to feel it? Will you think about
it?

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: I think about it. I think that's just -- that's just a part of my
tennis game now, feeling my knee a little bit, and not feeling -- my knee not feeling as
strong as it could. And, I mean, that might be just the way it's going to be, or hopefully
it will be a bit of a progression into feeling better and stronger as matches go along and
as tournaments come and go.

Q. (Inaudible.)

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: Not very good. I wish I had played better. I think I gave him a lot
of free points, and that was disappointing. But as Jim Courier told me a couple minutes
ago; that's pro tennis.
