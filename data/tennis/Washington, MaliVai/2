Q. Did you feel there was anything wrong with him? How did he look out there on the
court? He looked like he wasn't trying very hard.

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: How did Richard look?

Q. Yes.

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: He looked like Richard to me. I don't know. I don't know how he
felt. I think some of his performance had to do with the way I was hitting the ball. I
thought I was hitting the ball pretty clean, you know, from the first point of the match,
which is the way I wanted to start. When you hit the ball like that, sometimes your
opponent can maybe not look so good.

Q. How much did Wimbledon affect it? This was a Wimbledon rematch.

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: If I had my choice, I'd take the Wimbledon final over this match
today. I mean, that definitely entered my mind. It was nice to come here, you know, to the
Compaq Grand Slam Cup and play him first round. I mean, that was especially nice. When I
first saw the draw, I got to admit, I got a little excited. You know, it was a chance to
get back at him a little bit for the final. You know, I'm pretty happy with the outcome.

Q. How much did reaching the Wimbledon final change your life in tennis?

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: Not a whole lot.

Q. No?

MALIVAI WASHINGTON: I mean, I'm still the same person I always was. I think a few more
people know me. I get a little more fan mail; a few more weird calls when I'm at the
hotel. A little more money. Other than that, no, I'm the same.
