K. PLISKOVA/S. Stosur
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Response to that one?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Obviously really disappointed not to get through.  Yeah, look, I was behind pretty much the whole match.  Then somehow managed to get myself into a position where I nearly won the second set.
It's great that I was able to turn it around, then kind of stuff it up with a couple of errors.
Yeah, look, it's hard.
Q. What do you think happened in the tiebreak?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I mean, I don't know if it was just the tiebreak.  But she was obviously serving very well.  I was able to break a few times and get myself kind of back into these sets, but I couldn't afford to be down a break in order to do that.
Look, the tiebreak, I got myself back into it.  Yeah, made a bad error at 6-All.  She came up with another ace.  She served very well.  Some of those games where I had a couple of breakpoints, she hit a few aces, unreturnables, all those kinds of things.
Yeah, I needed to be better on my service games not to put myself in that position to have to break back just to get back even on the scoreboard.
Q. How powerful was her serve?  Did it remind you of anyone on tour?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, look, she's got -- tonight I thought she served very well.  She's tall, she's a lefty.  It's not easy to return against.  Obviously, she hits the ball pretty fast.  It's kind of like, I don't know, a Kvitova serve.  You know, it's hard to read.  You don't really know where it's going a lot of the time.  She can hit every spot.  You start leaning one way, she can go the other way.  It's sort of difficult.
Q. Fourth time losing first round at the Australian Open.  Does that weigh on you?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I'm not happy about it.  That's for sure.  Yeah, unfortunately it's another year done.
Q. Where to from here?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I'm playing doubles and mixed here, then straight after the Open, we got Fed Cup in Slovakia.  So I head there, yeah, play Fed Cup, then come home for a couple weeks.
Q. The match fixing allegations, Novak said his team historically had been approached to throw a match.  Have you ever been?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Never been asked.  Never heard of anyone being asked.  Don't know anything about it.
Q. Further headlines of Melbourne Park demons.  Did home expectations play any part here?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Look, I didn't play bad.  I played a decent match.  Played somebody who was playing well.  Had a couple of opportunities and didn't take them.
You know, a straight-sets loss, you don't know exactly what that was by reading a scoreboard.  It's one of those things.
But, no, look, I felt pretty good coming into tonight's match.  I did everything I thought as best as I could tonight, gave it everything, and unfortunately came up short.
Q. How do you think you're going to be remembered as a tennis player?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, hopefully not from my Australian Open results (smiling).
I've had a really good career.  I've achieved a lot of things.  You know, winning a Grand Slam was my dream from when I was eight or nine years old, and I've been able to do that.  There's been a lot of good in my career.
But I'd obviously like to do better here at the Open.
