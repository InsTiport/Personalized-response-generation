THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the match.   It was a strange one.   I mean, you went out so strong in the first, and it seemed like her style of play or something in the second kind of threw you and you came back.   Talk about that.   
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I think for sure I got off to a really good start and wasn't, you know, under too much pressure at all.   I was serving well and getting myself on top of the points and finishing it off.  
Then early in that second set I feel like I missed some of those opportunities.   I was still setting the point up, and then, I mean, at break point 1‑Love in the second set I had the open court.   I missed it, and kinda from that point maybe she grew a little bit in confidence, started playing a little bit better.   And then I missed a few more, and then all of a sudden there's a tight match on your hands.   
I think it's one of those matches where, when you are in control, you have to keep going and keep going and keep going and know that, Okay, yeah, I'm gonna miss a few but believe you're going to make more than what you're gonna miss.  
   
 Q.   Given the slow start you had in Australia, I mean, what does it mean to reach the semis for the first time this year?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   It's a really good feeling to ‑‑I guess it's still only February, so to bounce back relatively quickly is always pleasing.   Yeah, it's definitely nice to be on the winning side than not.  
You know, I had a couple of good matches at Fed Cup, as well.   Maybe that was a really good starting point for me.   You've got that team behind you, you've got a coach sitting on the court to help you through anything that you might be struggling with.   Now I have been able to play three good matches here, so it's definitely pleasing to be able to turn it around.  
   
 Q.   In the second set was it her style of play or was it more you?   In other words, do you take anything ‑‑is this a unique match, or did you take anything away from this match that you need to work on in the semis?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Um, no.   I mean, I'm not gonna go out and practice anything specifically because of tonight, but I think the big thing is that, you know, again, you miss one ball that you should make, you can't worry about it and be tentative on the next one.   
And even throughout that second set, I felt like if I got on top of the point early and really followed through with the way that I should have been playing, then I could've won the game.   
I guess it's just one of those matches ‑‑ not every match is always like that.   Of course she plays a little unique that at certain times can put you off a little bit.   At the end of the day, I'm happy with the way I could bounce back in the middle of that third set.  
   
 Q.   With Azarenka being No. 1, I'm just wondering, you've seen her play over the years, what's different about her now than maybe a year ago or two years ago when she was further down in the rankings?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know.   To be honest, I haven't watched ‑‑I don't watch that many matches of her play, but I think one huge thing is that now she's got this confidence and this belief in her own game.   
She's always been very consistent throughout the year, but, yeah, hadn't made that breakthrough from quarters or semis at Grand Slams, and then last year she made semis at Wimby, and then she comes out and wins the Aussie Open.   
I think it's one of those things where, as a player gets a little more mature, maybe just all around gets a little bit better.   Once you've got that confidence, it doesn't matter how play.   If you've got that, it can definitely be a winning formula.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, along with her and yourself, that's four different players that have won Grand Slams.   What does that say about the game right now?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I mean, it's very competitive.   Of course, yeah, having that result, there's no standout player who is dominating, but I think the women's side is very strong overall.   And because it is so competitive and, you know, it's hard to break away from the pack, I think everyone's really keen, really eager, and we're all playing really good tennis.   I think the standard of our sport at the moment is very high.   I think maybe that's why it's hard to break through and do it week in and week out.
