S. STOSUR/F. Schiavone
  6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you run us through Love-4 down? I think you had won three points at that stage. What was going on?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it wasn't going too well, that's for sure. Obviously just happened very quickly. Wasn't really in it at all. She came out playing pretty well. I was kind of not doing anything. 
 So from that point, just tried to slow down a little bit, take my time, and play point by point. Obviously one game turned into two, three, and started feeling a lot better and knew I was back in the match then. I really started playing well towards the end of that first set.

 Q. Was it nerves or something else, do you think? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Maybe a little bit of nerves. But I don't know. It's not like, you know, I felt really anxious or anything like that straight up. It was just a bad start. 
 Sometimes that happens. I guess matters how you finish more so than your start, so that was pleasing.

 Q. Overall then, how did you rate it? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, good. Thought I moved quite well, and definitely served very well after I lost those first couple of service games. Served well, kept her guessing and off balance as much as I could. 
 Yeah, overall very pleased. I haven't had that form for a little while. To play like that first up is a good thing. 

 Q. How much confidence does it give you to come back from Love-4 against a Grand Slam champion? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, lots. I think you never want to get into those holes. If you do, if you can get out of 'em, that's even better. 
 You know, a good start is better, but to know that you can come back from that deficit is really pleasing. Hopefully that's going to help me for the rest of the week.

 Q. You have an opportunity tomorrow to delay the world No. 1 for Caroline.
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, that's not the reason why I want to win, but... 
 Yeah, tough one. No. 1 in the world. She's there for a reason: She's a very good player. I'm going to have to play well. 
 I think the conditions are obviously tough, but I think they're pretty good for me here. So try and recover as well as I can tonight, and definitely if I can play like I did tonight, I think I've got a chance. 

 Q. If you look at your type of play, very aggressive, going for the big shots, Caroline is almost the opposite, very solid, consistent player. How do he see those two types of players collide tomorrow? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it's a different matchup to tonight, I think. Obviously you kind of summed it up right there. I think it's going to be a matter of playing aggressively but not making too many errors. 
 I can probably say now I know for sure I'm going to hit more errors than her. If I can hit more winners as well, that's where I'm going to win the match.
 It's going to be tough. I'm going to have to play well, there's in doubt. I'll give it my best shot. 

 Q. You say the conditions are on your side. What do you mean? Can you elaborate on that?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I mean I like playing in the hot kind of conditions. Obviously it's extremely humid and you've got to do the right things to try and, you know, stay ahead of it. It's not easy. 
 I felt pretty good out there tonight. You can really get the ball jumping off the court. It's pretty heavy, but I can hit with speed and kind of really hit through it. It's not too bad for me.

 Q. What do you think you do better than Wozniacki? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Um, well, I mean, if you break each individual shot down, I think I've got a good serve against her. Probably a bigger forehand; she's got a better backhand.
 But, I mean, she's the No. 1 player in the world. She obviously doesn't have too many weaknesses and plays very well a lot of the time. I'm going to have to bring some good tennis and really try and get on top of her.

 Q. From your matches earlier, what do you remember from those matches? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Not a lot right now. Haven't really thought about it. The last match we played I think was in Osaka last year. I played probably one of the best matches I played all year against her. Probably look back at that and work out what I did, try and use my forehand and serve as much as I can, and see how that plays out. 

 Q. You played here a couple of times in doubles. This is your first match in the singles Championships. How was it to be alone out there on court?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, a little bit different playing in the Championships in the singles. Really enjoying it. I'm really excited to be here, and to start like this is a good thing.
 So hopefully it's going to continue for me for the rest of the week. 

 Q. Getting back to the first set, when you were down Love-4, what was going through your mind? How did you dig out of that? What do you take away from that for the rest of the week?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I mean, even when I was 4-Love down I tried to play each point at a time. I broke her serve pretty quickly at 4-Love. I think that helped kind of change the momentum a bit.
 Then I held, and then when you start getting a few games back, you never now how your opponent's feeling. They probably think they should have won the set. 
 So it was just a matter of playing point by point. Then you kind of get into it and things start flowing a little bit more. It's not such hard work to try and get yourself into it.
 The key is not to panic and play point by point and see if you can claw your way back.
