  5-7, 6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How much did you feel that that match was on your racquet?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Not a whole lot of it, to be honest. I think it certainly -- it kinda went through stages where both of us were in total control, and then it would flip around and the other person was.
 So I think the first three or four games or something I was really just trying to hang in there. I thought she came out absolutely playing great. And then I was able to kinda stay steady and then I was able to really bump it up and then take control and win that first set. So I think kinda a lot of the match was a bit like that.

 Q. Then just three early breaks in all the sets, that was tough to overcome?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: In the last set? 

 Q. Well, in all three you were down a break pretty early. 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely hard to come back from that against a player like Petra. I think that third set, obviously she got away to a really big lead, which is always gonna be hard to come back. But I got it back to, you know, within a couple of games. 
 And then I think, you know, if I was able to get that first point on her last service game, you never know. You know, nerves, you start tightening up and you never know from there. But she played a great forehand down the line for a winner nearly on the line, and it was pretty much done.

 Q. Did you feel like you made some progress, at least? You won a set today. You got much closer than you have in the past. 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, this was definitely my best match against her so far. I guess that's pleasing. And at least I was able to come off the court knowing that I did everything I could. I think I got beaten by a player who played very well today.
 You know, I'm happy with the way I played. Obviously it's disappointing, but at least it's better to walk off feeling like this than any other way.

 Q. Could you assess your season now that it's done, please. 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah. Obviously it's had the absolute biggest highs that a player could ever ask for in the US Open and really the whole month leading up to the US Open, and then with the final, finally finishing the way it did, is obviously the biggest, you know, highlight. Then start of the year didn't quite go so well. 
 So it's definitely been a year where I definitely thought I could have done a lot better than I was for the first few months, and then I guess I proved to myself that I was able to do a lot better, and now finishing off here at the Champs has definitely been another really good week for me. So overall I'd have to say I'm very pleased with it.

 Q. Is it harder to play against a left-handed opponent for you?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah. I mean, certain left-handers can be very tricky, and, you know, I think someone like Petra, she'd be hard anyway regardless whether she's lefty or plays right-handed. 
 But reading that serve, it's a little more difficult and just the fact that there's not as many left-handers out there. I guess that's what makes it the most tricky.

 Q. What's next for you, sort of the next couple of months?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I head back home, take, you know, probably a good two, three weeks off and just kinda do whatever I want, and then I'll get stuck into the fitness training for 10 days to two weeks and maybe have the odd hit during that period. And then really from December really start focusing about being on the court and putting most of my energy into on the court rather than off the court.
 So, yeah, it's gonna be, I'm sure, very busy, because it's the part of the year that I always try and make sure I enjoy and really do whatever I need to do to get prepared for the year ahead.

 Q. With what's happening the last few months, would you almost want the season to continue or are you pretty much ready for that break?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, it's funny. I already said cooling down in the gym, it was the same thing last year, I got to the Championships and felt like I started playing really well again, almost didn't want to stop. 
 Now I it could probably say the same thing now, but obviously it's been a long year and you always look forward to that break. But certainly it's now makes you eager to do that training and get into the next year.

 Q. If Petra wins tomorrow, she's going to be No. 2, and she'll be pretty close to Caroline going into the new year. Could you just compare and sort of contrast their respective games from a player's perspective?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I think Petra plays a lot more aggressive. She's, you know, got a lot more visible, I guess, weapons than what Caroline has. 
 But what Caroline, you know, does very, very well is, you know, things that, you know, that a normal tennis fan may not necessarily see. I mean, she moves well, competes extremely hard, and really makes you work for it; whereas Petra, you can see those flashes of great, great tennis.
 Yeah, two probably different styles, but, you know, I think, you know, Petra is a very exciting player to watch and probably deserves to be in that No. 2 spot if she does win.

 Q. Of the maybe under 23 players that are out there right now, does she look to you, Petra, like the one with the skill? She can be erratic and she plays a high-risk game, but does she look like she has the skills that can really consolidate and be a solid No. 1 player?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I think she's definitely capable of being that No. 1, in that No. 1 position, and, you know, it's funny. She's very, very young, but already from when I first saw her when I played her at the French a couple years ago till now, it's amazing how much she's been able to improve. 
 And even from when I played her at the Aussie Open till now, I think she's taken huge strides. She's got the game where you will see maybe a flurry of errors, but then you'll flip it over and you'll see that streak of winners.
 So I'm sure as she gets older she will only make that better and better. Yeah, I think she's capable of doing very good things.

 Q. The men are still talking about the length of their season. You were saying you feel pretty good at this stage. Do you feel that's a sign that the women have got it just about right in terms of length of the year?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah. I think for sure the last few years I think we've, on the women's side, really got a tournament schedule where, you know, you can make good decisions and make a good schedule and putting good breaks throughout the year so that you do still feel relatively fresh at this point in time.
 And now, to have two months off, I think it's obviously the best part we've ever been in before. Looking at the guys, I think it's crazy that they still have another month to play. And they go off and do all their XOs in that time as well. They kind of complain about it but don't make the situation any better for themselves, either.

 Q. But looking back, do you think it was a tough decision for the women to make to cut the year?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Oh, I'm sure it was really tough. I'm sure there were people out there that didn't want it and probably players that thought it was not good for them and they weren't going to get on court and weren't going to get points, weren't going to get money and whatever else. 
 I think in the big scheme of things -- I don't think you'd find too many players disputing the way it's gone ahead. And I was a big, you know, advocate for shortening the season to where it is now, and I think it's pretty much perfect.

 Q. You've obviously improved a lot in the course of the season. Is there any part of your game you're going to look at during the offseason to improve even more?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I haven't really thought about that too much right, you know, just yet, but I think there's always things you can always look to improve. And I have had times of the year where everything's really come together, and that's, you know, almost as good as what you could ask for. 
 So I guess one of the goals would be to try to do that more often. It's not really necessarily working on one particular shot as such, but I'm sure once I sit down and really think hard about it, there will always be things you want to get better at.

 Q. What are you expecting when you get back? You only had that four or five days after the US Open. Are you going to be bombarded with attention, do you think?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I don't know. I guess we'll see, but, you know, I don't think there's going to be any welcome home party at the airport this time. I guess I might be able to slip under the radar a little bit in that regard.
 I don't know. We'll see. If I do, then that's good. And if I don't, then that's okay, too. I'll take whatever comes. But it's obviously gonna be exciting, and I'm just looking forward to getting back.

 Q. What will you do in your down time? Sit up in your house and what else?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, that and probably go to the beach a little bit, try and see some friends, I'll get back up and see my family. So, I mean, not that much. It all sounds pretty mundane, but life on the road is kind of what you look forward to. 

 Q. Are you planning to make sightseeing next couple of days? Are you excited to come back in next year in Istanbul?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I definitely want to try and see more of the city than what I have so far. So depending when my flight home is gonna be, I'll definitely try to see some more of Istanbul. If I happen to make it back here next year, then I will definitely be very excited to come back. 
 I think it's been a great tournament, and, yeah, certainly I'm sure it can only get better next year. Once the first year is done, I'm sure there's always things you can look to improve.

 Q. Your flight is not with Qantas, is it?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, it's not. I only found out about that this morning. I was quite happy about it.
