S. STOSUR/E. Gallovits‑Hall
  6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   First question. 

Q.   Are you able to talk a little bit about what happened at the ending with the shuffle? 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, LMFAO was sitting in the box.   I met him before my match.   I figured, well, there's only going to be maybe one chance you can do that at the US Open with him there. 

Q.   How did you meet him?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, he loves tennis.   He's friends with one of the WTA staff.   She was showing him around the center here.   Yeah, came by the table, said hi.   Yeah, worked out that he's a mad tennis fan, loves playing, is going to be here for a fair while.   It was pretty cool.

Q.   Was it a spontaneous thing?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I thought maybe I would, but then I thought I would chicken out.   Then I thought, I got to do it.   I got it out there.

Q.   Did you nail it?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know.   I'm sure I looked like a goose.   I'm waiting for someone to tell me if it was all right or not.

Q.   Was there good energy out on the court?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   It was nice.   I think he was definitely a favorite amongst the young kids.   They were all over there trying to get an autograph or a photo. 
Yeah, always good playing out there on a court like that here in New York. 

Q.   Two dominant wins.   Do you feel like you got your teeth in the tournament now?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, absolutely.   I'm feeling good.   My first two rounds have been pretty comfortable, I guess.   I feel like I've been playing well.   Of course, there's always things you want to go and fine tune in these days off, which is what I'll do tomorrow. 
I think so far everything is going quite well, going good.   I'll definitely looking forward to this next match.

Q.   Have you played your next opponent?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I played her in Alabama in a 75,000 the first time I came back when I was sick with Lyme disease.   I lost that one, but that was a long time ago.   I don't think we've played since.

Q.   She played Rodionova.   Will you talk to her, some scouting advice?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   If I see Roddy I might ask her.   Dave I'm sure watched a bit of that match.   We've seen her play a little bit this year.   This is probably her best year out on tour.   She's been winning more matches; her ranking has definitely risen.   Got to get some background information.

Q.   She's a lefty as well. 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Maybe there's a few serves that I'll have to hit instead being the lefty, but I played Safarova in MontrÃ©al recently.   I played Makarova in Cincinnati, as well.   I guess that's a good thing, having played a couple of lefties in a couple of weeks. 
There's not too many of them.   It's good to have that different spin and all that coming at you sometime before you play. 
I don't know whether I'll get to hit with a lefty, but at least I know I played some people with that opposite spin in recent weeks.

Q.   Kim retiring, your thoughts on that. 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I think the whole tour is certainly going to miss having her around.   She's been a great player and a great person.   You know, I think for sure she would have liked to have gone a bit further in this tournament.   I'm guessing Laura played very well today. 
I guess she's ready to do other things.   She's definitely one of those people that you can look up to and really admire with what she's been able to achieve. 

Q.   Kim was someone you could have actually met in the fourth round.   Are you disappointed you didn't get a chance to hit against her one last time?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Oh, I mean, if that was the way it was going to pan out, that would have been great.   I remember playing Kim a couple years ago in the quarters here.   I lost 6‑3 in the third.   She's one of those players I never was able to beat when we played. 
Again, if it worked out that way, that would have been exciting.   I guess it's not going to happen now.

Q.   Kim's retirement is a pretty big story today and overshadowed your victory.   Are you happy to fly under the radar? 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, it's fine.   I've got no problem being in the position that I'm in.   I mean, I would have thought Kim retiring should be the main story no matter who wins today. 
Yeah, that's fine.   Whatever the case, I'm sure as the tournament goes on, people win, people lose, and the stories always change.
