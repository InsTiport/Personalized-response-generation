 Q.  The most pleasing aspect, was it the serve, the forehand, just the way you handled the wind? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  I don't know, I think definitely just the way that I played all round I was very pleased with it, especially the way I was able to come into the net and finish points off with some volleys.  It does get hard out there with the wind, and you've just got to try to stay calm and just take a chance when you can get it and not be too rushed to do anything. 

 Q.  I know it's only early, but how important is that to get the win in the new tournament? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Oh, I think it's such a tough field, any match you win here I think is great.  To get through the first round -- and now I know that I've played at least two matches this week, and if I can play that same sort of way I can do a little bit better, as well.  The more matches I play and the more confident I get this week, it can only help for Melbourne. 

 Q.  How is it going with Nicole? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Oh, great.  I've really enjoyed working with her so far.  Basically since we got together, I've been in a tournament and playing matches, so a lot of it is just preparing for the matches and talking about it afterwards, but so far, so good. 

 Q.  Will it be a long-term thing?  I know it's only for this part of the season; is that right? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Yeah, it's just for January pretty much at the moment.  I guess we'll maybe sit down after Aussie Open is done and see what we'll do after that. 

 Q.  Do you like to have someone on the road with you? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely something that I'm probably looking to do.  It's just a matter of who that person is going to be. 

 Q.  I saw you were bandaged on your leg.  Is that something new? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Yeah, it's new.  It's not that bad, it's pretty much just bandages for precautionary, make sure I don't hurt it for next week. 

 Q.  How is your fitness at the moment?  Is it different from last year, better or -- 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  I don't know, I think I'm probably as fit.  I hope I am.  I'm not struggling out there at the moment.  I mean, I've worked pretty hard throughout all of December to try to get to where I was last January, and I think I'm kind of on the right track. 

 Q.  Do you feel the pressure every time you play at home in Sydney or Melbourne, or is that sort of pretty much -- 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  I don't really feel pressure.  I don't know, I just really enjoy playing Australia and having the crowd on my side.  I think if anything it really pumps me up, and I think I probably play my best tennis partly because of that.  Every time I get out there I just really enjoy it, and I think it makes for why I play so well. 

 Q.  I know you said you really wanted to concentrate a little bit more, try and push your singles a bit more this year.  Is there a certain goal, a ranking, win one of the first WTA titles -- 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Well, yeah, I'd love to try and win a title this year, but I guess for everyone that's the goal every year, and being now top 30 I guess the next spot is top 20.  I don't know when that's going to happen, but I think if I keep playing as well as what I've been doing and keep improving certain things, then hopefully I can get there. 

 Q.  Schedule pretty much the same as last year? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR:  Pretty much at the moment, yeah, just going to -- I just play all the usual tournaments.  It gets pretty simple when you get inside 50 or whatever, and I'll probably play similar tournaments.
