  6-2, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How do you feel after that win?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, really good. Really happy with that win. Since my first round I think I've played two really good matches now. Yeah, couldn't ask for much more.

 Q. You said if you lasted a week you've got your teeth in the tournament. Is that how you feel now?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, absolutely. I think I played a good first round, and to get through that, you never know what's gonna happen if you tough it out. So now to come through and have two matches the way I have, I'm really pleased.

 Q. Given the previous years, did you book your hotel just for a couple of days, or did you go straightaway through the two weeks?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: You always book it all the way through and hope for the best. I'm booked in for the long haul this time. I made the mistake a few years ago. I made the doubles final and nearly had to move out of hotels halfway through. I don't do that anymore.

 Q. You have been working on your movement? You were talking the other day that you were moving better. It was really evident today. 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, yeah. Again, like you just said, I think I moved really well. It's always something I work on, and I guess it was something I paid a lot more attention to the couple of weeks I wasn't able to play.
 All I could do is footwork stuff and strength and really work on that. I think I'm seeing the benefits of that hard work now.

 Q. You're getting around the court better and running balls down. Do you think that might be helping you eliminate some of the errors?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I think that always helps. If you can move easily, better shot selection, and come up with better decisions at those times. 
 Yeah, whether or not it's doing that today or it's just, you know, one of those things where everything kind of flows from there, I don't know. 
 But I think so far it's going all right.

 Q. How do you like your matchup with Dementieva?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I think it's not a bad one. We've had some good matches in the past. I've beaten her once or twice, and then she's obviously beaten me, as well. So I think it's gonna be whoever can, you know, execute the game plan better on the given day.
 But I know what I'm gonna want to do against her. If I can do that, I think I have a chance.

 Q. You were down today. It seems really lower-ranked women have beaten higher-ranked women. What is it about the women's game that allows for that sort of, I guess you can call it depth, but allows for that even playing field for players that are lower ranked in the world?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think the women's game is -- I think it's in a good spot right now, because, yeah, if someone ranked 100 or the American wildcard, Capra, can go through and beat Rezai in matches like that, I think it shows that anyone does have a chance.
 Maybe there is a good amount of depth there to be able to go out there and beat top 20 players if you're not in that position yourself.
 I don't know why. I guess it's good for the game that players lower ranked can step up and beat the seeds and keep it interesting.

 Q. You doesn't see it that much in the men's side. For women, is it the power of the men that makes it more difficult?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I don't know. I mean, it still definitely happens. But, yeah, maybe we don't have the massive serves that can get people out of trouble in service games or, you know, have that big power base for a lot of the players.
 So maybe it is that.

 Q. Do you think you have to work on something in particular? Because you looked frustrated a couple of times, banging your racquet. Is there anything you need to work on more than anything else?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, I don't think so. Um, I mean, there's always that little element of frustration when you get up in games and you don't consolidate 40-15s or stuff like that.
 But I don't think I played the games really horribly then to lose them. You just want to win that point and to get that break and, um, really get ahead more than anything.
 So, yeah, there's nothing that I'm gonna have to go out and work on or think that I need to drastically improve. It's just keeping everything going well and, you know, the usual things, serve well, return well. If you can do those, then I think you've got a good chance.

 Q. That service game really seemed to spur you there. Did you tell yourself to get really angry having done that?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I got a little frustrated, but I think maybe part of that was knowing what happened when we played each other last week. I was really dominating that first set in New Haven, and then lost the second. 
 I didn't want that to happen again today. I knew I really wanted to stay tough. She's not gonna give up. She definitely makes you work for nearly every single point. 
 So I think that was more of the reason for a little frustration today. I didn't want to go down that same path as I did last week.

 Q. How were you feeling after your first-round match? Beyond just relief getting through, did you feel you could get to the fourth round, or did you have concerns at that point?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Um, no. I mean, it's one match at a time.
 But, yeah, I think maybe a little bit of relief to get through the first one. First rounds are always that little extra bit of nerves and a little tricky. Vesnina had been playing well recently, so it certainly wasn't easy first round you could've got. 
 So to battle through that, I guess I have a chance now to get to this point. And, yeah, I've played well the quite well the past two matches. I'm pleased to have given myself the opportunity to now be in the fourth round.

 Q. Considering your success at Roland Garros and a good run at Australia this year, do you feel right now you are as poised as you've ever been in your career, both mentally and physically, to get to semis, to get to a final, and to actually contend for this championship?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah. Why not? 
 I think I've had a pretty consistent year, and now to get through -- I've never been past the second round here, so now to be in the fourth round is a big jump. I think it's just the kind of following on from the year I've had. It's pleasing to now back it up in another Grand Slam and to be playing well. 
 Yeah, once you get to this point, you never know what can happen. So if you keep playing well, then, yeah, can you find yourself in maybe semis or finals. If I've been there once, I definitely want to try to be there again. 

 Q. Do you feel as confident as you've ever felt in this particular campaign where you are right now, as confident as you've ever been in your career?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, I never had a good US Open. If I wasn't feeling as confident as what I've ever been here, then I think there's something wrong. 
 So I think I'm playing well and hitting the ball well. Yeah, I think I have a good chance.

 Q. Does it spur you on with the Aussie boys, Oi, Oi up in the stands? Does that spur you on, as well?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, they definitely got the crowd involved, and it was a great atmosphere out there today. I knew I had the crowd support. To play well and to have them cheering for me was a good feeling.

 Q. Does that put more pressure on you that you're the only Aussie singles left standing?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, no, I don't think so. It's just the way it is. I'm glad I'm still in. If I can keep that flag flying for a little while longer, I'll probably be really pleased.
