S. STOSUR/T. Pironkova
  6-4, 6-0

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How is your feeling about the game? The beginning of first set you been struggling a little bit after leading 5-2, but after that you just dominated the whole game. How do you assess the first victory after the US Open?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I'm quite happy with it. I know it was 5-2, but 5-4 isn't a big struggle. I had a set point in that game at 5-3 and missed a forehand that probably should have been a winner. At least I was setting up the point well and had my opportunity. 
 Then once I won that first set, I probably got a little more confident and started to relax and really started to play quite well, I thought. To have a 4 and Love win here in my first match, I'm very happy with it. 

 Q. I remember last China Open you lost the first round. This year you came back to Beijing and you can see you're now a Grand Slam winner. Obviously everything made change. Anything different for you as well?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think last year through this period I really struggled for whatever reason and lost first round and Tokyo, lost first round here in Beijing, so that was quite disappointing. 
 But this year I've had a pretty good year. Obviously the last two weeks have been the best of my career ever, so I think it's a time that I really need to try and enjoy. Obviously it's always tough to come back and play tournaments so quickly after winning a tournament like the US Open, but it's good to be here now. 
 It's definitely good to have won my first round here and get through it, and hopefully I can have a good second round. 

 Q. (Through translation.) The Chinese media Always say that you're the nemesis on the court against Chinese star, Li Na. How would you comment on her form?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Just in general? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think it's tough for someone like her. Obviously she's had a great first six months of the year. Probably couldn't have asked for a much better year. Since winning the French Open it's obvious she's kind of struggled on the court recently.
 But I'm sure -- I feel for her as a player, because it's never nice to lose as many matches as what she has being the player and capable of playing the way she is. I'm sure she felt a lot pressure playing here in Beijing, and would have loved to have done well here.
 I guess it's maybe some of the price you pay for having the success. Then all the pressure and all that stuff comes along with it. But I'm sure she'll win many more matches to come. 

 Q. Does winning a Grand Slam give more pressure or more confidence in this tournament?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Um, I don't know. I think maybe probably both. I think definitely your confidence can grow, but then you also probably expect more of yourself, too. 
 I felt like last week in Tokyo and the first few days here I wasn't playing as well as I wanted to. It wasn't like the US Open. You keep going back to those great feelings you had during a tournament where you did well and won. You want it always to stay the same, so I think that's something that is a little bit different to have to deal with.
 But I think it's probably a bit of both. I don't think anyone puts more pressure or expectation on me than what I do. It's always now I guess trying to keep getting better and better and really keep trying to improve. 

 Q. (Through translation.) This year you have won your first Grand Slam title. Seems right now you are in a great form. Do you think in your professional career that you will be able to reach the world No. 1? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I don't know. Obviously that would be very nice to get to No. 1, but there's lots of things I have to do before I could get to that point.
 You know, now I've won a Grand Slam and know what that feels like. I want to keep trying to improve my game and overall become more consistent. If I'm able to do that, then maybe there's a chance I can get to No. 1. 
 It's not something that I really set as a goal. I think it's going to happen if I do all my little goals correctly. If I achieve them, maybe it's a possibility. 

 Q. WTA report came out yesterday, and it seems like you're highly likely to play the year-end final in Turkey, but you still need some points. What kind of person you are? Are you doing the math in your head as to how many points you need, or you just take it as it is and enjoy your game in China Open? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think I know I'm close to making it. All that I know and all that my coach has told me is I need to win a couple of matches in the last few weeks. I haven't done the maths and looked at it really closely because it's not something you can control. 
 You have to go out there and win, and you want to win regardless of making the Championships. I guess it's extra pressure you could put in your own head, but I think it's something you can't get too wrapped up about while you're on the court.
