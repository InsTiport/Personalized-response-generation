S. STOSUR/L. Safarova   
6-3, 6-7, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What does that win mean to you?  A tough opponent, left-hander, as well.  Really big match.  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it means a lot.  I knew going into it I was going to have to play really well.  I think it was a really high-level match right from the start.  I think we both played great.  To get through that -- yeah, it's just awesome.   
I said to everyone after the match, I was like, Jeez, I can't remember being so happy to win third round.  Yeah, it means a lot.   
 Q.  Your serve came up really big today.  I think 14 aces, something along those lines.  How important was that for you today?  How comforting is it for you to have that weapon back and firing now?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it certainly got me out of a few tricky situations.  A lot of break points, I was able to serve my way out, which was great.   
Yeah, I really backed myself with my serve today.  Right from the first game I knew I was feeling good.  Yeah, I was able to keep making good decisions all the way through.   
Playing someone like her where you often feel a lot of pressure, to be able to do that was really pleasing.   
 Q.  Was the match with Simona last time, was that just an aberration, one of those matches that you can just put away?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I'm going to.  I'm not going to think too much -- obviously go back and remember why and, you know, why I really fell apart.  But I'm not going to lose too much sleep over that match going into this next one in a couple days' time.   
 Q.  Do you just focus on your game and not worry too much about what she's going to bring?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think you've got to look at both.  Obviously you have to think about how is she gonna play and then what I've got to do to combat that.  But I think a lot of that, as it often does, comes down to what I'm doing and often it comes down to, you know, what I'm doing off my racquet.   
So I think it's important to know that, but also you've got to look at the matchup as a whole, as well.   
 Q.  Three sets today, slightly longer match than some of the other ones.  Obviously the first round was played over two days.  How did the wrist come through today?  Slightly more attention to it, I suppose?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: No.  Again, no problem.  Yeah, I thought I hit my backhand really well today.  And, yeah, I mean, I've still iced it.  I'm going to do everything I need to do again.  But yeah, not for one second did I think about it or hesitate to hit a ball because of that wrist.   
 Q.  Just on Halep, what sort of qualities does she bring?  What are her dangerous traits?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think her ability just to continually kind of put you in positions that you don't necessarily want to be in.  She's very consistent.  She moves very well.  I mean, she doesn't have a big serve but she places it well.   
So she's a player that you have to beat.  She doesn't really give too much away.  You have to be aggressive but not make too many unforced errors otherwise things can get away really quickly, which is exactly what happened in Madrid.   
Yeah, she makes you work very hard.   
 Q.  The standard of form today, was that reminiscent of '09, '10, '12, the really good years you had here?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I think that's just as good as those matches I played beating, you know, the quality opponents I beat in those years.   
So I feel like today was a really good step up again in level, and right from the start I don't feel like I really dipped a point here or point there, but on the whole, that's probably, yeah, as good as I have played here for many years.   
 Q.  Dave was here today.  Is this the last of it you're working on together for the time being?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  Slightly different one, we have heard a lot of nontennis people come out and talk about the likes of Kyrgios and the Olympic qualities or whether they should be allowed to represent Australia in the Olympics.  From a tennis perspective, what's your take on that?  Do you believe Nick should be on the plane to Rio?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I...  I don't know.  I think if he wants to be there and he maybe behaves himself from now on, it's a good chance for him to be there.   
But like I said, there is a lot of criteria that goes into being a part of the Australian team.  That's for them to decide, and, yeah, I'm not too worried about it.  If he wants to be there, I'm sure he could take steps to be there.   
 Q.  I want to ask you about hitting partners.  What makes a good hitting partner beyond the obvious?  But what sets a great hitting partner out from the rest?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I have never really used one on a consistent level.  My coach has always hit with me.  That's a little bit different to just using a hitting partner.   
But, yeah, I think obviously they've got to hit the ball well, be able to do what you want to do and probably just be willing to work hard.  And, yeah, they're working for you, I guess, so to put that away and still give their best.
