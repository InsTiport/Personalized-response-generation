S. STOSUR/S. Lisicki
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Thoughts on that game?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I thought I played really well. Really happy with the result and the way I played and all that. 
 So, yeah, it's good. 

 Q. Is there anything to work on?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Oh, well, I guess there's always things you want to work on. But, you know, you always want to play better. But I thought today, given who my opponent was, she didn't give me much rhythm, served big, hit the ball hard, all that, I thought I played tactically pretty good, waited for my opportunities. Once I got them, I was able to take them.

 Q. A bit more mental energy than physical today?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Probably. I mean, I guess we didn't have too many long rallies I guess. We both like to go for our shots and serve big and all that. It was kind of a matter of who was going to get the first strike in first I thought. 
 I guess majority of the time I got that opportunity. Then second set was pretty tight. Then got to break and play that good game at 4-All. Then to serve it out after having a couple of match points, a couple of breakpoints, to get through that in that game, I was pretty happy with.

 Q. How did you find the conditions?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: It was a little bit heavier out there than even the night match I played. Especially during the day, uhm, in previous days, I guess with the cloud cover, made it a little bit different. No, it was good. The crowd was great. Yeah, it's always fun playing out there.

 Q. Any sign of the cramps? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, I was fine today. Yeah, I don't really know what or why that happened when I played before. But, no, I've recovered pretty good, played a good doubles match yesterday. Then today I felt better than yesterday. So, yeah, recovered pretty good. 

 Q. First time we've had two women in the third round. Seems to be a lot of hype around you and Jelena. Can you put your finger on why that is?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I don't know. Maybe it's because we're in the third round. Maybe that's it (laughter). 
 Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's always good to have players still in in that middle weekend. I'm just really happy that I'm one of 'em.

 Q. Confident going a bit further?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I hope so. That's the goal. I'm going to have a tough round next against Elena. I've got nothing to lose. I'm going to go out there, have fun, enjoy it, use the crowd to my advantage, see what happens.

 Q. Is there more pressure on her?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think so. She hasn't lost a match all year yet. I think I'm playing well. She's obviously playing very well, as well. I think hopefully it will be a good match. I'm going to give myself a chance, play well, try and execute the tactics. Can't really do any more than that. 

 Q. What is the process you go through with David? Look at recent tapes or, you know, from having watched her? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I don't know if Dave does that. We all play all year. We know pretty much most of our opponents. Sure we'll sit down tomorrow and go through some things. Day of the match, probably narrow it down and just focus in on a few key areas. Just be really clear about what I want to do, go from there. It's just a matter of doing it on the court. 

 Q. What makes Elena so hard to beat? Great groundstrokes?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, fantastic groundstrokes. Moves very well. She's a strong player, never gives up. I mean, there's always talk about her serve and how that's whatever, she can throw in double-faults, all that. But she handles that very well. I don't think there's anyone with much better groundstrokes than her. 
 So, yeah, I think that's the base of her game, I guess. 

 Q. After the last match, you were up 5-1, went off the board a bit, you couldn't put your finger on it. Did you do anything between your first round and today to try to get that out of your mind or deal with that better?
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, not really. It's always something that I try and work on. I guess some days it doesn't quite work out. But today I thought I stayed really focused pretty much the whole match. Never really had a drop, was able to keep a very high level the whole match today. So I was really happy I could go from what I did in the first round to fixing it in today's match.
