THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts after tonight's game?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, yeah, I mean at the moment just really disappointed again.   Leaving Brissie so early.   But, yeah, I mean I think at times I played well to get myself back to a position where maybe I was going to be able to keep on.   
Then I'd play a scrappy couple of points and all of a sudden you're down another break or something like that.  
So I think it was some good tennis and some pretty average tennis at times.   Yeah, I probably didn't play well enough when I had those opportunities to try and get ahead.  
   
 Q.   The surgery and the short preparation and everything else, how much did that go into it, do you think?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I wasn't going into the match thinking, Oh, my God, I haven't done this or that.   It's going to be an issue.   I gave myself every opportunity to try and play as well as I could.  
Yeah, for sure I have not practiced enough.   I guess going into the match you want to think that that's going to be enough, but I think tonight it probably showed that it certainly wasn't enough.   I have a fair bit of work to do ahead of me.  
   
 Q.   Did you put that surgery off because you thought you might make the WTA Champs?   I know you were in Istanbul as an alternate.   Why didn't you have it done earlier?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   There just wasn't an opportunity.   I hadn't seen a surgeon or spoken to anyone.   It was one of those things where I couldn't do anything about it.   I didn't even totally know what was going on at that point in time until I came home and saw the correct people.  
Then once I had seen the surgeon and done that, I made my decision in about five hours and I was in the next day.   I didn't let things linger once I knew.  
   
 Q.   The high unforced errors is uncharacteristic for you.   Is that from no match practice or you just weren't seeing the ball?   
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Actually I think part of it you could put it down to being a bit rusty and it's the first match the year.   You're going to expect to hit more errors than normal being the first tournament.   
Again, like I said before, I think a big part of it is I haven't done enough.   Again, just one of those things.   I can't change what I was able to do, but going into it I thought, Okay, I can draw on lots of different things and try and get through.   
Tonight I didn't do it.  
   
 Q.   Got two weeks now to cram for Melbourne.   What do you do?   Do you change anything?   You want to be careful not to overtrain, right?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I feel pretty safe that I can do what I want now.   Pretty sure I'm going to hit the practice court as much as I can and do, yeah, as much practicing and training and everything else on court that's possible.   
You still got to prepare for your matches the same way you probably normally would, but, yeah, now I do have another chunk of days unfortunately where that's all that I've got left to do.  
   
 Q.   Is two weeks long enough to get ready, or do you think it may be longer before you get back to...  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Oh, no, I'm going to think positive and think that is it is.   I'm not going to sit here and say it's not.   No, I guess time will tell.   
Last year I did all the training and did everything as well as I could and got a bad result; this year I haven't been able to do it, and I'm going to try and change the result that I had last year.  
It's all about just trying to do whatever you can.   I'm going to do as much as I can and try and play as best as I'm capable of.  
   
 Q.   The whole home country thing comes up every year.   Have you changed your approach to that?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know how much of that really played into it.   I felt pretty good before the match.   Of course I was a little bit nervous and you have those silly thoughts that come into your head.   You deal with those and you walk onto the court.   I thought the first game was good and I settled quite well.  
Yeah, then those errors come creeping back and you get behind a break and all that.   I don't know if any of that really had much to do with all the expectation.   
I've said it before:   It's great playing out on a court where you've got the crowd behind you and trying to cheer you on and all that.  
I don't think that, yeah, that was a reason for anything tonight.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to Sydney?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I haven't thought about what I'm going to do yet.   I guess that's a decision that's going to be made sooner than later.   
Yeah, probably go down there and try and get settled into those courts and go where there's going to be a lot of practice available.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to put your feet up and sink some beers?   
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know.   I guess we'll see.   Probably may as well.   No, we'll see how I feel when I walk out of here.  
   
 Q.   Does it bug you though that there is so much expectation behind you?   How much does that irritate you that people think you're being affected by the public expectation and pressure?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I'm not the first player to have their home Grand Slam and not perform, so...  
There has been a few Australians and French players, you name it.   It's a tough thing.   But it is one of those things.   
Again, would I rather have a Grand Slam in my country than not?   I would.   
All you can do is try and play your best.   I know that people believe in me and what I'm trying to do are the right things.   You just really want to perform right here right now.   That's what I'm going to keep trying to do.   
   
 Q.   I think last summer you spoke about how when you got to Sydney things started to pile up and you maybe started to panic.   What will you do differently this year to make sure you don't get to that stage again?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I think, again, drawing on that, I know that panicking doesn't help anyone get a good result or feel better.   I think all that I've got to do‑‑ all that I've got to do; sounds really easy ‑‑   is go out there and practice really hard and do the right things like I always try and do and really believe that's what's going to make a difference.  
There is no magic dust that's going to make anything go away or fix it overnight or anything.   I've just got to do the work and keep doing those things and get out on court and make sure that it happens.
