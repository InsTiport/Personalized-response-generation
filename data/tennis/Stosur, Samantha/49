  C. VANDEWEGHE/S. Stosur  6-4, 6-4  An interview with:  SAMANTHA STOSUR   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Tough night against an opponent who seemed to play really well.  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, look, I think she obviously had a great night out on the court tonight.  I mean, there's not that much to say.  It came down to a couple points.  I don't feel like I played a bad match at all by any means.  It was maybe just, yeah, a couple of points on my serve to go down a break each time and that was it.  I didn't get a breakpoint.  I didn't feel like I did much wrong, like I said.   Q.  Can you remember a game where you served six aces and lost?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, probably not too many, that's for sure.  Yeah, I mean, I think overall I felt like I was serving well.  Yeah, I mean, that game that I lost from 30-Love, she made a couple of returns.  I was probably a bit too early on my first shot, made an error, breakpoint, hit a double-fault.  That was kind of the set done.  I feel like the closest I came to maybe getting a breakpoint were the last couple of service games where I was able to get in Love-15, 30-All on that last game.  But, yeah, she came up with some good stuff when she definitely needed it.   Q.  Do you see a difference in her from Miami last year?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: I think in Miami she definitely threw in some pretty average service games which gave me a chance to break.  That was a really long match.  I think it was 7-5 in the third in the end.  I think it was a little bit different.  I think in the past she's kind of thrown in patches of matches where she's kind of gone away, lost it for a bit, got really erratic.  I don't feel she did that at all tonight.  She really harnessed all that very well and kept it up from first point to last.   Q.  Do you still feel quite confident going into your next tournament?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Oh, sure.  It's always disappointing to lose, no matter how well you play, how bad you play.  Whatever it is, you don't want to lose.  I guess that's the first thing you kind of feel.  But, I mean, there's certainly been cases where I felt a lot worse than this leaving Melbourne after losing.  There's a long year ahead.  This is only the third tournament.  We're still in January.  I'll certainly be ready to keep going for my next event, that's for sure.   Q.  Caroline Wozniacki, No. 8 in the world, lost in the second round as well.  Had 11 seeds go out in the first round in women's.  Weird tournament.  Do you think that's showing the rankings don't mean a lot?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Look, again, it proves that almost anyone can beat anyone.  Even though we're in one of the biggest tournaments of the year where everyone is trying to peak and do everything right, you think the seeds are going to go through in the first couple of rounds, yeah, it shows there's a lot of quality players who haven't quite gotten to that ranking yet.  Maybe they're a bit younger and haven't had the opportunities.  But they're very good players and on any given day, they can beat someone.  I think it does show the depth in women's tennis, especially at the moment.  Yeah, no match is a given, that's for sure.   Q.  Venture who you think might be there in the final?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, who knows?  I don't know.  I've watched a bit of tennis the last couple of days.  I think it's still early days.  Until you really get deep, over the weekend, who knows who's hitting their form at the top just yet.   Q.  Fed Cup for you?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yep.   Q.  Any radical change in your schedule?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Not yet, no.  Fed Cup, Doha, Dubai, Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston.  Kind of the usual suspects, at least for the first part of the year.
