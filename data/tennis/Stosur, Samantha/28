An interview with:   
SAMANTHA STOSUR   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Maybe just first off what you thought of your performance out there.  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, overall I thought it was pretty good considering we had to wait a long time to play.  Sometimes it's hard to kind of find some rhythm, you know, get really good energy out on the court after you've been sitting around for a long time.   
I was quite pleased overall with how I played.  There's obviously things you want to do better.  But to get through that in straight sets, I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  What do you feel were the keys to breaking down your opponent in the end?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I feel like when I was able to go back behind her to her backhand, that worked well.  Overall I thought I served pretty well, so there wasn't, like, a lot of points on serve where she could really dictate off the first shot.  If I could get a good strike, I was in good shape to win those points.  I think I was able to attack her second serve pretty well.   
She was serving her first serve very well I thought tonight, so any opportunities I got on second serves, I tried to take advantage of that.   
 Q.  Do you as a player ever consider the weather when the last raindrops are starting to come down, it really can be a bad idea?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Exactly.  I definitely rushed that first return on that first point, then missed another one.  She played a couple of decent points to win that game.   
It stopped as quickly as it started thankfully.  Yeah, then I just tried to recompose myself to try and serve out the match.   
 Q.  You mentioned the delay at the start of the match.  What were you doing in the meantime?  Did you feel it when you got on in the first set, did you feel you maybe weren't 100%?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I mean, didn't do too much.  But I think for me, I can't sit around in the same spot too long otherwise I get really tired and sleepy, so you kind of sit over here, sit over there, sit over here, keep moving around.   
I actually warmed up once before when it looked like they were going to finish.  Then they got that last rain delay.  It was probably a good thing to get the legs going and get moving.   
It can be a little bit tricky, but it's obviously the same for both of us.  There have been a fair few rain delays throughout the European season, so I think we're all pretty used to it at the moment.
