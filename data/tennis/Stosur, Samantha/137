 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. This was even better than yesterday. You must be pretty thrilled.   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, very, very happy with tonight's performance. Obviously got off to a much better start and hung in there when I had all those breakpoints against me in the first set. I think that just kept the momentum going in my favor.  
 Soon as I got a chance, I took it. Yeah, very happy overall with the whole match.   
  
  Q. I guess in this sort of form you must be able to think you can go all the way.   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it definitely gives you more hope and lots of confidence. If you can, you know, beat a player like Caroline in straight sets here at such a big event, then it's fantastic.   
 I've got obviously one more round match tomorrow, and hopefully I can find myself in the semis.  
  
  Q. Obviously it's been a season of firsts. You've won against two world No. 1s this year. That's another feather in your cap.  
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Ah, that's cool. Yeah, it's a good achievement. Whenever you can do that in your career, that's a good thing. Like I said, I guess to do it here and at the French, they're two big tournaments where it means a lot to everyone who's competing. So very, very pleased with that.   
  
  Q. What was your strategy for the match today?   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Just to play aggressive, you know, really take the court away, make her run, get her on the stretch, and stay at the baseline as much as I good could and attack any short balls.  
 I thought I did that well. I had to serve well I think against her, try and set the points up that way. And then on the returns, go after the returns, and basically from the first so the try and get her moving, if possible.  
 So I thought I executed the game plan quite well.  
  
  Q. It seemed to me as if you played a lot on her forehand. Was that on purpose?  
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I mean, I think everyone knows her backhand is probably her strongest shot. So try and attack her weaker side and get her moving to her backhand rather than having her, you know, stationary all the time.  
  
  Q. Did it surprise you that she didn't have any answer to your very aggressive play?   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I mean, I guess she tried. You know sometimes -- I thought I played well. I didn't really allow her to do maybe what she wanted to do. If I'm getting the first strike, then I think against anyone it's important for me. So that's sometimes the way the match goes.  
  
  Q. You seemed quite controlled tonight. You though you were going to be able to hit more winners than her, but the errors were kept pretty well under wraps.   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, sure. I mean, against someone like her, I have to go after the points and try and hit winners. Sometimes by doing that you do hit more errors.  
 I think I was, you know, okay with that going into the match, that if I was making some mistakes, didn't matter, because I probably would hit more winners. I guess it's a fine line between doing enough and going too crazy and doing too much.   
 I think I found that even playing field quite well today.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised by how well you've been able to turn it around? You didn't come in with the greatest form.   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, well, I don't know. I think it's something that you always want to be able to turn around. I guess when you haven't been playing so well leading up to a big event, there's maybe that a little bit of doubt.  
 But like I said, I had always been practicing well and doing all the right things. I was hopeful that it would turn around soon.   
 Like I said, I had one more week do it. So now I think it's safe to say I've been able to find my form right at the right time, and that's very pleasing.  
  
  Q. And you're going to be up first tomorrow. Is that going to upset your rhythm at all?   
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: I hope not. Obviously an early start, but there's plenty of time to sleep, get to bed, and then do what I need to do. Hopefully it'll still go to plan.
