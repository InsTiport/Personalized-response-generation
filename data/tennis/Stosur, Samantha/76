S. STOSUR/E. Makarova
  6‑3, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What's your verdict from the match?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I think the first couple of games were good.   I felt like I was getting ahead in the games but not, you know, winning them.   And then I got that break which, yeah, really was quite disappointing, considering that, you know, first few games that I had a few chances, and then that really kind of kicked me into gear. 
From there I thought, okay, you've got to step it up and just maybe, yeah, do a little bit more.   It wasn't like I was doing anything wrong, but from there it all seemed to flow quite well.

Q.   What was the key ‑‑other than, you know, the mental approach of feeling that you had to step it up, what was the key to the game?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, I mean, I think mostly that, and then from there, you tend to make better decisions, move the ball around the court a bit better. 
You know, I kept it out of her kick zone.   This court gets pretty bouncy and with the spin can really move a lot.   I felt like I started to actually move those things about the court and the balls a lot better, you know, the way they suit my game.
From there, you know, I mixed up the serve and I thought I, you know, did everything reasonably well.   It wasn't like anything outstanding, but I played tight games and didn't really give her too much.

Q.   You're in the same half of the draw as Vika who has pulled out today.   Is that an advantage, looking ahead, No. 1 seed is no longer in contention? 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Oh, look, maybe it's good for anyone in this half of the draw, but to be honest with you, to get to that point it's going to be pretty tough.   Everybody that you play is in the top 29, I think. 
You know, No. 1 or No. 2 now being out, I guess, it could help for whoever gets through that part, but nevertheless you're going to play someone who is 4 or 5 anyway, so it's not like it's a huge advantage.
