 L. SAFAROVA/S. Stosur
  7‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What's the situation?   Obviously that's a disappointing result.   There were a couple of chances to come back in that second set.   Talk about the match.   
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I think the first set I was up 5‑2 and really got in control of the match from when I first broke and then let that slip away when I was trying to serve out the set.   And then again I was up in the tiebreak and hit a double fault, played another point that didn't really do too much.   
She kept pressing the whole time.   You know, as that tiebreak went on, it could have gone either way.   It didn't go my way.   
Then again, I was up a break early in that second set and let that slip away again.   Came back.   
I think it was just one of those matches where there was just a couple of points in it where, you know, she stepped up, and maybe when I had a similar opportunity, I didn't do enough.   You know, then you lose 6 and 6.  
   
 Q.   What do you do about consistency at the moment?   Because things just haven't been there, have they, since the French?   Do you feel it's a technical aspect, or is it just the mental aspect?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   It's probably a bit of everything, yeah.   Since the French I don't feel like I've played as well as what I'm capable of.   You know, it's been on my least‑favorite surface.   That period of time has been a lot longer this year than what it normally is simply because of the Olympics.  
You know, I'm trying not to worry about it too much.   I think today was definitely an improvement on the round before, and, you know, I feel like it's getting there.   But, you know, hopefully next week you get a few more wins, and then all of a sudden things turn around and that confidence builds.   You know, nothing is that big a deal.  
Yeah, I think since the French my form has been lacking a little bit.   Again, I think it's because of that prolonged period.   It just seems not much has happened and it's been over a long period of time but without too many matches played.  
   
 Q.   Are you worried about it?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   No.   I mean, I'm trying not to.   I think each day, each week, you've got to get out on the court and keep doing the right things.   Eventually it's going to come back.  
You know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but I know that I need to try and improve things a little bit more than what I'm currently at.  
   
 Q.   You were runner‑up there, weren't you, in Toronto?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Do you know how much of an effect, if at all, it will have on your ranking, not defending those points?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   To be honest, I don't know.   I don't really look at that stuff.   I know what I'm ranked and whatever else, and the more matches you win, the better off you're going to be.   I know that it's not the greatest thing to go from a final to whatever we were, third round, but again, I can't control the points and all that.   I have just got to control the matches I win, and hopefully you don't lose too many.  
   
 Q.   What have you got coming up?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   What do you mean?   
   
 Q.   Tournament‑wise, before going into the US Open, what have you got?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Just Cincinnati.   Go there and then hopefully try and do a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   Would you consider playing, let's say, New Haven, as well, to try to get a few more matches under your belt?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, I haven't thought about it so far.   I mean, just trying to take it, you know, week by week.   
Yeah, it's not something ‑‑I'm not going to all of a sudden rush out and think that I need to change my schedule.   If it comes up in conversation, then I'll definitely think about it, but so far I'm going to play Cincinnati and prepare for the US Open.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to head there to Cincy like tomorrow or when?  
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, tomorrow morning.
