C. McNALLY/S. Stosur
6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your take on the match tonight?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Well, I mean, when I was able to execute what I was trying to do, I felt like I was playing some pretty good tennis. Trying to find some positives in a loss.
But, yeah, look, she's going to be an up-and-coming player, no doubt about it. Credit to her. She handled herself well.
Yeah, there's things I definitely wish I could have done a little bit better.
Q. Tough for you on the breakpoints, created a lot of opportunities, but struggled to convert.
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, I mean, absolutely. The first set was 5-1, could have easily been 3-2. I think I had at least six breakpoints, maybe even one more. I was obviously doing something all right to get myself those opportunities. But you've got to be able to take them.
That's unfortunately the difference, especially in the first set. If I was able to keep that a little bit closer, get one or two of those, you never know how things can turn out. When you get yourself down 5-1, they can obviously start free swinging a little bit more.
Q. You work incredibly hard clearly. You've had trouble in the first rounds, in particular at home. Is it disappointing to lose again early in the tournament?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Of course it is, yeah. I do all the things that you need to do, doesn't necessarily unfortunately seem to come off here for me. Whereas, you know, other tournaments around different places, whatever else, it seems to be a little bit easier for me.
Of course, it's disappointing.
Q. Is it the fact that you're an Aussie playing in Australia that makes it harder? Do you feel like there's extra pressure?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: No, I don't think that's the issue. Obviously it's a little bit different, no doubt. I think all the Aussies would feel it. Some thrive on it, some find it a little bit harder.
Yeah, I don't use that as a reason or an excuse or anything like that. There's certainly been years in the past where I did struggle with that. But at the moment I don't think it's that.
I think the conditions I find really hard with these courts and balls. I just don't get the same reward off the court as what I do outside of Australia. I find that difficult every single time.
Try and knuckle down and do it again.
Q. A lot of players talk about the first round, the most tricky round. Why is it so tricky?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, you're a qualifier, last person in the draw, or Rafa, Roger, Serena, everyone, I think everyone is nervous in the first round. Everyone gets a bit of nerves in every single match. If you don't, then there's probably something wrong with you. You're pretty abnormal I think if you're not going to feel anything.
I think it's just one of those things you want to get your way in. Once you kind of, for a lot of players, get that first match, maybe a second match, things just seem a whole lot easier sometimes.
Q. You moved on quickly last year. Does that give you confidence you can do the same?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: That's what I'm going to try to do, for sure. Out tomorrow morning at 10:00 with my doubles partner to try to work on a few things, get on court together. We've only been able to play one match in Brisbane.
Yeah, it will be back to practice, training, doing that all over again tomorrow morning.
Q. Is this something that will sting and stay with you or will you be able to process it and move on quickly?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, of course, it hurts. But at the end, you got no choice to kind of move on pretty quick. If I want to be down in the dumps, a sad sack, it's not going to help me go out there and play well in the dubs.
Sometimes you have to suck it up for a day or two after. That's just the way it is. Tennis, we get another chance a couple days later. We have to make the most of that opportunity.
Q. You spoke a little bit about not having much expectations. What are you thinking this year going forward with your singles career?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I want to keep playing, no doubt. I guess my ranking is going to see where that allows me to keep playing, what I want to do. Kind of assess it as it goes.
I know my schedule for the first six months or so where I think it's going to be pretty all right with what I want to try and do.
Yeah, if I can win matches and do the things that I think I'm still capable of, then hopefully I'm still main draw Grand Slams and having another shot.
Q. What about the Olympics? You might become a five-time Olympian. That is a major focus?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Definitely trying to get there. Yeah, if I can make it to a fifth Olympics, that would be quite incredible. A couple years ago, I didn't think it was anywhere on the radar. Now we're getting close to it. It's certainly a possibility.
Yeah, that would definitely be a highlight of the year down the track if I'm able to get myself to Tokyo.
Q. Is the Olympics something you talk about with the other players, all sort of gearing towards the same goal there?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Oh, I mean, anyone wants to try and get there. Especially Australians, we love sport in general. To be part of an Australian Olympic team for the first time or third time, fifth time, whatever, it's something very special.
I think the players around the world think that the Olympics is an incredible event for us. So no doubt, it becomes a bit of a focus and a goal for everyone to try and get there who's able to qualify.
Q. With the rest of the Aussie girls, you have a lot of experience, do you talk to Ash, any of those younger girls?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, tons of the younger ones. We practice a lot through December. I was down here in Melbourne training, hitting with a lot of them. I played doubles with Lizette last week. I really enjoyed seeing them, practicing with them, hanging out with them a little bit when you get the opportunity. They're an awesome group of girls. They support each other extremely well for being an individual sport.
I really enjoy seeing them do well and how much they get behind each other and always wish the best for each other, even though they're obviously strong competitors out there.
All of those girls between 120 and 250, say, who are playing the quallies here, got a couple of wildcards, if they can keep pushing each other along to try to get up the rankings, it would be awesome to see.
Q. Do you think you'll be at the Australian Open next year?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I'm planning on it (smiling).
