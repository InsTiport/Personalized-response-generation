  M. SHARAPOVA/S. Stosur  6-3, 6-4    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Maria just did her press and talked about I suppose the quality of your shots and heavy kick on your serve is a ball she likes to play.  How do you feel when you come up against an opponent that your biggest weapons play right into their hands?  What can you do in a matchup like that?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, it's obviously hard, but unfortunately I guess today my biggest weapons weren't I don't think hit as well as what they've been going.  When they're not as good, yeah, makes it easier for her. Yeah, today is a match where I felt really good going into it, and I'm just incredibly angry with myself right now that I wasn't able to do more and give myself more of a chance it really feel like I was in the match.   Q.  What were the things you were angry about?  What didn't you do as well as you wanted to do or where did it go wrong?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: It was all round a bit sloppy.  Never really felt like I played really well for long period of the match. Kind of got that break at 2-1, and then handed it straight back with a pretty average game. Yeah, just things like that.  Never any momentum; never any rhythm or anything to the match. It was incredibly frustrating.   Q.  I would like to know, how did you prepare?  Last few days weather has been in morning has been quiet sunny and nice, and then late in the afternoon is all windy and cloudy.  How do you prepare for those kind of conditions?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Just have to do what you can.  I mean, obviously tennis there are so many variables day to day.  You just got to be ready for anything. I mean, I knew it was a little bit windy before the match, and then, yeah, out there it was very tough conditions at times and not so easy from certain ends and all that. But that's something that we've got to be prepared to play in.  I mean, especially here.  In Paris it can change a lot it day to day.   Q.  Obviously all in all do you take a bit of confidence out of the past few weeks the way you've been playing, and are you sort of hopeful of have a decent sort of grass court campaign?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, look, I think my tennis the last month or so has really picked up.  If I look at it from a bit more of a broader picture, things are moving in the right direction again, which is a good feeling. Yeah, feel like I'm playing a lot better at the moment, so kind of makes today even more annoying.  Look, it is what it is.  I'll be ready for the grass, and then, yeah, for the rest of the year. So I guess it's a good feeling that I feel like the good tennis is starting to come out again.   Q.  How difficult is it to beat Sharapova here?  Is she almost becoming Rafa-like on these grounds?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: I wouldn't say she's Rafa-like.  That may be a bit of overstatement.   Q.  She has a good record.  SAMANTHA STOSUR: She does have a good record.  Yeah, it's a very good record.  I don't know.  She's tough to play.  I don't necessarily think she's got -- today it wasn't like she played great tennis that beat me. Unfortunately I let a few other things annoy me.  Yeah, it is what it is.  But she does have a very good record, and I guess we'll see how in record continues or doesn't.   Q.  Where do you go from here?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: I am going to Florida to take a couple weeks off, and then start on the grass in Eastbourne.   Q.  Just the one leadup tournament?  SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yep.
