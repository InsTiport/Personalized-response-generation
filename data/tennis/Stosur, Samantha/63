    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.     
   
 Q.   It's been a while between fourth rounds at slams.   How pleasing is that?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, very pleasing.   Very happy, I think it's the first time I won three matches in a row for a while, too.   Yeah, it's all good.   I'm really happy with the way I played today.   
    And to keep playing well, you know, when your opponent is putting you under pressure at certain times in the match, it's really amazing to come out of those as well.   And I'm pleased to find myself in the fourth round.  
   
 Q.   In some ways is it good to have that test?   The first two matches were pretty routine, to have more of a challenge this time and know you can get out of it?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, you'll take whatever you can get, really.   Yeah, again, I do feel like today was the hardest match so far.  
    I felt like I stepped up and I did what I needed to do.   I felt she actually came out and played pretty well.   She was trying to play really aggressive.   And I was ‑‑again, when she was doing that, if I couldn't attack, I thought I defended pretty well.   Then as soon as I got my chance, I really went after it.   
    I knew I was going to do exactly that same thing.   As soon as I dropped the ball short she stepped in and really went for the line.  
    I was trying to do that back at her and hopefully before she could do it to me.  
   
 Q.   Talking about hypotheticals at the moment, but if you do play Maria in the next round, I guess it's an opposite situation today where head to head you're in the wrong end of that.   How do approach that if that's the case?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I will approach it like I do with most matches.   Even today I knew I had a good head to head, but you certainly don't take anything for granted.   I knew she was going to come out there and try and change that.   
    That's exactly what I will try and do against Sharapova if that's who I end up playing.   I have beaten her before.   I know what it takes.   I know I have to play very well against her.   
    I know there are certain things I have to do well and if I don't, then it makes life very, very tough that day.  
    I will go out there and certainly give it my best shot.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're playing as well on the clay this week as you were in the year you had the run to the final?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know.   It's kind of hard to compare the two, but, yeah, I don't know.   Maybe very similar.   But regardless, I do feel very comfortable at the moment.   
    I'm very pleased with the way I'm playing.   So whether it's the same or better or worse, I don't know, but whatever it is I'm quite happy with it.  
   
 Q.   What do you think is the most important thing that's clicking for you here at the moment?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I don't know.   It's probably just a combination of doing all the things that I know I can do well.   I mean, I think today I served very, very well, better than I served the first couple of matches.   It's a good feeling to be able to step up to the line and if it's break point you can hit an ace, if it's match point you can hit an ace.  
    That really got me through some tight moments today, which is great, whereas, it wasn't maybe the same the first two rounds.  
    You know, just trying to use my forehand, use the court the way I can to open it up and give myself space and trying to move forward.  
    I think it's not really one thing.   It's probably the combination my whole game being able to flow out there.  
   
 Q.   With all the seeds falling, Radwanska today, as well, obviously can you focus on your next match?   But is it hard not to get a little excited and see it as a big opportunity maybe?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I guess it is an opportunity, but like before, I have only beaten Maria a couple of times; she's beaten me nine or ten.   
    It's a bit irrelevant up until I play this next match, if it's against her or if it's against Ormaechea.   You never know what can happen.   I will play my next one and then we will see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Have the matches against Maria followed a particular pattern?   Is there something you sort of trace through all those losses and a couple of recent wins that you can take out of that looking forward?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I know there are a couple of times I have beaten her I did things a little bit different or a little bit better.   But I mean, at the end of the day it's kind of, I've got to do what I do well.   Sometimes it doesn't always match up great against her if I'm not doing it well enough.  
    But, you know, we have never played here, so I will take that as a good thing.  
    We played each other a couple weeks ago in Madrid, which is probably good to have that fresh in the mind and think this didn't work, that didn't go well, this did, and really try and be clear and go out there and do, you know, what I feel I like I need to and hopefully do it well.  
   
 Q.   There's a little girl running around at the futures championship from your home state hoping to do the same thing you're doing.   Do you think she has a bright future?   I hear you have had time with her in the past.   
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I actually don't know who she is, but hopefully she does, yeah (laughter).  
   
 Q.   We have questions from fans to players.   We do this every year.   We have a question for you.   Fans found out that you're particularly fond of French wine and pÃ¢tisseries.   The question is:   Does that not get to be a little problem when you're in Paris competing for a sporting event?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Well, the bakeries are fine.   I don't think they are too much of a problem.   But I don't ‑‑yeah, I haven't enjoyed any French wine this week, so that's okay.   But I'm enjoying the baguettes instead.  
   
 Q.   But is it true that you're...   
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I'm no connoisseur, but if we're out at dinner having maybe a bit of a celebration at the end of the tournament, then I would certainly enjoy it.  
   
 Q.   What is your preferred wine?  
    SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Like I said, I'm no connoisseur.   I don't know (smiling).
