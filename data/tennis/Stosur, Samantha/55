Y. WICKMAYER/S. Stosur
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You never really got into it, did you, after the first service game?   Sort of catch‑up from there. 
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, look, it wasn't a very good start for sure.   But I actually didn't feel like, apart from trying to play that little catch‑up with the break behind, I felt like I was playing quite well. 
I served very well.   Yeah, again, having that break of serve right at the start, for her to get that lead obviously frees her up a little bit.   I thought she played very, very well. 
Yeah, early in that second set I had a chance to break serve; didn't get it.   Then it was service games, service games, service games.   She gets a let cord at 30‑All to get a break; down a break. 
Look, I don't feel like I played that bad a match, to be honest with you.

Q.   Is that encouraging with what's coming ahead in the next few months?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I mean, in some ways it's good and in some ways it sucks, because you're done, you wait another four or five weeks till you get to play again. 
I don't feel like I played bad.   There's only so much you can really be down on yourself about apart from losing.

Q.   You said last week it all happened pretty smoothly with Miles.   Were you feeling unsettled at all coming into today?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   No.   I had some really great practices.   I felt really good going into today's match.   I didn't think about it at all.   It's something that happened. 
I go out there today; unfortunately, I didn't win.

Q.   You take a bit of time now to think about that situation, what you want for the future?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, for sure start thinking about it a little bit. 
I mean, by no means a rush, yeah, to just pick someone.   I want to really take my time and think about it and make sure I'm doing the right thing.

Q.   You took your time last time getting a coach, a couple of months.   Did you learn anything from that process that you think you'll be able to utilize when you're looking this time?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Maybe.   I think I still know what I want out of them.   I don't think that's changing too much.   But I think it's a hard thing.   You know, there's probably a handful of coaches that you might want to think about.   They've probably all got jobs. 
It's one of those things.   It's not an easy thing to find that right and ‑‑ that you think is going to be that perfect match.

Q.   Do you feel like you know exactly what you need at this stage of your career?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, I think so.   I think I need to go out there, keep working hard, work on my own tennis, draw on what I do well, know what I need to work on, and do that day in, day out. 
I think I know enough about my tennis to know how to do it.   But obviously if you're going to hire a coach, you want that person to obviously help in that process. 
But nothing beats getting out on the practice court and doing the hard work as well, at this moment while there isn't that person to be there. 
You know, that's fine.   That's what I'm going to go out and do.

Q.   In the scale of your career, do you walk off today and still think‑‑ are you still baffled by the whole Wimbledon thing, why it doesn't work for you here?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   Yeah, pretty annoyed about it, to be honest.   Yeah, I don't have an answer 'cause, like I said, I do feel I played well; I think she played well and she stuck to it right from first point to last point. 
She did well to carry that through, and nearly without a blip. 
That's that.   I still think I'm a good enough player to get through first rounds here, and for whatever reasons it's not happening. 

Q.   You move on now to the US Open.   What is your plan in the lead‑up to the event?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   I'm playing doubles and mixed here.   I think there's about three weeks off where I'm not going to play any tournaments.   I start in Stanford, MontrÃ©al, Cincinnati, then I'll play US Open. 
So still got plenty of tennis leading up to New York.   That's a time where I really do need to, you know, do all the things that I keep thinking about, practicing on the practice court, going out there and really just letting it happen when it counts. 

Q.   You're playing with Wickmayer in doubles?
SAMANTHA STOSUR:   No, Pennetta.   I'm playing with Nenad Zimonjic in the mixed.
