 Q. Was there a moment of hope there in that second set, a moment of hope in that second
set that something wonderful might happen? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: Well, it was 2-Love and then I got a game point for 3-1, so that was a
moment. Then I made a mistake and finally it was 2-All, so not really.  
 
Q. Are you pleased; I mean, this was your best performance at a Grand Slam event? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: Yes.  
 
Q. Talk a little bit about how it felt to get that far for you? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: It is a good feeling, always is good to feel that something is better
and better, last year I lost four times in first round. This year I won on every Grand
Slam one round, and here two rounds, so it is nice.  
 
Q. Would you tell us what you think about Steffi Graf? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: I think she is an excellent player and she is a little bit different
level of play than other players are or like top 100 players are, so --  
 
Q. So do you play her just to see how far you've got to go or how far you have come? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: I think it is not such a big difference. I saw before a match and --  
 
Q. It is not the big difference, you thought? 
 
 RADKA BOBKOVA: Yeah. In the finish, I was little bit nervous, but then I start to play
what I know and it was not so bad, like I saw before, so...
