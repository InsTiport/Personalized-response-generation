MODERATOR:  Ladies and Gentlemen, Alexander Popp. 


Q.  Did you expect to get this far when you started?

ALEXANDER POPP:  It's an easy answer:  definitely, no. 

Q.  You've got your family here watching you, your mother and father?

ALEXANDER POPP:  No, my father is not here.  He had to leave because he's got to work back home.

Q.  I come from Birmingham.  Wolverhampton is near to Birmingham.  Was it a long time ago she left there?

ALEXANDER POPP:  She was born there, grew up there.  She's been to Germany probably for about 30 years now, I guess.

Q.  You sound very British to a British ear.  Do you sound as German to a German ear?

ALEXANDER POPP:  I hope so, yeah.  I guess I do, yeah.  I grew up in Germany, so I think my German is all right (laughter). 

Q.  When was the British thing first raised, considering playing for Britain?

ALEXANDER POPP:  After I won my first round here.  Got worse after I beat Chang here.

Q.  Never before?

ALEXANDER POPP:  No.  Probably if I would have lost first round here, I think nobody would have sort of asked me about it. 

Q.  You could be our only British quarterfinalist at this rate (referring to Henman down in his match). 

ALEXANDER POPP:  Did Tim lose? 

Q.  No. 

ALEXANDER POPP:  He'll win.

Q.  Any thoughts on your next opponent?

ALEXANDER POPP:  Probably Patrick Rafter.  Well, it will be fun playing him.  I mean, for me it's just great, this tournament.  I just know all these guys from television more or less.  It's a nice experience, totally different to play them on court. 

Q.  You like playing on grass, like to volley a bit?  What do you feel about the surface generally?

ALEXANDER POPP:  I mean, this is the first grasscourt tournament of my life.  I'm very happy up till now.  I can't complain.  I won a couple of matches.  Yeah, I guess it suits my game. 

Q.  If I said to you, What do you know about Wolverhampton, what would you say it has there?

ALEXANDER POPP:  Not much, to be honest.  I've been there a couple of times when I was younger because my grandparents lived there.  Since they died, I haven't really been there.  That's a long time ago. 

Q.  How do you find Rosset's serve today?

ALEXANDER POPP:  He didn't serve very well in the beginning, had a couple of double-faults.  Third and fourth set was a lot better, I think.  It was difficult to break him.  You see, it's always a question whether you're up or down.  If you're up, you always serve better than if you maybe break down.  Got a lot of pressure on yourself, then you hit a couple of double-faults.  That's what happened, thank God.  Still, his serve is not easy to return.  It will probably never be.
