THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I know one of you played yesterday.  Conditions were very different from yesterday.  Can you comment on how that changed the play today.  
PAULA KANIA: You know, the weather is not dependable, so we have to adjust as quick as we can.  It took us awhile with Klaudia, through the whole first set, but then we step up the level and I think it was way better.   
It was really like four mistakes in the end.  But we cannot say anything, like it was bad conditions or something.  It was for both teams, yeah.   
 Q.  Captain, were you pleased with the weekend?  What did you learn for the team taking forward from here?  
CAPTAIN JANS-IGNACIK: Yeah, of course, that was a big lesson for me.  I'm not talking only about the weekend, but the whole week.  We did amazing job.   
First of all, we have new people in the team.  The most important thing is that it works out, so we will be smarter for the next Fed Cup in April.   
I'm real proud of my team and my girls and the guys who are helping us.  We did our best.  This is the most important thing now.   
 Q.  You play all around the world, in many different tournaments.  This is your first time playing in Hawaii.  Will you come back?  
PAULA KANIA: For holiday?  We would love to come back.  Doesn't matter if it's for tournament or holiday, that would be a point on the map to come back.
