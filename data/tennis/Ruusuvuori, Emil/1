7-5, 6-4
EMIL RUUSUVUORI:   
Q. A tough match out there today.  Can you give us thoughts on your match and the main takeaways?
EMIL RUUSUVUORI:   Yeah, it was an okay match.  He was just better in the key moments.  End of the set he was able to just push some extra balls on the court and he was able to take the break and then served well when he had to in the deciding games, and that was the difference today.  Yeah, credits to him.  He played well in the key moments.
