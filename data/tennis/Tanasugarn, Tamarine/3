THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  That match was actually a lot closer than 6-2, 6-2, wasn't it?

TAMARINE TANASUGARN:  Yeah, actually, it was  -- every game was deuce, was really close game every game.  Today is really, you know, I have to give Amelie very, you know, respect, you know, that she's  -- last couple matches we playing and she's playing today unbelievable well.  She serve very well today.  She don't make any unforced error today.  Seems like today she was really like, you know, in the beginning of the second set, you know, my rhythm, you know, my time is getting back.  You know, and she always never give me a chance to come back to the game.  Yeah, she playing very well today. 

Q.  One of the big differences in the match seemed to be that she won her breakpoints and you didn't. 

TAMARINE TANASUGARN:  That's true.  And also, you know, today my serve doesn't, you know, doesn't help me at all today, doesn't work.  But, you know, yeah, I'm happy of my results in this tournament, yeah.

Q.  Does she play particularly well on those breakpoints?

You know, for me, I was trying to change it up all the time, you know, like  -- playing like change, loopy, try attack, even like dropshots.  It seems like everything that I do, she, you know, she ready for that and she won the points.  So, you know, I really have to give Amelie credit today.  She playing very well.
