3-4, 4-2, 4-2, 4-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Being in the stands last year and watching the NextGen Finals, now that you were out on the court, could you imagine what the atmosphere would have been like, all the public cheering for you and the way that they were?
JANNIK SINNER: No, the atmosphere was unbelievable, you know. Playing here in Milan and many Italians are coming, it's a little bit of pressure in the beginning, of course, but then, you know, you try to play your game.
I have done it very well today. You know, of course I, last year, I watched these kind of matches, and now I'm able to play them. I'm very happy that I won today the first match.
