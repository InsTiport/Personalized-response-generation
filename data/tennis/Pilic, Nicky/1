THE MODERATOR:  Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the press conference.  The first 15 minutes, we would like to ask questions in Slovak or English, then we leave the floor up to our Croatian colleagues to have their questions. 


Q.  To the coach or Ivan Ljubicic, were you surprised by the nomination of Beck? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  Not really.  We didn't know really if Kucera is playing or Beck.  After long discussion, we stop because for us more or less is the same. 

Q.  Mr. Ljubicic, the first match, since you play first, is in a way emotional to you?  If so, was there any difference in your preparation against Kucera or Beck? 

IVAN LJUBICIC:  Well, I think lately I play the level of tennis that it doesn't matter who is on the other side.  So I really was not thinking who is my opponent.  Yes, I prefer to know exactly at what time I play because I can prepare much better. 

Q.  Niki Pilic, do you think the biggest problem you can have is emotional, is the human reaction from your team?  Do you think that could be the most important opponent? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  Well, first of all, I think there will be one very hard match.  I don't think so anybody is favorites.  The favorites is ones who are play better.  My opinion is in the finals, there is always emotion there.  Doesn't matter if you play at home or outside, emotions are very deep.  Obviously, we would like to win and Slovak would like to win also.  So emotional match is definitely there.  But, as I say, we have to play very good tennis to have a victory. 

Q.  Niki Pilic, for a player like Ancic, who is young, do you think is better for him to play second match when he has to wait quite a while but at the same time maybe Ljubicic just won the first point?  Were you hoping for this draw, is the question? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  I think for us it's better that Ljubicic play first, for our side, our point of view.  Because if we thinks that Croatia could lead 1-0, I think there is a more pressure to Hrbaty.  You know, in tennis you are around enough that, with inspiration, players can do lots of things.  If Mario play good, we have a chance there.  Obviously, this is only speculation.  But I think for my opinion, it's better that Ivan is playing first. 

Q.  Mr. Ljubicic, what kind of athlete is Mr. Beck in your opinion in terms of the surface?  How do you rate his abilities? 

IVAN LJUBICIC:  Well, he's definitely a good player.  I think he was just unfortunate to be injured last period of the year, not to have better ranking that he has right now.  I played him three times, I think, and they were always very difficult matches.  He is, in my opinion, very talented player, and I think he can still improve a lot.  But obviously playing in Bratislava, in front of his home crowd, he's going to give everything he has, and I don't expect easy match at all. 

Q.  Niki Pilic, how different do you feel to sit here as captain of Croatian team comparing to captain of the German team in the Davis Cup final? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  Well, I was fortunate that in Germany I have very good atmosphere in that time when Becker was a megastar and three other guys was accepting.  Winning three times with Germany was nice.  But I'm born as a Croatian, and I have in this team two players that are born in same city as I was born.  And, obviously, emotionally that's much deeper.  Obviously, I mean, to win this title, if it's possible, for me will be Mt. Everest. 

Q.  Coach and both players, would you say the conditions of your players is good enough to play all the matches? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  Well, as far as I know, we did that for many times.  I don't think so there will be any difference if everything's going normally.  We played many times the same players in doubles and singles.  I think both of my players are mentally and physically pretty strong, and I thought so that it will be enough. 

Q.  Goran, do you feel this opportunity is an opportunity you have to take because maybe Croatia are not going to reach the final again in the near future, or do you feel that the power in tennis now has changed, and this opportunity could come around quite often? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  I think this team can dominate in Davis Cup for next five, six years if they stay together.  I said last year they have a chance to win the Davis Cup.  I don't think anybody believed me, but now we're in the final.  I don't see why this team cannot win this year and next year and year after.  This is a team that has a future. 

Q.  Mr. Ancic, could you describe your feelings, how you feel playing as the second? 

MARIO ANCIC:  I've been through these situations many times, playing first or second.  I think here, even young, I've been through some tough situations.  You know, already couple years played Davis Cup.  The most important thing is to play good and the result in the end. 

Q.  Goran, I'm sure you're proud to be on this team, but as a human being would you like also to play?  Do you dream to have a chance to play?  Would you like to play even if the score was 3-1, let's say the fifth dead rubber, or you would prefer not? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  First of all, it is a big pleasure for me.  I would like to thank the guys, they invite me and I'm here.  I was always part of the team, but now I am a member of the team as a fourth.  The tennis I play at the moment I think is good enough.  And we came here to win.  Doesn't matter if I play or not.  But I think if it's 3-1 for anybody, I don't think this match is going to be because if we win 3-1, there's no point of playing because everybody's going to be drunk.  I don't think there's going to be any spectators in the hall to watch the match, so I can play by myself.  It's okay (smiling).  If we lose 3-1, I think everybody's going to be disappointed, and they're going to celebrate.  Again, nobody's going to watch.  I don't think is going to happen.  Maybe if it's 3-0, then is different.  But we came here to win.  Every match is important.  Every day is important.  I'm glad that I'm here. 

Q.  Goran, somebody said that this team can dominate the world of tennis for the next five, six years.  Would you like to be a part of the team for the following five or six years?  Would you even reconsider the possibility of returning to pro tennis? 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  Returning to pro tennis, no chance.  I'm very happy that this Davis Cup is finishing soon because I don't have to practice any more.  That's why I stopped playing tennis, because I couldn't practice any more.  I don't have fun too much to practice.  To be member of this team as a player, you have to practice a lot, and I don't want that.  But I hope I can take over this team very soon as a Davis Cup captain.  So we see.  This is my dream.  We see first what going to happen here and concentrate of this match, then we'll see what's going to happen in the future. 

Q.  Mr. Pilic, do you consider Goran's selection as a reward for what he has done in the past for tennis in Croatia? 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  No, I don't think so.  At the moment Goran is playing such a high level of tennis that he is definitely No. 4 in the team as a quality.  It doesn't matter if he's playing singles tour or not.  Nobody in Croatia can play such a standard that he was playing here the last five, six days, so there is no that kind of emotion.  Goran start this team long time ago, five, six years ago when we were in third league.  But this is not because he's here.  I think he in the last couple of months have a lot of responsibility for that place as the No. 4 in this team.  He was practicing very hard.  As he said, he is very glad when that finish because he's not able to practice twice a day.  His level of tennis, he surprised me also the way that he was playing the last four or five days.  This is one of the reason, the main reasons, that he is in the team. 

Q.  A general question.  Is there anything that disturbed your attention or distracted your preparations during your stay in Slovakia? 

MARIO ANCIC:  No. 

IVAN LJUBICIC:  No. 

GORAN IVANISEVIC:  No. 

CAPTAIN PILIC:  No.
