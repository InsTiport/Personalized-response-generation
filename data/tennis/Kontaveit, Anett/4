 6-4, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It was a tough game this evening.  Can you talk us through the match.
 ANETT KONTAVEIT:   Yeah, you know, I think I started well, but, you know, I think Shelby had a slow start, but then she came back and she was playing really good tennis and playing really aggressive.
 You know, I think, you know, she played a very good match.  Yeah, I felt like I didn't have as much in the tank as I did before.
 Q. I think you were just one of two players left in the women's draw today who were in the whole hard quarantine group.  I think only one player from the hard quarantine group, Brady, made the fourth round.
 ANETT KONTAVEIT:   Yeah.
 Q. Doesn't sound like a coincidence.  How tough of a challenge was it to play this tournament after that?  How much of an impact do you think it had on the tournament as a whole, not just for you, but for the whole field?
 ANETT KONTAVEIT:   I mean, there is no escaping the fact that we were in the room for two weeks before a slam (smiling).  I mean, that's not how you prepare for a slam.  But, I mean, I'm surprised how well I actually did and how I came, but I did feel like with every match -- and I played quite a few also in the lead-up tournament -- so I felt like with every match I was getting more and more worn out.
 Q. Is there anything you think you could have done differently or this was just what it was going to be?
 ANETT KONTAVEIT:   Well, I did as much as I could.  I mean, I got treatment every day.  I really did as much as I could.  And, you know, Shelby, I don't want to really take it away from her, I think she played a great match and she really deserved to win today.  Yeah, but it's a difficult situation (smiling).
