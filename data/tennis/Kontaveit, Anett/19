G. MUGURUZA/A. Kontaveit
6-7, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. You played very tough and very deep, but do you think you lost because on your faults or because GarbiÃ±e has grown up her level?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: It's tough to say.  I mean, I did my best.  I mean, there were some moments, some close moments in the second set, where, yeah, I felt like I could have done a better job.  Yeah, I thought she played well.
Q. Have you some regrets or are you satisfied of your level?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: I thought it was a good match, but, yeah, there are some moments in the second set where it did hurt a little bit, especially in -- I think it was 3-2 or around then.  Yeah, I had some game points, and I didn't convert them.  Made some errors.  That hurts a little bit.
Q. She said you could become top-10 player in the next year if you play like today.  Do you hope this?  Do you agree with her?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Well, I hope so, yeah (smiling).
