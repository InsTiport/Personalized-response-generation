THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. That was a tough matchup for you today, but you must be really pleased overall with your first week of Roland Garros.  Your overall assessment of your performance here this year?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Yeah, definitely today wasn't a good day for me.  And she's a very strong competitor.  So, I mean, all the credit to her, but I definitely wasn't playing my best today.
But, yeah, I think I'm very happy with my clay season overall.  And, yeah, I think I played great matches here before that today.
Q. And after a result like that, you must go through some difficult emotions.  Do you get a chance to reflect on how well you have done in the first week or is your focus at this moment in time just about today's match?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Well, the match is so recent.  So, yeah, definitely, right now, it's more on this match today.
But I think tomorrow or the day after, when I'm home, I can think back and remember the good matches and the good results that I did.
Q. And you must be pleased that you've had some good support out here, lots of people cheering you on and wishing you well in your career.  Does that help keep you motivated and inspired?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Yeah, of course.  I mean, to have people support you and, yeah, cheer you on, it's something that motivates us, and it's so great to have.
Q. The next big challenge in terms of the Grand Slams will now be Wimbledon.  Can you just tell us a bit about your preparations for Wimbledon and your hopes and expectations at Wimbledon this year?
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Yeah, I'm playing two smaller grass court tournaments in Holland and Spain, and then, yeah, I'm playing Wimbledon.
So that's what I did last year.  I really like playing on grass, and I'm really looking forward to Wimbledon.
