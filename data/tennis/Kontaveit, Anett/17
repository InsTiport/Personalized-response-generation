A. SABALENKA/A. Kontaveit   
6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Could you talk through the match today.  What were some of the problems that she presented in how she played that were difficult to solve?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: She played really, really strong.  Yeah, from the beginning she put me under a lot of pressure.  I think obviously my first-serve percentage was really low.  That gave me I think a lot of trouble.   
Yeah, her game was really aggressive.  I felt the pressure straightaway.  That's what she did better than I did.   
 Q.  This was the first time you two played.  What was your sense in terms of after the first few games against her that she does particularly well, the blend of her game?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Well, I sort of knew what was coming.  But then the other thing is playing against that.  Yeah, she's a really good player, as her results have showed this year.   
Yeah, she was just too strong today.   
 Q.  Now that you can reflect on a week that was pretty successful for you, can you discuss what it means to make a final like this, what you're most proud of this week?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: It's definitely a really positive week.  I'm very proud how I managed to get through these close matches, how strong I stayed in those tough matches, yeah, that I came through some of them.   
I thought I played good tennis this week.   
 Q.  How do you think you have to build on the skill you have already, or do you have to temper it a little bit and reduce the risks?  Are you comfortable with how you're playing?  Would you like to tweak something before the season is out?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: I don't know if I would tweak something.  I've always had this aggressive style of play.  I think that's what gives me an edge.  Yeah, I think I'll have to work on my consistency, sometimes the shot selection and things like that.   
But I think it's just a constant improvement.   
 Q.  How is the leg?  It was a pain you felt after the semifinals.  Are you concerned at all going forward with Beijing?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: It's not too serious.  I just felt it landing on the serve on my left leg.  But, yeah, I've played quite a few matches this week.  I think a day off, actually maybe a few days off from matches, and it will feel fine.   
 Q.  I'm a little journalist from Wuhan Open.  Many people say you have the potential to become the top 10.  How do you respond to that?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Thank you.  I'm glad to hear that, that people think this way.  I'm definitely working really hard to achieve that.  That's one of my goals.   
 Q.  You played wonderful this week.  Actually you have a huge opportunity to enter either Zhuhai or Singapore.  In the coming games, are you going to work towards that goal?  
ANETT KONTAVEIT: Yeah, Zhuhai is definitely a goal.  I think I do have a chance.  If I play good tennis again next few weeks, then, yeah, I definitely have a chance.  That's definitely a goal.
