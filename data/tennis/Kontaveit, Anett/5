  A. KONTAVEIT/H. Watson
 6-7, 6-4, 6-2
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match and how you were feeling on the court today?
 ANETT KONTAVEIT:   It was a very, very tough match, very close one.  I didn't feel like I played my best tennis maybe in the first or the second set, but I fought through it and I hung in there as much as I could and fought as hard as I could, so I'm really, really happy that I managed to turn it around.
