DITTY-HUBER/Dulko-Jozami
  6-2, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You were both late-minute doubles replacement. How did you handle taking the court that quickly again, especially you, Betina? 
 BETINA JOZAMI: I don't know. We started the match trying to do our best. I couldn't help her. She started better than me. I don't know. We lost. 

 Q. Gisela, how do you feel right now after coming so close and having it right there for the country? 
 GISELA DULKO: Well, of course it feels disappointing when you lose. But the only thing I can say is that we did our best. It didn't work. 
 But we have to keep working as a team. I think one day we can do it much better. 

 Q. How about your game, though? It seemed like you were in many ways the best tennis player out there for both days. 
 GISELA DULKO: Well, thank you. I think I'm playing very good. I play good singles. I'm happy the way I play both matches. 
 In doubles, you know, it was difficult. It was a difficult team. I did my best. I could play better, for sure. But, you know, we did the best. We are not happy now. It's always tough to lose a match. 
 But, like I said before, we have to work a little bit more as a team, maybe practice more doubles, play more together, and one day we're gonna do it better, for sure.
