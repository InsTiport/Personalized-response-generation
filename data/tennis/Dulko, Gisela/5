 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Is that the biggest win of your career?  
 GISELA DULKO: Yeah, maybe it is, I think, against the higher player. Yeah, it was a very, very good match for me.   
 I feel great after this fight. I think that was the most important for me because I was always down, first set, second set, and then in the tiebreak. I just hung in there, and the things were good for me at the end. I was really, really happy.  
  
  Q. Was the double fault the point where you thought, This is it, I can do it in the tiebreak?  
 GISELA DULKO: No, I think I believe all the match. I think I believe that I could win.  
 But one thing is to believe, and the other one is to be there. I knew she's a great player, No. 3 in the world. She's not going to give you so many chances all the time, so I had to play good the big points and hopefully I could take my chance well.   
  
  Q. How well did the dropshot work for you? You kind of threw her game off quite a bit tonight with that?  
 GISELA DULKO: Well, yeah, it was not only dropshot. I tried to mix it up, especially with her. She has I think one of the best backhand on the tour, and if you give her the ball always the same, it's impossible. At least for me.   
 So I tried to mix it up, you know, with dropshot, high balls with my slice, and I think it work very well for me tonight.
