ATP: Questions.

Q. I'm doing a story about returning serve. Can you discuss the strategy when you block
the serve as to when you attack the return?

ALEX CORRETJA: I attack the return whenever I see the ball is reachable and I feel
comfortable to do it. Depends on which point you're playing. Also when you see the ball is
going too wide, sometimes I'm trying to just push the ball and put it on the other side of
the court. 

Q. Do you become more aggressive on a second serve?

ALEX CORRETJA: Yeah, but I stay behind the baseline because I wanted to play with
topspin and to play deep. Many of the times, unless I'm playing a serve-volley guy, I'm
waiting for the ball, I'm not attacking the ball. I'm playing aggressively, but not
playing flat or something, always with topspin.

Q. Do you guess or anticipate which side the service is coming to?

ALEX CORRETJA: You know normally where the guy serves. Well, you don't know normally
where the guy serves, but you have an opinion how he's been serving through the whole
match, the important points, like this. So you know a little bit how he's going to serve.
If it's an advantage or breakpoint, you have an idea. Sometimes you anticipate it, but
sometimes it's difficult to do that.

Q. What happens when you get caught in between grips, do you change grips as he's
tossing the ball?

ALEX CORRETJA: I change grips whenever I can. It's difficult. It's difficult to return
a serve which is coming 220 kilometers per hour. You have to be aggressive if you can, but
normally it's not easy.

Q. When he's tossing the ball, what kind of grip are you using?

ALEX CORRETJA: Forehand because it's easier to play.
