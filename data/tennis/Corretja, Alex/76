ALEX CORRETJA:  It's great for me to be in the semifinals of a hardcourt event, especially here in the Lipton, which is a great tournament.  I hope to continue doing well.  Let's see if I can win also tomorrow.


Q. Talk about playing Agassi tomorrow night.

ALEX CORRETJA:  It's going to be tough match for both, I guess.  We're going to run a lot on the court. Going to try to move him, and try to see if he cannot attack my second serve so much.  I'm going to try to play deep to see if I can win some points easy.
