Q.  Alex, can you say that the injury didn't in any way affect your ability to play your game today or did it?

ALEX CORRETJA: Not today.  Maybe the other days where I didn't practice as well as I want.  But since last Wednesday already I've been practicing pretty well.  So I had enough time to get ready and unfortunately this happen.  But right now everything, it's okay.


Q.  No problem tossing the ball?

ALEX CORRETJA: No, no, no.  Not anymore.  Not even burning, so it's okay. 


Q.  Is Gianluca one of those players you hate to play because you know he's just going to drive you crazy?

ALEX CORRETJA: Well, I always beat him, so I beat him like four times and we play four times.  So I know every time we play it's kind of a strange match, and different situation than you are used to.  But of course I didn't play my best today but it was good to come through and see that  -- spend some time on the court and getting ready again.  You know, I feel like I'm getting into the year already again.  So I was little bit off, you know.  I had some time off and right now I didn't feel at my best since last week, you know, and I needed to play some more matches.  I don't feel like I'm 100 percent in tennis way.


Q.  The way he plays, can he make you look bad even though you're playing well?

ALEX CORRETJA: Sometimes, yes.  Of course.  Because it looks like he is doing nothing with the ball, you know, no pace, no passion.  I mean, nothing.  But of course you have to beat him, you have to give him credit.  The way he plays, it's difficult these days.  And still the guy is 40 in the world or something, with 35 years old.  So it seems like he's a great contender.


Q.  How good will you be when you're 35 years old?

ALEX CORRETJA: I hope I'm gonna be good father, but nearly sure I'm not going to be a tennis player.
