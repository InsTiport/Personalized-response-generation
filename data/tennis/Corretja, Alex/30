 MODERATOR: Questions for Alex, please.  
 
Q. What do you have to say about the game of today? You started very well, and then
somehow you --?
 
 ALEX CORRETJA: -- lost? (Laughter) 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 ALEX CORRETJA: Well, it's a pity when you are serving for the match against Safin, No.
1 in the world. You are playing pretty well. You like to win. You like to close the match.
You feel a little sad, of course, because what you want is to win. Especially when you are
leading in the score the whole second set, you cannot finish the match, you feel like a
little frustrated, no?
