 MODERATOR: Questions for Alex.  
 
Q. It was a match of a lot of chances in the first and the second set. What is your
feeling about it? 
 
 ALEX CORRETJA: My feeling is that, as you said, many chances. I believe I played pretty
well on those chances. I cannot say that I was playing bad tennis. I have to say that he
just served unbelievable. He played great on that moments. It seems strange to see how he
recovered from yesterday, the way he played, and today he played magnificent tennis. It
surprised me a little bit the change he can make in one day, no? He shows why he's a good
player, or special player, I would say. 
 
Q. On your part, where do you feel your game is? 
 
 ALEX CORRETJA: I have to be honest. I believe I was a hundred percent concentrate. It
didn't affect my serve, the fact that yesterday I lost to Safin the way I lost. I think it
is not easy to lose a match yesterday and today come back on court and be focused again
and be a hundred percent ready to win. And I think I was ready to win. I did what I had to
do to win. But, unfortunately, I had two set points in the first set. He just served
great. Then I had many breakpoints in the second set, a little bit more of everything, of
the same thing. I have to say that when you play your hundred percent, you play your best
tennis, and you cannot win, it's because maybe the other was better than you.  
 
Q. Could I get your thoughts on playing Lleyton Hewitt tomorrow? 
 
 ALEX CORRETJA: I think it could be a nice test for myself for next week, for myself,
all my fellow friends on the team, Ferrero and Costa. They might play him as well. It's
good to see tactics, the way we're going to play. It can help for next week, even if it's
on a different surface in a different tournament. But, of course, it is good to see how we
develop our game, each other.
