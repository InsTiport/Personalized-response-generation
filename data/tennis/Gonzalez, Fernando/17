   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What does the prognosis look like for Hamburg? 
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: I'm not playing. I'm going to -- I have a pain since -- I have problems in my left leg after the Munich final. First match I pulled the right one. 
 I'm in a lot of pain, so I don't want to be -- take any risk. Because, I mean, it's painful, and if you're not 100% then you're not able to win. So I have to take care. 

 Q. Yesterday Nadal said that he doesn't understand Etienne, the fact that you have to play three Masters Series in four weeks. What do you think about this?
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: I think that it's not only now. I mean, I think we play many tournaments during the year, in the year -- -I mean year by year, and sometimes it's too much for your body. 
 But you can choose. You can skip a few tournaments. But, I mean, it will be much better if you have more time off, so that means a little bit less tournaments.
