Q.  Carlos Moya said the match against you was emotionally the best match he ever played.  How do you see that? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It was really a great match.  He took his opportunities on the difficult points. 

Q.  You had a match point, and you had a breakpoint to get to 3-1.  You would have had a great advantage. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I even think I had two match points.  What can I say?  I played a great match.  The points were the points that were, so I cannot change it. 

Q.  In Key Biscayne, you always had the initiative and you were less tense than today.  It looked similar to the match in Key Biscayne, up a set.  But your serve wasn't as good as it was there. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, the match is over, and I think he deserved his win.  I think I played well, but I didn't take the opportunities, the important opportunities. 

Q.  Moya said it was the most exciting match and emotional match of his career. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  He has all the merits because he really played very well. 

Q.  Where do you play next?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I am going to play in Basel before Paris.  I've really enjoyed this in Madrid.  This is the first time I've been here.

Q.  What do you like best in the tournament?  The surface?  The public?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  The crowds here are very nice.  It's very sad that I lost, but I felt I played well.

Q.  In the 11th game, you started playing very badly.  You hit a ball out long.  Immediately after, you played one of the best games I've ever seen you play.  Why did you change so much?  Why was it so up and down?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, I tried to do my best tennis, and Carlos, too.  I played well in the first set, but he's got a lot of experience, and he knew how to change the tide of the match. 

Q.  The support of the crowd was important.  You saw they were backing him a lot. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, the court was packed. 

Q.  I think the public was the crucial point to help Moya. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yes, that's true. 

Q.  We saw that you really gave everything of yourself.  Do you think you gave everything out of yourself or is there something you are unhappy with? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, I think I played well.  But, unfortunately, I missed my chances in this match.  I'll keep on playing and try to improve. 

Q.  Then you played doubles.  How do you find the energy? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  When Novak serves, I don't have to do anything. 

Q.  How was your volley?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Good.  For me, doubles is quite entertaining.  I think I'm going to play more doubles because it's good for my tennis. 

Q.  Always with him?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, we just decided to play here.

Q.  Going back to the match, in the third set, you were a bit out of control.  You weren't very focused.  After that you were broken.  You then broke him back, played two games in a row at a very high level.  Was it because you lost your concentration?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, tennis is like this.  Your mind plays a part in it.  It's not easy to be concentrated all the time.  He also at a certain point made a couple of double-faults and gave me the game.  But that happens in tennis.

Q.  Did you feel tired?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Tired and also a bit nervous.  If not, it would be boring if it wasn't like that. 

Q.  You discussed some points with the line judges. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, when you win, everything is fine.  When you lose, you find you can criticize things.  It's part of the game.

Q.  Did you lose your focus with that? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Well, I made my case, but I knew I couldn't change that.

Q.  You held your right side.  Did you have any pain or something? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, it was bothered a bit. 

Q.  How is your knee? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It's okay - better than the other day. 

Q.  Moya talked about your physical power.  He felt that you weren't in such good physical shape during the match.  Do you think that was crucial?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't know.  You always try to run, make the other run.  But, of course, tiredness reaches you at some point.

Q.  In a match so close as the one that you played today, what was the difference?  Why did he take the match and not you?  Was it the tennis?  Was it physical conditioning?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Maybe because he's got more experience.  It's hard to handle the match in certain moments.  I'm sad really.  I'm not angry.  I'm not angry, I'm a bit sad, but at the same time I'm happy that I've been playing well.

Q.  Do you watch your matches after on video?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I discuss it with my coach.  I think I didn't have that many errors.
