R. NADAL/F. GonzÃ¡lez
  6-3, 6-2, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Three straight sets. Do you feel you got into your game tonight?
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Part. But, uhm, I was really frustrated when I couldn't win a serve from one side of the court in the first two sets. I mean, it was really big advantage for him. I think he was playing good. 
 I mean, I just tried to go for my shot. I miss a couple in the beginning. Rafa, when he's up in the score, he's a different player. 

 Q. On Saturday you had a really long match. Do you think fatigue played a part in what happened today?
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Of course, I was tired. But I don't think it's the reason. I was able to run. I was able to compete today. I mean, maybe I didn't play my best tennis, but I can run. 
 In the beginning, I feel a little bit fatigue. You know, the body was little bit heavy. But during the match, I was ready to fight and still running. 

 Q. Do you take anything out of what happened today in terms of improvement to your game?
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: I think I didn't go to the net like I have to go against Rafael because he always bring you one or two more balls. And when I went to the net, I lose a lot of confidence 'cause I didn't finish the points like normally I like, you know. With my shots from the baseline, you can go to the net. And I miss a couple, and I lose a lot of confidence at the net.
