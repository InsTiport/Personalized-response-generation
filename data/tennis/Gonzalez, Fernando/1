THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you describe what you felt out there at the last point?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Many things.   I was really tired in the end, and I said I don't want to finish with a double fault, but it was.   I was tired. 
But, I mean, after that, he just dictate.   The atmosphere was great.   I save a couple of match points before, and I felt that it's gonna be the end, you know, and then I have the chance to keep playing.   I have my chances.
But Nicolas played better in the important moments, and I was a little bit tired at the end.

Q.   What went into the decision to decide to retire here?   Just the hip?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   To retire or retire in Miami? 

Q.   Both. 
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Both?   To retire?   Because, well, in the past year and a half been pretty tough for my career. 
But anyway, I don't have the energy to get up in the morning, train like I have to train, travel like I have to travel.   And I been doing this for many years.   If I'm not gonna be 100%, I think I have to do something else.

Q.   Do you know what that is?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   I like tennis.   I will be around.   But, I mean, I have great memories from tennis.   I wasn't enjoying as I enjoy in the past.
That's why I decide to finish my career.

Q.   Are there any particular moments from tonight that you will remember?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Yeah, at the end, the video was great.   I mean, the top players‑‑ it's not only about tennis.   It's also about friends.   I mean, we been playing against each other many times, but at the end of the day we are friends.   We have a great relationship.
Of course, the atmosphere was great.   We're really far away from Chile, and there was little flags.   There was my family here.   I had a lot of friends, and I really enjoyed the moment.

Q.   How do you remember the experience at the Olympics when you look back on your career?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Oh, that's huge.   When I went to Athens‑‑ I play only two.   In '04 when I went to Athens, I said maybe that's the only one.   It's the chance I'm gonna have. 
Then I have the second chance and also have a great week.   And also I think maybe this gonna be the end, no? 
After, you know, when I was like 27, 28, I always was enjoying every single time thinking about can be the last time.   So I enjoy a lot.

Q.   The Olympics or Australian Open?   Do you have a favorite moment in your career? 
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   It's very different because it's been different part of my career.   I mean, about tennis, by far was the Australian Open, like I feel. 
But emotionally I think that the Olympics, both, because it's something else than tennis.

Q.   How do you want to be remembered?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Um, like a person who give 100% every single time when he went to the court.   That's why I'm retire.   And of course I think is much better to remember as a person than as a tennis player. 
Of course, I would love to have the memories of my game and everything.   But for me, it's very special that I have a good relation with the other players.

Q.   When you said you'd be involved in tennis, do you know what you'll be doing or are you gonna take some time or just rest?
FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ:   Yeah, I have to take some time.   I have been‑‑ my life has been really in high revolutions in the past 15 years maybe.   Now is the time to relax and take my time and be where I want to be.
