THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Fernando in English, please.  
 
 
Q.  What happened there at the end of the second set? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I was playing a great match, but I didn't play as good the rest of the match, that two points.  I mean, I did double-faults because I was little bit nervous.  I was against the wind, so it was very hard to play against the wind and against a good runner and a good fighter how is Guillermo.  So, I don't know, I'm really disappointed.  I don't know exactly what happened, but I'm really disappointed about that.  
 
Q.  After the second set got away from you, was it difficult to regroup and get up for the third set? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  After four matchpoints, I mean, it's tough to come back, especially when you are playing against Guillermo, who is a good fighter.   It was little bit windy, so it's tough to play.  He was running everywhere.  He fight a lot.  
 
Q.  Have you ever experienced anything like that before? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Never.  I mean, is my second semifinals in a Masters Series.  But, I don't know, is first time that this happen to me in important tournament like this one.  But anyway I'm very disappointed about this.  
 
Q.  You're not normally a nervous sort of guy. 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Everybody's nervous, I mean, but you have to play good when you are nervous.  I mean, I tried to.  I tried to go forward, but today was different.  
 
Q.  Were you aware of what happened with Carlos Moya yesterday? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I heard something about that.   But it always happens sometimes, I mean, to all of them, to all of us.  I hope to get a good experience about this.  
 
Q.  How did you feel you played after that point at the end of the second set? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  In the tiebreak? 
 
Q.  Up to the point where you were serving for the match. 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I was feeling really good on the court.  I mean, I know how Guillermo plays to me, and I did a lot of slice, I tried to put a lot of balls in the court.  But after, that was different.
