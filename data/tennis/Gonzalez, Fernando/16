 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Fernando.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the humidity. Which problems did you have with the climate here in China?   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: No, I think was really tough conditions. I mean, we used to play every week different. But this time it's really hot, really humid. And the balls are really slow. It's humid. It's too much.   
  
  Q. Would you like to talk about your opponent today.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Yeah, I didn't know nothing before the match about him. But he's a young player, I saw on the Internet last night. I was a little bit afraid because he's a young player coming up, nothing to lose, in his country.   
 He have really, really good tennis. He have a lot of talent. I think that he can be really good player in the future.   
  
  Q. I would like to know if the medal you have for the previous Olympics, not in singles, but in doubles, is a challenge for you for this opportunity? How do you prepare with Nicolas for the doubles, as well?   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Of course, it's one of my best experience in my career. I know what it feels to be in the podium. So I have a really nice dream coming back here, I mean, to the next Olympics.   
 I want to get one for my country.   
  
  Q. Do you feel any pressure from the crowd?   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Well, I feel a lot of support because the people, I have really good memories from last year. I came here to play Beijing and Shanghai. And the people treat me really good. I don't really feel any pressure here because I feel a lot of support about the Chinese people.
