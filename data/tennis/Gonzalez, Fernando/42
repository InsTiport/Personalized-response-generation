 Q.  Are you still in the doubles with Massu? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.  I mean, we're supposed to play today, but we're gonna play tomorrow. 
 Q.  There was some misinformation? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, we play tomorrow. 
 Q.  And for sure, do you plan to go to Fisher Island to practice after the tournament? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I mean, after the tournament, we need to practice on grass.  I mean, I haven't talked with the captain yet, but that's one of the chances that we have, is to go to Fisher Island, and the other one is to go straight to California. 
 Q.  What would be preferable for you? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  We have to see.  I mean, practice on grass, the grass is, I mean, almost the same everywhere. 
 But I need to talk to him first, and then we gonna see. 
 Q.  You have no idea whether or not you have any difficulty getting a reservation to use Fisher Island? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I mean, I haven't talked to him.
