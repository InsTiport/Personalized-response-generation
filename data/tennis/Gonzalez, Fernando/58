Q.  What do you think of the match?  It seemed very quick and quite easy for you. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, Andre was a dangerous player.  He knows this kind of surface better than me, but I had a very good serve.  I felt great during the match.  I returned better than I had been.

Q.  What do you think about the hard court? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I like it quite a lot.  Here it's quicker than normal speed.  It's much more quick.  I served very well.  When you serve well, the rest of the game comes easier. 

Q.  Your next opponent is Moya.  What do you think about this?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It's going to be a hard match.  I played him a long time ago and I beat him.  Now many things have changed.  He's a better player.

Q.  Did you have any problems with your leg?  You had a tendonitis? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, it's still there, but we have to control it.  I'm well taken care of. 

Q.  What's the most difficult thing in Moya's game for you? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  He's one of the best players of the world now.  He serves very well.  He's got a very good forehand, and he attacks very well.  He doesn't let you play very much. 

Q.  Do you prefer players that attack or not? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I always try to play how I play.  I try to make him feel uncomfortable, and always play as much as I can my own game.

Q.  Do you have any strategy tomorrow for Moya? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, but I'm not going to say it (laughter). 

Q.  Do you see yourself in the Top 10 very soon?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I want to take it easy.  I'm playing very good tennis.  The road is long.  I have to work hard.  But obviously I think I have good conditioning, and I'm working hard on it. 

Q.  What are your goals in the future? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  To keep on playing, gaining more experience, more matches, better players all the time.  Time will say. 

Q.  Are you going to play doubles tomorrow with Roddick? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yes.  Usually I play singles and doubles both.

Q.  How did you become partners with Roddick?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I asked him once if he wanted to be my partner, and he agreed.  We're not playing together the whole year.  It's nothing permanent, but so far we're playing together.

Q.  Isn't it too much to play singles and doubles at the same time?  Won't your tendonitis be jeopardized by playing so much?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It's under control.

Q.  What is your schedule after this?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  After this I'm going to Basel and then to Paris.

Q.  Did you like the crowds, the atmosphere? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  The other day there were some banners, Chilean banners, and you like to see this. 

Q.  Does it bother you to see a Chilean crowd?  It's your first time in Spain.  How do you feel? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I went to play the Conde de Godo in Barcelona already.  I like to be in Spain.  When you're in Europe, it's nice to be in Spain.  They treat me very nicely. 

Q.  After Paris, are you taking a vacation?  Are you going to Chile?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't know yet. 

Q.  How long are you going to be on vacation? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Two or three weeks.  I have a exhibition match with Rios, but after I will take vacation. 

Q.  You said your goal for this year, have you achieved it?

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yes.
