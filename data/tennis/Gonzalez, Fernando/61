Q.  Tell me what you think was the difference in the match.  You seemed to kind of be in control, then there was obviously a turning point. 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I mean, I think both, we didn't start playing good.  I mean, we make a lot of unforced errors.  But we get into the tiebreak, and it change everything.  I was trying to win every point, trying to attack always.  But they always bring you two or three more balls then, the other players, and that makes you get tired sometimes.  
 
Q.  Was that the main difference from last night to tonight, just his speed and his ability to get to those? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Today I serve much better than yesterday.  But my shots, I felt much better last night, and I was running better.  But I know Lleyton has a lot of experience.  He's a great fighter.  He showed that he's No. 1.  
 
Q.  I think you had 2-1 in the second set, had five break points.  Did that feel like a big chance for you? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It was a big chance, but he put  -- I mean, he makes -- like all the break points, he did a good serve.  So there he show why he's No. 1.  I mean, in the tough moments he plays good.  
 
Q.  Did you allow yourself to think that you could win it somewhere there in the second set?  Did you feel, "I've got it under my control"? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, I have a few break points.  But after in the 5-all, I did a few mistakes.  But that's normal for me because my style is try to hit the winner.  Sometimes I hit everywhere.  
 
Q.  He won the first game of the third set.  Did you feel any sort of a letdown?  Was it hard to get up again for another set when he got that first game?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Against the good players, when they are winning, they start to play much better. But Lleyton, I mean, I attack him and he's  -- the ball is coming always, always, always.  He makes you run.  He's pretty tough to play.  
 
Q.  Any thoughts on what this week will do for your confidence?  I mean, you beat some great players.  Even if you lost this one, you showed you were right there with them.
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I mean, after the week, it's positive.  I mean, I won four good matches.  That's make me feel much better because it was a few match that I lose first and second rounds and I was a little bit down.  But I start to work hard.  
 
Q.  How are you going to spend the rest of the time before the US Open? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I'm going to Washington next week and then I have a week off before.  I don't know if I'm going back home or stay in Florida.  I don't know yet.  I will see.  
 
Q.  Where in Florida? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Miami.  
 
Q.  You have a place there? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.
