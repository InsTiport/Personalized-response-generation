 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Fernando, you played him couple times and it was very tough matches, but today was a different story. It was different, Fernando GonzÃ¡lez and different Andy Roddick tonight.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: It wasn't a good day for me. I mean, I didn't make anything with my serve, and I didn't feel at all.   
 I mean, I didn't feel good, and the match, I think he did a really good job because he took chances.  
  
  Q. Is avocado still part of your diet or you didn't eat enough for today's match?  
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Maybe.   
  
  Q. Did you say you were sick throughout the match?  
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: No. No, I didn't feel good. You know, like, I feel slow and -- I don't know, but, I mean...  
  
  Q. It wasn't much of a match?  
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Excuse me?   
  
  Q. It wasn't -- for 11th seed it wasn't much of a match. Was it just Andy playing so well or...   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: He was playing good. He took every chance, but I didn't play my best tennis today, but it's part of this. Every match is a different story.   
  
  Q. Usually, I can take a picture of you, I see the fumes around your head of adrenaline. Today was nothing.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: What?   
  
  Q. I see the fumes of adrenaline around your head.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Okay.  
  
  Q. Today I didn't see anything.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: I don't know. That kind of day that you don't, you know, feeling something else, but I can't do anything.
