   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  There was a very curious situation with the crowd disturbance.  What did you see from where you were standing?  What happened?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  I don't know.  I see it was very noisy from both sides, but the police came in.   
 I don't know exactly what happened with them.  I saw that they threw spray.  I know nothing else.   
  
  Q.  When you say it was noisy, was there anything you were taking offense to?  Anything insulting to you?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  No.  Well, they say a few things, but it's part of the crowd.  It was really fun for them.  I mean, it was a lot of Chileans and a lot of Greeks, too.   
 But for me it's fun to play like that.  It's like a Davis Cup match.  I think the people enjoy it.   
  
  Q.  Did you see the reaction once the police used the spray?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  No.  I saw only -- I mean, I saw when the police came in, but I don't know why.  I don't know.  I don't know what they were doing.  I mean, I don't know exactly.   
  
  Q.  Were the Greek fans saying anything offensive to you that you could hear?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  No.  Only one thing in Spanish, but it's nothing like -- I mean, it's nothing that bad.  I mean, they're fans.   
 It was very noisy, but also was the Chileans.  I mean, it was fun.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever seen anything like that in a tennis match?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  Well, in Davis Cup.  Well, maybe last year.  But today I saw many, many Chileans, and it was really exciting for me.   
  
  Q.  But never police having to come in and use pepper spray?   
 FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ:  No, that's the first time.
