THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish.  


Q.Do you think you played well?  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yes, I played well.  Well, unluckily enough, he didn't give me any chance.  He played great tennis.  A couple of balls, it went his way.  

Q.The crowd was there with Albert Costa.  Did you feel that, too, against you?  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  That's pretty normal to find this in Madrid for him.

Q.Are you sad to be out so soon?  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, actually I'm upset, but I need to be strong and carry on.  

Q.This Masters Series used to be in Stuttgart.  Do you find it better to play here or was it better to be in Stuttgart? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, I like being in Madrid actually.  I feel at home.  I like the people here better than in Stuttgart.  It's not that I don't like German people, but this is closer to me. 
 

Q.Last year you had an opportunity against Schalken at the US Open.  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  That was long ago.  I need to look towards the future.  I'm comfortable like this. 
 

Q.You're not very used to the surface here in Madrid.  What have you learned on this surface? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I like the surface.  In Madrid, the ball flies faster, that I don't like.  But the lessons I've gained, I just need to keep training.  Matches are decided by a couple of points.  

Q.And until the end of the year? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Just two tournaments.  But it hurts to play well and to lose in the first round.  It takes away your confidence. 
 

Q.Did you ever think you could have a match on your side, with the crowd for Costa? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No.  He had a very good serve.  It's difficult to play at that level with one or two balls defining the match.  

Q.Very complicated question.  Maybe you don't want to answer.  The subject about corruption in tennis.  Everyone is speaking about it.  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  If there's something wrong, I don't know.  I've only heard a rumor.  Obviously, the ATP has to investigate this and sanction those who earn money by losing on purpose.  I don't know if there's someone doing it or not.  I'm not informed.  But if it's this way, it's not good for tennis.  

Q.Do you like it as much as cars?  Talking about yesterday.  

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, it was a very good experience.  Last year I also went to the Real Madrid.  I enjoyed it.  This is the first time I lost first round anyway.
