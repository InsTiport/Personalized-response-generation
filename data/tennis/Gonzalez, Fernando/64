Q. Is that your biggest ever victory, do you think?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Of course.  He's the best player ever.  I been dreaming to play with Sampras maybe, like, twelve years.  I just happy to play with him.  I beat him today.  I play a great match.  So, I'm so happy about it. 
 
Q.  When you were trailing in that first set, you still had the belief to keep going for your shots.  Do you think that put him off, the fact that you were still going for your shots even when you were losing?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  If I want to beat a player like Sampras, you have to go  -- I mean, you have to go to find the match.  I mean, you cannot stay  -- Sampras is not going to lose the match.  My game is like that, so I have that style always.  
 
Q.  Did you have a particular way you thought you had to play to beat him? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.  I mean, if we play in the baseline, I just to attack him always.  I mean, I try to move the ball always and that's what I did.  
 
Q.  I mean, the crowd was fantastic, too.  Lots of your fellow Chileans.  Does that make it even more special? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Two days ago when I play with Moya, it was like maybe 1,000, 2,000 of Chilean people.  So that give you a lot of motivation and is make me very happy.
