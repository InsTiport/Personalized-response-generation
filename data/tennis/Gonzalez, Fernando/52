Q.  What happened with your ankle, and how much of a bother was it? 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, I just twist it.  I mean, it's happen like one months ago, exactly the same thing.  And when I twist it, it was very, very painful.  But after, I can run.  I can do -- I can play almost at the same -- I can run like at my 100% almost. 

Q.  What did you think of the officiating out there today?  It seemed like there was a lot of sketchy calls made on both ends of the court.  You both had problems. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Sometimes the close call, you never know.  I mean, it's for both side it's the same thing.  But sometimes in hard court, you never know which kind of call you gonna have.  But that's the bad thing.  On clay, you can have a mark, but you cannot have it here.  I mean, it's just small detail about the match.
