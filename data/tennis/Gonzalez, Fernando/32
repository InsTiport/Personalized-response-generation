   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Quite a big battle for you tonight. 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, it was a tough day.  I mean, I didn't play my best tennis, but the other guy was serving really good, was returning really well, too. 
 My serve didn't work in the first three sets.  I was (indiscernible) in the beginning of the match. 

 Q.  How are you feeling physically now after that? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I'm fine.  I mean, I play long match.  But maybe we play really short points most of the time. 
 But I feel okay.  Of course, I'm a little bit tired now.  But I have two days to recover and play the next match. 

 Q.  What are you expecting from Lleyton Hewitt in your next match? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It's going to be tough, like every match in a Slam.  But especially here, he's going to have the crowd.  He play many time this tournament. 
 He's really good fighter, but I'm playing good normally most of the time.  I think it's going to be a tough match always. 

 Q.  What do you make of his form at the moment?  He's dropped in the rankings a little bit. 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Haven't played too many tournaments.  I mean, last time that I saw him was in the US Open.  When you don't play, maybe you don't have rhythm, you don't have enough competition. 
 Anyway, he's a really good player, good fighter.  Is going to be really tough match from the first to the last point. 

 Q.  Do you think he might be more vulnerable, danger of being beaten, by not playing so much? 
 FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, but he's a good player anyway.  The good players can do that.  I mean, maybe play a tournament and then don't play for a few months.  Nothing really important happen, but when you get to the top level, maybe that's a little bit tough to do it.
