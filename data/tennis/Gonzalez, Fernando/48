FERNANDO GONZALEZ: I mean, one of the most important reason is I think it's our personality. We try to fight from the beginning till the end. Maybe that's one of the big reason for our success. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ: I think I can play on every court. Sometimes I like more hard court and sometimes more clay. But also this year I won a few matches on grass, and that's new for me. So, I mean, doesn't make too much difference about any court. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ: I mean, it's very important if you have a coach, he used to play, he is a good coach, have good results on both sides. So he knows what do you think, what do you feel in the important moments. Because there is some coaches that they have never played and they doesn't know what do you think in that moment. So maybe that's a good, very good reason to have a good coach like that. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I am not anymore with the guy Gabriel Markus. I have a new coach, Patricio Rodriguez. I start with him like a few months ago, the week before Wimbledon. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah. 

NICOLAS MASSU: It's better the coach play tennis before. Because Fernando say, I think the same as Fernando, same. Same reason. 

FERNANDO GONZALEZ: I'm not the right person to answer that, but, I mean, they feel very deep the tennis, you know. They don't like to stay away from the tour, I think - I think, I mean, is my opinion. But you have to ask them.
