THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Getting through a first round is an important thing, but to do it against Michael, final professional match, was it bittersweet?  What did you say to him?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It was tough when I was serving for the match, I was feeling like he was trying to come back.  He didn't want to finish the match, I think.  But I was very concentrate on my match, I was playing really good.  But Michael, in the third set, he start to return better.  He get more confidence.  When we finish, I say, "It was a pleasure for me to play against you in your last tournament."  That was all.  
 
Q.  You had a great run here last year.  Your thoughts coming back to the US Open?  Do you derive more confidence this year considering how well you played last year?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, one more year of experience.  That can help in this kind of tournament.  Last year I was winning more matches before this.  I mean, you have to go match by match.  I'm playing good.  Today I play good.  My serve was much better than the other week.  That make me get a lot of confidence.  
 
Q.  In my opinion last year you play better than this year.  What's going on?  Cincinnati, you play much better. 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, maybe.  Every week is different.  Every tournament is different.  Maybe this last year I play  -- this year I play better French Open than last year.  It's happen.  
 
Q.  This band you are wearing around your leg, is it nothing important?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I have tendonitis one year ago.  This bother me sometime, so I used to use that.  
 
Q.  Does it influence your form, tennis form?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, sometimes.  Today I feel perfect.
