THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 
 
 
Q.  When Lleyton was here, he predicted Andy's victory.  He was wrong.  You forced him completely to defend.  What was the difference between this game and this match and the match you played before? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  My game is like that.  I mean, I play very aggressive.  I try to go to find the match.  I mean, I try to win the points, and I always want to play and try to make the winners.  That's the way that I play.  
 
Q.  The tiebreak, you were leading 6-2.  Suddenly it became 6-all.  What were you thinking at this moment? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I was very nervous.  I need little bit more of confidence, because I haven't won matches since a few months ago.  So that happen.  But I'm very happy in the 6-all I made a good serve then I play great point.  
 
Q.  Do you always hit as strong as today, or it's just today? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Maybe more than today (laughing).  I like to play.  That's the way of my  --. 
 
Q.  Do you work on that?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  That's my style.  I love to play like that.  I prefer to be one great week and then three not so good.  I mean... 
 
Q.  The power you create from both sides, backhand and forehand, it's a matter of timing, it's a matter of strength you have?  What is it?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Work.  Work.  I always try to do it.  I mean, since I was a kid I try to hit the ball very hard.  
 
Q.  It was like that from the beginning when you start to play, or you just improve a lot?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, since more than ten years I think.  
 
Q.  Are you surprised to find yourself in the semifinals here? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, because last week I lost in first round.  I was sick last week.  
 
Q.  What was wrong? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I had a virus.  But I work very hard last week with my coach.  We did it great.  
 
Q.  You never played Lleyton?  Have you watched him much? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  We play six years ago in the Juniors, but now he's No. 1.  He's a great player, great fighter.  But if I play like this, maybe I have a lot of chances.  
 
Q.  Do you remember where it was when you played him? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I think  -- I don't know.  Was Under-16s and I'm 22 now. 
 
Q.  You remember the score?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't.  Three sets.  
 
Q.  You won or lost?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  No, I lost.  Three sets.  
 
Q.  So if you play like this tonight, you'll be in the match? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I hope so.  
 
Q.  You have a chance?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I think so.  I mean, I play great.  Try to go win. 
 
Q.  Is this as well as you played this year, this match? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Maybe.  But I didn't serve like other times.  But I play unbelievable today.  
 
Q.  How was this match compared to when you beat Sampras in Miami? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't know, today I play much better my backhand.  But I didn't serve so good than with Sampras.  
 
Q.  Andy said he had fun.  Even though he lost, he said the crowd was great and had a blast, he enjoyed this match.  Did you enjoy this match?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I enjoy because I won (smiling).  It was a lot of people.  It was great stadium.  The people enjoy very much tennis here.  
 
Q.  Do you train in Chile when you don't play tournaments?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I don't train (laughing).  No, my coach is from Argentina.  I go to Buenos Aires. 
 
Q.  But you live in Chile? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  So you train with all the Argentinian players? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah.  I'm with my coach always.  We practice together.  
 
Q.  Do you remember how it was when you beat Pete?  When you beat Sampras, what was the feeling like when you pulled that off?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  It was different because I dream like more than ten years to play against Sampras, and I have the match and I won.  That was fantastic.  
 
Q.  What surface suits you best:  The clay or the hardcourt? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I like more clay, but I won two titles on clay, never on hard.  But this year I make better results on hardcourts.  So maybe hardcourts is my surface.  
 
Q.  Tomorrow you are playing Lleyton, the No. 1 player in the world.  What thoughts do you have for this match? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I mean, I know he's a great player.  He won a couple of big tournaments this year.  He's No. 1. 
 
Q.  What do you have to do to beat him?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  To play the way like today  - I mean, aggressive, and try to win the points.  I need to force him.  
 
Q.  Do you always have this forehand, or sometimes you lose it when you're not in confidence maybe? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I have my forehand since I born, but I lost my backhand all the rest (laughing).  
 
Q.  You work the backhand most? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I like  -- I mean, always I love my forehand.  I try to go, keep on going, but... (Laughing).  
 
Q.  And how did you begin tennis? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  My dad used to play.  I go with him to play with his friends, and then I start to play like when I was five years.  
 
Q.  Five years?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  It was not too hard in Chile because it's a country with maybe some problems before a long time ago? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, but at that time... 
 
Q.  There are a lot of courts?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, there is a lot of courts there.  
 
Q.  What is your relationship with Marcelo Rios?  Are you friends?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  I'm not a great friend of him.  We have a very good relation.  We play Davis Cup together. 
 
Q.  You practice together too?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, when I'm in Chile we try to practice together because there is not too many players to practice.  But I have a good relation with him.  
 
Q.  And why did you choose Horacio as a coach and not someone from your country?  Is there not so many coaches there?
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, there is not too many.  I used to work with Viver, now I'm working with Horacio de la Pena for one year.  
 
Q.  One year now? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  Yeah, almost. 
 
Q.  How did you meet?  On the tour? 
 
FERNANDO GONZALEZ:  On the tour, yeah.  We talk together.  We start to work when I was like 190.  Now we're like 30, you know.
