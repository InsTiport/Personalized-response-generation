 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Could you tell us how you won that tough five-setter?  
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: It's tough to explain 'cause he was hitting every single ball hard as he could. And I feel that I wasn't making too much damage with my shots.   
 I feel really uncomfortable almost all the match. My serve wasn't like I used to serve. But fortunately I took my chances and I won the match.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts on playing Andy Roddick next.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: It's gonna be tough. I mean, for sure I have to play better if I want to beat him. I mean, I know that he won in four sets. I mean, he's playing a good level.   
  
  Q. Is it your serve that's stopping you from reaching your top?   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Yeah, yeah, my serve. And today I wasn't that comfortable 'cause he was hitting the ball really hard. He take me out of position almost every time.   
 It was really hard for me to do the same with him. So that's why I didn't feel like I wish. But fortunately I took my chances in the fifth set and I break him, and that hold during the whole set.  
  
  Q. He said it was like playing in front of a soccer crowd today.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: It was exciting to play in front of this crowd for me. Is a big support really far away from home. Just really excited.   
  
  Q. How is your knee? You iced it early on and seemed to be limping.   
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Yeah, I have the knee since long time ago. I mean, sometimes is painful, but it's only pain. I mean, I know that I have, but it's painful sometimes.   
 Today I didn't feel really, really well.   
  
  Q. Will it be feeling better in time for your next match?  
 FERNANDO GONZÃLEZ: Hopefully. I wish. I will try. I'm going to make everything to recover and try to play a good match.
