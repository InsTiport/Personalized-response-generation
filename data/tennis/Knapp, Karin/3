  THE MODERATOR:   We'll start with questions for the Italian team. 

Q.   Generally for the players, particularly to the singles players for Saturday, any added pressure for playing in an away venue in the United States and what type of added pressure is there for playing first? 
KARIN KNAPP:   I think, yeah, I play first.   I enter the court first.   But it's a tough match.   I think we have to think about the match.   It's not easy because we are here in America.   I heard a lot of people are coming. 
We are small but we will be loud (laughter).   No, it's nice.   We are happy, we are ready, and let's start tomorrow. 

Q.   I'm assuming you have met on tour some of the opponents you're playing.   Can you tell me about what strengths they have and how you feel you match up on the hard courts. 
CAMILA GIORGI:   The court, it's good.   It's fast, but is good for us.   We are used to play on this surface in Europe, indoors.   It's going to be just a good experience. 
KARIN KNAPP:   Yeah, I played already against Christina, but it was completely different conditions.   We played outdoor on clay. 
But how Camila say, the court is good.   We practice a lot.   We had nice practices this week.   Yeah, we are ready.   We are ready to compete against them and fight a lot. 

Q.   Italy has been very successful against the United States recently.   I'm wondering if you feel any pressure to continue that success, even though I know you're a whole new group that is playing. 
KARIN KNAPP:   We played a lot of times against America, but I think it was not like us as a team. 
We are really happy to be here.   We make a great team.   We are very happy the captain choose us.   We will fight and try to win again, try to follow Sara, Roberta and the other ones.
