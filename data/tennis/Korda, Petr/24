Q.  Last time you played 6 nothing, three times  in a row; three times it was 6-Love.  

PETR KORDA:  Three times?  


Q.  Yes.  

PETR KORDA:  I know it was twice this year.  It was in  Milan.  I was leading in the first set 3-Love.  I  lost.  Then I was 6-Love, 3-Love, up, and I lost 7-5.  Today I just raised my game on a good level.  Then I was able to again to perform 6-Love and, you  know, that is not important.  Mostly important, I was  able to win the match.  


Q.  Question about the so-called players  initiative, about having ATP points next year.  Do you  know about this initiative, and at what stage is it?  

PETR KORDA:  Probably you were the first one who told me.  But they have points in ATP Finals, and maybe it's  going to be good idea to have points also here.  But I  have to think about it.  Too quick.      


Q.  Petr, you didn't really have a great year  like you had the one year before.  Is that something to  do with the heart problems you had, or is it missing of  self confidence or --  

PETR KORDA:  It is everything -- it started in here in  Munich in the beginning on the clay court season and  since that time I didn't catch the train because they  find like I had-- like I don't know, like something in  the heart and my condition went down to level zero; I  couldn't catch it during the whole year, but I had a  good break after U.S. Open I was months at home and  really I settled down and I was start to working and  preparing myself for the next season and I had some  success in indoor tournaments and, you know, I am  looking really forward for 94 because this year I was  many times sick and really I want to forget this season  and maybe I am going to have a good head; then I am  going to be able to celebrate a little bit.  


Q.  Thank you.
