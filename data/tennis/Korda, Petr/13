 PETR KORDA: We didn't check the fever yet. But, I am not feeling well. I have some kind
of virus, whatever. Yesterday I had sore throat, and this morning I woke up and I couldn't
almost leave my house, very tired and spent a whole day in the bed sweating and just don't
-- I didn't want to give up, but it is really hurts. 
 
Q. It is hard to believe, isn't it, for yourself even, that a couple days ago you were
so strong against Sampras and --
 
 PETR KORDA: One day you are up and next day you can be really down. Unfortunately, I
didn't went down with my tennis, but I just got sick. Actually, it is the worst could
happen to me. 
 
Q. Was there any point in the match that you felt better than other point?
 
 PETR KORDA: I was struggling since the beginning and I just was pushing hard as I
could. But to be honest, I didn't want -- I didn't want to default it. I was trying to do
the best I could, but I just didn't have the energy and I just didn't want to collapse
over there. 
 
Q. Have you got any idea how or when it happened?
 
 PETR KORDA: When it happened, I would say, I think it happened here. Whenever you go,
it is like every room, it is like a refrigerator, it is so cold and when you coming from
the court, it might happen with Pete when we were coming in and out, I probably got
frozen. And, I would say, they have to consider probably because otherwise I don't have
idea where I got it. Because, I mean, whenever I go, because as I know, I had this problem
when I was playing first time US Open I had to default for the same reason. 
 
Q. Was it even worse that it was that cold and windy out there?
 
 PETR KORDA: I mean, that didn't bother me. That is the same for both players, but I
just didn't have it. I would say it is enough.
