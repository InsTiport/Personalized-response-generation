Q. What do you think about Martelli?

PETR KORDA: I think he played great match, but I want to see him play one more time. I
don't think so he can play like that, hit the ball hard, that well, how he was playing
today. I just want to see him play. Hopefully it's going to be this year.

Q. At the end, it seemed like there was something?

PETR KORDA: I was tired in the end because I've been here whole day, with the food
which we can get here, I mean, I was so hungry. I didn't eat. If you can get little piece
of chicken for $10, you just can fill up your stomach. I've just been struggling. I've
been struggling in the end.
