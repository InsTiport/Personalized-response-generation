Q.  What does this tournament mean to you? 
 
PETR KORDA:  I think, you know, it is the final Grand Slam tournament of the year.  It is like a Masters for us and just for me, it means last tournament of the year, and I am just pretty happy I won today.  
 

Q.  How do you like the atmosphere here?  Is it more relaxing or is it sort of -- 
 
PETR KORDA:  First of all, I want to say I am little bit disappointed because I cannot find my country flag between the official countries, like from all the players by flag.  That is a little bit disappointing. But this tournament, it is good organizing, and just the court is a little bit faster than usual, that is all what I can say at the moment.  
 

Q.  Do you think that with the faster court here than it was in Frankfurt, you have more chances here to win the tournament? 
 
PETR KORDA:  I was almost out of the tournament, couple of minutes ago.  But this court is much faster than Frankfurt, and it could be some surprises this week.  
 

Q.  Could you say why it is so relevant for you to see your country's flag? 
 
PETR KORDA:  I don't know, if you look around, then you can see all the flags for all the players, and you know, you cannot finds yours, that is like -- what do you think, you know?  If you are going to participate in the tournament and you are going to be only one from the country and you are not going to see -- everybody, they have a flag, except me.  They have Russians, I don't know, South African, what else and they don't have a Czech.  
 

Q.  You would have some vacation after this tournament.  How do you plan to spend it? 
 
PETR KORDA:  I don't think I am going to have a vacation because I already start last week to prepare for next season.  Just I am not going to play tennis but I am going to work on my conditions, especially my upper body.  
 

Q.  Thank you.
