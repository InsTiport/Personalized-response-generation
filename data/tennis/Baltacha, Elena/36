Q.  This is a statistic that you probably don't know about:  Until this year, we were facing a year without a woman in the second round of Wimbledon.  You spared Britain's blushes there.  What do you think about that?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  I've saved the day (laughter).  
 
Q.  How do you feel about that?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Pretty good, yeah.  Yeah, I think I didn't play my best tennis today, but I just kept on fighting off (something) before the match.  My legs felt like jelly, especially the whole first set.  I was all over the place.  But I've never shanked so many balls, as well.  But, no, I just kept on fighting, kept on digging in, and managed to get a win today. 
 
Q.  Did it help that last year they put you on Centre Court?  That surely must have helped your nerves going to an outside court. 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah, it did.  Today was quite a big court, as well.  A lot of people there, a lot of people supporting me.  That helped, as well.  
 
Q.  Who was there today? 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  My mom, my dad, my coaches, Joe was commentating.  My friends, about 10 friends.  Just the crowd really were just really supportive. 
 
Q.  When you went a break down in the second, did you worry you were going to lose? 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Sorry?  
 
Q.  Did you worry you were going to lose control of the game a break down in the second?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Not really.  I wasn't trying to think about that.  I was just trying to, you know, keep focusing.  I mean, I don't think she had a great day, as well, today.  But, you know, I was the one that came out in the end.  So that's the main thing.  A win's a win. 
 
Q.  Where did you get that serve from?  Helped you out a bit, didn't it?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah (laughter).  I mean, yeah, my stat wasn't high.  First serve percentage wasn't high at all today.  I think it was below 50.  But I served big on important points.  I think that's what got me out of jail.  I only had I think a few double-faults.  My second serve was all right, as well, today. 
 
Q.  She seemed to be getting a bit niggled at times.  Were you aware of that?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah.  I mean, to be honest, I wasn't really trying to, you know  -- I wasn't really trying to look at the other end to see what she was doing.  I just really had to focus on myself.  As I said, I wasn't playing my best tennis today.  I wasn't getting the great feelings that I'm searching for.  But, you know, as I say, a win's a win.  Even if you win ugly, a win is a win.  
 
Q.  Were things getting a bit fraught at the end?  The umpire reminded you to shake hands. 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  No, I shook her hand.  I mean, I don't know what she was saying about it.  But I shook her hand.  I shook the umpire's hand, so... 
 
Q.  Were you born in England or Ukraine?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  I was born in Kiev in Ukraine.  
 
Q.  When your dad signed for Ipswich?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Are you a tractor girl?  Do you support Ipswich?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah, I support every team he plays for. 
 
Q.  Did you choose tennis or did your dad suggest it?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  My mom and dad introduced it to me.   In Ipswich I started playing short tennis when I was six.  We moved up to Perth in Scotland.  Then I started playing tennis when I was 10.  
 
Q.  Another big day on Thursday, Amanda Coetzer.  How do you feel about that?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Oh, it's going to be a toughy, that's for sure.  But, yeah, I've got nothing to lose, nothing at all to lose.  I'm going to go out, give a hundred percent, see what happens.  But I'll be well up for it.  
 
Q.  How will you celebrate tonight? 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Get hammered (laughter).  No, not quite, no.  Going to have an early night tonight and practice tomorrow.  Clubbing.  Go clubbing, yeah (laughter). 
 
Q.  That's an early night in Scotland. 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah (laughter). 
 
Q.  What does your dad do?  Is he still involved in football?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I don't really see my dad that much.  But, yeah.  
 
Q.  Where is your brother?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  He's up in Scotland. 
 
Q.  Will he have been watching on the tele? 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yes. 
 
Q.  He told us last year he was your big hero and your inspiration. 
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah.  Hopefully he's watching me.  But he's still in Scotland.  He's still playing for St.  Marren.  He's doing well. 
 
Q.  Do you think he'll get hammered tonight?
 
ELENA BALTACHA:  Probably (laughter).  No, they start their pre-season.  He'll be a good boy tonight, I think.
