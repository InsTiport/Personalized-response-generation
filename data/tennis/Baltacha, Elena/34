Q.  Obviously an education in terms of not just tennis, but mind games and things that can go on out there. 

ELENA BALTACHA:  Well, you know, when I went out there today, I was just thinking to be positive.  She's a great player.  She played well.  I mean, in patches I played really well, as well.  I really enjoyed the match today.  I mean, I've had a brilliant week.  I learned a lot.  You know, it's given me a boost for the future.

Q.  Seemed to be a long wait for you at the start.  What was going through your mind then?  Did you wonder what was happening?

ELENA BALTACHA:  It's not really a lot.  I mean, obviously she took a bit of time to come on the court.  But, you know, that didn't bother me at all.  I was just thinking of, you know, just stay positive, just to play my game, you know, just to fight, which I did today. 

Q.  You were both called at the same time, weren't you?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Uh-huh.

Q.  Did you have to come from different locker rooms?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I don't know.  I didn't see her in the locker room. 

Q.  More recognition now, help for your future matches. 

ELENA BALTACHA:  The crowd were brilliant today.  My last two matches, they were superb.  They were backing me up.  It was just a great atmosphere.

Q.  What next for you?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Back to reality (laughter).  Felix Stowe, 25,000.

Q.  Where will you be this time next week?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Felix Stowe.

Q.  How far did you believe, when you had that clear lead in the second set, that you could win that match?

ELENA BALTACHA:  As I said, I mean, you know, she's a very good player.  In patches I played really well.  You know, I just kept on thinking just to keep on fighting, just to keep on digging in, which I did today.  At the end of the day, I didn't win.  But, you know, I've had a brilliant time this week.  I've learned a lot of things.  But I know there's still lots and lots of things to improve on.

Q.  What have you learned and what do you need to improve on? 

ELENA BALTACHA:  Oh, the obvious things stand out.  I don't think I'm quick enough.  You know, I still need to, you know, read the game more.  I mean, there's lots and lots of things I could tell you that I still need to improve.  But there are areas that I have to improve, especially playing on clay.  You know, just not on grass courts  - clay, hard.  But, I mean, I'm really excited.  As I said, I'm really looking forward to the future.  This week's definitely given me a big boost.

Q.  Given your bank balance a big boost.  How are you going to spend your winning?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I'm going to go shopping, treat myself.

Q.  What are you going to buy?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I don't know.  I'll put it in the bank first.

Q.  What was your previous biggest paycheck?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I don't know.  Well, this was the biggest one, isn't it? 

Q.  Have you done enough to get a sponsor car yet?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I'm trying.

Q.  You're praying?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I'm praying.

Q.  Still have to drive the Peugeot?

ELENA BALTACHA:  The old one, yes (laughter).  

Q.  Parents here today?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Uh-huh.

Q.  Did you see them afterwards?

ELENA BALTACHA:  No, not yet. 

Q.  Could you hear (Alan/Allen) Jones telling you to calm down?

ELENA BALTACHA:  I had a lot of things on the court from different people.  You know, just kept on focusing, just kept on fighting.

Q.  How conscious are you of what's going on around you on the court?  Are you picking up on the support?

ELENA BALTACHA:  As I said, obviously you do hear it.  But, you know, I just kept on trying to focus.  You know, it was nice because it was a great atmosphere today. 

Q.  Were you aware of Tim going a set up?

ELENA BALTACHA:  No.

Q.  The crowd all cheered. 

ELENA BALTACHA:  No.  I was concentrating on my match. 

Q.  How far will you follow Tim's further performances here? 

ELENA BALTACHA:  Well, how long is a piece of rope?  You know, I don't know.  I mean, you know, I'm here to try my best.  As I say, I've got lots of things to improve on. 

Q.  He meant, will you continue to watch Tim's matches?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, of course I will.  I mean, he's doing really well at the moment, yeah. 

Q.  When you were little and growing up playing short tennis, was there anybody that you really admired in women's tennis that you would have liked to have been like?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Well, I mean, at that age, I was five, so I didn't really.

Q.  Maybe later years perhaps. 

ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah.  I mean, I really liked Steffi.  Navratilova, obviously.

Q.  What of their qualities was it that you liked? 

ELENA BALTACHA:  Well, I mean, it's obvious, isn't it?  Navratilova is an absolute lej (legend).  She's quick.  Even watching her last week at Eastbourne, I mean, she's just unbelievable.  She moves so well, still reads the game unbelievable.  She's just a brilliant player to watch - still. 

Q.  After Felix Stowe, what then?  Is qualifying for the US Open a possibility?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Yeah.  I'm playing two 25's in Spain, then a few tournaments in America leading up to the US quallies.

Q.  This experience, makes you more determined to come back next year, reach the second week?

ELENA BALTACHA:  Of course.  It makes me more determined in every tournament I play - even next week.  I mean, tomorrow's another day.  As I said, I've had a brilliant week this week, and it's definitely given me a boost.
