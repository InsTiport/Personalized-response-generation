THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese, please.
Q. Talk about the match today, the first time being in the main draw. Anything about your performance?
WANG XIYU: Well, it was all right. I did my best. My opponent was very strong, was No. 1 in doubles, top 30 in singles. I think she's really a powerful player. I did my best to play in this match for every point.
Q. It's been a year since you've been on the senior tour. Anything you want to say about your past performance?
WANG XIYU: Generally speaking, I'm improving. At the very beginning, it wasn't very ideal. I didn't see great results. Then I steadily am improving my form. I was getting used to the level of competition on the senior tour. I think I see improvements physically and mentally.
Q. In the Asian swing, you've played many matches, even though you didn't have any victories like last year. What have you learned in this section of the Asian swing?
WANG XIYU: Well, to me I have learned a lot in the past few weeks how to actually have a better assessment of your health, your upper limits, how to make plans for each match, and how to improve, how to do better strategically, more strategies when facing different problems.
