THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you find the experience out there today?  
SARA TOMIC:   Well, definitelya big thing.   I mean, it's the first Junior Grand Slam.   I got well‑supported out there, so it was really good.  
   
 Q.   Was it unnerving or unsettling for you, the publicity surrounding your brother?  
SARA TOMIC:   Definitely.   I didn't expect that many people to be there.   Obviously my brother is doing well.   They came to see me.   Yeah, it was really good.  
   
 Q.   How do you think you handled the whole situation in your game?  
SARA TOMIC:   Um, I didn't play my best game, but I could have ‑‑ handled the situation as well as could have, but couldn't do anything else.  
   
 Q.   Did you get some support from Bernard today?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yeah, some fist pumps?   It was good.  
   
 Q.   Did he give you any tips before the match?  
SARA TOMIC:   Before he just said, Enjoy the match and just play what you need to be playing.  
   
 Q.   Do you have big hopes and dreams like Bernard?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yeah, definitely.   Play Serena, to play Sharapova, to play all the big players.  
   
 Q.   What do you think at this stage is your biggest strength in your game?  
SARA TOMIC:   Definitely my power.   That's definitely my strength.   You know, moving players around the court, as well.   
So, yeah.   
   
 Q.   And have you got a particular goal that you want to achieve for this year?  
SARA TOMIC:   Just making good results and nothing about winning.   Just thinking about what we want to work on, me and my coach.  
   
 Q.   Will you be watching the match tonight?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yes, definitely (smiling).  
   
 Q.   What are you expecting?  
SARA TOMIC:   Hopefully a win.   I mean, Federer is like my idol, too, but I'm really happy to support Bernard.  
   
 Q.   You and Bernard's girlfriend sit side by side in the box.   What do you girls talk about while he is playing?  
SARA TOMIC:   Oh, we always talk about the silly dropshots that he did sometimes.   But, no, that's the way he plays his game and what's the difference between us.  
   
 Q.   So you feel like whenever you watch him you're learning?  
SARA TOMIC:   Definitely a big thing.   And all those players that he's been playing, quite an experience for me as well.  
   
 Q.   Is Bernard an inspiration to you?  
SARA TOMIC:   Definitely.   That slice and the way his attitude is on the court, speaking as well, because I get frustrated.   So I get a lot of experience from that, too.  
   
 Q.   Do you get to hit much with him?  
SARA TOMIC:   I had maybe a little week session just a little bit before I went to Europe last year.   It's a big stretch to see how he hits compared to me.  
   
 Q.   How tall are you?  
SARA TOMIC:   5'6", 5'7".  
   
 Q.   Are you expecting to grow some more?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yes, I think I'm going to be like 6'0".  
   
 Q.   Obviously your father has had a big say in your career, and I would assume a dominant figure in the initial teaching.   
SARA TOMIC:   Oh, I mean, he wants the best for me, to just do everything.   I trust him, what he's saying, so...   
   
 Q.   You are also coached by Johnny on the Gold Coast?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yeah, Johnny Stamenovic.  
   
 Q.   So they both sort of advise you?  
SARA TOMIC:   Johnny is more the head coach, and then dad will come and help some stuff, too.   
   
 Q.   Do you want to be No. 1 in the world, as well?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yes, definitely.   
   
 Q.   Just wanted to clarify that.   
SARA TOMIC:   (Smiling).  
   
 Q.   It was quite hot out there.   
SARA TOMIC:   Oh, it was so hot.   I was expecting, because she's from USA and she came from like the winter there, I was thinking she's going to be like dying on the court.   
But she handled it really well, so good for her.   
   
 Q.   Relative to Bernard, you seem quite talkative.   
SARA TOMIC:   Yeah, I talk a lot.   
   
 Q.   And you enjoy media, is it?   
SARA TOMIC:   Um, I guess.   Unless I stuff up.  
   
 Q.   Do you get nervous coming in here talking to all of us?  
SARA TOMIC:   Yeah.
