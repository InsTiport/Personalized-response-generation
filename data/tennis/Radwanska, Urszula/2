U. RADWANSKA/A. Glatch
  6-3, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. First of all, how is your ankle?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Oh, it's better. Much better today.

 Q. But were you struggling with it? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Actually it's a little bit strained, so it's like -- but it's much better. Yesterday it was painful. I couldn't run. Today was much better. I was playing with the tape so it was okay.

 Q. Can you talk about that Friday night? It was really late, but you were serving for the match and then you get hurt. Take us back to how you got hurt. 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, actually it was during my match point, so it was pretty bad luck. I twisted my ankle and I took a medical time. After that, I won the two points and the match.

 Q. But at any point did you think might have to retire from the match?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Oh, no, I was so close. So I said, No, I need to play to the end. 

 Q. And then you said it was hurting a lot yesterday. Were you putting a lot of weight on it? How bad was to yesterday? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, it was bad. It was hurting a lot. At night, I couldn't sleep actually. But I took some pills and then I went to the physio and with some treatment it's better.

 Q. And how was it today when you were out there? How much pain were you still going through?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Well, without tape it's really painful. I couldn't actually run without tape. 
 But the physio did good work, and we taped it and I took some pills today so it's good.

 Q. This must be a nice run for you. You beat a top 10 player, a top 5 player to get to the fourth round. 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, it's very good. I have a wildcard here so it's really good. 

 Q. Can you talk about that crazy let call you got at 4-2 in the second set when the umpire called let?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah. She called a let and it was actually during my shot. She said it was after, so I was really pissed. Maybe that's why I played better later.

 Q. Did she explain to you why she called the let, which didn't seem like there was a reason? And then why she wouldn't take it back? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Well, it was a reason, because the ball came to the crowd.

 Q. Yeah.
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, so I heard it also. For me it was actually during my shot. She said she called after, but I cannot -- I couldn't do anything. 

 Q. Do you normally get so emotional? You were angry throughout the set until the end when you won. Do you normally get so emotional and angry?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yes. No, actually I was angry maybe two games later and then it was okay.

 Q. You gave your racquet a very good workout on the court. 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, I know.

 Q. But you're able to get angry and then get focused again?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah. I was like angry for two games. But I was sorry about the games, not about her. 

 Q. So you've always had problems with your temper, with the anger? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Well, right now it's not that bad. When I was smaller, like when I was 14 or 15 it was really bad. Like I was destroying the racquets and screaming. Now I'm trying to control this. 

 Q. So why do you think you've been playing so well at this tournament? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Well, hard to say, but -- I don't know. I like the courts and I feel good the ball here. I was playing pretty well against Kuznetsova. I don't know. I just like it here. 

 Q. You must know Wozniacki pretty well, huh? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah. She's my close friend. We know each other. I played her like last time at junior Wimbledon. I lost against her, but I had a match point, so I don't want to remember that match. 

 Q. So you're ready for the big revenge this time?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Yeah, of course. I'm ready. 

 Q. How long have you been friends with Caroline?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Oh, we are friends from like juniors, so for a couple of years. Actually she's Polish. She speak Polish. Her parents are Polish. Yeah, we're close friends.

 Q. What was it like to beat your sister a couple weeks ago? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Actually, it was nice for me, yeah. But, you know, she was a little bit sick. Actually, she came in Paris so she played indoor. So, yeah. 
 But it was actually, yeah, a good match for me. Actually she wasn't really pissed for me after the match. She was just laughing, so we're still friends. (Laughter.)

 Q. The Williams sisters are asked how it is when they play each other. How is it for you emotionally when you play her? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: I mean, I was trying to not thinking that she's my sister and just, you know, playing my game. But it was really hard. You know, someone needs to lose. 
 But, yeah, actually it was our first match on the WTA. I don't think so it was last one, so, yeah. 

 Q. Are your personalities similar or are you very different? 
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Um, it's hard to say. You need to ask my parents about that. But on the court we are actually different. I'm trying to play more aggressive and I'm more emotional on the court, and she's like more quiet. 
 Off the courts I think we're similar. We have the same style and we like the same things. Off court we are actually almost the same.

 Q. When you're together at a tournament, do you spend a lot of time together or do you hang out separately?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: No, we're always together. We're practicing together and we're staying in the same room, so... 

 Q. Do you get sick of each other?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: No.

 Q. Never?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Never. Like maybe when we were small, we were fighting. But now it's okay. We're supporting each other.

 Q. What did you fight about?
 URSZULA RADWANSKA: Oh, about everything, like sisters. Now we're supporting. We're also like best friends.
