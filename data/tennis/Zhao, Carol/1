THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You've been out for a while.  You're healthy again?  
CAROL ZHAO: Yeah, I've been battling this elbow injury for about likes three months.  I took some time off.  I've been working really hard on rehab and stuff.  Then, yeah, unfortunately yesterday I had a little accident.  Yeah, I wasn't able to perform physically 100%, which is a bit of a shame.  But I gave it my all out there.   
 Q.  She jumped on you right in the beginning.  I think she had four aces in the first two games.  
CAROL ZHAO: Yeah, I mean, it's never easy to play against a good player like that, especially when you're short on match play.  She's putting a lot of pressure on your service games.   
Yeah, she's a top-20 player, so...   
 Q.  When you get to play those top-50 players like that, do you see these games as a measuring stick?  
CAROL ZHAO: Yeah, sure.  I mean, every match is an individual entity, I guess.  For sure, you get to see, like, a high level.  She played well at Wimbledon, I think.  She's in good form, yeah.   
 Q.  To have an opportunity to play in the Rogers Cup, have a match go like that, how are you feeling right now?  
CAROL ZHAO: Yeah, first and foremost I would have loved to be 100% healthy, been able to give my best that way.  But always grateful for an opportunity to play here.  Hopefully next time will be better.
