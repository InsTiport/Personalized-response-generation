MARTIN LEE: Yeah, I felt the whole match I was playing well. First set, I played very well. Had a big chance in the beginning of the second set, which I didn't take. Then he started to play well. Then he got on a roll for about a set and a half. It really changed at the beginning of the fourth. I lost my serve the first game, but I thought I played an all right game. I wasn't too dispirited. I was feeling very good. My body was feeling fine. The fifth set felt like the first set anyway. I think he just came out with the pass at 4-3 to break me. I actually hit a good volley. I think it was going to take a bit of magic from one of us. I thought he looked pretty tired. 

MARTIN LEE: When it's so tight like that in the fifth set, it's usually a shot out of nothing that gives you the break, gives you the chance to win, and he made it. I thought I played a very good match. I dug in well when I needed to. I think I'm getting more and more belief the more matches I play at this level. 

MARTIN LEE: Yeah. Well, this year's been great. I've been getting better and better. The last six weeks, I think I'm realizing what level I need to get to. The way I've been playing, even though I haven't been playing that well, it's all about belief. It's the times when you're not playing so well, and if you still believe, you're still in the match. If I get to that stage in every match, I'm going to win quite a few of those matches. 

MARTIN LEE: I think this is my fourth. This felt great today. My fitness is one of the best parts of my game. I can run all day. Today was very encouraging because I feel fine now really. I've just played five sets. Just got to keep it going. 

MARTIN LEE: No, I've been working on that for a year now, and it's got so much better. I still get a little bit angry. But it's fine if you let the anger out. If you're fine for the next point, it's perfectly acceptable. I used to get angry and still be worrying about it a set later. The match is gone by then. 

MARTIN LEE: Well, I think the mental, definitely. I don't think I'm playing any different to what I have done in probably the last two or three years. I'm just believing. I'm probably playing a bit smarter, probably thinking more, not going for those 100-to-1 shots when you're down, trying to play the percentages. It's coming together nicely.
