 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously a tough one today, but what are you going to take away from the experience of this week?  Obviously the big wins you earned and all of that.
 LORENZO MUSETTI:   (No audio)... on the court.  I was maybe tired, like I played a lot of matches during this week.  And also I had a little problem with the shoulder so I couldn't like have the power that I had in these days.
 But for sure I'm taking away great experience.  I think next week or in the next week I will play with more trust in my weapons and in myself, so this is what I'm taking away from this tournament.
 Q. I wonder if, in the last year, you have been motivated at all by the success that Jannik Sinner has had?  Do you have a friendship, a rivalry, and do you inspire one another?
 LORENZO MUSETTI:   Yeah, of course Jannik, last year he made a fantastic season.  He grew a lot.
 After our match here in Rome, he also won his first ATP match here in Rome.  Then he started to beat records and records and to become one of the youngest guys on tour that is top 100.
 Yeah, of course we motivate each other.  Also here we push each other to be better and to play better and to be like more professional ever.
 But it's really humble guy, and he's really a hard worker, so I think he deserves everything that he did last year and also here.  Also today he had an amazing match with Dimitrov.
