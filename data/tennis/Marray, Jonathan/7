JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, obviously. Yeah, losing is not great. But when you have a few chances, few matchpoints, it's even worse really, isn't it? 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll remember that one for a while, actually, as well. Yeah, I mean, I got in the point, made a decent return. I was obviously trying to get into the net. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Can't remember. I'm trying to forget it already, I think. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, got to try and put it out of my mind. Probably played on my mind a little bit. But you try and wipe it out. Don't think it really affected me. He just played a little bit better towards the end, really. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, he's not bad. Bit disappointing. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I mean, at least I got myself in position at the end of the day. Yeah, I was just saying, you know, six months ago, if I'd be playing first round Wimbledon, taking someone of his caliber to five sets and stuff, I would have been happy about it. But, I mean, obviously, having the chances that I had today, yeah, I'm just gutted. Missed that forehand long. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: I'm not sure. Probably like 600 or something. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, Manchester, Nottingham. Then maybe I think Brazil or something, the States, some challengers. Take it from there. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, it kind of starts the Monday after the final here, so... Yeah, so only a week and a half away. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: I think it might be Nottingham first --maybe. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I mean... 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, probably had too much time. Don't know really. Just, I mean, I went for it. Maybe should have gone down the line. Easier to say now, isn't it? I just went for it and probably was a bit tentative with it and pushed it long, yeah. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, definitely. Very good year, yeah. Yeah, great six months. But, yeah, my game's come on quite a bit. Obviously, won a few matches like in Queen's and stuff. Should have really won my second-round match in Nottingham as well. But, yeah... 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Exactly. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I put myself in the positions, but am not exactly finishing them off at the minute. But I'm sure it will come - one day. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: No. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Well, I was in a doubles here, actually. So I was about still. But, yeah, I mean, I was actually around Wimbledon still. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Maybe Brazil. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah. Just play some challengers there, I think. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: I think - I think we worked out that I'll probably be in the US Open quallies, scrape in. Yeah, I'll go to Brazil, maybe play a few tournaments in the States before the quallies. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: First time out there playing in the US, and first time going to Brazil. I'm looking forward to it. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I mean... 

JONATHAN MARRAY: The courts here are pretty hard. They're saying they're not that quick, really. So I have good results on hard courts leading up to the summer, so I don't see why I can't put my game on and win some matches. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: No, the sun wasn't really that much of a problem. The wind from the start of the match today was difficult, obviously, for both of us. It was hard to get your rhythm on the serve. So I think I did make quite a few double-faults. Yeah, I mean, it was difficult conditions. But it's the same for both players, so I can't really blame anything there. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, little bit better. Could have been even better if I won today. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I've got enough to travel and stuff. I'm quite happy at the minute. Yeah, it's fine. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, I mean, some fella was trying to get a story out of me, a funny story out of me. But, I mean, it was just like in the junior tournaments, one tournament a year in the summer. Camped out once like. It wasn't as if I do it all the time (smiling). 

JONATHAN MARRAY: Yeah, well, I was in pretty early yesterday because I was supposed to be first on again. We were practicing indoors half an hour at about eleven. Then basically just got to sit around and wait all day. Just I was here all day really, like in the changing rooms. 

JONATHAN MARRAY: No. When I'm abroad, I usually read a lot. My family's here, and I had people to talk to. So stuff like that.
