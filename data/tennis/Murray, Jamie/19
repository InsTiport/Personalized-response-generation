MURRAY-SOARES/Cabal-Farah
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. Two wins out of two, you couldn't ask more for that.  How happy, confident and satisfied are you?
JAMIE MURRAY: Yeah, really happy to win.  Really happy to get through to the semifinals with a match still to go.  I think we played, you know, a really good match again tonight.  Was always going to be difficult against those guys because they always compete so well.
Previously when we played them, we've always felt like we've played well against them, but kind of struggled to, like, close out the matches against them.  Today we did a good job of that.  Had a couple of setbacks in the match.  But we fought back hard each time and didn't let it affect us too much.
Q. Given that you've got a match to spare going into the next one, is the idea that you take your foot off the gas, save some energy, or is it continue the momentum?  How do you approach that?
JAMIE MURRAY: No, I mean, we'll be trying to win.  I think important to kind of maintain the level of performance that we've had the first couple matches.  I think winning keeps the confidence going.
Yeah, that's our goal, yeah, just keep trying to win.
Q. On the assumption you're staying at home during this tournament, how important are the home comforts compared to most tournaments?
JAMIE MURRAY: Yeah, some nights I'm staying at home.  Yeah, it's nice.  It's nice to sleep in your own bed, be at home.  It's easier to kind of get away from the tennis, just like mentally more than anything.
I stayed at home last night.  Yeah, just be with family, as well, away from the tennis event.  Yeah, it's nice, relaxing.  Yeah, I prefer it that way.  Doesn't happen very often.
