KONTINEN-PEERS/Murray-Soares   
6-4, 6-3   
 Q.  How do you think the match went today?  
JAMIE MURRAY: Tough match.  I mean, I think we started well.  Was doing good on serve and then didn't really serve a great game at the end of the first set.   
Second set, again, we lost kind of rhythm with my serve.  We gave away breaks.  Didn't quite clean the net, either.  From that point, it was disappointing.   
When they served, served well, so there was a lot of first serves.  Wasn't kind of easy conditions playing that time of day, but, you know, I think for me it was obviously disappointing to finish that way, but, I mean, overall we had a great week, got four matches.  Back in the finals again was nice, and looking forward to Wimbledon.   
 Q.  Do you think going the distance here puts you in good stead for Wimbledon?  
JAMIE MURRAY: Well, yeah.  It's always nice to win matches and be in finals.  We came through some really close matches this week, so that will obviously stand us in good stead for that.   
 Q.  How's the body feeling?  All happy and healthy?  
JAMIE MURRAY: Yeah, yeah.  Good, yeah.  Knee's been holding up well, actually, since we got to grass.  Been really happy with that, and, yeah, I hope it keeps up.
