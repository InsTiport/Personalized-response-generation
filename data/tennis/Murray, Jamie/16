 Q.  Thoughts about the tournament.  
JAMIE MURRAY: Yeah, a great week for us in Sydney.  You know, perfect preparation to win a tournament going into the Australian Open, first Grand Slam of the year.   
Played a lot of good tennis this week.  Beat a lot of good teams.  Doubles draw was really strong, as it always is in Sydney.   
It's the third year in a row we played in the final here.  There's obviously something we like about the conditions.   
You know, really excited with how the week went, especially after a tough start in Doha for us.  To turn it around and play a lot of great tennis this week  bodes well for next week.
