THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   So after last night you're feeling great?   You played pretty well for most of the match today.   
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, I mean, we played a good match.   We didn't lose serve.   So, you know, we did a lot of good things.   We just obviously didn't quite get it done at the end.   
But, yeah, overall it was a great week for us.   Yeah, I don't think we could have done much more today, but, yeah, just the way it goes.   Couple points here or there.   Both tiebreaks got away from us kind of at the start and we weren't really able to get it back.  
But, you know, it was a good week for us, great week for us, and we go to Eastbourne next week.   All money in the bag for Wimbledon.  
   
 Q.   The conditions were quite different to yesterday?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Well, I mean, it was obviously cooler and stuff, but, you know, we played late in the evening, anyway.   So, I mean, it wasn't massively different.   
But, yeah, the sun wasn't out, but it didn't really make a difference.  
   
 Q.   The atmosphere, the crowd were quite subdued for long periods.   
JAMIE MURRAY:   Don't know.   I wasn't concentrating on what they were doing.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to Wimbledon, the way you've been trending over the last few weeks, you have won a title this year, you've done well on grass.   Do you feel quite good looking forward?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, it was a bit of a rough start of the year for us.   We went to Australia, and once we started playing matches, you know, I was in a lot of pain.  
Then after Australia I took a month off, and John was off trying to play with other guys.   When I did come back, we were a bit kind of slow‑‑ well, I was, anyway ‑‑ to kind of get it going again.  
But once we started in the clay season, you know, we were winning a lot of matches every week.   We won in Munich.   Bucharest we lost the semis.   We had match points.   Lost a tough match in Madrid, and then DÃ¼sseldorf we won matches well.   French Open we won matches.  
Each week we were getting out there, competing hard, and, you know, we know that our level is a tough level to beat.   Hopefully that will continue for the rest of the season.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how you combine as a unit?   I you seem to gel very well on and off the court.   
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, it's been great.   I mean, since the first tournament we played in Montpellier, which seems like a long time ago now, well, from my point of view, I mean, from the first match I really felt like this guy's going to be a great partner for me.   
Here we are like 15, 16 months later and things have been going really well for us.   We got good guidance from our coach Louis who has helped us a lot.   And, you know, we keep working hard, keep trying to improve, and, you know, good things will happen for us.  
   
 Q.   John, how is it for you?   
JOHN PEERS:   Yeah, the biggest thing for us is we both combine really well.   We both bring different things to the table.   It actually throws a lot of other guys and other teams off.   
We are not always winning the points in the same way.   That's a great asset for us.   And also getting on well off the court is a huge thing because we spend so much time with each other it's almost like an old married couple that see each other day in and day out.   (Laughter.)  
We do well.   We combine well.   We bring different things to the table, and we are actually good friends which helps as well.   So it's good.   
   
 Q.   Would you describe it as an equal partnership, or because Jamie is a bit older, been around a bit more, do you leave more of the bigger decisions to him?  
JOHN PEERS:   It sort of depends on the feel of the match and the flow of the match.   Sometimes one of us will see one thing one way and definitely need to do that, or sometimes, no, you need another opinion coming in.   
So I think the biggest thing in is it ebbs and flows as the match goes on.   Once one guy sees something, you have to trust the other guy he's seeing the right thing and you go with it.   That's the biggest thing about a good partnership.   
   
 Q.   How open do you feel the Wimbledon doubles is?   You have beaten the Bryans this week.   They have been invincible in recent weeks and months.   How do you see that?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Normally in Wimbledon, of all the Grand Slams, it's kind of been the top doubles teams that are doing well there.   Obviously it's over five sets, so the best team will always win.   It's not kind of like it is week in and week out on the tour and things like that.  
I think we will be seeded.   I think after this week we will manage to do that, which is nice for us, obviously nice you don't have to play the top guys first match out.  
For us, we think we can do really well there.   I don't see why we wouldn't regardless of the surface.   You know, we know that every match we can lose, but we can equally win, as well.  
I think, like I said before, we put our level on the court.   It's a tough level to beat.   We will keep working harder to make that level higher and higher.  
   
 Q.   After you split up with Eric in 2007, you've had 43 different doubles partners.   Can you tell us how much less stress you feel now that you're playing with John?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, it's helped my game, you know, exponentially.   You know, we are training together all the time.   Each week we're stepping on court we know what the other guy is going to do.   Our partnership's strong.   
You know, that continuity, that direction, you know, that brings confidence and calmness.   I'm not pitching up every week and looking to the side of me to see who I'm playing with and waiting to see what they're going to do on the court, and, you know, you're kind of winging it in a way and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  
You know, this has been by far the best partnership I have had in my career, and I hope it continues for a long time.  
   
 Q.   Had you continued playing with so many different doubles partners, do you think you would have become disillusioned?   
JAMIE MURRAY:   It's possible.   I mean, after the Australian Open last year, yeah, I mean, I had to come back to Britain and kind of didn't know what was going to happen.   I didn't really want to kind of keep going down the road I was going down for the previous two years, because I wasn't really doing great things.   
I wasn't enjoying it either.   I couldn't really see things getting better for me the way that it was going.  
So, you know, when John agreed to come over and play the tournaments in Europe after Australia, for me it was a big opportunity to try to make some work and, you know, thankfully we kind of stuck it out and, you know, now we're getting the rewards for that.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of the names on the back of the shirts in this tournament?   Is that a good move for doubles?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, I think any promotion for the doubles guys is good.   You know, it's not always the case that the doubles guys get promoted particularly well on our tour, I don't think.  
I think we bring a lot to the tour.   I think that nowadays singles guys are playing as much doubles as the doubles players.   They are playing every week, as well.   
The level is very high.   The money is good.   You know, contrary to other comments it is not just a bunch of crap players getting a lucky break with their career and whatnot.  
You know, I know how hard we work each week to, you know, do the best we can whether that's in training week or out in a tournament.   I see how hard the other guys, especially guys that we played today, how hard everyone else is working to try to be the top.   
No one is just kind of coasting by and making a decent living.   It's not like that at all.   I think we deserve a bit more credit than maybe we get.   
   
 Q.   The Bryans have been great for doubles, obviously, but do you think their dominance is maybe coming to an end now and that's a boost for the rest of you in doubles?  
JAMIE MURRAY:   I don't know.   I mean, I think they won three slams last year.   
   
 Q.   Not four.  
JAMIE MURRAY:   Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's going ‑‑well, yeah.   I would take three.   (Laughter.) I mean, they're great for the sport, though, especially when, you know, tournaments wanted to get rid of doubles altogether a few years ago and they made sure that didn't happen.   
You know, they, for us, you know, they bring so much to the sport, and, you know, a lot of us guys look up to them and what they are doing.   You know, they are great self‑promoters.   You know, hopefully, you know, off the back of that, some of us can get a bit more exposure.   
And as I said before, I think the tour should be doing more to, you know, push us forward a bit.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to play mixed doubles?   
JAMIE MURRAY:   I'm going to play with Casey Dellacqua.   
   
 Q.   Bally, she was obviously someone you knew going back a long, long way.   I wonder what your earliest memories of her were.   
JAMIE MURRAY:   That's a good question, actually.   I mean, she was three years older than me.   And also, she was in Glasgow, whereas I did most of my tennis at Stirling.   Well, actually she was in Perth.   
I probably remember kind of either going to Perth where she was getting trained by Jimmy McKechnie, I think.   Then obviously she moved away down to London.   So kind of those teenage years didn't really spend that much time.  
But once you start to play professional and play more regular on the main tour, you see a lot more of her.   
Yeah, probably my first meeting or recollection would be kind of playing at Perth Tennis Club, about eight, nine years old.   She was older than me.
