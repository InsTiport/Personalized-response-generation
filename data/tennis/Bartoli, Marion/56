  D. CIBULKOVA/M. Bartoli  
4-6, 6-4, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Why was Court 1 inferior to you in comparison to Centre Court?   
 MARION BARTOLI: Do you think it's fair to change a semifinal when you played already one set on it and it goes to another court? I asking you the question. Do you think it's fair?   
  
  Q. Did it play differently?   
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, can you answer my question? Do you think it's fair?   
  
  Q. Not really for me to say.   
 MARION BARTOLI: Exactly, that's not fair. We play on Court 1. For me, that's not fair. They have only two matches to play. It was not like the first rounds or something, so...   
  
  Q. Do you think it had to do with the rain window? They felt there was only a two-hour rain window today.   
 MARION BARTOLI: Yeah, but why they don't send the other one on the Banque Nationale court? They haven't start the match. They can send the people with the night tickets to see this match and the one who has the day session tickets to see our match on Centre Court. The other one didn't start.   
  
  Q. Why do you think you were treated in a second-class way?   
 MARION BARTOLI: Because I guess I was not the priority number one to be on Centre Court.   
  
  Q. What did you do during the rain delay?  
 MARION BARTOLI: I slept, as I was so tired. I slept for an hour. And they told us to be ready at 9:00 to play. We start at 3:00, and be ready at 9:00 to start again on the other court.   
 So just warm up and go back on court is the only thing I could do.
