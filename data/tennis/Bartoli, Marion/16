  6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese, please.   
   
 Q.   I want to ask, you are almost to be eligible for the WTA Final, but eventually Li Na is eligible to participate in WTA finals.   Can you make comments on this, on Li Na's performance?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Yeah, well, first of all, Li Na had a very strong season.   She really deserve to go to the WTA Championship in Istanbul.   I will still go there as an alternate.   
It's still a huge achievement for me to finish inside the top 10.   Obviously I'm not really disappointed.   You know, she played really well in Montreal, in Cincinnati, and obviously here, the China Open.   She really deserved to qualify.   
   
 Q.   In Miami this year, you handed Azarenka her first loss.   What kind of adjustment do you think Azarenka has made to win this victory today?   
MARION BARTOLI:   I don't really know.   I think in Miami I played probably one of the best matches I could have ever played, and maybe Vika was a bit fatigued and a bit tired, but you will have probably more to ask her about that.  
But, you know, even today if I lost in two sets, I really felt the first set was really close and it could have gone either way.  
But obviously she's really playing extremely well.   She was definitely better than me today.  
But I think every match is different.   So you can't really compare a match that happened in March or April and the one that happened in October.   
   
 Q.   You have already entered the quarterfinal in China Open.   Are you satisfied with your performance in China Open for the past two years?   
MARION BARTOLI:   Yes, yes, I'm very pleased and happy to be back in the semifinal here.   I had really a good tournament this year.   I felt I really played some good matches.   And even though today if I lost, I think it was still a great match.  
It was great obviously to spend my birthday here in Beijing, and I received a lot of presents from all my fans.   It was really nice.  
They sang Happy Birthday after my match when I played on my birthday, so, yeah, I think it was really cute.   Obviously now I'm flying back home.   I will spend my birthday with my family.   I will open all my presents and everything.   I'm looking forward to that.   I had really a nice week here.   
   
 Q.   I think in the second set you didn't hold any service game, and especially when you were 40‑0, 40‑15, you don't have break from Azarenka.   What happened?  
MARION BARTOLI:   You know, Vika is probably the best returner in the game.   And it's not like I was serving badly at this time.   It was just her returning so well.   I couldn't win the points.  
So even though if I was hitting 40‑0, 40‑15, she was breaking me because she was returning so well I couldn't win the points.   It was not really me getting broke; it was her returning amazing.   Obviously that happens.   Maybe she could have missed one or two.   She didn't.   That's the way it is.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about, is it possible for you to play Fed Cup tomorrow for France?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Tomorrow?   
   
 Q.   I'm so sorry.   Next year, I'm so sorry.   Is it possible for you to play Fed Cup next year for France?   Because AmÃ©lie was appointed as the new captain.   Is there any new talk between you and the French Tennis Federation?  
MARION BARTOLI:   We have been talking to each other during the US Open with AmÃ©lie, and I think she haven't take her decision yet.  
I can't really answer to you right now, because obviously it's her decision.   I think she didn't took it yet.     So maybe it will happen a bit later in the year.  
   
 Q.   Are you thinking about this?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Am I thinking about the Fed Cup?   Yes, of course.   I'm thinking about my country, so that's why we had this meeting.   Obviously the decision belong to the captain, and she haven't taken yet.   So we will see later.  
   
 Q.   There are a few points you got tonight that were on calls that were overturned.   Did you feel like there was a problem tonight with having to challenge calls?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Well, I think we played fairly fast, and obviously it's definitely very tough for the linemen to call.   I think the ball was traveling extremely fast in the air.  
Sometimes it's a matter of millimeters here and there, so there is nothing you can blame the linemen for, and just great to have the challenge system on.  
   
 Q.   I understand that you're also a painter.   Have you had any chances in Beijing to do any painting?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Well, it was tough because I was very busy on the court obviously.   The junction between Tokyo and here has been pretty rough, as well.   
But I do love painting, and that's something I really like to do when I'm off the court.   For example, during Grand Slam when I have a day off between each matches, it's really much more time for me to do that.   For example, in NewYork I had the pleasure to do it, but obviously that's really something I like to do to take my stresses away to think about something other than just playing tennis.   That's my way of relaxing.   
   
 Q.   It looks like you're going to play your next tournament at Moscow.   So are you still going to try to make more points so you can be ahead of Sam Stosur on the alternate position for the Championships so in case someone pulls out of the Championships you can get in in the last minute?  
MARION BARTOLI:   Well, yes, that's definitely one of the reasons I'm playing Moscow.   
Also, the other reason is I always felt it was great for me to play indoor.   So it's really some tournament where I had success in the past, so I think it was great for me to have one extra tournament at the end of the year, trying to get more points for next year, as well.   
But obviously now with my ranking and the position I am in right now, yes, I think it was a good decision to take.   If maybe I can do well and Sam is not doing that well, I will have a chance to jump 9.   But whatever, even finishing inside the top 10 is really an achievement for me this year.   I think it's a great building for next year.   
   
 Q.   I have heard that you are a big fan of 007.   So Skyfall, are you planning to watch it?  
MARION BARTOLI:   That's funny.   Yes, when I will have the chance to not play tennis at the end of the season I will definitely go and watch.   
It was obviously very nice and special for me to meet Pierce Brosnan in person and to receive some flowers from him and get a personal note.   That's definitely something that's not happening every day in your life.   
So I had that pleasure in 2007 to meet him, and that was even more special because I played the Wimbledon final 7th of July in 2007, so it was a lot of 07 into that date.   
Obviously I really like those kind of movies, and I will definitely go.
