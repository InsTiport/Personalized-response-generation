   THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 

 Q.  So you lost to her last week and then you came out and had a really good first set, how important is that to you? 
 MARION BARTOLI:  Yeah, think it was really important for me to play against her last week.  She's in great shape, obviously.  She has won lot of matches in singles and doubles.  And so she was coming here with lot of confidence. 
 And you know, I came this time with a really good plan on court to attack her to make her move and to serve her better than I served her last week. 
 And I think it worked pretty well in the first set, and even in the beginning of the second.  And then, unfortunately for her, she retired.  But on my side, I think I played really good the first set.
