 P. KVITOVA/M. Bartoli
  6‑1, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   You were saying that against her you should take initiatives and be aggressive, but apparently it didn't work out.   
MARION BARTOLI:   I believe today her performance was extraordinary.   When she plays like this, it is almost impossible to play against her.   I had break opportunities, and every time she served an ace.   
I don't believe I totally missed my match.   She was just too good to give me any chances.  
   
 Q.   When she plays at that level, could you compare her game to Serena's or Sharapova's?  
MARION BARTOLI:   She does winners extremely fast.   Against Serena I won once and I lost once, but I never had this impression in the rallies that I couldn't do anything.  
Today, against her, I was under the impression I just couldn't play.   I believe she is able to play a winner from anywhere on the court and whatever the ball you send her.   In fact, she takes away from you the control of the match.  
I never felt like this against Serena or Sharapova.   For example, when I was serving well, she returned a missile.   I had absolutely no control.  
   
 Q.   You were saying after SanDiego you were on a good roll.   Is this going to stop you, or will you be able to forget?  
MARION BARTOLI:   You always need to draw the lessons from a loss.   I believe I need to see what I did wrong so that I can improve and do better next time.   
But globally I am now playing with a better basis, and if I keep the same attitude during practice, I believe I will be able to make more progress.
