THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How was that match?   It was pretty crazy.   You had your ankle and then you came back and almost lost the lead in the third set.   Sum it up, please.   
MARION BARTOLI:   Well, I felt this match was very tough from the beginning.   Obviously I lost almost the same kind of matches last year on the same court.   
I think it was really a good job for me, especially mentally, to really hang on and be able to stay strong towards the end.  
Yes, my ankle was hurting me at the beginning of third set, but I was really able to focus and went throughout pain.   I'm just really pleased with the way I felt on the court and the way I was able to pull that one out.  
   
 Q.   How is your ankle?   Do you know?   
MARION BARTOLI:   Well, we'll see a bit more when it gets cold tonight and tomorrow obviously.   I did all the treatment already.   I sit a lot, so it's going to be a lot of rest and rehab, but hopefully I will be able to play my match as close as possible from 100%.   
   
 Q.   So there has been a lot talk recently about your coaching situation.   You're with your father here.   Talk about your relationship with him and how he helps your tennis.   
MARION BARTOLI:   Yeah, my dad is with me here this week.   AmÃ©lie is there as well.   It's kind of following from the Fed Cup because I had her on the bench in the Fed Cup and I had my dad in the stands.   It reminds me some good vibes.   
Obviously I'm still looking for a third person to still kind of join my dad and myself relationship.   It's going to come just with time.   I'm not really rushing anything.   I just have to find the right person.   
I feel I'm improving, and I'm really happy outside of the court and this is the most important thing.
