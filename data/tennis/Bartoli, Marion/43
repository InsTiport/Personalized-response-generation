M. BARTOLI/S. Peng
  6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What's stronger, the coffee or your performance?
 MARION BARTOLI: It's a decaf, so I'm not sure it's going to be very strong.
 Well, yeah, I thought I played well. I could have finished earlier. I mean, it could have been 6-1 in the second instead of 6-2, even 6-Love, but I think overall it was a great performance, definitely.
 Yesterday I played slightly better, but today was still very strong.

 Q. Shahar yesterday said you played so well yesterday that if you played like that all the time, you'd be the No. 1 in the world. Is she right? Is she crazy? You tell me. 
 MARION BARTOLI: She's my best friend, so I'm definitely not going to tell you she is crazy. It's very nice for her to say that, but yes, definitely, if I would have played all the time like yesterday, yeah, I probably would have been top 3 in the world at least.
 But, you know, tennis, it's the fickle sport, so I'm glad I have been able to play two matches in a row very well. So I'm going to try to keep it up this way for a semifinal.
