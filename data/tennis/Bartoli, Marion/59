  B. MATTEK/M. Bartoli
6-4, 6-1

 Q. You seem to be having trouble with your shoulder. Is it injured, and how long has it been troubling you?
 MARION BARTOLI: Yeah, well, today I had a stiff shoulder. I don't know why. But I couldn't serve for sure at the pace I normally serve, so of course I know it was difficult for me to win the match, and especially on grass. But it's happening.

 Q. Did it just start in the match, or had it been troubling you before?
 MARION BARTOLI: Yeah, I don't know if it's the weather or the conditions or something. But yeah, when I wake up this morning, my shoulder was really hurting me. 

 Q. How far did you expect to get this tournament? 
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, I never set myself goals in terms of results, I qualify or semifinal or whatever. I just wanted to play some great tennis, which I was able to do the first two rounds, but today was just not a good day for me.
