M. BARTOLI/K. Clijsters
  3-6, 3-1 (ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. Just wondering at what point in the match you became aware that Kim was having problems with her shoulder?
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, pretty much from the warmup, to be honest with you. I played against her before, and I knew she was not serving it the way she was serving against me in our previous meetings.
 But it was very hard honestly to focus on my own game. I could see she was struggling, and on my side I was struggling even more. I really tried to regroup at the beginning of the second set and tried to focus on my own game before looking at the other side of the net.

 Q. Could you tell particular shots that she was having trouble with? Did you focus on that?
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, I think it was obvious on the serve. After that, maybe on the high forehands. It was already hard for me to just put the ball inside the court, so it was not even, I think, a part of your tactics, but there is some days when it is like this.
 It's tough, but you have still to find a way to try to put a good performance.

 Q. Jack Kramer, very famous player in the past, said when you have an opponent who is injured, beat their brains out and take them to lunch.
 MARION BARTOLI: All right. (Laughter.)
 Well, I think it's 3:30 right now, so it's not even lunchtime anymore.
 No, well, definitely be happy to take Kim to dinner, and even Jada, but I'm not sure she would like to have dinner with me tonight. (Laughter.)
 She will probably want to have a rest and have some time off.
