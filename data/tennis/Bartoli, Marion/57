  M. BARTOLI/A. Sugiyama  
6-2, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. How serious is the injury?  
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, you know, I was cramping on my calf, so my ankle twist because just my calf didn't respond the right way. They told me I had a little bruise, but it was not that bad.   
 But, you know, it's hard to assess an ankle on the same day as when you twist it because it's more reacting during the night. Obviously I'm going to see tomorrow how it goes.   
 But, you know, I'm quite flexible in my ligaments, so I have the same in the past and usually it's not that bad. I will try definitely my best to be able to be ready tomorrow and play that semifinal.   
  
  Q. Is it tough to play someone like Cibulkova in that condition if you have to run a lot?  
 MARION BARTOLI: Well, if I hit hard the ball, it's gonna be difficult for her to make me run (smiling).   
 I'm going to try to play the same way as today. She's similar to Ai in the way they are quite small and they are speedy on the court. But, you know, I'm going to try to attack her return of serve and be able to take the control of the game and just be more aggressive than maybe Jelena has been able to do today.   
 But obviously it's going to be a tough match.
