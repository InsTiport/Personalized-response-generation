Q. You were on the defensive almost from the start?

JAKOB HLASEK: Yeah. Yeah, I was. I started to serve and I was a break down, so, obviously, I could never lead, even though -- I think in the second set I led once, no? I don't know. But --


Q. 2-1?

JAKOB HLASEK: 2-1, right. That is the big lead, right, isn't it? Yeah, you know, it is just -- I guess I had -- I would -- I wouldn't say a bad start, I didn't miss too many points -- two, three goods points at the beginning, and then in a way I never got back, but I felt like my return let me down today a little bit. I couldn't put any pressure on his serve, only maybe last two, three games I changed something and that worked a little bit better. But I think that was the biggest difference. I couldn't return his serve.


Q. Did you have higher expectations today because he was tired from yesterday and angry about the schedule? Did you figure this would be a good time to catch him?

JAKOB HLASEK: Well, I don't know. I know Boris quite well and it seems to me always when he is tired he plays better. Because he knows that he cannot play long points. He has to go for two, three quick shots. I think that is where he is the most dangerous where he plays only two, three quick shots. I wished the rallies would have been longer, of course, but he recovered well and he was on top today.


Q. How close do you think he is to his game? What is your assessment of his game, if you think --

JAKOB HLASEK: I don't know, I mean, I didn't watch much yesterday, but I saw him playing from the back and I was hoping he is going to do that against me today, but obviously he didn't, so I don't know. But I just won't comment on this match today. He played better than me, and I just couldn't stay with him, especially when he was serving.


Q. Thank you.
