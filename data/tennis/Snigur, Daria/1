THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

DARIA SNIGUR: I can't believe it.  It was my dream.  It's very good for me.  I worked hard every day for this trophy.  It's incredible.   
 Q.  You said you were feeling pressure through the week.  Now that you've won, is it gone?  
DARIA SNIGUR: Yes, yes.  I am tired now.  I can relax.   
 Q.  What did you feel like when you walked out on to the court?  You mentioned yesterday about not liking a lot of people.  There were certainly a lot of people there.  Did that affect you?

DARIA SNIGUR: Yes.   
 Q.  How did you feel you dealt with that?  
DARIA SNIGUR: I know her game because we played in Roehampton final.  Is very hard game for me because I don't like when she play all time slices.   
But I must to play because it's finals Wimbledon.  I don't have any choice in that.   
 Q.  What did you try to do?  Seemed like you tried to be more consistent.

 Q.  What do you think about Elina Svitolina and Yastremska as well?  Why so many great players coming from Ukraine?  Marta Kostyuk as well.  
DARIA SNIGUR: I don't like Elina's tennis because Elina I think play maybe slices, maybe volleys.  I don't know.  I love Dayana's tennis.  Push all the balls.  It's very good, I think.
