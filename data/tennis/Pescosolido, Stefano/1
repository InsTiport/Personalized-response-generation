 Q. Stefano, I thought you had opportunities in the third and the fourth sets. What
happened? What was the difference in the match, basically?
 
 STEFANO PESCOSOLIDO: I had a chance in the third set 2-1, 3-1, I was up front. If he
could go up front on that one, he thinks he had a chance in the fourth set; he became too
tired, and he lost confidence for winning. 
 
Q. Stefano, a lot of people have talked about Chang's better serve, and he is using
this longer racket and so forth. I know you haven't played him in quite a while. Can you
tell a difference? Was his serve troublesome?
 
 STEFANO PESCOSOLIDO: He played four years ago with him and since then he sees that his
service has improved; especially he is doing more aces and on the right side he finds that
it is more deep on his service. So he definitely found a difference on his service. 
 
Q. Do you think he can win this tournament?
 
 STEFANO PESCOSOLIDO: He is one of the favorites, but believes that either Sampras and
Agassi have something more than he has. But he is definitely up there as being possible. 
 
Q. Do you feel like you lost a chance today?
 
 STEFANO PESCOSOLIDO: I know that three sets in five with Michael would have been real
tough. Michael is a great fighter. He could have a chance, but once he reach that point,
Michael was physically stronger. 
 
Q. Do you have a feeling about when you lost the first serve -- in the beginning of the
second set you start to lose a lot of first serves -- the reason that the match was
changing was that you lost the first serve --
Q. Second set.
 
 STEFANO PESCOSOLIDO: I don't know what the percentage is, but he knows that he didn't
serve his best and to win the match today his service would have been the most important
part. During the match.
