Q.  A couple of unusually unfortunate serves towards the end of the second set.  Something wrong with your racquet?

AMANDA COETZER:  Something with my racquet?  No.  I mean, I never felt very settled the whole match.  I think it's just often my serve goes off a little.  It's an indication of just a bit of a mental lapse that I had.  I felt very unsettled, just right from the start.  I settled down a little bit in the second set when she was making a lot of errors.  It was just a tough match to play.
