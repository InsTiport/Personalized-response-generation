 Q. You played her a few times. She obviously hometown-- not hometown but countryman.
Did you feel that at all? 
 
 AMANDA COETZER: Yeah, I felt that. We played a lot in the juniors and I haven't really
played her for a long time and I think it was a close match; not like the score indicates,
but you know, we had very close games, all the game went to deuce, ad, deuce, ad, and I
just felt like I played the important points; I played them better than she did.  
 
Q. Windy? 
 
 AMANDA COETZER: Yeah, it was a little bit swirly. She served well, but it wasn't too
difficult. It is a nice court out there. It is quiet. So it was fine.
