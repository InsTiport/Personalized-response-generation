THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  You played her 16 times.  Is that as good as she's played against you?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, I think it's really one of the rare ones where there was no match at all.  I mean, I was just, yeah, off, and she was all over me.  I mean, yeah, I don't know really what happened to me.  She just took advantage and didn't let it go.  
 
Q.  Did you feel good before the match?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  I was pretty relaxed in the warmup.  I felt the ball pretty good.  But once I went on center court, I mean, I was normal nervous, not too much.  But I just had -- I just lost my attention a bit.  Off the long wait, I don't know.  Also in the warmup, I don't know if you saw, I just kept serving in the net, which indicates that I have no tension, there's no tension.  So, yeah, I could really never feel comfortable.  I had the feeling when I rally with her, I was getting tired and pushed back too much, just too much power.  Yeah, if I take them early, I was too risky, I mean, I was missing.  
 
Q.  Can Amélie go all the way now, do you think?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  It's a tough one.  Anybody can go.  Definitely she has the game for it.  Many years, she's always far in the Slams, but she never really made it.  It's going to be mentally very tough for her.  But she has the game, yeah, the abilities for it.
