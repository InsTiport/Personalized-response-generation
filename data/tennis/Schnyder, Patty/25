MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  How do you feel now?  You have adapted to grass?  Seemed like quite an easy match. 

PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, I feel more and more comfortable on grass.  I think I played a very good match.  I served really much better than in the first round.  Yeah, I'm happy now. 

Q.  I think now you're facing Lindsay Davenport.  Can you tell us, have you ever met her, played against her?

PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, I played her a couple of times.  But I think the last meeting is a long time ago.  I just, yeah, tried to play my game, like make her play, make her, you know, make the winners, just try to do my best.

Q.  If you were to be programmed on Centre Court, would that be daunting, frightening?

PATTY SCHNYDER:  No.  But I love to play on Centre Court.  It's the one missing here.  I have a lot of Grand Slams.  I would be looking forward to play on Centre Court or Court 1. 

Q.  John McEnroe suggested today that part of the reason that Lindsay Davenport won was because Alicia Molik's skirt and top were so tight that they stopped her moving around the court.  Do you think that's a danger with some women's outfits?

PATTY SCHNYDER:  No.  I mean, it's a stupid question for me.  I don't think so.
