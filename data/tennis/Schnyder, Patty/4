  Q.  I'd just like to know how many times you've played on Centre Court.   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  This was my first time.   
  
  Q.  We've had so many rain delays.  What do you do during the rain delays and how frustrating is that?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, I don't know.  I just listen to music and talk with my team, some players maybe, hang out in the locker room.  But I was lucky, especially that Saturday, I knew I was not on the schedule, so I was really relaxed, I had no nerves going.  But in the beginning of the week, yeah, my first round match I had to wait like eight hours to finish it, and it was tough.   
  
  Q.  What do you do, you listen to music, you sit there, you talk?  Do you read, play cards?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Not this time.  Sometimes we do, but not this time.  There's not much you can do.  They always keep your time like half-hour wise, they push it further in the day, so it's not like you know you're going to have three hours.   
  
  Q.  Does it feel worse here than other tournaments, or is it pretty much the same?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  It's the same.  Rain is always pretty annoying.
