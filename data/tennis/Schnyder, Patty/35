 Q. Were you happy with your play? 
 
 PATTY SCHNYDER: No, not really. I didn't feel that comfortable on court. It was --
yeah, you could see that. I missed a few really easy shots, played in the wrong corner, so
-- but I think, yeah, it is tough to play the first match like favorite and you know you
have to win or you expect yourself to win, so it is good that I could do it. 
 
Q. Was it weather or first-day jitters?
 
 PATTY SCHNYDER: My game, I was not that happy. The timing, sometimes I was running kind
of strange and, yeah, the wind was not really helpful, but, yeah, we both had it.
