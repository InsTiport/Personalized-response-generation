THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Never really happened for you, did it?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  No, that's not true.  In the beginning I had some good chances to hold my serve and to break her.  But after that, I started feeling pretty well from the baseline.  Also, she hit so hard and I don't like that especially.  I think at the end, too, I mean, she knew that there were a couple of really important points and, you know, she just kept the ball in play and didn't miss them.  So I had my chances.  
 
Q.  Not too unhappy then with the performance overall?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  No, it's okay.  I mean, with my serve I am not too happy, especially at the beginning and the end.  But I thought it was okay.  Previous rounds, I am happy with the tournament.  
 
Q.  Is this the furthest you've come at Wimbledon, isn't it?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yes. 
 
Q.  I suppose you can take that home and be reasonably  pleased?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, of course.  
 
Q.  How about Lindsay?  Do you see her as a potential champion? 
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, I think she plays really well.  The grass is, I think, one of her favourite courts.  And, you know, if she can keep playing so well in the important points, I think she can go very, very far.  
 
Q.  Did you notice any weaknesses in her game today?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  I mean, her movement.  I mean, she doesn't move too good.  It's so hard to make her run.  She hits a really good serve, high percentage of the first one, good returns.  It's really hard to make her move.  
 
Q.  Will you stick around London now?  Have you got doubles?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  No.  No more tennis here, but probably one day or so.  
 
Q.  Maybe see a bit of London perhaps?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  What would you like to see? 
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  No, I've been here before, so I know a couple of things.  Probably go to a musical. 
 
Q.  A musical?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Anything in mind, what's going on at the moment?
 
PATTY SCHNYDER:  No, no.  I have to think about it.
