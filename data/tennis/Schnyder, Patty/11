  Q.  What is the reason for your withdrawal?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Right ankle, impingement, they said.   
  Q.  An impingement?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, the capsule is just irritated.   
  Q.  In your knee?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Ankle, right ankle.   
  Q.  Which ankle is it?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  The right one.   
  Q.  How long has this been bothering you?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  I made a bad step during the match yesterday and I had pain already to finish it, but it aggravated during the night.  This morning it was -- I cannot really run without pain.   
  Q.  What's the prognosis?  How long do they expect you to be out?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  No, it's not too bad.  The Achilles' is fine.  It's going to be four, five days, they hope, and with good rest and treatment here they think it's going to be all right.   
  Q.  How disappointing for you?   
 PATTY SCHNYDER:  Yeah, it's kind of, I mean -- other tournaments are even more important to me personally because I, in the past, have never played really good here.   
 But when I look at the draw and I see how big this event is, I, yeah, am a little bit frustrated.
