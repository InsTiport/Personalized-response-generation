   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  So where does beating Martina here on center court, where does that rank in your career?  Is that your biggest win, would you say or no? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I mean, yeah. 

 Q.  You made it to Wimbledon? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I beat top players also last year.  And Martina is one of the best, of course, and I'm very happy.  And before the match, you know, I didn't believe I can beat her, because she's the favorite, of course.  And a few years ago she was my favorite player. 

 Q.  Oh, yeah? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah.  I love her matches against Steffi Graff.  That was amazing.  And now I was playing with her.  It was good.  You know, a really good thing. 

 Q.  What did you like about her?  Why was she your favorite player? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  She was very young.  She won a few tournaments for Grand Slams.  She was very young.  Youngest player.  And I like her tennis. 

 Q.  Where do you train actually? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  With my coach? 

 Q.  Where do you train? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  In Poland with my dad. 

 Q.  Are there a lot of tennis players in Poland? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No, not really.  I'm the first in Poland. 

 Q.  Domascowska, is she still playing? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah.  But she lost many points and now she's like 160. 

 Q.  So do you have a Fed Cup team? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I'm playing with my sister. 

 Q.  Yeah, that should be a pretty good team. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  We won last year, and now we are in first group, so we'll see. 

 Q.  What's her name? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Urszula; she's 300th. 

 Q.  But younger, one year behind you?  She's one year younger than you? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  So could you forget that it was Martina across the net?  Did you have to pretend she was not your childhood hero? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I had nothing to lose.  So I just play, and my best, and I did it. 

 Q.  Was your father here? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  So he was the one who came to the bench? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, he's my coach.  He was on the court, yeah. 

 Q.  Was he a player, too?  What's his background? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, he played.  I mean just the leagues in Germany, because I lived in Germany like six years.  I start there.  And not like ATP player, but he played. 

 Q.  When he came to the bench, did he give you an important piece of information? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I don't understand? 

 Q.  When he came to the bench as a coach and he talked to you, did he tell you something important? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, of course.  It's like much better, if he can say something important and I can use this on the court.  Because Martina was playing very well.  I had to do like 100% my tennis.  It was good. 

 Q.  So it was a motivational comment from him? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, of course.  I looked first at him.  He said I'm playing very well, and I have to do the same.  I should do the same and I can beat her. 
 But I didn't believe like 100%.  But I do my best, and I tried everything. 

 Q.  It says in the book, I think, that you're still in high school.  Are you still in school? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, this is my last year.  And in May I have five exams to finish.  It's going to be very tough.  Because it is very difficult and important in Poland.  So it's one month I'm not playing tournaments in may. 

 Q.  Studying? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I have to. 

 Q.  Can you be done for the French?  Finished with your exams? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I don't know.  Because it's difficult.  Now I have books here, but it's difficult to learn here before the match or after. 

 Q.  So you have your books here with you? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, yeah.  Just sometimes a few times. 

 Q.  Do you have a favorite Grand Slam? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Wimbledon, yeah.  I had my first success there.  I won Wimbledon Junior.  I won two years ago, and then I was in the fourth round.  And I think that is my best Grand Slam. 

 Q.  You also said you have a pet mouse?

 Q.  Flippy and floppy? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Why would you call two rats Flippy and Floppy? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Because in Poland, it's like one movie, and Flippy and Floppy were like two brothers.  It was movies, so that's why we call them Flippy and Floppy.
