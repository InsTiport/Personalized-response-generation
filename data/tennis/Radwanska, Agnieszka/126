A. RADWANSKA/E. Bouchard
  7‑6, 6‑2

Q. It was a tough first round opponent, and an even tougher first set for you.
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   You were able to pull it out in the tiebreak.   What was the difference in the tiebreak?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, well, of course very tough first round, especially for the tournament on the clay.
Well, of course I didn't use my first chance when I was 5‑3 up.   But, you know, she was really playing and hitting the ball unbelievable.
But of course I think the tiebreak was the biggest key in that match.   I did a couple good shots in the tiebreak and managed to win that.
I think that gave me more confidence in the second set and it was a little bit easier. 

Q.   How much did it help with your confidence being able to close it out in the tiebreak?   You really seemed to cruise through the second set quite well. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I think in that match, you know, every point matters.   The games were really tight and maybe ‑ of course the serve was important, but still had a chance to break.
Just I think the first set is always very important, especially in that kind of matches.   So that's when I was really doing everything to win that first set.
