A. RADWANSKA/N. Li
  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Almost like the win by a thousand cuts, all those match points?   How did you feel out there? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, it was kind of like a dÃ©jÃ  vu from Auckland final.   I had alsoI think seven, eight match point before I with this final, so very similar situation, yeah. 

Q.   You were quite aggressive on occasions out there, a bit of volleying.   Must be pretty happy with your game. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, actually for sure the nerve was very good, and especially that I lost couple times against her last year.   So, well, just went on court and pretty relaxed. 
Of course the wind was a little bit difficult, especially in the first set.   A lot framing.   But I think the second set went much better and it was good match.

Q.   Can you talk about the first game where you tried to serve it out, the first three match points?   You were maybe getting a bit aggressive and seemed like you were getting frustrated because you weren't hitting the ball as much, no? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, it's always frustrating when you have a lot of match point, especially on my serve.   Then she was serving for the first serves and I couldn't really make it.
But for sure those few first match points, for sure I could try something else.   You know, it's always annoying when you have a lot of chances and then it's going opposite way.
Especially when someone if top is on the other side of the net it's no free points.   You really, really have to like finish the match.   I just couldn't. 

Q.   You had a hard time with her on hard courts last year in the matches.   Why did you turn it around today? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think I was really playing good and really focusing on my serve today.   What I remember, she was serving a little bit worse than before on our matches; I really couldn't break her at all last couple of the matches.
So I think it was the key, you know, a lot of good rallies, a lot of games, long games with her serve.   So that's why, you know, I could really have some chances.   Especially in the first set, first game break right away, and I think the set open.

Q.   Are you the kind of person that enjoys a lot of matches, a lot back‑to‑back matches?   I guess to go through and win the Australian Open you're looking at 16 matches in a row. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I wish.

Q.   Obviously that's a lot of matches and obviously something you contemplate.   Is that something that suits well for you?   Some players here in particular, you get a feeling that they play a few games and take it easy, lose, or drop out to save yourselves.   But that's not the case for you? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Actually today when I was going on court, you know, of course if I win, great; if not, I mean, not that big deal because I really had a lot of matches here and in Auckland.
I'm really ready to Australian Open.   But I always go on court to win.   I will do of course everything to win that match tomorrow as well, and we'll see.   I wish to win 16 matches in a row.   (Smiling.) 

Q.   Do you see yourself as maybe a little bit below Serena?   I suppose with the win in Auckland, here, that maybe in some people's reckoning you're going to that second tier, maybe the second level of favorites below Serena?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   It's always hard to say, but I think of course winning two tournaments in a row is a good score and a good thing.   Never had that before, especially here, so for sure I'm ready for Australian Open.   I'm happy that I can play my best tennis from the beginning of the year.

Q.   So you've never won back‑to‑back tournaments before?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I did Tokyo and Beijing, yes.   But never here, so...

Q.   Li Na says she's trying some new things to strengthen her game.   Did you sense any change at all compared to the last couple matches you played her? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Not really.   I think we play like four times last year, or even more. 
But I didn't really see any changes, no.

Q.   She says she is trying to be more aggressive and come to the net a little more.   Do you see that?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   She was aggressive as well before, especially when I played her in Cincinnati.   She was really playing very fast.   I was late with everything.   I didn't have any answer for her shots.
She was really playing aggressive already last year, so, yeah. 

Q.   Also talk about the shot between the legs. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I didn't really have any other choice, to be honest, over there, so I tried.   But, hmm, next time maybe.

Q.   Is that typical for a woman player to do that?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Not really.   I can do it, this shot.   The ball was not that perfect to do that, but like I'm saying, I was really too close to the net just to reach that ball. 
So I tried, but, yeah, I was really practicing that shot when I was little against the wall.   I was like, you know putting the ball by myself and running one by one.
Then, you know, just I can do it, but for sure needs to have like better ball. 

Q.   How is the body holding up?   This is two weeks of constant matches.   Are you feeling fatigued physically?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, the ice bath always helps.   I'm feeling good.

Q.   You've improved so many things in your game ‑ first serve, forehand ‑ over the last few years.   Do you think it's possible to add speed to your second serve, and is that something you work on?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, of course.   But I think as I was saying, when I'm really improve my game it's really practicing every shots.   Of course it's always something to improve in every shot, I think.
Yeah.

Q.   Would you change your game much from the way you played today if you were playing Serena or Maria or Victoria?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, every match is a different story, especially different conditions, different surface.   It's always hard to say.   Every match is different.   Even when it's sometimes just few days later, it's still the different game.

Q.   The basic principles of how aggressive you are though, were you happy with that game today?   Do you think it would match up well against the top 3? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I hope so.   I think I was really playing good tennis the last couple of days.   I hope I can continue playing on this level.

Q.   Are you okay with the crowd yelling your name, Go Aggie?   Australians like to shorten names. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, I think my first name is pretty difficult, so if it's Aggie, Aga, Agnieszka, you know, Angie sometimes, so I'm okay with that. 

Q.   People have called you Angie?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Sometimes, yes.

Q.   Where?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Especially at the hotels.   Like you're checking in?   Oh, Angie.   Like, Uh, yeah, whatever.   (Laughing.)

Q.   Your match was televised in Poland for the first time this season.   How important to you is it is that your fans can watch back home?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   This is great, especially that it's not the EuroSport anymore, not that much, so I think it's great if the Polish TV is showing the tennis.   Obviously it's a great thing for tennis in Poland that it's going to be more popular. 
I think they should show as much as they can. 

Q.   The tournament in Poland, the report says that you couldn't play because you already play Auckland last week.   What's the situation?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, well, unfortunately the tournament officially came up really late and I was already sign up for Auckland.   That was too late, so I can't play in Poland, yeah. 

Q.   Words on either Angelique Kerber or Dominika?   You will face one of them in the final.   Just a couple words about each player, what you like about their game. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I play against them a lot of times and I know them from the juniors day.   They are my age and we know each other more than ten years, both of them, so I think doesn't really matter who's going to be in the final for me.   They both playing great tennis.   I saw them here playing and they really playing good. 
You know, just going to maybe watch myself maybe a couple games today and we'll see.

Q.   Do you think you should be allowed to play in Poland?   I know what the rule is, but given that the tournament came in late, did you think they would make an exception for you?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, we were trying to do that, but there were a couple persons that were against.   You cannot really do anything about that.

Q.   So you asked and they said no?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, yes.

Q.   You asked the tour?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes.   It was the question if I can play two in one... 

Q.   Internationals in six months?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, exactly. 

Q.   They said no?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   No.

Q.   Who said no?   Do you know?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Not really.   It was official question for the WTA, and of course it's probably, you know, a lot of people working on that. 
They didn't do an exception.   I think on one side it's pretty hard to do that, but on the other side, why not?   It's the rules, right, so...

Q.   When did you hear that there was going to officially be a tournament there? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I think November. 

Q.   So after you made your schedule?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Oh, yes.   Pretty much I know my schedule one year before, especially when I'm top 10 and we can't play the small tournament, international tournaments. 
So the schedule, it's not really changing year.   Maybe two, three tournaments, but it's very similar every year. 

Q.   Did you work harder on off‑season serve and volley and coming to the net more?   Because today when I was watching you attack more and you were coming more to the net.   So her game allows you to do that? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I was really practicing that in off‑season, yes, a lot of volleys and a lot of serve and volley return and volley.   So, yes.

Q.   Seem to be very comfortable. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, well, especially with that weather I think it's good to go to the volley.   Especially with the big wind it's always hard to do anything, so I think it's good tactic.
