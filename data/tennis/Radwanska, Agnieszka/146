A. RADWANSKA/S. Voegele
  4‑6, 6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   First question. 

Q.   Thoughts on the match today, Aga? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, first match is always tricky, especially that every week we have different conditions, different courts, different balls. 
Yeah, I think I needed that match just to feel the rhythm. 

Q.   And the 36 unforced errors, kind of a little high for you.   Part of that, Voegele, she was really aggressive off your serve.   How were you able to combat that and win those last two sets?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, I think the courts are much slower than in Tokyo.   I just had one practice.   I think I didn't really adjust. 
But I think I was playing better definitely in the third set I think winning the points in the important moments and came back from some Love‑40 games. 
I mean, was very tight match.   Could be both sides.   But just happy that I could come back and winning those last couple of points. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese. 

Q.   Seems that you're not satisfied with your performance on the court.   Sometimes you're even trying to throw off the racquet.   Can you comment on your performance to control your emotions or mood on the court today?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, maybe I didn't play my 100% today.   Of course I had some good and bad games and moments on the court.
Of course then you get nervous when you know that you're not playing your best.
Then I think always trying to fight until the end, and doesn't matter what is happening.   So that's what I was trying to do today.   The end was better.   I was really trying to stay calm. 
Of course was a couple moments I was really, really angry.   In the end, I think I did everything I could do and I won the match.
