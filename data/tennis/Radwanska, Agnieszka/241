 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Her serve seemed to give you some trouble. What was tough about her serve today?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I mean, for sure she was serving unbelievable today, especially in the second set. Sometimes four aces in a game. It's too much, you know -- was no chance to break her, so...   
  
  Q. How much of an advantage is that for her against a lot of players, particularly on this surface?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: For sure, you know, I mean, I broke her also once. But if she's on a good, you know, game and she's serving -- I mean, she's doing her best on the court, it's very tough to play against her, even if I'm serving.   
 So, yeah, she was playing too good for me today.
