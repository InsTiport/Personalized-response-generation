A. RADWANSKA/M. Martinez Sanchez
  7-5, 6-1

 Q. You're up against Shuai Peng next. I believe that's right, yeah? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Actually I don't know (smiling). Okay. I don't have much to say because I never played against her in singles, so just we'll see.

 Q. I think you played against her in Indian Wells last year. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Peng? 

 Q. Peng. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Oh, Peng. I think, yeah, it was last year, once. It was tough, two sets, but it was a long time ago and it was on the hard court, so it was a different situation than here.

 Q. How is your confidence at the moment and how are you feeling?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I'm feeling good, but actually today was a bit hard with the wind and with the sunshine. But I was playing quite good, so hopefully I will do at least the same or it's going to be better.

 Q. Are you happy watt way you're playing on grass?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah. Actually I like grass and I'm doing now very good on the grass every year. Hopefully I'll do at least the same like last year.
