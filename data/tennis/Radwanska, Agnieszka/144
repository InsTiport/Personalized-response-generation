  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.

Q.   You've struggled against Serena your whole career.   Can you talk about what makes her so difficult?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think the ranking and how many points she has, I think this is the proof that I think she has really good year and playing really on the very high level I think whole year.   Very consistent, playing very aggressive always, deep balls, and pretty much attacking from every point.
So it's really hard to find the rhythm and stay in the game, because I think from the beginning she was dictating pretty much everything. 

Q.   Did the medical timeout affect you at all? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Not really.   Happens. 

Q.   What do you think didn't work out for you today:   the serve?   The baseline?   Or even dropshots?   Anything of your game?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I mean, it's hard to say because she's the player that she doesn't really let you play. 
She is really just pretty much attacking everything, all the serve, all the return, and when she's really having her day, it's really tough.
I think she really play very well today from the beginning until the end.
You know, I think she was just playing too good. 

Q.   If you are going to play against her again in Istanbul later this month, it's going to be a different court, an indoor hard court.   Do you think you'll try something different? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Maybe I will just play with my left hand.   Maybe that will work. 
To be honest, well, I think of course every match is different story, and especially when it's indoor and the surface is different.   I'm just going to try again.   We'll see there. 
But, you know, like I'm saying, if she's really playing her best tennis, it's tough.
