THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You've had a lot of success at this tournament the last couple years.  Obviously you won it in 2011.  What do you think your biggest reason for your success at this particular tournament is?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: It's always hard to say.  I'm just feeling very well here.  I like the courts.  I like the conditions, I guess.  Everything suits me.  So just, you know, very happy that I can really play my best tennis here.   
So hopefully I can do it again this year.   
 Q.  How did you feel about your draw yesterday and the chance to possibly meeting Wozniacki in the round of 16?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: You talking about this tournament?   
 Q.  Yes.  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Actually, I didn't see the draw.   
Well, I mean, it's a really strong tournament.  Really tough opponents from the first round.  Let's focus at the first round first.   
Then if I play Caro for the third time again in a row, that's no choice.  We have to play again.
