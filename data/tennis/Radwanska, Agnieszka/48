A. RADWANSKA/A. Konjuh
  6‑2, 4‑6, 9‑7

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Congrats. I just thought last year, it was deep into the second week that you had a very close match. Is it advantageous to have a close match in the first week?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, if you see other scores, and if you see, for example, players who won the Grand Slam, they always have something like this on the way.
You know, sometimes it's a little bit easier to play after when you know that you probably shouldn't even be here anymore.
Well, let's see. But definitely those kind of matches are tough. But, well, if you can come back, it's great. But, well, I don't know if anything change in the way to the second week. So we'll see.
