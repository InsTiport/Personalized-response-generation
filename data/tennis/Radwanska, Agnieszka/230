 V. AZARENKA/A. Radwanska
  6-3, 6-4 
   
  Q. Tough match for you, right? What's happened next set?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, earlier it was tough. I think every game was like so close and doesn't matter which one was serving.   
 I think I just, you know, I made a couple of mistakes and I was already down. Because you know playing against Top 10 players, it's just so tough to come back.   
  
  Q. You were controlling the second set, and suddenly there's a drop in your performance. Is there any reason for that?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Actually I was 4-2 up, right?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, yeah. Like I said, the service was not that important in our game today. But you know she was just playing good and moving well, and it was so hungry. And like I said, just couple of mistakes and that's it.   
  
  Q. What is your next plan, next tournament for you?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Finally, I'll go home for two weeks, and I'm very happy about that. And I'm playing Indian Wells and Miami.   
  
  Q. Overall, you would say you were satisfied with your performance in the tournament?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah, I'm very happy today. I did semifinals. Especially that I didn't play well last year, two years ago. It's just great. I had a couple of good matches here. Of course, semifinal in a big tournament is always good.  
  
  Q. So when you were leading in the second set, then you got broken, so did you feel pressure or something or was it that she was just playing too good?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I think it was that she had a couple of good shots, and then she came back. So, you know, if you're not focused in the important moments, then it's not good. So I think I just wasn't very focused when I needed to be. I just lost.
