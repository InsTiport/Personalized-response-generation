6-2, 6-1   
An interview with:   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Could you tell us something about the match?  How did you feel on court and what did you think about it?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, I didn't feel good.  I mean, that was everything I could do today.  It wasn't my day.   
And I didn't move well.  Anytime I was going back, it was a drop shot coming and all the wrong bounces.  I wanted to play a bit faster, but either I was stepping in.  It was just wrong timing.  And I'm just happy that the clay is over.   
 Q.  Speaking about that, of course, grass is coming.  You have good memories about it.  Maybe this can help you and you'll gain some confidence.  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Of course.  And I'm enjoying grass much better.  And I'm really happy to play on grass and it doesn't matter what the results are.  Just, you know, can feel my tennis and really, you know, feel on court comfortable and I can play my game there.
