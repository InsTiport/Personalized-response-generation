  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on that?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think when you're not playing your best tennis then it's hard to compete with those kind of players.   I think I didn't serve enough, you know, to win that.   I think that was really important part in that match.   Yeah, I didn't really serve well.

Q.   How difficult was it to play in such hot conditions for the second day running?   You were first on again at midday. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, definitely I would prefer to play under different conditions.   Well, that's the schedule.   So I have to deal with that.   And, you know, it's the same conditions for both of us.   It's not only me on the court.   So, well, yeah. 

Q.   Did you think of asking for an evening match?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think it's so many matches, and, you know, so many seeded players.   I think it's tough. 
I think if I were to put in the request I think it would be a mess.   So, you know, I kind of knew I was going to be first again, so I prepared for that.

Q.   How are you feeling?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Pretty similar to yesterday.   I think I just need time.

Q.   How come Martina couldn't come this week?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, she couldn't come.   She will be in Indian Wells and Miami.

Q.   Is she supposed to go every place with you or just cherry‑pick certain tournaments?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Of course the big ones, Grand Slams and mandatory tournaments, so, yeah.
