 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Going into this match, did you know that you had to just get a set? At 5-1 was it kind of going through your mind?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah, I knew that, but, you know, even when I was 5-1 up in the first set, to be honest, I didn't feel I was close to win the set. She start to play unbelievable since then, and, you know, hitting the ball very hard.   
 Even when I was, you know, serving, you know, first or second serve, you know, she was playing so aggressive.  
 You know, it just -- you know, I had my chances, but, you know, when you're not really using them it's kind of going down.   
  
  Q. It's the end of the season. You must be disappointed, but also you've obviously started to play really well at the end. That must give you a lot of confidence going into next year.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, um, you know, first of all, I was very happy to be here like top 8. So first of all, this was my success already.  
 You know, I had, you know, two tough matches here before, and, you know -- you know, I really had late night yesterday.  
 You know, I was trying my best today, but, you know, she was just playing too good in the important moments, I guess.   
  
  Q. What are your plans in the offseason now?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, I think, you know, pretty much the same like every year, you know. I gonna have some rest, you know, around two weeks. Then, you know, you still practicing again and, you know, working hard for the next season.
