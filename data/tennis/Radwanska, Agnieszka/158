THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What do you remember about when you played Madison Keys in December?   She's your next opponent.   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   In December?   
   
 Q.   Wasn't it at Miami that you played her?   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   March.   I don't think I ever play any tournament in December (smiling).   
Uhm, well, actually I didn't even remember that, to be honest.   I still trying to remember that match, but...   Still can't remember that match, to be honest.   I thought I never played her before.   
But I saw her in the tournaments this year, and I think she improve a lot.   She's really playing good tennis right now.   Will be tough, for sure.   
   
 Q.   Where do you find your level right now?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think, you know, I was really preparing, you know, uhm, for this tournament.   I knew the grass court season is not that long.   So, uhm, I think I'm really, you know, ready for this tournament and just happy to win those two matches in two sets and ready for the next one.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel healthy and relaxed coming into the tournament?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I'm quite healthy, so yes.   
   
 Q.   Not so relaxed?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Relaxed (smiling)?   This is Grand Slam, so I think nobody's relaxed here.   Everybody wants to have great results here.   This is one of the most important tournaments of the year.   Especially for me right now, you know, I'm not really trying to think about the pressure.   But, of course, in your head is always the thoughts that you defending the final here.   
So, uhm, yeah, trying to be relaxed, but it's tough sometimes.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel walking out to Centre Court today?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, it's always great to be back on that court.   Always special atmosphere.   Always brings some good memories.  
   
 Q.   What was the walk like?   The last time you did that walk you were going out for a Grand Slam final.   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, you know, time flies, so it was like two weeks ago.   It was great.   Always happy to play on that court.   
   
 Q.   Do you do anything in between matches to keep relaxed so you're not thinking about defending the final?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Always practicing, having treatment, massage.   Just relaxing and resting at home.  
   
 Q.   No fun things?   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   No fun things?   You know, just going out for some good dinner and, you know, watching some movies or series.   
   
 Q.   Did you watch last year's final again since then?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   My final?   
   
 Q.   Have you looked at it?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Not really, no.   I remember that final so I don't need to watch anymore.   Every point, trust me.  
   
 Q.   Not even once?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   No.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe how Serena Williams is playing at this time?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, uhm, I think she's really playing great tennis, especially what makes her the powerful player.   She's really dictating everything from the beginning of the match.   I think that's what makes her player No.1.   
When she's playing her best tennis, uhm, I don't know what you have to do to win the match because it's very, very difficult.   She's not really letting you play.   
   
 Q.   What did you think yesterday with Victoria not playing, Caroline going out, Sharapova, Federer, all the injuries?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, was crazy day for sure.   But I didn't watch every matches, but I saw a little bit.   
Well, a couple injuries.   I think it was just a bad day for few players.   Actually, those players were playing the same day, and everyone together makes a really crazy day.   
Well, so, this is the sport and everything can happen.   I think this is the proof of that.   
   
 Q.   Serena and Andy Murray are joking about playing each other in a match.   If those two face off, what do you think Serena's chances are?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, this is a good question.   I don't know.   On which surface?   Here on grass?   
   
 Q.   You choose the surface for Serena.   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, yeah, I would like to see that match, to be honest.   I don't know.   I don't know.   If Serena will play her best tennis, I think Andy will be in a bit of trouble.   But I still going for Andy.   
   
 Q.   Which male player would you like to play?   How would you do against Janowicz on clay?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   On clay?   With that serve?   Not good.   
   
 Q.   How about he only has second serves?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Even worse.   
   
 Q.   Underhand serves?   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, he's very strong guy, so that would be tough, as well.   But, uhm, you know, serve is the huge weapon.   So I think, you know, just without the serve I think I might, you know, have some good rallies.   But otherwise not good.   
   
 Q.   Who has better touch, you or Jerzy?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   You know, I think we're the same level.
