   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Tell us about your match.  A slow start but a big finish. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I mean, I was losing 6-1, 3-Love, and I was thinking, What I'm doing wrong?  Because it was so quickly.  And, uhm, she was using the wind very well, and I didn't. 
 I think that was the most important point in this match.  Then I was start to play, try to do something else.  And then it was like, uhm, very long games, and I won the second set.  It was so close. 
 And third set, I was -- I don't know what she was doing, I mean, at all.  It was just like, uhm, but it's not a question for me. 

 Q.  What did you try differently? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I mean, not to play aggressive.  Just, you know, hit the ball like right, left, no mistakes.  So I think that was more important, for sure.  And also -- I was serving much better than in the first set. 

 Q.  Why such good form?  Have you done anything special? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Before this tournament? 

 Q.  Yes. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Actually, no, nothing special.  I was practicing normally in home.  Actually, in Hobart, I lost in first round, but also against good player.  And here, I'm very happy that I did few rounds here and I'm first time in quarterfinal. 

 Q.  You've had some big wins over some very big-name players.  Do you get nervous before those big matches? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No.  Actually against Kuznetsova, I was playing three times.  I knew how to play different.  Here it was different because it was first time. 
 But, anyway, I have nothing to lose, even in this match. 

 Q.  You seem to have some magic against Russian players. 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Oh, yeah, all the Russians are very good, so we'll see.  Maybe I'll also play against Russian in quarterfinal. 

 Q.  A few years ago when you were thinking about turning pro, did you think you would get to a slam quarterfinal this early in your career? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No.  Actually, I was thinking about just one round, two rounds.  And then also before this tournament, I said that it's going to be good that I will be in three or fourth round. 
 I was already two times in fourth round in Wimbledon and US Open and here.  First time quarter. 

 Q.  Do you remember your father used to coach Nadia Petrova at some stage? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I knew it, of course.  Also, I was practicing before her.  Me and my sister, we were waiting for him and watching also this practice. 

 Q.  Did it help in this match particularly? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No, not really, because it was a long time ago so... 

 Q.  How well did you know her personally? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I was I think 10 or 11 or even smaller.  She was practicing with my father in Krakow.  I was a kid.  So now I know her.  This time was just Nadia Petrova and that's it. 

 Q.  She doesn't pat you on the head or anything? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No.
