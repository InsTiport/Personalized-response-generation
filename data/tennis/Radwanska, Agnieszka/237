 Q. It was a tough day to day on the court. How are you feeling physically after your match? Was it really tough? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Actually, I had one day off, so it was actually much better than the next day. But I was sick and, I didn't feel very good on the court. And I think that was the reason.

 Q. Yeah, because you didn't seem able to just handle the game. Just keep the ball on the court. You were really slow, that was because of you were sick? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah, for sure. The first two matches were much better. And today, for sure, I didn't feel 100% on the court.

 Q. But your game, what have you thought about the way she was playing? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I was playing against her once, and on the green clay one year ago. It was actually a very long and tough match. 
 I mean, today, she didn't play great, and, you know, it was the same. So I think it was not actually what it should be.

 Q. Can I have just your thoughts about your start of the season? It's a little bit difficult? How do you feel? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: You know, it's the beginning of the year, so you never know what it's going to be in the end, and what I will have the ranking. But now I will try in Dubai. But quarterfinals is not a bad results here.

 Q. Is the pressure different because now you are a Top 10 player? 
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: For sure it's more pressure than to be 110. But, you know, it's just going to the court to win the match. Doesn't matter who is staying on the other side.
