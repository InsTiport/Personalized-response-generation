 A. RADWANSKA/M. Rybarikova
  6‑3, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was it much harder than you think the scoreline suggested?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, I think so.   It was a long match for those two sets, especially on grass.   You know, also, the first match is always very difficult, different courts and different tournament, and also that court was actually much slower than the others.   And also a lot of breaks.   
So it was a bit of a weird match, but I'm just very happy I could close it.   I was in a little bit of trouble in the second set, but...   
   
 Q.   Was she much affected by the injury, do you think?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I don't think so.   She was moving and playing the same as before her injury, so I think it was fine.  
   
 Q.   You have not made a semifinal in any Grand Slam.   Do you think you can here this time?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I hope so.   I really was working hard this year, and we have great result.   Maybe not in the Grand Slam but also in the other big events.  
So I think when I can win some mandatory tournaments, I can also be in the semifinal of a Grand Slam.   If I'm going to do it, I don't know, but for sure I'm going to try.
