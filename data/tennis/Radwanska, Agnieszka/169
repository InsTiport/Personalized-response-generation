A. RADWANSKA/B. Bobusic
  7‑5, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Could you just summarize the way you played out there?   Was it a bit of a surprise in the first set, do you think?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think the worst on this match was the wind.   I think we both couldn't win one game from the one side.   I think I was just losing against the wind, pretty much.
I think I just didn't start aggressive enough, and I'm just happy that I could come back in the first set and play already much better in the second set.

Q.   The last two tournament wins have obviously been great.   What sort of confidence does that give you coming into this tournament?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, for sure it's been a great two weeks for me.   So I can't complain, for sure.
And, of course, very happy that I could play a lot of good matches and really high level and not even losing one set.
