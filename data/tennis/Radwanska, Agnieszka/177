M. SHARAPOVA/A. Radwanska
  5‑7, 7‑5, 7‑5

Q.   Tough match, long match today.   What are your thoughts coming off the court?   You obviously played pretty well.   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, well, you know, it was actually great match.   All of those set were very tight.   You know, of course I had my chance in the second set, but when you're not using them against really top player, great player, it's hard to come back. 
Obviously she really played very good in the end. 

Q.   Day off tomorrow.   What are you going to do to get prepared for your next match? 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I need a lot of rest, massage, and everything just to cool down, because for sure that match cost me a lot.

Q.   Feel fairly confident you'll be able to progress into the next round?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I have still one more chance to be in the semifinals, so of course I'm going to try.
