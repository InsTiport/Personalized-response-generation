   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  Sharapova last year at the Open, and right now you have Svetlana Kuznetsova on your board.  Do you think you've found an ideal surface to beat Russian players?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Actually, it was exactly the same match:  Third round in the Grand Slam, playing No. 2 on center court.   
 So exactly the same match, a Russian player, and so -- and both matches I had nothing to lose.  Just play and try my best, and I did it twice.   
  
  Q.  Does that give you confidence, now that you've played, you've beaten a big name already, can you come out in a Grand Slam and do it again?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I'm very excited and happy.  I lost against her a few times already, but it was very close, 6-3 in the third and 6-4 in the third.  Finally I did it.  I beat her.   
  
  Q.  Did you learn much about her in those previous three matches you played against her?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I was playing many matches against top players, so I know how to play.  I have to play aggressive and try my best even if I'm losing 3-Love.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you're playing well enough to keep going through the rounds and get right into a semifinal or in the final if you keep going?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I don't know.  Actually, I want to be first in the quarter final here, and last year it was second.  I'm already in the fourth, so I'm very happy that I did another step.   
  
  Q.  Last year you were still in school at this time.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  But are you all done now?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, actually, I finished my school half year ago, so...   
  
  Q.  Does it make tennis easier not to have those other responsibilities?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I have more time, for sure.  But now I'm doing driving lessons, so it's not...   
  
  Q.  Driving lessons?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah.  I have exam after Australian Open, actually.   
  
  Q.  Are you driving on the wrong side of the road here?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  No, not here, just in Europe.   
  
  Q.  So how long is that going to take?  You said you'd be taking a test right after.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Actually I did already my driving lesson, actually the lessons, and the exam will be after the Australian Open.   
  
  Q.  And you talked to us quite a bit last year about your pets.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Do you still have those two pets?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, yeah.  I have still two rats.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel still like a teenager or a woman?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Hard to say, but normal.  I feel normal, like normal person, normal player, normal girl.
