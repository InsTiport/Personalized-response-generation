A. RADWANSKA/L. Hradecka
  6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   

Q.   You're taking on an Australian, Tomljanovic, in the next round.   You took her on in the French Open a couple of years ago and she surprised you with an upset.   What can you remember from that match?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, of course that was a year ago, but I think here it's going to be a totally different match.   Of course I hope that's going to be different score.   Obviously that's different surface.
I look forward to that match.   We didn't play since that match.   I think it's going to be a good challenge.

Q.   Obviously that was on clay.   Here is grass.   Do you feel the difference on surface tilts the advantage in your favor?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I hope so.   I'm not a big favorite on clay courts.   I'm happy we can play another match here on grass.
It's always hard to say what's gonna happen.   I'm feeling good and I'm ready for it.

Q.   No doubt there will be no complacency this time around.   You won't be taking her lightly?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Say again? 

Q.   You won't be, I guess, underestimating her abilities?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think she's a player that she can really play great tennis.   She's hitting the ball very well.   I definitely gonna expect the best tennis from her.   I need to be careful from the beginning.
I know she can play great.   Well, we'll see after a couple of games what I have to do to beat her.
