THE MODERATOR: Questions for Agnieszka Radwanska, please.
Q. What didn't work for you today?  Was it because you played late last night?  You stayed almost two hours on the court and you had to play the first game today?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: That obviously didn't help, but I didn't think that's really explanation for that.  We all used to that.  Of course finishing the match middle of the night, it's never easy.
It's different day for me than yesterday.  Nothing was going really my way.  I get frustrated and I didn't come back.
Q. What did you learn from this week you spent here in Doha?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, I think good matches in really tough conditions.  And, of course, semifinals is not bad result, so I'm happy still with that week.
Hopefully I can come back stronger next year.
Q. You're going to Krakow or just to Indian Wells?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I'm going home for a week, and then next weekend, I'll go to Indian Wells.
Q. What do you think bothered you the most about her?  What make her tough to play against?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I think her consistency.  I think that what make her a very powerful player, a very solid game from the back.  What she did today, very good.  Everything was coming back even stronger.
So, you know, she was pushing me back.  I really in that kind of stage, I didn't know what to do.
