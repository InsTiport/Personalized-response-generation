A. RADWANSKA/V. Williams
  6‑4, 6‑2

Q.   Where would you rate this win in your career?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, one of my biggest title.   As you can see in the draw pretty much all top players.   So very, very special title for me. 

Q.   Right off the bat Venus was bringing it with some serious heat on serve.   What was it like to face that kind of power from her?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I knew.   I really prepared for really good serve for her, very aggressive tennis. 
I just was trying to use my chances.   Wherever it was a little bit of couple points I could really go for it, that's what I was trying to do. 
Of course, a couple of her serves I really had no chance.   But if I had any chance, I think I took it and that's why I could break her. 

Q.   In your tight game yesterday your opponent said she thought she took a few too many chances.   Today, Venus was very, very aggressive.   Do you feel like your defense forced your opponents into being a little too risky this week?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think I played a couple different matches.   I think they are two different opponents from the semis and in the finals.   Sometimes they're really hard to compare. 
But yesterday I think we play really similar tennis.   That's why it was a long games, a lot of rallies.   We played three sets.   I think we played over three hours. 
Today, Venus is a much more aggressive player with a really huge serve.   I think the serve was really the key as well in that match. 
So, yeah. 

Q.   What do you feel today went particularly well for you and made the difference in this matchup?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think I was playing much better every match.   I didn't start that well from my first match.   I think every match was much better.   That's why I think I sitting right here now with you guys. 
I think every match was much better and I think I was feeling the balls much better. 
I think coming from Stanford, the conditions were different, different balls.   All this difference together make a big difference.   I really needed a couple of days to adjust everything, play my really great tennis the last couple days. 

Q.   You came up with a bunch of aces, not so much based on power but on perfect placement.   Was that your strategy?   How much fun was that to go kiss the trophy after winning it?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Of course, I can't really serve like Venus.   A couple times around 200 per hour.   This is my tactic, you know, just to find the right spot, even when the serve is much shorter. 
But I think this is the way I trying to always find a way to win the matches. 
Of course, kissing the trophy I think is the best moment in a player career. 

Q.   Does it make it even more special when you beat a legend like Venus?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Of course.   Especially I think she played great tennis whole week, playing and beating a lot of good players on the way to the final. 
I think I even more happy to beat Venus when she's really on fire. 

Q.   You mentioned the different conditions between Stanford and here.   The balls are going to change again next week in Cincinnati, then at the US Open.   How difficult is it to actually adjust?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   It is difficult, especially when you don't have much time to adjust.   Now in Cincinnati, I'm going to have maybe one or two practices, then I'm going back on court to play a match. 
Of course, conditions, sometimes it's humid, sometimes it's windy.   We know Cincinnati is actually very tough conditions. 
Well, sometimes one or two days is okay, but sometimes it's just not enough. 
But I think everyone has the same problem.   I think it's good problem that I don't have time for another tournament.   But we'll see. 

Q.   That last game, the unique shot of yours with the knees on the ground. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   But I stand up (laughter). 

Q.   How did that shot come around?   Is that something you've done all your life?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   As we can see, return is coming so quickly, especially from Venus, that I don't really have time to do anything, to go back.   So the one thing is just bend my knees and try to make the shot with her power from the return.   So that's what I was trying to do, yeah. 

Q.   Venus told us that MontrÃ©al is now rivaling Rome for her favorite city in the world.   I guess your evaluation of Montreal has changed maybe?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I think wherever you win, you love the place.   I think this is a great tournament.   Everything was good, really well‑organized, no trouble for anything.   Very nice hotel.   A lot of practice courts. 
You know, so good so far.   So just very happy, you know, to come back here. 

Q.   You've mentioned the difference in conditions between Stanford and here.   It will change again.   You played most of your matches at nighttime here.   Today you played in the middle of the day.   What was the difference and how did you adapt to it?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes, on the schedule, was not really for me in the final.   I really finish late last night, finish all my treatment after midnight.   The match was at 1:00. 
But, different conditions.   I think even with that, I think I still managed to play my best tennis.   So I was a bit afraid of that because, yes, a couple matches before I was just playing very late.   It is different. 
Today I didn't really feel that, that it was different, so it was good. 

Q.   A long list of firsts for you for a Polish woman.   How does it work back home for you in terms of pressure, the media?   Talk about what life is like when you return back. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   In one side it's a bit hard because it is pressure.   I'm the first player who achieve a couple things, even for the junior times. 
But I think now anyway you can see much more players, Polish players, on the top, like was in the men's also.   Girls are doing pretty well, so more names are in the draw.   So it's a bit easier. 
Still I think the last couple years, I'm handling the pressure I think all right.   Just trying to not really think about it, just doing what I have to do, doing my best. 

Q.   Are you learning to say no to requests also?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yes.   I think you just need to know how to say 'no' a lot (smiling). 

Q.   Venus played four hours more than you.   Did you see that on the court?   Was it in your strategy to make her move more?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think she had one more match, as well.   I had a bye, so that was a little bit easier for me. 
But I still had tough matches on the way.   Even the semifinal was two sets, but feels like a three‑set battle. 
If I feel that?   Not really.   I think you can really ask her if she feels.   It was her sixth match.   She also had a lot of three sets, long matches. 
But I didn't really think about that.   Just go on court and play.
