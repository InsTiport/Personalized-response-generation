A. RADWANSKA/F. Ferro   
6-1, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  What did you make of that performance?  Tell us about your preparation coming into this tournament, obviously having to skip Rome.  How are you feeling physically?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, first of all, I'm just very happy with that win, obviously.   
Yes, well, I have been very tough few weeks, months this year, and struggle on my body, as well.   
I had some time off, and practicing few days just before Paris.  I think every match matters.  I'm just very happy, you know, to really play solid tennis today.  Happy with the two-sets win.   
 Q.  Does it almost free you a little bit up coming into this tournament because you come in pretty much cold without any matches, anything at all.  Does it free you up to go for it without too much pressure and flying under the radar maybe a little bit?  Or are you worried lack of match play kind of catches up with you?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, first of all, I'm just happy I didn't miss a Grand Slam.  I have been playing all of them since I think 10 years.  I have good statistics about that.   
You know, it's always good to play.  Of course, like you said, I just had one match on the clay court, and obviously that's not much.  So like saying, every match matters.  Well, hopefully I'll have a couple good ones here.
