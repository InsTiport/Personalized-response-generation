   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  How did you enjoy your first quarterfinal?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Anyway, I lost today.  But, anyway, I'm very happy that I did my first quarterfinal.  So I beat two Russian good players, both seeded.   
 So, anyway, I'm happy.   
  
  Q.  Did you notice a different intensity from a quarterfinal, different to other matches you would have played in the past?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Actually, I was playing against Daniela in Zurich, in winter, so not so long time ago.  I beat her also in two sets.  But today was different.  You know, she was playing very good.  I made few mistakes.   
 I also have many chances, but I didn't use it.  So next time.   
  
  Q.  Were you nervous at all?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Before, a little.  But I just, you know, came to the court and, anyway, I had nothing to lose.  I tried my best, but not my day.   
  
  Q.  Was Daniela one of the players you admired as a young girl?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I don't know.  I mean...   
  
  Q.  Would you say it was a question of playing on the biggest court?  But you played Arthur Ashe in New York.  Huge stadium, big crowds.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Actually, I think was the same.  I was playing here on all the center court, so I'm very happy I played all of them.  So, anyway, I hope I'll play next year also on center court.   
  
  Q.  What lessons can you take out of today?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Hmm.  First of all, think I have to play like aggressive, especially if somebody's playing very good.  She was serving very well and return also.   
  
  Q.  She seemed to be forcing you behind the baseline.   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Exactly.  She was playing very long balls, I mean, close to the baseline.  It was very hard to play, you know, play.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you'll be able to take that and develop in your own game?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  I mean, I was trying everything in first set and then second set.  But was very long games.  Anyway, the last points always she did better, so...   
  
  Q.  So you think your experience may have helped on those crucial points?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Exactly.  Next time.   
  
  Q.  Where do you go after this?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  After this I'm playing Federation Cup, so is going to be Hungary.  And then I'm playing Pattaya and Dubai, Doha.   
  
  Q.  And driving lessons?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:  Yeah, I'm doing driving lessons also.  But I have exam.  There is one tournament, so I have to change it.  But it's very hard to change in Poland because it's so busy everything.  So I will try to change it for next time.
