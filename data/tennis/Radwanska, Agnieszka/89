 A. RADWANSKA/A. Tomljanovic
  6‑0, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Nice to see you playing well again.   Looking back now on the early part of the year when you hired Martina as a coach, did you go a little bit off‑course?   Was it perhaps a bit of a bad decision or strategic error, with all due respect to her, to work with her and the result of that not being very good?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think it was maybe bad timing to hire her when I really had ‑‑I didn't feel good.   I was a little bit exhausted.  
I had a couple really tough months.   It was the same time she was working with me.   
Well, now I think, first of all, I'm just feeling much better.   I think also grass changed everything, as well.   Helps me go to my best level I can play tennis.   
Well, for sure a couple of good months of experience working with her.   But now we're just friends.  
   
 Q.   So you didn't feel there was anything she was doing that threw your game off or made it more difficult or confused you and contributed to your problems rather than...   
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   No, no, not at all.   Actually, she had me learn a lot of things and she understand me pretty much on and off the court.   Definitely she was doing good job.
