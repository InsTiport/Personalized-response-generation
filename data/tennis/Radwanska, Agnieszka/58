A. RADWANSKA/B. Jovanovski   
6-0, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  It was pretty windy out there today of how did you find the conditions?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yes, well, it was cold and windy.  That's why it was a little bit slow and the ball is not going anywhere.   
But, well, I think we all kind of used to that after couple of days here.  The conditions are same for both of us.   
 Q.  You seemed to move really well today.  Would you say you're feeling comfortable on the clay?  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, I think I'm getting better.  Of course I was doing everything in those last couple of weeks to move better.  I think that's the key on clay.   
So that's what I was working on, yeah.   
 Q.  Moving forward, what are you looking to improve on for your second-round match?  You're up against Caroline Garcia.  
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: That's for sure going to be different match.  I guess she's on fire winning last week.  Well, good hitter, and we had couple of good matches, long ones.   
So, well, just looking forward.  Going to be a good match, especially here when she play home.
