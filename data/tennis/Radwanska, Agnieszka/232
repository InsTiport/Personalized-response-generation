 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Agnieszka, please.   
  
  Q. How do you feel playing here? And how do you feel sending Wozniacki to the semifinals?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, first of all, I was very happy that I had the same chance like last year to play at least one match like an alternate. I was very happy. But obviously I didn't really expect that. I just find out yesterday late evening that I'm going to play today.   
 But, yeah, it's just a great feeling, you know, to play last match this year in Doha, in the Championships. So it's just great.   
 For sure, you know, with Caroline, we're best friends. I think I just did a great present for her and I'm very happy about that.   
  
  Q. You were trailing 2-5 in the second set. Did you expect this sort of comeback?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Not really. I think it was actually pretty fast. You know, I was 4-6, 2-5, it was not too long. But, like I said, it was just last match this year, so you just keep fighting till the end, till the match point. That's it. Just keep going, keep going.   
 I didn't think about the score. Just played my best till the end.
