  A. RADWANSKA/S. Fichman  6-1, 6-0   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Can you talk about the match?  It was a pretty dominating performance and a good way to start a Grand Slam campaign, yeah?  AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah.  Well, we didn't play before so we didn't know what to expect.  Actually, we know each other from the junior events and for a long time now, but then never played against each other. Well, first match is always tricky, but I think today everything was working my way.  Pretty good start for me.   Q.  Coming into the tournament with a win up in Montreal, talk about your thoughts coming in.  Do you feel like you're in good form and ready to make a long run here?  AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, I hope so.  Of course I had a lot of good matches on the way here.  Especially in Montreal.  A lot of good matches against top players and a couple of good wins. So of course that gives me more confident than before.  Hopefully I will play in the same good level here.   Q.  You have not gotten past the fourth round here before.  Is there something about this that creates a little bit more challenge for you, or do you think you're maybe now more ready to get deeper into the tournament?  AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Of course.  I think like you're saying, this is the only Grand Slam I was in the quarterfinals, so I will do everything to do that. I hope even deeper, but let's focus on that first and then we will see.
