  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. You almost made that comeback in the third set. In your mind, how did you come up short?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, yeah, I was trying. Of course, I was close. But I think beginning of that third set just slip away too fast. That was 1‑5 suddenly from nowhere. 
I was still able to come back. Was close but didn't make it. 

Q. Garbine has improved a lot this season. What do you think about her game? Do you consider her already like a main favorite for every big title?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, she is a player that have great potential, very powerful player from the both side, great serve. She definitely can play on every surface. Definitely going to have a lot of good results also in the Grand Slam. 

Q. Is your plan to still play next week?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yes.

Q. So you're still chasing... 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yes, exactly. Still chasing Singapore. So Tianjin and Moscow, as well. 

Q. Is there something you regret you haven't done as you would have wished in this match, something you would change?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Well, definitely that ball for the 5‑All. Well, I think also in the second set I have couple points that I didn't really make it. In that kind of match, it makes big difference in the end. 
I think in that kind of very tight match against good player, you really have to take your chances. When you didn't get, it's really turning not your way.
