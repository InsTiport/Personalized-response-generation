    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What do you think switched in the match?   You were comfortably ahead and then...   
    AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I wouldn't know that as well, what happened.   I think I started good.   I think she was a little bit nervous in the beginning and then start to play better and better and hit the ball very well.   
    I didn't do anything, you know, to win that first set.   
   
 Q.   It's been a good year for you overall, making it to the second week of all the slams.   The US Open has not been as successful for you as the other ones.   Why do you think that is?  
    AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Uhm, well, I think, you know, what's the difference, is surface.   Every Grand Slam is different surface.   I mean, the same players, the same faces.   Conditions are always different everywhere, as well.   It's hot or windy or sunny or cold.   It's always changing.   
    Well, I think I prefer to play during the day, I guess.   
   
 Q.   Did your trip back to Poland last week make preparation for this tournament any harder?  
    AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I mean, you know, I spent three days pretty much playing, but then I have couple days, you know, to practice, to adjust to courts, to prepare for the Open.   
    I don't want to make any excuse.   It's not excuse because I went back home I lost today.   It's not that, for sure.   
   
 Q.   What is your schedule for the rest of the year?  
    AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I'm playing Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing, and if I'm gonna make Istanbul, of course the Championships.
