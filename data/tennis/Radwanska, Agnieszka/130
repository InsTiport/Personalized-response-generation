F. PENNETTA/A. Radwanska
  6‑4, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What went wrong after the four games to one?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think I start well, but anyway, here, I think, I don't know, the conditions are really like worse for me than, for example, in Doha.   The ball was really flying.   I didn't really feel the ball today at all. 
I think she was using the wind much, much better than I did.   Of course, 4‑1 is 4‑1, but the break, she was using the conditions better than I did. 

Q.   Are the conditions different to when you won here a couple of years ago?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   I think every year is a little bit different.   I think it's similar, though, but still I can't really control the ball here that much.   I do normally. 
The conditions for me are tough.   When I don't feel the ball, it's not good.

Q.   Was the heat a bit of a problem?   It's very hot out there today. 
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Well, I think I played a few weeks ago in Australia and it was 48 and I survived.   So it's okay.
Of course it's much different than Doha.   It was pretty cold, especially in the end of the day.   But I think it's just the wind and just the air.   It's a little bit different than any other tournaments.

Q.   How difficult is it as a seeded player to come in cold against a good player like Flavia who has had to come through qualifying and play four matches?   Was that sort of the difference, that she's used to the surroundings and you are maybe not so much?
AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA:   Yeah, for sure it helped her a little bit, for sure.   I mean, the first match is always the most difficult in a tournament, so especially here when you play someone top 20, top 30 from the first round.
So I think, you know, every match help.   I also prefer to play something before.   I played in my first round.
