  A. RADWANSKA/A. Pavlyuchenkova  
6-3, 6-2  
   
  Q. How do you think you played today?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I think it was not the best tennis that I can play, but enough to win.  
  
  Q. Do you think she was nervous?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I don't know how to say, but I think a little bit in the beginning, yeah.   
  
  Q. What do you think you've improved the most this year?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I don't know, but I have for sure more experience playing against the top players. I think just this.   
  
  Q. How about your next opponent? What do you think of Kuznetsova potentially?  
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I was playing against her a lot of times, many times, even here last year. I know her very much, so we'll see.   
  
  Q. Do you have a specific goal for this year would you say, for rankings or anything?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Actually I think Bartoli lost, so I will be top ten, so that was my point for this year.   
  
  Q. Any new goals then?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Top five, yeah (smiling).
