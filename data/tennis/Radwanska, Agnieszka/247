   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  The first match you had this nothing-to-lose attitude.  Would you be able to have the same mentality in the court today?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANKSKA:  Yeah, I think so because I was also playing with player top 20, also seeded.  Yeah, exactly the same feeling.   
 But, yeah, she was playing very good today.  Sometimes have to lose.  Anyway, fourth round is good for me, yeah.  First of all, I beat a No. 2 of this tournament.  It was very close in the first set.   
 In the second set, she was playing much better.  I couldn't do my best.   
  
  Q.  Do you have the feeling you did your best in this match?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANKSKA:  I think it was also windy like yesterday and day before.  I think she was playing very good.  I mean, she used the wind.  I mean, she's a very tough player.   
 Also very good forehand, backhand, all sides.  She not missing like easy balls.  So tough player.   
  
  Q.  How far do you think she can go in the tournament?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANKSKA:  I don't know.  She has a chance to be in the semifinal for sure.   
  
  Q.  Is Armstrong a difficult stadium to play in with all the movement?   
 AGNIESZKA RADWANKSKA:  No, I don't think so.  I mean, it was very similar to Ashe also.  Normal court.
