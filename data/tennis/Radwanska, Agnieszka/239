A. RADWANSKA/D. Hantuchova
  6-3, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. How did you feel you played today?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I feel very good for sure. It was much better today than in the first day against Bammer. The match was of course much better and I felt very good.
 Actually it was hot. Maybe in the beginning of the match it was a little bit tough, but then it was very good.

 Q. What have you been doing in the off-season? How prepared do you feel at this stage before the Australian Open?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Normally I'm always practicing at home in Poland, so all the time indoors. It's my first tournament outside, and in Poland it was -15 and -20, so it's big different for me.
 I'm very happy that I have two good matches that I won, yeah.

 Q. How big of an adjustment is it to go from that to this where it could be 40 degrees tomorrow?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah, I know. I'm used to it. I never practiced in the States and in the academies, you know, in Spain or whatever. I feel the best at home, so I'm always practicing there. Even if a I don't have a hard court in my city, I practice on carpet. It's okay. I feel good there.

 Q. What goals have you set for 2009 after a great year?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: For sure I just want to be on top, top player, just to be around top 15, top 10. For me, just to be there all the time.

 Q. What you do you think about the chances of your sister in today's match?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: I don't know. For sure, you know, she has very tough matches before. Four matches are a lot, actually. And also for her it's first tournament outside. So for sure it's big success that she pass the quallies and first round. I don't know even the score. I don't even who she is playing.

 Q. Now she's playing.
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Okay. They just saw me on TV and now she's playing (laughter.)

 Q. Did you like the new rule where you can call the coach on the court?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: No. Actually, I'm not. You know, for me tennis is like individual support. So maybe except the Federation Cup with the coaches. But for sure, for me it should be just the players on the court and that's it.

 Q. Daniela did today. Does it disrupt your game at all?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: No. If she does it just once. But for sure she's playing also just alone. The coach was just because she lost the first set.

 Q. Do you and your sister practice together daily?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah, actually we were practicing 15 years already. Together, of course.

 Q. Have you played each other in an international tournament?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: We played a lot in the juniors. You know, actually sometimes every week even, you know, in the finals, semifinals. But on the tour, no.

 Q. Right.
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: But, you know, it's strange. Even if I was playing with her a match it's not the same feeling. We playing just like a practice. You cannot feel the same nervous like against someone else.

 Q. After the Australian Open will you play Dubai, Paris?
 AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA: Yeah. Paris, Dubai by and Montreal.
