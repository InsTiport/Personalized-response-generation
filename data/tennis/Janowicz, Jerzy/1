 J. JANOWICZ/L. Hewitt
  7/5, 6/4, 6/7, 6/4, 6/3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   Can you just talk us through your assessment of that match?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   It's I think really good win for me.   I think Lleyton Hewitt is really dangerous player.   Doesn't matter how old is he and doesn't matter his ranking, he's extremely good player‑ especially on grass.  
So I had to play really good tennis today.   I had to be focused from the beginning.   A little bit unlucky moment in the third set tiebreak.   I took small risk on the second set‑‑ on the second serve when I had the first match point.   I missed like by four centimeters, and next match point he played winner down the line backhand exactly middle of the line.  
So a little bit unlucky there, but luckily I was able to pull it off.   I played unbelievable fifth set, and I'm really happy.  
   
 Q.   Tell us what you think of Lleyton Hewitt as a competitor.   There is some suggestion that this is probably his last match at Wimbledon in the singles and maybe his career.   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I don't know.   You have that kind of information or what?   
   
 Q.   Been suggested this will probably be his last match in Wimbledon and maybe his career.   Who knows?   Tell us what kind of competitor he is.   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I said already.   He's really, really good player.   Doesn't matter how old is he.   In my opinion, he will not finish the career like this.   He will still play at least two more years.   
I hope I will not play against him anymore.   As I said, he's really, really extremely good player.
