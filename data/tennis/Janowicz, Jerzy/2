THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Coming back to Wimbledon after how well you did last yeah, how do you feel?   Excitement?   Pressure?   What's the emotion coming back?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   It's of course nice to come back.   I have still in my mind what happened last year.  
But, you know, everything depends how I'm going to do this year.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   What were your thoughts on today's victory?   You had some periods that were very impressive, and then Devvarman was a very tough opponent.   How would you analyze it?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I'm a little bit disappointed because actually before the match I felt pretty okay.  
During the practice I played really good.   
Today, today I expect from myself a little bit more, but lucky that I pulled it off.   We'll see how it's going to be during the next match.  
   
 Q.   A lot of your ranking right now is built on the semifinal of Wimbledon last year.   Does that make you nervous at all?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Not on my mind.  
   
 Q.   No?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   (Shakes head.)  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on facing Lleyton Hewitt next?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Lleyton is really, really good player.   He won the Wimbledon, so he has a lot of experience.   He's extremely solid.   He has a great backhand.   He doesn't miss much.   He has a really nasty serve.   Maybe not that powerful, but it's really accurate.   
So I'll have to play my best tennis.   
   
 Q.   What's been the toughest part of the last 12 months for you?   Obviously you had the big result here and not as strong the rest of the year and this year so far.   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   What was the toughest part?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I lost my skill in Battlefield.  
   
 Q.   How did you lose your skill on the battlefield?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I lost my ranking a little bit and I had ‑‑ killing rate was much higher than now.   I had 2.2, and now it's 1.8.  
   
 Q.   What do you mean?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   You have killing statistics and death statistics.  
   
 Q.   Like a video game?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And now you're getting killed more often?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Yeah, definitely.  
   
 Q.   Any specific video game that has stat?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Battlefield.   
   
 Q.   Oh, just battle field.
