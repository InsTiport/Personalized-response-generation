 J. JANOWICZ/R. Stepanek
  6‑2, 5‑3 (ret.) 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   With these sort of circumstances, what are your thoughts going through your head?   
JERZY JANOWICZ:   Not much actually.   I'm a little bit disappointed because I don't like that kind of matches.  
I couldn't finish the match normally.   I don't know actually what happened to Radek.   Apparently he had some problems with the left leg.   I have nothing actually to say.   
As I said, I'm a little bit disappointed.   Today I felt pretty okay.   Especially from baseline I was really confident.   I was hitting the ball pretty well, pretty hard.   
So I was hoping I'm going to win this match normally.   
   
 Q.   How are you sort of feeling for the rest of tournament and how are you feeling in yourself?  
JERZY JANOWICZ:   I feel pretty okay.   Especially today I felt really good.   So this match gave me a lot of confidence right now.   I was serving good.   As I said before, from baseline I think this was my best match on grass so far.   
So, yeah, I'm looking forward for the next match already.
