D. KASATKINA/J. Konta
4-6, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you manage to pull that off?
DARIA KASATKINA: I don't know.  It was such a tough match.  We spent like three hours on the court, but felt like one hour on a court because I was so much in the match, yeah.
But now I feel a bit weird, yeah, because it's done.  It was such a big battle, such a big fight.  So I'm just happy that I survive.
Q. You looked a bit overwhelmed at the end of the match when you won.
DARIA KASATKINA: I mean, I don't know.  I didn't control my emotions, so...  Really, I was just playing with my instincts, and that's it, because my head was not working any more.
Q. You were very calm when you had the two match points against you.  How did you deal with that?
DARIA KASATKINA: It's tough to explain because when you are playing, you don't really feel that you have so much pressure on your shoulders.  Like, you don't follow the score that much.  It's a match point, but you feel like it's just a regular point.
That's why I was pretty calm.  I knew that my chance will come.
Q. What did you find most difficult about her game?
DARIA KASATKINA: It's tough to play Johanna, of course.  She's serving good.  She's playing very fast.  She's staying on the line.  She's playing very aggressive.  It's very tough to play against this kind of player, especially when they have a good day.
But I'm happy that I was able to manage it.
Q. The last part of the tiebreak looked like a lot of drama, even the challenge at the end.
DARIA KASATKINA: Oh, my God, that shot.
Q. What was going through your mind?
DARIA KASATKINA: I decided to took a challenge just in the last moment.  Normally if you are watching from the side, you immediately say 'challenge' on this one.  I was standing there thinking maybe it's not.  I had four challenges on this tiebreak, and I was thinking to challenge the ball, the only one my set point.  Can you imagine what was happening in my head (smiling)?
Q. How do you think you can recover and play again tomorrow?
DARIA KASATKINA: Thanks God I'm still young.  Yeah, I have still some power, some energy.  But of course we will see tomorrow because now I'm under adrenaline, so I don't feel anything.  Actually, I'm ready to go and play another one (smiling).
But tomorrow we will see.
