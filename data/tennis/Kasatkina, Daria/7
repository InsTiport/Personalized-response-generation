D. KASATKINA/A. Van Uytvanck
5-7, 6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk us through how you turned that match around.
DARIA KASATKINA: It was a tough match from the beginning.  So, yeah, I'm happy that at the beginning of the second set I was able to forget about the first set and just continue to play and show I think not a bad level of tennis.
Q. How do you think you turned the match around at the end of the second set?  She seemed to be getting quite frustrated in the second set.
DARIA KASATKINA: Tough to say.  It was just trying to fight, because I didn't feel my game so good today.  I just talked to myself, like, Dash, okay, just go for it and try to put so many balls as possible in the other side.  And it worked.
Q. How would you describe your relationship with grass?  Is it a surface you like it play on, or...
DARIA KASATKINA: Relationship?  It's not too long.  But tough to say because I just spent maybe 10 matches on grass on my life.
But I like to practice on grass.  It's special.  I feel free.  I feel very good.  But during the match is a different story, but still, I like this feeling to play on grass.
Q. Do you think that will come with experience with more matches on the grass?  Do you think you'll feel more comfortable?
DARIA KASATKINA: Of course.  I think when I played my first match on grass when I was a junior, oh, my God.  It was a disaster (smiling).  Yeah.
Now it's getting better and better.  I think experience with the years and with the matches it will come.
Q. Do you feel like your confidence is at a good level?  You have had a good season.  How are you feeling about the way things are going?
DARIA KASATKINA: Trying not to think about it, because what is in the past, and the most important thing is the next match and next point.  So, yeah, I already forgot about anything that I achieve, because the most important matches are coming.
Q. You've got Sevastova next.  Can you just talk about that matchup.
DARIA KASATKINA: She loves to play on grass (smiling).  Yeah, it's going to be tough, for sure, because she's very strong player.  Yeah, that's it.
We played last time like few years ago, 25,000, Belarussia.  So it's going to be new match, new fight.
Q. Have you been enjoying your time in Eastbourne away from tennis?
DARIA KASATKINA: Honestly, nothing to do almost (smiling).  And mostly I'm playing tennis, so not so much time.
Only the thing I'm doing except playing tennis is watching World Cup in the evenings, sometimes during the day.  So this is the only thing.
Q. Aside from Russia, obviously, who have you been watching in the World Cup?
DARIA KASATKINA: Spain, for sure.  Of course Spain.  Today I got to watch Argentina.  Actually, I'm watching almost every match.  I'm trying to watch all the matches, but the priorities is Russia, Spain, and Argentina.
Q. Do you find that relaxes you away from tennis?  You don't think about tennis when you're watching?
DARIA KASATKINA: Honestly, all the time I'm thinking about tennis (smiling).  Yeah, tennis players are addicted.  So that's it.
Q. You mentioned that you still haven't really got used to grass.  You almost beat Venus Williams a couple years ago at Wimbledon.
DARIA KASATKINA: No idea how it comes to the third set and 10-8 in the third.  And I remember it was a big drama match because of the rain delay and the match point, and 10-8 in the third.
It gives me actually a lot of experience to play on such a big court against such a legend and on the grass.  So, yeah.  It was nice experience.
Q. Are you hoping for more big matches at Wimbledon this year?
DARIA KASATKINA: Of course.  Why I'm coming there (smiling).
