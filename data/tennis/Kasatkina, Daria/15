THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Was it just too difficult tonight?
DARIA KASATKINA: Yeah, I mean, it was tough.  I think Elina, she was the toughest opponent for this final.  Yeah, she was playing really good during all week.  In the final, she show I think her best tennis.
Yeah, it was really tough.
Q. You played more than four hours longer on the court than she had this week.  You had an extra match because she had a first-round bye.  Do you think that showed in the end?  Were you a little weary out there?
DARIA KASATKINA: It just happened.  Maybe I could won the match not in three hours, maybe I could won in less.
It's okay.  Happens often, yeah.  If you are top player, you are getting bye, and you are going through the first round.  It is what it is.
Q. What do you take away from this week, getting to the final?
DARIA KASATKINA: Only positive things, of course.  I mean, I spent amazing 12 hours on the central court.  Yeah, I won four unbelievable matches.
Yeah, okay, I didn't have enough for the final, but still it was very nice week.
Q. I heard you say you felt your legs were like bubbles, but it looked like you were still trying to run.
DARIA KASATKINA: Of course, it is finals.  You are trying to run, trying to reach every ball.  Not every day you are playing finals.
Yeah, it was really tough.  I must come and say it, yes, I was tired.  I think everybody saw it.  It's not an excuse.  It's okay.
Q. You're disappointed to lose, but you can't be disappointed with your effort this week.
DARIA KASATKINA: With the what?
Q. With your effort this week.
DARIA KASATKINA: Yeah, of course.  As I said, it was really a good week, so...
Q. Best week of your career?
DARIA KASATKINA: Yes and no.  If I would win today, yeah, for sure is going to be best week of my career.  But for the moment, not yet.
Q. What does it feel like to be a player in the world's top 20?
DARIA KASATKINA: Regular.  I don't know.  I want to be higher than just top 20.  It's just the next step.
Q. What is your aim for this year, ranking aim?
DARIA KASATKINA: I already said it few days ago.  Like top 15 this year and then we will see.
Q. Looking ahead, Indian Wells coming up.  What kind of confidence do you take from this?
DARIA KASATKINA: Of course, a lot of confidence because I beat, like, one of the best players in the world during this week.  Of course, I will take a lot of lessons from that.
Q. You get your biggest paycheck out of tennis out of this tournament.  How will you treat yourself?
DARIA KASATKINA: I don't know.  I will see.  Didn't think about it because I was too focused on the next games, so...
Now I can think little bit about it.
Q. Will you go home before going to Indian Wells or straight to the States?
DARIA KASATKINA: I will decide just now.  Didn't think about it.  That's it.
