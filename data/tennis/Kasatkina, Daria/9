S. STEPHENS/D. Kasatkina   
6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Obviously commiserations for the loss.  Just wondering, during the first couple of games, it felt like it took you a while to get your footing in the match, and then towards the middle of the first set that you were...  
DARIA KASATKINA: Actually, from the beginning of the match, I was feeling pretty good.   
Just a really few balls at the beginning decides that she was 4-1 up, and then it was kind of I came back.  But, yeah, the game on 4-3 down.  And my serving decides everything on the first set.  And the second set, she just continued to put the pressure.   
And she won.  Actually, yeah, she was better than me today.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you were just running out of options in the second set?  That she was finding an answer to everything?  How did it feel to you?  
DARIA KASATKINA: Yeah, exactly.  I was feeling that the conditions was pretty good for her, better than for me, because I couldn't make a winner.  Anything I was spinning, it was just on a good spot for her.  And she was moving unbelievable.   
I really felt like I have to not even fight.  Like, I don't know.  Yeah, fight like crazy for every ball.  That's it.   
 Q.  Sloane has been in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam a few times before.  This was your first one.  You had to play yesterday, obviously, which is also different.  Did it feel like this was a new occasion for you?  This was something different that maybe you were less prepared for?  
DARIA KASATKINA: I don't know.  Maybe it was a little bit more difficult for me, but it doesn't matter.  I have to get used to.  It happens.   
Okay, because of the schedule, I was playing last match.  And she got, like, almost two days off, one-and-a-half days off.  But it doesn't matter, because, yeah, because today it was not about it.   
 Q.  Looking back at this tournament, making quarterfinals is important, but how much do you take out of these eight days here, and how much do you feel you've learned also just in terms of just everything?  
DARIA KASATKINA: A lot, actually, because I realize that the second week of the Grand Slam feels differently than the first week.   
Yeah, I'm really happy to have this experience, especially in Roland Garros.  And for sure I'm sure that it will help me in the future.   
 Q.  How exactly does it feel different?  Can you just give a few examples?  A few pinpoints?  
DARIA KASATKINA: I don't know how to explain.  Just the atmosphere in the club and on the stadium was different.   
Because also -- and for me it's different because I start first two, three matches on the smaller courts and then, thereafter, the bigger stages and I play on the bigger courts.  And for me it feels differently from Serena or someone else who is starting from the first round to play Philippe Chatrier.  But for me it was different.   
And I'm really happy to have this experience.
