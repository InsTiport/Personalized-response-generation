THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Just how are you feeling about your tennis today and after -- I think you did pretty well in Rome.  So it seems to be doing well.  
DARIA KASATKINA: Yeah, getting better.  Thank you.   
The beginning of the match was pretty nervous because the weather conditions and the first round of my favorite tournament.  So I was pretty nervous.  But then I'm happy I was able to fix it and to play good tennis today.   
 Q.  Aside from the clay, what makes Roland Garros your favorite tournament?  
DARIA KASATKINA: Well, I won this tournament as a junior.  It was my first Grand Slam I ever played as a junior, too.  So, yeah, I had very special memories here.   
 Q.  You play with a lot of variety.  What is the toughest part about doing that in this sport where so many people are big and strong?  
DARIA KASATKINA: Now the tennis become more physical, physical sport.  So you have to be athletic, watching everything what you are doing, the food, the fitness, everything, when you go to sleep.   
And so it's everything, such small details that you have to follow if you want to be the best.  So I think this is the most tough, toughest moment.   
 Q.  And any satisfaction to outsmarting players, to reading their games and knowing how to beat them?  
DARIA KASATKINA: Well, sometimes I have too much this thoughts in my head, which is not helping me too much.   
But at the end, yeah, this is helping me a lot also, so I have to really mix it up.  And fix my head to do right, right decisions.   
 Q.  Finally, what have you been doing over the past few weeks to address those voices in your head and play clearly?  
DARIA KASATKINA: What I was doing what?   
 Q.  What have you been doing to try to --  
DARIA KASATKINA: Oh, to fix my head? (Laughing.)   
Okay.  Well, you have to -- I was working with Didac, first of all.  And second of all, it's coming with the matches, with experience, with everything like that.  It's not coming from the air just because you start to wanted to fix your head.   
So you have to work every practice, every match thinking about it, and it's getting better and better.  Thank you.
