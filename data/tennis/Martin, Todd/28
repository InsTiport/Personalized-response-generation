TODD MARTIN: Come on, Yevgeny isn't that much younger than me. How much? 

TODD MARTIN: All right, he is younger than me. Gee, you know, these conditions, one, I'm used to because I do a lot of training out here; and, two, I feel like with the lightness of the air here, the speed of the court and the speed of the ball, the three components have worked together perfectly, I don't think just for me but I think if you asked most of the guys out here, they're pretty comfortable with the way the conditions are. I think that helps make me feel a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more confident in myself. I feel like I am controlling the ball well. When I feel that way, I feel like I can compete with most anybody. 

TODD MARTIN: I feel pretty good. I've probably felt better once I got to the semifinals of a tournament before. You know, today, I guess you notice as you go along how much adrenaline affects how you feel. And I seem to feel okay today (smiling). 

TODD MARTIN: Well, the way our tournaments work, I think there's 52 direct acceptances into this tournament. I don't know, I don't think I was 64 at the time of entry, but I'm not sure. 

TODD MARTIN: So, you know, I called up and begged. I think Charlie and Ray saw that Michael and I both were off the acceptance list. I think Michael, due to the fact that he's Michael, has won this tournament three times, it was a no-brainer. And, fortunately, I was able to sneak in ahead of one of the young guys who would also have been a prospective wildcard candidate. I'll be sending Christmas cards to both of them for a long time. 

TODD MARTIN: Well... 

TODD MARTIN: You guys are all schmucks anyway (laughter). The way I feel about playing Tim is, one, he's one of my very favorite guys out here. I've said that about other players over the years, but I think he's a special guy. So from that standpoint, if I shake hands and say, "Good luck," it doesn't hurt quite as bad. But I think it's an interesting match-up because we both - and Tim probably a better job than I do - play the percentages pretty well. I think that, despite both of us sort of fighting for the opportunity to attack one another, I think it will provide a pretty interesting match. It usually does. It's a match-up that usually the guy who comes up with the good shots at the right time wins - similar to Yevgeny's and my match today. 

TODD MARTIN: That's the first I heard about it. It's at 3? 

TODD MARTIN: Well, I can tell you if a 31-year-old is in the final, he'll be happy. 

TODD MARTIN: Well, I think if you've never met him before, his perspective on competition, and our lifestyle, it's pretty refreshing. I think he holds things -- holds important things where they're supposed to be and holds this where it's supposed to be - not that "this" isn't important. You know, all the pressure he's ever had over in London, he's handled so well. It's simply because he understands that what happens, happens, and the best he can do is the best he can do. And then once you get to know him personally, you know, he's a mischievous, endearing personality that's always a pleasure to be around. 

TODD MARTIN: Well, I think, frankly, no offense to you, I don't think that question needs to be asked. I'm 31. I've made it to two Grand Slam finals. I've made it to one of these finals before. My highest ranking has been four, blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah. But I can still do better. And Tim is more than capable to do better. 

TODD MARTIN: Frankly, I think he's an early bloomer. He was on the tour at 18 or 19, started having great success at 22 or 23. Last I checked, you didn't have to be the most perfect shaped rose and the largest in order to be in bloom. So, I mean, he's been one of the best tennis players in the world for a number of years, and he will continue to be. 

TODD MARTIN: Boy, I'll beg to differ. I think -- I don't necessarily feel that Thomas Johansson or Richard Krajicek or some of these guys who have won Grand Slams, who have "broken through," are any better than the rest of us who haven't "broken through." You know, I think -- my hat's off to anybody whoever won a Grand Slam, but it says a lot to give yourself the opportunity to win those Grand Slams, as well. Take that for what you will. 

TODD MARTIN: Well, my frustrations sort of mounted last year at The Open. I sort of finally probably did the self-reflection, the serious self-reflection, that I needed to do a couple years ago - maybe a number of years ago. I was injured for a reason. I've been injured for a reason throughout my career. One, I'm probably a little bit predisposed due to my build. But, two, I've probably never been in as ideal of shape as an elite professional athlete should be. That's been my major objective since September. I've lost probably eight pounds, am much stronger and am in much better condition. Despite having tape on my knee, tape on my wrist, a few other things, I feel very good, I feel very healthy. It's just, I think, frankly years of not being in as ideal of shape as I could be, has taken a toll on my body in the long run, and now if tape holds me together, it holds me together. At least I'm not out there thinking, "What's going to go next?" I feel very strong and comfortable. 

TODD MARTIN: I remember being asked about what I was proud of like when I was 25 or 26. I said to whoever asked that question, "My dad taught me that pride was a sin." So I'm most pleased about having recovered from elbow surgery in '97 and the death of my father later that year, and having reasserted myself, started to play again like one of the best players in the world, which I felt like I was still capable of. That was sort of one of those look-in-the-mirror times. That definitely propelled me a bit, gave me a lot more confidence, and I learned a lot as a tennis player during that period of time - '98, '99. And I'm also pretty pleased with myself about what's transpired in the last six months. I think this has been -- you know, maybe there's not been glaring signs of it, but it's been -- it's been the most deserving I've ever been of the success I've had. 

TODD MARTIN: Because of the consistency with which I'm focused, with the amount of other things in my life that I'm balancing along with my career, and from maybe - most importantly - from what I'm absorbing from my experiences in the sport and how I'm applying them to my time on the court. 

TODD MARTIN: Well, you know what it does, it gives -- it might give me the soapbox to talk to some of the younger guys about, "Listen, you know, I certainly didn't throw away years, but I didn't make the most of some of the years I had." That feels a lot better than throwing them away, but it doesn't feel great. But I'm a big believer in, you know, the path you take is really just as important as where you get to. 

TODD MARTIN: No. I think Patrick should understand that before this tournament I had been playing very well this year, and he should understand that Pete's coming into form, and he should understand that Andy is in form and hasn't proven to be out of form in quite some time, not to mention James Blake has been playing great this year, too. I think all that Patrick needs to do is understand his choices and be confident in whichever choice he makes. I don't think success in any one tournament should alter too much his perception of what his roster has in store for him. 

TODD MARTIN: Oh, my God (laughter). In answer to your very interesting question, I think experience makes a difference; however, there's a certain point where talent outweighs experience, and also the opportunity to provide experience outweighs experience also. I think finally Patrick's in an enviable position, to have choices. 

TODD MARTIN: Well, I did a little post match interview on the court, and I said the same thing. I think Yevgeny probably did out-play me. However, I think that's one of the neatest things about our sport, is the scoring system is geared towards critical moments. During those critical moments, he didn't out-play me. And that's encouraging for me. With regard to Tim playing against me, I think Tim does pose a great challenge to me. But over the years, I've had better success against Tim than I've had against Yevgeny. The nice thing about it is we don't have to rely on anybody else's opinion. I think we get to go out and see who plays better tomorrow. It will be fun doing so. 

TODD MARTIN: How many breakpoints did I have? 

TODD MARTIN: (Applauding.) What's your question? 

TODD MARTIN: I think the first game and the third game of the second set were most critical. I was down I think Love-40 in the first game or 15-40, right after having won the first set in a good tiebreak. Got through that game. He held easily. Then right away I was back in the thick of things. We were to switch balls right after my serve, so we were playing with as slow a tennis ball as possible. That's the most difficult time for me to have success against Yevgeny. One, I probably served better, I mixed up my serve well, and I didn't just ace my way out of it. I did hit a couple big serves at critical times on breakpoints. But for the most part, I felt like I planned the point well in my head and then I executed it accordingly. And that's when the sport's the easiest to play.
