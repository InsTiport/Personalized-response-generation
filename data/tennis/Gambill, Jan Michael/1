THE MODERATOR:  We'll open it up for questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Obviously, a rough day.
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Yeah, it was a bit of a rough day.  I thought I should have hit the ball a little bit better.  Just not quite in good enough shape yet from injuries and taking time off to really go out there and compete in long points at this point. 
 

Q.  Are you frustrated at all, with what happened in Indianapolis?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Yeah, it's very frustrating.  It's unfortunate, you know, the affliction that I had in Indianapolis and then having to take -- forced to take more time off when I know I need to be training.  When I'm relatively injury-free, it's kind of -- it is, it's unfortunate. 
 

Q.  I know you were dizzy.  Whatever happened with that?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  I was having a breathing problem basically.  That's in past tense, so... We've come to figure out what it was. 
 

Q.  So what was it really?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  That's what we know.  I mean, (inaudible) in sharing that. 
 

Q.  Okay.  Is that taken care of now?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  So you're basically 100 percent?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Well, not quite.  But I'm getting there. 
 

Q.  You play all over the world at the tournaments.  How does Cincinnati compare to the rest of them?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Oh, Cincinnati's one of the best tournaments of the entire year.  It's great.  These facilities are fantastic.  They take care of the players extremely well.  There's lots of fun things to do in this area.  I loved playing here every year I've come here, so it's been a wonderful time I've had here over the past years. 
 

Q.  For me, like you see Paris, you see London, you see Monte-Carlo.  Then you throw Cincinnati in there.  From an outsider's standpoint, it seems kind of funny, like it shouldn't be with Paris and all that stuff.  Apparently, the facilities and everything really stack up, though.
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  Paris doesn't even compare to these facilities.  They have three courts.  You know, I'm an American, and no European city is going to compare with an American city to me.  And any time I can play at home in the United States, it's 100 times better (inaudible). 
 

Q.  Plus we have the Eiffel Tower here (laughing).
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  That's right.  Anything they can do, we can do. 
 

Q.  You said you hit the ball pretty well.  Do you feel like there's any kind of confidence you can take from the match?  I mean, do you feel like you're playing better?
 
JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL:  I'm playing better, hitting the ball okay, just making a lot of errors.  I hadn't had trouble with Gaudio before.  Coming here, I hadn't played him for -- since US Open two years ago was last we played.  I felt pretty comfortable during the match, but I just didn't get it done.  Just played a lot of dumb points out there.
