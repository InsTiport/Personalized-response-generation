 THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please. Q. The passing shot at love 2 when you had breakpoint...MARA SANTANGELO: Was out (laughing).  Q. What went through your head when you missed it? MARA SANTANGELO: I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Was a very important point, and when I had the ball for the passing, I get little bit tight. Probably that's why it comes out.  Q. Were you surprised at how well your approaches were working against her at the end of the second and start of the third? It's almost as if you didn't have to volley that much. MARA SANTANGELO: No, not really, I didn't surprise because I played few matches on this level, especially on the last few weeks. So I'm pretty in confidence. That's why.
