Thanks all fans, supporting us today.  Always in Melbourne I have really great memory, so amazing tonight.  I still couldn't believe that we make finals, Sam!
Q. You guys have a nice partnership here.  Had a nice win last year in Hong Kong.  You have continued the form this year?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: Yeah, we are on a bit of a roll, so hopefully we can keep it going in the final.  That would just be amazing for us.  Yeah, we are playing really well.  We might as well give it a crack.
Q. Coming up shortly, a couple of hot days as well.  How do you prepare in the heat?
SAMANTHA STOSUR: I'd rather play in the heat than play in this.  I'll be looking forward to that.  We will be prepared.  We've got a day off tomorrow.  We are going to do everything we can, come out and play as best as we can.  Yeah, we will see how it goes.
