6-2, 1-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.
Q. In your doubles yesterday, I felt like there were ups and downs in the matches today as well as yesterday. Any impact from previous matches?
ZHANG SHUAI: Doubles yesterday, well, I wasn't playing very well. Today in the opening I wasn't feeling great. I was trying to play more aggressively, to raise my form.
In the middle of the match, I felt some improvement. At the end of the match, I wasn't able to take the key points, so I lost the match.
Q. You're partnered with Samantha Stosur. Any expectations of making it into the WTA Finals?
ZHANG SHUAI: We will try our best. At the start of the year we had good runs. After that we didn't play that many matches, only a few events we played. In the Asian swing, we will try to play more matches.
Q. We're at the end of this year. What do you think of your performance this year in singles and doubles? What are your expectations for next year with the Olympics, your schedule for next year?
ZHANG SHUAI: Definitely some adjustments. This year I felt it was a year of breakthroughs in doubles. I was able to make some breakthroughs in the Grand Slams. I was really happy to see my performance this year.
In the Asian swing, in these tournaments, I was able to come up with a better game style. I need to adjust for a new start, a fresh start next year.
Q. Three-setter last year with Kerber. How would you compare the differences?
ZHANG SHUAI: The difference is that last time I was able to keep my advantage. This time when I was ahead, probably at the beginning of the third set, there were two or three times to break her serve, but I wasn't able to convert.
Other than that, I don't see much difference. How should I say? There were good things that I did well, but also some things I need to improve on. This is why I need more practice, to improve every day.
