Q. What do you think of the Open so far? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I feel pretty good. I didn't expect to play on Center Court at all
because I thought they are going to put me on one of the outside courts. 

Q. Is it the largest stadium you have played on? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I played in Melbourne in Australian Open, quite the same, quite the
same. 

Q. What did playing out here mean to you? I mean, was that -- 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: This is my first time at the U.S. Open. This tournament quite
important for me. If I do well here, I mean, I can approach top 10, if not, next time. 

Q. What do you think of the whole atmosphere surrounding you? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I mean, it is really tough to concentrate in the match because, you
know, it is little bit noisy on the court. It is noisier on the court and people are
walking between the points and very tough to concentrate. 

Q. You were supposed to play when, yesterday or last night? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I don't know. 

Q. The extra day's rest -- 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: It really helped me. I recovered well. Now I feel I can go longer
than second round. 

Q. Because you were so concerned after playing so much last week? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: And especially the weather today wasn't that hot like in Hamlet, it
was nice to play today. 

Q. So now you feel you have enough energy to go -- 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Sure. 

Q. What happened in that first set, you got angry with yourself? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Sure, because I was serving for the set and I got two bad calls. I
don't know, maybe -- I don't know if linesmen did it on purpose but, I mean, I was sure
the wall was going out, and twice he said ball was good and I was angry with that, I mean
-- 

Q. You were angry with the call not with yourself? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, with the call. Those two calls would cost me all the match. I
mean, I saved four set points in the first set, could turn another one. 

Q. Do you think your anger helps you? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Sure. I started to, you know, to fight. Before I was a little bit
just concentrated, but then after that, I thought I don't want to lose the first round at
the U.S. Open. 

Q. In the Grand Slams you played so far, which is the place you like best to play at? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: The most easiest for me is Australian Open because I like is the
atmosphere there, it is not like here. Here it is like a nightmare. You cannot walk here
easily, everybody touching you, whatever,. 

Q. Did you hear that before you got here? Were you preparing yourself? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I expect that, but not that much.
