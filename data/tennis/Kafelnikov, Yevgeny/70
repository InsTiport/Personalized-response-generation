YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I couldn't read which side Patrick was going to serve.  Just shows that I was a little bit tired.  Doubles, played a lot of night matches.  This week I've played doubles at night.  I got tired.  I feel like my game is starting to come back a little bit, you know, we'll see how it's going to be next few weeks.

Q.  Do you ever feel that maybe the doubles wasn't a good idea for you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  It's a very good idea.  I'll show you why.  You come and watch.

Q.  Because you don't worry about your singles that much?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Something I can tell you.  I play good this week because I got a lot of matches last week in Toronto, singles and doubles.  I'm sure I'll play better  next week.

Q.  When he got his first break, did that demoralize you at all?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  No.  I was still trying to get it back, even though I had a chance the very next game, I had Love-30.  He came up with unbelievable shot, which I never thought he could have made it.  I knew if I would get that break, I would be still (inaudible).  Who knows, from that point on, it might turn things all the way around.  Like I said, he played a terrific match.  That probably was only chance that I could have.  His serve was too good.

Q.  Are you kind of surprised that he doesn't seem to get tired after having won in Toronto?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I guess if you physical condition at a high level, at this moment, no matter what kind of matches you play, you still going to be fine.  Like I said, I haven't had too much success lately. Maybe this put me in the position where wasn't focussing on a certain point of the game.  Once you get a few matches in a row, you feel your body is starting to get tired.  Played three matches in a row.  Got a little bit tired.
