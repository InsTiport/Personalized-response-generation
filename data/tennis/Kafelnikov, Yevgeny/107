 Q. How do you feel because everybody says that you could even win this tournament? Do
you have the feeling? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Who is saying that?  
 
Q. Me. 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Did you bet on that?  
 
Q. I may do it. 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Actually, I am not thinking like you think. I don't feel I can win
this tournament.  
 
Q. You have to play Stich. You beat him four times; correct? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I won 4 out of 5 matches against Michael.  
 
Q. How do you explain it? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Well, ask Michael. He can explain to you everything. I don't know.
By the way, did you speak with him?  
 
Q. I saw that match. But I'd like to know it from you. 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Well, I don't know, actually what I am doing right or wrong when I
am playing against Michael, but something happened during all those five matches when I
beat him. Next one is going to be completely different because this is the Grand Slam
tournament. This is the fourth round match.  
 
Q. Have you played him on this surface before? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: We played actually once on the fast surface, indoor, I beat him,
very, very tough match. But I mean this time it is completely different thing.  
 
Q. How did you play today against Costa; did you feel good? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I can say I have been playing smart today, smart.  
 
Q. Smart? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah, that is why I won this match. And because you know, it was
very tough conditions. It was lots of wind today on the court, which Carlos don't like. He
likes to stay on the baseline. I was trying to attack him every single point, which I have
done successfully.  
 
Q. Another person was thinking that you could become top 3 player in the world Andrei,
Medvedev, do you have any comment on this? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: You know, it is tough. It is tough to be one of the top three
players in the world, no. No way that I can get there.  
 
Q. Do you remember when you were one year ago, I mean, twelve months ago, did you think
about the possibility to go so forward? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Well, the thing is that all the time I believe in myself, so I was
thinking that one day I can be very good; not good as I am right now, but I would be
thinking that I could be in the top 50. That was my.  
 
Q. 50? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: 50.  
 
Q. So you surprised yourself? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Sure. Everybody surprises, all you guys surprised. My family is
surprised. Everybody is surprise.  
 
Q. Do you have anybody of your family here? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No, I don't want them to travel with me.  
 
Q. You are alone completely with your coach? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Just my coach.  
 
Q. Was the match with Sampras at the Australian Open a turning point? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: A lot. A lot. That match give me lots of confidence, I must say
that.  
 
Q. It was a great match? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah, it was a great match. I think Pete also got confidence from
that one. That is why he is almost unbeatable right now.  
 
Q. Do you have a goal now in your mind? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: My goal for this year was to stay -- to break top 50 which is I
did.  
 
Q. And now? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Now.  
 
Q. You are conservative or you want to do something more? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah, I want to play the matches the end of the year.  
 
Q. Top 8 you are trying to get? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah.  
 
Q. Listen when you don't play tennis, what is your favorite. . . . 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: You know, I am travelling almost every week, I am all the time on
the courts, so I have nothing, nothing to do, basically.  
 
Q. You play chess? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I don't like those kind of games, you have to concentrate for, I
don't know, 25 minutes in order to play one game. That one I don't like.  
 
Q. What else? What do you do? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Well, you know, sometimes when I am not playing I am trying to go
somewhere to relax, because it is really tough to be on the courts all the time, to
concentrate.  
 
Q. Do you go back every once in awhile, Sochi and how popular are you there? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Last time I was there was three and a half months so I want to see
my family so bad. I want to go there so much. I am missing them.  
 
Q. When are you going to get back there? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: After this tournament, hopefully.  
 
Q. Then you have Davis Cup? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Ooh, yeah, big match coming up.  
 
Q. What chances do you give to yourself? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Always chances.  
 
Q. They are going to play on what surface? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Green set, fast surface, but you know, Michael is playing
unbelievable. He has a great record in the Davis Cup matches; almost win everything.  
 
Q. Do your parents -- will they be able to see your match with Stich on television? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I would any so, yeah. Russian -- they are doing U.S. Open, so...
They are going to be able to see me. Let's hope I am going to play on Center Court.  
 
Q. The Center Court is a little faster -- is a little slower than the other courts? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah, I would say so.  
 
Q. That bothers you, you normally prefer faster court or not? 
 
 YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: My chances on the Stadium court is much better than on the
Grandstand because, you know, the court is much slower, a little bit slower, but Michael's
serve, nothing much you can do on the fast court.
