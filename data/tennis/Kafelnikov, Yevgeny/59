Q. What was the difference between last year's match and this one?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: You know, different circumstances. Carlos was playing first World
Championship, unexperienced. I guess there was a difference. I had already played three
times before. That was the difference.

Q. Do you think he was less nervous this year?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I don't know if he was -- probably he was nervous. But, you know,
that's obvious and it's logical. You know, we're both nervous. It was really important for
both of us to win the match. Unfortunately, I come up short. You know, that's the way it
goes.

Q. It looks like you had problems with serve and your forehand today especially. Do you
have any explanation about that?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: You know, it's difficult to explain why on particular day this
aspect of the game is not working. It was one of the days where I was maybe -- I cannot
say that I was not focused enough. I was focused. I was ready to play. But, you know, the
circumstances were different. I was forced to make those mistakes because I knew I had to
play aggressive to beat him. But, unfortunately, didn't work today.

Q. Did you make a decision about your next coach for next year?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah.

Q. Who will it be?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: It's Larry Stefanki.

Q. He was working with Bjorkman?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: But we talked long time ago. We decided to work together.

Q. Is a one-year deal, just for one year?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I mean, I cannot say it's one year. It depends how we like each
other. If we work successful, we'll continue going on.

Q. Can you tell us your feeling about performance of Pete who is No. 1 sixth year in a
row?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No comment. You know, he just shows on the court. You know, I
cannot say anything more about it. He is No. 1. He's the best. That's it.

Q. Did you realize what it is to be No. 1 six year in a row?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No question, it's the biggest achievement. I don't know who would
be the next guy who would break his record. Maybe it never happen. You know, he
definitely, you know, best player ever which has played in this wonderful game.

Q. Are you satisfied with this year's season?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Very much right now, yes.

Q. Are there any moments that are special for you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Not exactly, but the end of the year was really, really special. I
played some good tennis. You know, I'm happy to finish the year on this positive note.

Q. Will you be in Melbourne this year?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Next year, you mean, '99?

Q. Yes.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there.

Q. You will play an exhibition in Chile?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, I go 9th of December to Santiago to play exhibition with
Marcelo.

Q. What do you think about it?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Big adventure. We'll see.
