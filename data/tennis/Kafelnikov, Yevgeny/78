Q.  Yevgeny, you're in the semifinals.  Tell me about this match.  How important was it to you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  You mean the particular one today against Henman?
  

Q.  Yes.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Well, it was match which is for me didn't mean anything.  You know, I've done what was necessary.  Yesterday I qualify for the semifinal.  Just today was the match for you guys, for the journalists (laughter).  We played, as I can say, more exhibition match.
  

Q.  Keep going.  Keep talking about it.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  You tell me.  You ask me something, and I'll answer.
  

Q.  When was the last time you played a match so relaxed?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  It's been a long time.  I just can't remember when I was playing so relieved, you know, I  had nothing behind my back.  I had something -- today was just an exceptional.
  

Q.  Did you have a good time?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  We had a good time.  I had a good time.  I had three points, which I was enjoying, and I'm sure Tim enjoyed it, too.
