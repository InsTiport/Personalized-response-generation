Q. How much pressure is that for you to carry your team? 
 
YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I didn't want to put all the responsibility on Marat because he never played Davis Cup and if he would have started first, then might be different story.  But, I am glad that I am starting and everything will  -- I think that match is the most important.  If I win that one, then I think we have a pretty good chance.  If I win that match first match, I think our team has a pretty good chance of winning everything. 
   

Q. Marat, are you nervous?
 
MARAT SAFIN:  No.  It is a great opportunity, good chance for me to play this.  I am just happy. 
   

Q. How important is the doubles?
 
YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Very important.  But, it is somehow the one team who gets two points in the first day, I don't think the doubles will really matter. 
   

Q. What about playing all these matches, and the fatigue factor?
 
YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I have been in that situation, I think 14 times where I had to play singles and doubles, four singles and one doubles, and, you know, in all those situations where I had to play, I was coming off very  successfully.  So, I never had any problem with physical conditioning.  I have been handling it pretty well.  So, it is not an exception this time.  I am still going to play two singles and one doubles match.
