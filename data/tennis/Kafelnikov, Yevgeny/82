Q. I just had two quick questions for you.  Did you feel like you were in control the whole match today?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I felt like, yeah, I'm a favorite.  But it was a couple stages in the match, especially in the second set, where I thought things might change.  But, you know, those crucial stages, I was able to play right shot at the right time.  That's why I think it's a win for me, you know, pretty comfortable.


Q. You've been in the semifinals twice, I think here, right?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Right.


Q. What do you think your chances of winning it this time are?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I guess I have to take every match at a time.  My next match will be on Thursday, so I can have -- I will have tomorrow a day off.  I can use it as a good practice day.  I will practice all the aspects of my game which is going to be necessary to play either Rusedski or Woodbridge.  Overall, I feel I'm going to be in a good shape on Thursday.


Q. How do you feel on this fast surface?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Well, I always like the indoor surface because, you know, my game is very simple.  You know, I rely on my groundstrokes and a little bit on my serve.  On this kind of surface, it's really helpful.  So that's why no wind, no sun, nothing bothering you.  It's really good for me.


Q. How is your health?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  To be honest, I don't feel so fresh, for example.  That's the only concern I have. Otherwise, you know, my finger is perfect.  I feel very healthy.


Q. You did that at the Australian Open, is that right?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  That's correct.
