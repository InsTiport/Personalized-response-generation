Q. Did you know that you could save Ferreira?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I knew that, yeah.

Q. You knew that?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah.

Q. Is that the most boisterous crowd you ever played in front of?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: To be honest, no. I had some better crowds in some other countries.
For instance, like France, but it is no question that the Germans is the most country for
support for their own player.

Q. How difficult does it make it for you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: It was difficult for me to play there because everybody was on
Boris's side and I think that because of the support, it helped him a lot to win the match
today. Especially, two straight sets, which is what he needed.

Q. Does anybody ever serve aces on the second serve at 181? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No. Never. I mean, same time Boris knew that this is the only
chance for him to stay in the tournament and -- I think he deserved that place in the
semifinals in this World Championship.

Q. Did you think you had a couple of very important calls which went the wrong way?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, especially I think it was 4-3 in the first set, 30-15, first
serve went wide, very long, and I don't know if the linesman did it on purpose. He didn't
say anything. But when I was trying to say something to the chair umpire and the crowd
started whistling at me, I got so upset with that because I knew for sure that the ball
went long and that is why I couldn't keep my emotions inside of me and just exploded.

Q. Did you say something to Becker at that moment?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No. Nothing.

Q. Do you think you might have had any sort of come back from what happened in Moscow
in the Davis Cup semifinal, the crowd's reaction?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Maybe, yeah. Because in Moscow, we had an unbelievable crowd and
Moscow crowd was on the other side -- on our side. So, I think it was a sort of a payback
for me here in Germany. 

Q. You obviously didn't realize it at the time, but I think the crowd was whistling at
you when you queried that call. They just seen the playback on television and saw that it
really was a bad call; they were whistling at the call itself. I don't think --

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I thought they were starting to whistling at me.

Q. I think they started initially until they actually saw the replay.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I didn't know that they were whistling at the linesman; otherwise,
of course, I wouldn't do what I have done, so I am kind of regret it myself.

Q. Today, when you go on court for a match like that because, you know, you had --
you're not going to qualify for the semifinal --

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I knew winning one set I would help a friend of mine, Wayne
Ferriera, to be in the semifinal. I was doing my best what I could today in the match, but
unfortunately, it didn't work my way. Unfortunately, Wayne couldn't qualify, but as I was
saying, Boris deserves to play in the semifinal.

Q. Which part of the game do you like most; could you tell us, in your words, what part
you like most? 

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Can you describe -- I don't speak German.

Q. That part of the game you like most, have most fun?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: From my point of view?

Q. Yes.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: In my game?

Q. Yes.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Or in Boris' game?

Q. In both your games. If you want both, the game of both.

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Well, I would say there was very exciting game today. We had some
nice rallies, I mean, we are totally different players. Boris is a strong player. He has a
big serve. He knows how to play volley. That is his best game. My game is to be on the
baseline and when two players with completely opposite games compete with each other, I
think it is fun to watch it. Because everybody producing best what they can and in the
game. I am sure it was a very wonderful game for the spectators to watch; especially with
Boris winning the match.

Q. You have heard of the problems of Steffi Graf in Germany. Who is managing your
earnings, IMG or your family?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: IMG Management.

Q. They do all the stuff with the money?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, they do everything.

Q. And you know exactly what happens with all of the things? Do you have a look into
this?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, I know exactly what is going on with my financial situation.

Q. Yeah?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yeah.

Q. What are you doing between now and Davis Cup?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I am going to go home to see my family tomorrow.

Q. What sort of atmosphere is there compared with the buildup to last year's final?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: We are expecting more crowd - that is the main thing. And hopefully
that will help us to win the first Davis Cup.

Q. When are you all getting together?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Saturday.

Q. How big is the hope in Russia that Agassi doesn't make it?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I am sure the United States team is strong even without Andre. They
can put, I don't know, Jim Courier with Michael Chang; it could be the same team, or Jim
Courier with Pete Sampras. I mean, they can put anyone they want and the team will still
be strong.

Q. What about your knee, is it all right now?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: My knee, yeah. I checked with the doctor yesterday and it is no
problem. I can play.

Q. It didn't hurt you today?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No. Not at all. When I knew that results I was really happy;
especially here mentally, because when I felt pain in my knee it last a -- last couple of
last week; it was really difficult for me mentally to keep that inside, but yesterday when
I knew that with my knee everything is going okay, I was really happy with that.

Q. Was the reason you put away your (pointing to knee) --

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Yes, that was the reason.
