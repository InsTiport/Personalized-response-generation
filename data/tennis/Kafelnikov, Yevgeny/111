Q.  What did it feel playing and winning Agassi that way?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  What do you mean that way?


Q.  Well, being down in the first set and coming back in the match?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Well, it is difficult because Agassi is always like Jesus wherever he goes.  But I had no pressure on the court because I am used to playing top guys like Sampras.


Q.  What did Sampras's experience bring to you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Now I feel more confidence when I play against top guys.


Q.  What happened during the first set, did you think you could play better or did he play very well?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  He was fresh and he made no easy mistakes. So that is why it was easy for him.  But after he was tired.


Q.  Did you change anything in your game?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I just tried to do my best and I did.


Q.  Did the fact that you felt he was tired in the third set encourage you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Yes, he made more easy mistakes.  I didn't do anything special.  I just tried to hit every ball back.


Q.  So you think his physical condition let him down?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Yes, I do.


Q.  Is clay your worst surface?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I can tell you, it is not my best.  I won tournaments indoors, but in three matches on clay, I didn't win a single set.  I am not as comfortable as on hard surfaces.


Q.  Why?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I don't move well enough on clay; especially against those Spanish guys with their topspin.


Q.  In your country do you have clay courts?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Yes, of course, there are more clay courts, but you can compare me with Volkov.  Chesnokov is a good example of a clay court player.


Q.  What did this victory bring to you?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Now I feel more confident for the next round.


Q.  What do you prefer, winning a tournament or beating a top guy like this?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  It is difficult to say.  Winning a tournament means five matches.  Here it is only one.


Q.  Do you feel Agassi is not as good on clay as he used to be?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I don't know when he played on clay for the last time.  I think it was in Barcelona last year. When you play all year-round on hardcourts, it is very difficult to start playing on clay.


Q.  Did he say anything to you afterwards?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  No.  Just shake my hand; nothing else.


Q.  Do you believe that you are able to beat the other top guys now?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Well, I beat twice already Michael Stich.


Q.  So you have a lot of confidence against the top guys?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Yeah.  I didn't feel any pressure, you know. I played Sampras when it was like, I don't know, 15,000 people at Melbourne, so --


Q.  Did you notice all the fuss that was going on  beside the court with Brooke Shields?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Excuse me?


Q.  No, you didn't then.


Q.  Do you know who Brooke Shields is?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  No.


Q.  You have never seen Brooke Shields in a movie?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  No.


Q.  She is a movie star?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Probably Andre's girlfriend, yeah?
