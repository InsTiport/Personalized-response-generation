Q. You have to obviously blame your serve for the loss today. Can you elaborate on
that?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I was basically forced to do that because, you know, Goran was
holding his serve, and he had so many free points. That's why, you know, I tried to play
the same game as he played. I've done that successfully basically for two sets, then in
the third, fourth, and fifth and deciding set, I got a little bit tired. That's why my
most double-faults came in those three sets.

Q. Yesterday you sounded like it was a mental thing. Is it mental or is it technical or
both?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Today was more physical because I was really, really, really tired.
You know, it was really hard to maintain that level that I was playing first two sets. As
I was saying before, you know, when the time comes to crucial points, I cannot respond
well enough on my serve. Basically that's what happened. The most important, I was forcing
myself to play very risky second serve. My serve ain't good enough. That's why, you know,
so many double-faults.

Q. Not to belabor it too much, but is this something you want to work on between now
and Australia?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Right now that's the main thing that I will work on. I'm pretty
satisfied with any other aspects but the serve. Hopefully, you know, in those two weeks'
time that I will prepare for the Australian Open, I will work specifically on that aspect.

Q. What is your next event actually?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: I play Adelaide.

Q. Do you plan to play less tournaments maybe next year?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No. I still will do same thing that I was doing before, play as
many tournaments and singles as I can, and doubles, too, because it really helps me.

Q. Singles and doubles?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Both, yes.
