MODERATOR:  Questions for Yevgeny. 


Q.  How impressed are you about the way Max has improved and he's still improving?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  Logical process, you know.  You're putting a lot of hard work, and it's paying out.  All I can say.  You know, Max dedicated himself to the game of tennis, even at that stage.  He's 24.  Still, if someone has a belief, he's going to accomplish what he wants.  He's doing that quite successfully. 


Q.  What would you say of your own performance today?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I have no complaints.  I give hundred percent.  Unfortunately, was short.


Q.  Have you been surprised that Max played the whole week as well as he did?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  I mean, I'm not surprised.  I just said hard work is paying out.  You know, he's doing what he's doing the best  - serving big, covering the net well, beating some top guys. 


Q.  The last six years you've always been in the Masters Cup at the end of the year.  Are you looking forward to Sydney?

YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV:  This is going to be my seventh.  '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000.  This will be my seventh year.  Great accomplishment.  What else can I say?  Looking forward to it, no question.
