a little better. 
 
Q. Elena, is it nerve-wracking coming out against the world's No. 2 player?

felt like I lacked experience. 
 
Q. Do you hold out any hope for tomorrow?

think they could do a little better tomorrow. And I hope that whatever they do tomorrow,
the people who come to see the game will enjoy it.

of subdued, the crowd?

I'm very grateful to the people who came to see the game. I do think that the support from
the public is very important for the players.
