C. SUAREZ NAVARRO/S. Stosur
  7‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   Difficult match here in Madrid, but you solved it right. 
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, well, the draw has not been very good for me.   You have to be conscious in tournaments like this.   From the first round it can be very difficult and tough.
We knew that the match was going to be difficult.   I think we have focused in a very good way tactically talking; mentally it has been very well. 
So, yeah, I have been very happy. 

Q.   It was a first‑round match, but against a top 10.   You came from losing a final in Estoril.   Did you have that in mind when playing?
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Not really.   Yeah, it was difficult to recover from that loss in Estoril for the final.
We had very small margins, only yesterday, to prepare the match of today. 
                       Not in any moment once I trained yesterday here.   We were already focusing on today's match.   Not in any single moment I had in my mind what happened recently in Estoril. 

Q.   The season has been going really well.   You're again up there.   Maybe it's the moment to break, right, to stay up there forever. 
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, you know, the season is going pretty well, but it's a very long season.   The important thing I think is to keep going in the same way I've been playing until now.
Little by little, to all the tournaments that I go, try to do as best as possible and try to reach the best way as possible. 

Q.   You are the kind of girl who looks at the draw, or not? 
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, I'm one of those players that looks at the draw, yeah.   If you ask me, I know against who I'm playing, of course.   But if I tell you I haven't had time to look at the draw, I normally do.   Normally I have a look at it. 
Sometimes I like to see if there is an entertaining match, anything interesting, see against who the other Spanish players are playing.

Q.   You have Kanepi in the next match. 
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, I play last week against her.   I think the first set of Estoril was really hard.   Afterwards I played also really good.   I think over here it's going to be completely different match.
I think that in altitude she can play even a little bit better.   Well, nothing more, no?   Simply just try to be happy about today's victory.   It has been very tough. 
From this evening I will try to prepare the match of Kanepi.

Q.   Given your quality, there is always high expectations on you.   How do you handle this? 
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   No, not really.   It's a lot when I was younger.   I had a great surprise in Roland Garros, and from then on I think everyone was expecting that that was going to be the minimum that I was going to achieve.
But, no.   I think that the fact of being 24 years old and also not being in the top 15 doesn't have to be a limitation or barrier or extra pressure for me. 
It's simply that people have to be conscious of the difficulties that are in today's circuit.   You know, the players are really well‑prepared.   The difference with points with the top 10 is massive, really big. 
In the big tournaments we just have to try to do really well.   Pressure?   No, I don't feel the pressure.   I don't feel like I have a lot pressure on me. 

Q.   You have Conchita Martinez watching the matches and following the circuit.   How do you feel working with her in the Federation Cup?   How do you feel that she follows you all over the circuit?
CARLA SUÃREZ NAVARRO:   Well, I think she's having a really good attitude.   In every moment she's been available for all the players.   She's always asking how we feel.   If we need something, we can count on her.
I think the year of Conchita has been good.   Two victories at home.   She has a lot of will to do things really well and to have that communication with us that we always needed. 
I think that all the players are very happy with her in general.
