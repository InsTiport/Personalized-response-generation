THE MODERATOR: Question for Carla Suarez Navarro, please.   
 Q.  You won both of your games today.  How do you feel?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Thank you.  I feel good, you know.  Long days, but always when you win, when you enjoy on court, always is good.  I mean, I feel tired a little bit, but also happy.   
 Q.  How will you prepare for your semi either against Radwanska or Vinci?  Who would you like to play first?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: I don't know.  I know both players really good.  I lost to Radwanska recently in Australia.  And with Vinci I play a lot of matches, but they have different styles and will be tough for sure, you know.   
 Q.  Who do you see going further in this competition?  There's a very talented lady playing.  She's only 18 and she's beating all the top seeds.  Did you see her play?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, maybe, yes, she's in the semifinals, and now she's playing against Petkovic.   
Always in semis or finals there are a lot of emotional moments.  You never know what happen, no?   
She's playing good.  She having a good week.  We will see happen in these two days.
