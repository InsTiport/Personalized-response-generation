  5‑7, 6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Bit of a battle tonight.   Were you expecting that?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, for me was difficult today.   Always when you came here and you play your first tournament you know that all the matches can be tough.
Today for sure was.   I was 4‑2 up in the first set, but then I lost.   Well, the match is really long. I have time to come back and win the match.

Q.   How are you feeling first game of the new season?   How do you feel going into the preparation for the Australian Open?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, I was practicing really hard this off‑season.   Now I feel really good.   I play two matches here.   I think I never won my first two matches years ago, so I'm happy.
Well, I'm waiting for the match of tomorrow.

Q.   Obviously big match tomorrow against Maria.   Sort of thing you love building up for?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yes.   I mean, if I can play in another round better, but, yes, I play tomorrow quarterfinal.   I play against Maria last year two times; always tough.   She's a really No. 1; she's completed. 
For me it's difficult because she serving good and she can play during two hours or two and a half hours a really good game.
For me it's difficult, but I think I am ready for tomorrow.

Q.   Obviously Maria had a very sort of straightforward win last night; you had a tough game today.   Do you think that will be a problem physically?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   No, I don't think so.   But for sure it's different for me because she has today day off; I play two and a half hours. 
But, well, I have time to rest.   I can go to the physio and have a good recovery.   Well, I will see what happens tomorrow.
