THE MODERATOR: Questions for Carla Suarez Navarro, please.
Q. Congratulations.  This is the biggest title of your career.  Can you tell us what it means for you?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Thank you.  So special.  It was tough week with a lot of matches every day.  Only top players were here.  You know, winning my second title after losing three finals the last year, so even more special.
Q. And No. 6 is also a big thing for you?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, always for sure.  Being in the top ten is a dream come true I want there the last year and I want to be higher if I can.  Just enjoy the moment.
Q. Congratulations.  Maybe the first set reminded you of the match you played her the last time.  Can you talk about the feeling when you lost the first set and somehow managed to come back in the second set.
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: You know, she plays really fast.  It's a tough opponent.  She play with no pressure.  She play really, really good.
Maybe I was a little bit nervous.  You know always you have time to come back, fight, run, and put the ball into the court.  Just play tennis and believe that you can come back.
That is what I was thinking during the match and I put in practice.
Q. Which was the toughest match of the tournament for you?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Which one?
Q. Which was the one match was toughest?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: This one for sure you know, yeah.  The other matches, the first one was also tough because I was losing the first set 4-Love and I need to came back.
But today I lost one set.  It's difficult starting like this in one final.  Always so emotional and you have the title so close.  So you want to play good.  Finally I can come back and win the title.  But for sure this one was the tough one.
Q. She's only 18.  She's already in the top 40.  How do you see her future?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: You know, she has time.  She has really good potential.  But the tour is really tough, really close.  All the player have the chance to win matches, to win titles.
She has time, and I think she will play good, for sure.
