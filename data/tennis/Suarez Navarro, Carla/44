THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please  
   
 Q.   You've now beaten Venus, Radwanska, Cornet, and now Petkovic here in Miami.   Would you say that you're probably playing the best tennis of your career?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, yes, I am playing good.   I play good matches here.   I feel good this week, so maybe, yes.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   What has caused that?   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, I was practicing really hard during the off‑season ‑ also every day during tournaments ‑ so, you know, more experience.   I know more all the players.   I play a lot of important matches in big tournaments, so maybe that's why.   
   
 Q.   You'll be top 10 for the first time in your career Monday.   Talk about what that feels like.   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, I feel so happy.   It's so important for me.   I was practicing and I was working during all this year with my team to a moment like this.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   And just tell us something about Carla Suarez Navarro that we wouldn't know.   Maybe off the courts something you like to do, something funny.   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, I just want to sleep as long as I can.   (Laughter.)   But nothing special.   
I like to read books or go to the cinema at home.   Go back home sometimes is also good.   I like it, but I don't have time to go home the times I want to go.  
But nothing special.   I mean, I'm relax on court and also off court.  
   
 Q.   I assume that maybe the Canary Islands isn't a huge place for tennis.   How did you become a tennis player?   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yes, I start to play when I was nine years old.   I practice basketball, I swim, but the tennis was the sport that most I like.   
So I play tennis not every day, but two days per week.   Then when I have 11, I play or I practice every day since then to today.   So I feel good.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   You never went away to Barcelona or anything like that?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   No, I go to Barcelona when I was 18 years old.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what kind of books you like to read?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Books?   I can read every book.   I mean, history, novels, or I don't know how to say in English, but like police also.   
   
 Q.   And will you buy yourself a special present for reaching the top 10, and what will that be?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   No, no.   
   
 Q.   You don't do that?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Not at the moment, no.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, normally all the tennis player want to be No. 1, but the first step I think is be in top 100 and top 50, then top 20, top 10, and you never know.   
But I want to be No. 1, yeah.
