A. RADWANSKA/C. Suarez Navarro
6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. So talk about the match a little bit.  Were you able to play the way that you wanted to play today?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, not really.  You know, I want to play more aggressive, but I don't have power to play like this.  You know, with Aga, also you have to play solid and try to be on court long time.
But, you know, I try.  I was there.  I need much more for today.
Q. Why weren't you able to have the power today to play the way you wanted to?  Were you tired?  Was the knee bothering you?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, yesterday and the day before I don't sleep as much as I want.  I didn't rest good.  You know, I feel tired.
But when you are on court you have to fight, you have to run, you have to be there, and today I don't have the good feeling to play good tennis, the good mentality to play more aggressive or try to play a little bit better than I play.
But I have to learn about these situations, this match, this experience.  I need to learn.
Q. Were you nervous?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: No, no.
Q. Pressure?  Nerves?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Not really.  Not today.
Q. How would you summarize your tournament and your start to the season?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, I feel good.  The first tournament I play good matches.  Also here not really good tennis, but I can be on court and have results, you know.
But I feel good.  I think this is the way.  I need to work.  I know that.  I need to practice.
But I feel good.  I think I have two good tournaments here in Australia, and now Doha/Dubai I need to be with the same way.  Try to play a little bit better tennis.  But I feel good.  I feel good after the off-season.
