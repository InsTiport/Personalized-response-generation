C. SUAREZ NAVARRO/V. Williams
  0‑6, 6‑1, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   What was it like playing in front of a packed house, big crowd, playing Venus Williams, down 6‑0 after the first set, and you pull it out.   What happened out there?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, it was a crazy match, crazy first two sets.   Venus was unbelievable at the beginning. 
I start a little bit nervous, but, you know, in tennis, even if you lost the first set, you're still in competition.   I'm happy with the way I come back after the first set.

Q.   Do you feel a certain comfort level playing in such a Hispanic city, here in Miami where there is so much a Latin flavor?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, the crowd is amazing here.   The weather, also. 
But I feel good here in Miami.   I want to feel also like this in my next match.
