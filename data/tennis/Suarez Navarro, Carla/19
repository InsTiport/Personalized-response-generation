THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. What was the most difficult aspect of playing Venus out there today? There were certainly some opportunities you had. What made it tough to play her?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, you know, she plays sometimes really fast. The most difficult for me today was my return. I was not really good on that.  
That's because she serve good. And, you know, she's there every time. She fight. Sometimes she looks like she was tired, but then she served and returned really good.  
The most important thing in the match I think was all the service and the return games.  
   
 Q. The serve. Is it as effective as it used to be? Because you certainly had some looks at some second serves. Seems like the second serve jumps quite a bit.   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, it was so tough for me. The grass today I don't feel really good. I mean, it was difficult in another courts. But, yes, I have the opportunities or the chance to win more points with her second serve, but I didn't take it. That was the big problem for me.  
   
 Q. How difficult is it to get a rhythm against her? Because she seems like one minute she's hitting fantastic winners from anywhere in the court and then there's a few interspersed unforced errors, as well. How difficult is that?   
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, you have to be focused on yourself, you know. Yeah, she play with different balls, different rhythms of the match. She work sometimes really slow.   
And we stop, also, with the rain. I mean, it's difficult always playing against Venus.
