C. SUAREZ NAVARRO/M. Puig   
4-4 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Strange way to be in a final.  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, it's not the way.  I mean, I feel like I didn't play and I'm in the final.  But, well, I cannot do nothing.   
I wanted just Monica to be good because nobody wants to lose a Grand Slam, so we only have two or three days to start there.  But, well, I'm here and I play tomorrow again.   
 Q.  Have you found your rhythm on court only playing one complete match?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, I play one match, but I still practice.  I play points during the practice.  I mean, yeah, it's not normal match.  I don't know if I have to play three sets, how can I play.   
But, well, I play a lot of matches all these days before New Haven.  I feel good.   
 Q.  Is this the strangest way you've ever advanced to a final?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah.  But not only for me, I think for any player.  I don't think only playing one match, that player is going to be in the final.  But, well, difficult situation, strange.   
 Q.  What did you see out there and what did Monica say to you, if anything?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: I think the abdominal, but I'm not sure.   
 Q.  Could you tell that something was bothering her or not?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just talk to her and try to be good for US Open, nothing more important than that.   
 Q.  Are you happy to be in the final?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, I'm happy.  Not the way, you know.  I feel like I need to deserve.  Now I'm playing, but they going out of the court.  They are not finishing the match.  Difficult situation, but I'm happy to be tomorrow on court again.   
 Q.  What do you know about your opponent?  I don't think you've faced her.  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: No, never.  Well, I saw her from all this tournament.  She's having a really good summer.  She beat a lot of top 10s, a lot of good players.  She's with a lot of confidence.   
Will be a really tough match.  She play aggressive.  She serve good.  I need to be focused.  I need to be 100% there, try to win because it's a final.   
 Q.  You have a very unique one-handed backhand.  Did you look up to someone, take after a specific style?  
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, when I start to play, I play like this.  When I'm growing up, Justine Henin was playing the WTA Tour, so I watch her.  But just practice.  It's really natural, but I was practicing a lot and watching her.
