 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Where does this win rank for you among your best? I know you beat Venus in a bigger tournament, but this is...   
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yes, Kuznetsova is a very good player, and this match, for me, is very important.   
 I feel very good now, and I'm happy now to be in the next round.  
  
  Q. Could you sense her getting a little frustrated in the third set?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Sorry?   
  
  Q. Could you tell she was getting frustrated, a little angry at herself in the third set?   
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: I don't understand.   
  
  Q. Could you tell at all that she was getting mad at herself?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: (Through translation.) Yes, I have a little bit. Yes. I think the first two games in the third set was very important, and when we was 3-1, this game is also very important. She is in, out, in, out, so I think -- I know that she's so-so.   
  
  Q. And playing at this level, I'm quite surprised, because you played further back, 10 feet back, than any player we've seen on the tour so far, and you're very successful with it. Is that normally your style, or is it this court?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: No, when I play in big courts, I normally -- normally I go back. But I think it's my style, because if I play in, I don't have so many (Through translation) power to play with the big players.   
  
  Q. Where do you rank this victory among the wins you have had on the WTA Tour? (Through translation.)   
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: It's very important. Maybe I play very good, and this, for me, is one of the most important match of my life.   
  
  Q. How much confidence does this give you going into this tournament now?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, now I have another match; the other player is very strong. She play also very good. I feel now good. I feel with confidence, so we will see what gonna be in the next match.  
  
  Q. Has this been a good year for you, better than other years?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yes. Well, I think so. I want to play good every year and every moment more than the year before, so I want to have a very good ranking in the end of this season.  
  
  Q. These courts, they say they're playing very slowly. Did you find that be to be true? And if it was true, was it helpful? Was it helpful to you?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yes. For me, it's better. The court is slowly. I feel good on this court, so I think people who play fast, this surface is not good for them. But for me it's perfect.
