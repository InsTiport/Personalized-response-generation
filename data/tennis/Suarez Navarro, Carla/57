 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How do you think you'll play against Elena in the next round?  
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: In the next round?   
  
  Q. Yes.   
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: I think the next round is a very difficult match. So I don't know the score now, but Dementieva is a very good player, and I think the match --  
 THE INTERPRETER: Will be difficult.   
  
  Q. You made quarterfinals last year at the French Open. Do you think that will help you?   
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yes, I think so. It's different because it's the second time, it's not the first time.   
 I think I can play better than the first time with Jankovic in Roland Garros.
