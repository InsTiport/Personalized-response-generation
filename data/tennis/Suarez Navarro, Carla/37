  F. PENNETTA/C. Suarez Navarro  6-3, 6-4    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  What do you think wasn't working for you today?  CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, I think that first of all, Flavia play really good today.  But me, myself, today it didn't help to me. She play more aggressive than me.  But, you know, we both know each other really good, and the match was really close.   Q.  Physically were you feeling okay today?  CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Yeah, I feel good.  Yeah.  Always good.   Q.  You had a very strong buildup to the French Open, but perhaps you played so many matches this season already.  Is there any thought that maybe you would do anything differently in the future schedule-wise to maybe peak in the tournaments that mean the most to you?  CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: No, I think now I'm going to rest.  I have two weeks for the next tournament.  I go back home. Well, I play a lot of the matches, you are right, but that's a good thing.  I was improving my game; I was working really hard. We are now in the middle of the season, so I need to work more and keep going, keep fighting.   Q.  How disappointing is this loss for you?  Did you have high expectations of yourself?  CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: Well, yeah, I want also to play good.  I want to have better results. But you know Flavia is also a really good player.  She's also working really hard and she's playing really good and she also can play here good matches and go through to the quarterfinals or semifinals.
