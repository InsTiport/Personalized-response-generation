  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   There are several very good players here in Birmingham, many ranked in the top 20.   Do you think this is the toughest Aegon Classic there has been?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Well, was tough to get in the top 20.   I know for me it's always tough because you have to work all day all the time if you want to be higher in the ranking.
Yeah, you have to practice every day really hard. 

Q.   How are you feeling personally in the early stages here?   Feeling good before you start playing?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yes, I feel really good.   I was at home ten days, so I arrive here really good.   I feel good.   I practice yesterday, I practiced today, so, yeah, I'm ready to play. 

Q.   Do you view the Aegon Classic as a good grass court tournament to play in before Wimbledon?
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO:   Yeah, it's a really good tournament.   It's the first time I'm here, so the courts are really good.
Sometimes the weather is soâ€‘so, but, well, I think it's a really good tournament.
