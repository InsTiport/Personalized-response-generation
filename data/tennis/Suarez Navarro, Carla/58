 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Tell us what the win meant to you.
CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: For me is a very good match. So I feel very good. And now I'm very good, so... 

 Q. What kind of strategy or tactics did you prepare before the match? 
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: (Translated from Spanish) Nothing special in tactics. Just to go on court, to try to be positive, to try to do my best. 
 In the first set she never thought that she's going to lose. She was still thinking positive all of the match. 

 Q. Are you normally as attacking as you were tonight throughout the match? 
 CARLA SUAREZ NAVARRO: (Translated from Spanish) You must be aggressive during all the match because, if not, she's going to take control of you.
