V. TROICKI/J. Lisnard
  7-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. Are you disappointed? The first set was tight with the tiebreaker. 
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: I am disappointed. I didn't play well. I had cramps from the first set on after the tiebreaker. I don't know what to say. I have nothing else to say about the match. 

 Q. You had a wild card here in Monte-Carlo, so you were very eager to do well maybe? 
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: It's not that. Any match I play, I want to win it. I didn't want to lose first round. But I didn't play well today and I'm very disappointed. It's annoying. 

 Q. What about your career... 
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: Well, I was able to come back after one year and a half without playing, having experienced a lot of frustration. 
 When I see that I played such a bad match today, I'm upset. I learned to put things into perspective. But here it's so difficult. My body let me down. I don't feel I lost because of tennis. I have no explanation for that. I just want to hit the road. 

 Q. What about your program now? 
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: I want to stay with my wife.
