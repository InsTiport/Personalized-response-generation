  6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions.

 Q. It's better to play under the flag of Monte-Carlo than the French flag?
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: Yes, since I won. But it's been a few years now. 

 Q. The match was completely under control?
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: He was not playing at his best level. I was trying to do my best. It was a one-way match.

 Q. You feel you are adapting well to clay?
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: I start very early. I was on clay courts as soon as February.
 This is an advantage compared to those who are coming back from Miami.

 Q. This is home. And it is also a big tournament. 
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: I love it. I have no problems of motivation. Since it's home, I really want to do well here. 

 Q. You passed the first round. Weren't you disappointed you had to play on such a small court? After all, you are the local player.
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: No, it is a Davis Cup court, so I am used to it. Maybe I will get to play on a bigger court tomorrow, but I am not upset.

 Q. People usually think you are French. Does it bother you?
 JEAN-RENE LISNARD: It is always the same question. Some even criticize me for that. I always remind them that I pay my taxes to France. 
 They think what they want. I don't care.
