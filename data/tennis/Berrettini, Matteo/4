  M. BERRETTINI/K. Anderson
 7-6, 7-5, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How happy were you tonight on the back of a great week with the ATP Cup, Team Italy?
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   Yeah, I'm really happy for my performance.  I think I played a really great match, high level.  Also Kevin played good, so really happy because, I mean, I won in straight sets, but it was actually really, really tough.
 Obviously I used the energy and the confidence that I got the previous week, but it's a different week, it's a different match.  It's best-of-five, so everything was kind of a little bit different.
 But I used, for sure, the good feelings of last week to win today.
