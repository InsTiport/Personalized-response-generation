7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Have you enjoyed your time here, first of all? What does that win mean to you to finish off your singles campaign here?
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Yeah, it was a great week so far. Before the week started, you know, my team, we talk a little bit and we said to each other, Let's enjoy this week.
Q. Could you just reflect on the start of the year? Because you were outside of the top 50 and you probably, at that point, didn't think you could get here. How has that run towards the end of the season helped your confidence?
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Yeah, for sure being here wasn't a goal at the beginning of the year. Also before US Open, you know, I didn't expect that. I wasn't thinking about that.
I knew that I was playing good in springtime, you know, like on clay season. It's just crazy that it happened. And nothing. I'm happy.
Q. After your win today, you said you weren't feeling that great. Is it just tiredness, or are there some physical issues you are experiencing?
MATTEO BERRETTINI: You asked me if I had physical issues?
Q. Yeah. You said you weren't feeling that great. Is it just tiredness, or are you experiencing some kind of...
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Yeah, for sure I'm tired after a long season like this, but it's not just that. I played a lot of matches on grass, on clay, on hard courts. It's tough. It's my second year on the tour.
So you have to get used to it. You have to -- I think next year is going to be better, because, you know, I'm learning a lot.
Yeah, I have some parts of my body that are not feeling great, but that's the life of an athlete. So nothing. I'm just working to be better.
Q. We've got the Davis Cup next week, and then we've got the ATP Cup in January. Could you just speak about what you think about the two formats and what benefits they will give you?
MATTEO BERRETTINI: I never played those kind of, you know, competition. I mean, I played Davis Cup but not like this.
So I think it's going to be fun to see how it's going to be. You know, the groups are a little bit different, and the new format with Davis Cup is different. So everything can happen. Best of three sets, two singles, just -- I mean, just two singles and one doubles. It's going to be different.
But when you are playing for your country with a team, it's different. I mean, I'm speaking about myself. You can find, I think, more energy. Even if you're tired like I am, I'm going to find, for sure, a lot of energy to play these kind of matches.
