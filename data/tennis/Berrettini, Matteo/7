  M. BERRETTINI/G. Monfils
 6-4, 6-2
 Q. Is this the best tennis you've played in a while?
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   Yeah, I think so.  Even though I had a couple of good matches last year, but I wasn't, I never felt like really physically how I felt today.  So -- and yesterday -- so yeah, I'm really happy for my performance.  Obviously both for my physical and mental condition.
 Q. Talk me through that amazing rally when you broke up 2-1 in the second set.
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   Actually, now you remind me of that.  It was crazy.  Sometimes there are certain stuff that can happen just in an important point, you know?  I think he jumped two meters, I don't know, I did a great lob, I felt it and I said, Okay, he's going to go back, but then he smashed it, so I don't know how.
 But then, yeah, it's great for sure good highlights, but I'm, I was more focused like on the other points, yeah.
 Q. How do you rate your semifinals chances?
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   I think in the competition like this ranking obviously counts, but until -- we are playing good, we feel like the energy, we are really happy to be in the semifinals.  Last year I didn't play and unfortunately the guys couldn't make it, so we're really pumped and I think when it's a team competition you never know.
