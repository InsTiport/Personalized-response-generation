  M. BERRETTINI/D. Thiem
 6-2, 6-4
 Q. Talk about the win, how important it is to start with a win.
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   Obviously, it's important for the team.  It's important for me in general.  It's good to start this Aussie summer with a great win against a great player.  Now we are back in the tie.  The doubles is going to be pretty important.
 I'm really happy for the way I played.
 Q. Keys to the match?
 MATTEO BERRETTINI:   I think I was really aggressive.  My energy was really good.  I was playing really fast.  I didn't give him, like, a lot of time.  I was returning well, serving well.
 I think I just played better than him today.  Then obviously you know tennis, second set I got a little bit tight.  He was ready to break me.  It was a great fight, especially the second set.
