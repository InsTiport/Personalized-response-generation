MATTEO BERRETTINI/ P. Andujar
6-7/ 6-4, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Your next match is against a young Norwegian.  Any thoughts about that?  And congratulations about your win today.
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Thank you.  And what did you say?  The first part?
Q. You're facing a young Norwegian in your next match.  We are very proud of that.  We are from Norway.
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Oh, okay.
Q. Any thoughts about that match?
MATTEO BERRETTINI: I never play him.  Just practice once in Phoenix.
And he's younger than me, and he's playing really good on clay especially.  It's going to be tough match.  But, you know, I think I'm playing him Wednesday, so I have two days to rest and prepare the match.
