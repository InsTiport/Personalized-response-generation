R. FEDERER/M. Berrettini   
7-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Have you got big regrets on this game?  
MATTEO BERRETTINI: I think, for sure, when you lose a match, you're never happy. But big regrets, I don't think so.   
I mean, I had some chances, especially -- I mean, I had a few breakpoints in the second set, took them back. I had I think couple of times in the first set 30-All, and he did two aces I think, and I miss a return like close.   
So I didn't play my best tiebreak, but he was serving so well, so nothing. I was trying my best. For sure I'm not disappointed about the chances that I didn't have.   
 Q.  When you played him at Wimbledon, you thanked him for the lesson. Then you said last week that playing your idol was like a dream but that you knew what you had to do to get better to get on the court with him again. What have you improved since that Wimbledon match?  
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Today I was nervous, like it's normal to feel, to be, but I wasn't, like -- in Wimbledon it was just, I don't know, just -- I wanted to be there so bad, and I couldn't feel like, I don't know, in the mood. Like I couldn't feel really myself in the court, because I was just enjoying what was happening.   
Today I was more ready. I was, like -- I knew what I had to do to win, I mean, to try to win the match. I was serving really well. In Wimbledon my serve wasn't working at all.   
Yeah, I was more ready. And I think, like I said, the more you play against these kind of guys, I mean, these top three guys, the more you get used to them a little bit. You have the chance to know them better. That's helpful, for sure.   
 Q.  Looking on the positive, getting here was a big achievement, and you have had a great year. Probably not the best having Novak and Roger as your first two matches, but what have you learned from the experience to make sure you get back here and maybe as a higher seed next time?  
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Yeah, I know how many times Roger played the finals: 17. This is my first. So for sure the first time he was, like, a little bit like me, like, nervous and didn't know what to do exactly.   
But I'm playing against the best guys on the planet and maybe the best guys ever. So I'm proud of what I'm doing. I'm proud how I'm facing these, you know, these kind of situations.   
I think that I played a good match also against Novak even if the score was not that good. But for sure I'm learning. And these kind of losses, they will help me in the future to get better.   
When I stepped in the locker and my coaches were there, I said, Guys, I want to be better. I want to be able to beat those guys. With respect, of course. But I'm ready to do the preseason already.   
 Q.  Just a quick question on the World Cup of tennis. We have two formats: Davis Cup next week and ATP Cup start of the year. What do you see about the two formats that make tennis special?  
MATTEO BERRETTINI: It's tough to answer, because I never was there. I never played this kind of -- I mean, I played Davis Cup, but not like this, not with the groups and everything.   
So maybe you should ask me at the end of the next week, but I think it's going to be a great event. Both, you know. It's good to have, like, in a place all the countries. You can see a lot of matches, singles, doubles. Great players are going to play. So it's going to be fun, for sure.   
 Q.  Can you tell us a little bit more about the ATP University you mentioned day before yesterday? Very helpful for you here?  
MATTEO BERRETTINI: Yeah, it was helpful because they brought me here. Yeah, it's crazy to think about that, because I saw the guys in the hotel. They're doing the same thing.   
Yeah, we studied a little bit. It's not something we normally do during the year. We had the chance to meet -- help me, guys. The coach of Zverev? Lendl, sorry. My bad.   
So it was really helpful. They brought us here. We had chance to know, like, some players better, because normally we are on the tour but we don't spend so much time -- you know, we don't hang out too much. We hang out with our team, maybe Italian friends. So it was a nice experience.   
I think it's going to be helpful for also the rest of the players.
