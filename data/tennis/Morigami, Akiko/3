 Q.  Congratulations. 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Thank you. 

 Q.  Safina is No. 13 seed.  How does it feel to have beaten her? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Well, I actually really didn't feel like I'm playing against a No. 13 seed, just because -- I know that she's a really, really good player, but I've been playing a lot of top ten players well, so I really didn't think, like, oh, I'm playing against No. 13 in the world.  I just tried to focus on my game and was very aggressive. 

 Q.  And how do you feel your performance was? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  I'm pretty satisfied how I played today.  I played pretty aggressive, and maybe grass court is not her favorite surface.  But I tried to focus on my game, and I'm pretty satisfied how I played today. 

 Q.  It seemed as if you had a lot of Japanese support in the crowds.  Did that help having people cheering you on? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Yeah, definitely.  It's good to have support all the time, and they were pretty supportive, so I'm really happy. 

 Q.  What are your hopes for the rest of the tournament? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  I think I'm playing Venus next round, and I played against her at the beginning of this year.  I lost to her 6-1 in the third, and it was a pretty close match. 
 I'm just going to play my game and just really don't think what the opponent is going to be, I mean, other courts.  I just focus on my game.  So we'll see how it goes.
