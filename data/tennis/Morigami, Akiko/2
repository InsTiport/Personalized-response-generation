 Q. You seemed to have a good partnership going on today.  What were the main strengths of the pairing today? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Well, Jarmila and I played a couple tournaments this year, and then I definitely think we're a pretty good match, just because she has so much power. 
 Well, today was just pretty much focus on like our game obviously because I never -- we never really played against them.  But we knew they were going to come into the net.  So we tried to make them volley, we tried to eliminate the, like, easy mistakes, which I think we did pretty good. 
 At the same time we were pretty aggressive when we needed to.  So I think that was a point. 

 Q.  And the rain didn't even put you off; you came back stronger it seemed.  Did it help that you had broken the serve in the first game before? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Yeah, it definitely did help us, broke in the first game.  Well, when we came on the court, I was serving, and then all of a sudden, Love-40, so I'm like, oh, my God, it's not really good.  But luckily I held my serve.  And after that I think we were looking pretty good, and after that pretty focused on our game.  So pretty satisfied. 

 Q.  So have you got high hopes as a pairing for the rest of the doubles tournament? 
 AKIKO MORIGAMI:  Hopefully.  I mean, next opponent is definitely tough team, as well.  But I think when we play really aggressive and then stay focused, I think we have pretty good opportunity.  So I think one at a time.  But hopefully we can stay longer in the tournament.
