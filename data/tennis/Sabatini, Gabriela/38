 Q.  You haven't won a title in a little while.  Can you explain?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Well, nothing wrong with that.  I mean, I
am just trying to improve.  I am playing, I feel, very good this
year, playing good tennis and, you know, just looking forward
to this tournament.

 Q.  Do you feel you are playing good tennis?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I feel I am playing good tennis. I
need to win some good matches against top players to get even
more confident.

 Q.  Do you think that it would make it any easier to get to
the finals?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I don't think so.  It is still very tough.
 Everyone is -- there are a lot of tough matches next rounds,
so-- but I am ready.  I feel very good, and I am just ready to
play them.

 Q.  Are you going out tonight in Miami?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, maybe.

 Q.  You feel more comfortable now speaking Spanish, I think?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah. It doesn't matter; I can speak both.


 Q.  Her Japanese is pretty good.

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Not yet.
