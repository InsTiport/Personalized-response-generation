Q.  Hi, Gaby. 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Hi.  
 

Q.  Was it difficult, you had barely anybody in the stands last night by the time you won? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  There were a few people; my parents, my coach.  
 

Q.  Is it exhausting after being up so late last night? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I mean, I was -- first of all, I didn't know I was playing today again.  
 

Q.  You didn't know? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I didn't know before the match, so, I guess I was glad that I didn't know because I would have been very mad.  I just can't understand how they can make the schedule like that.  I guess he is not playing today, so what's the point to make him, you know, play first, then I played last, then I have to play again today, and early today. I mean, they don't even put me, you know, later in the day, so I was extremely mad, you know, last night, today.  
 

Q.  Did you tell them, talk to anybody? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  I couldn't talk to anybody.  My coach did, but I will talk.  I guess it is an ATP tournament, that's what they said, and that's not how it is.  We are playing here, too, and we have the right to have, you know, a normal schedule, too.  I mean, they are not in control.  They shouldn't be in control of the tournament.  That's too bad.  
 

Q.  Compare your play, how you are playing right now through this tournament to how you've done in your, I guess, previous months?  Do you feel, yourself, things are clicking right now? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yes, I think -- I've been working a lot of things, you know.  I think that there were a lot of things that needed to be reassured, you know.  I think I'm getting that, you know, trying to get -- to have, you know, a good plan each time I, you know, I go out to play, you know, to really know exactly what I do with every shot that I hit. That's getting there.  I mean, I'm feeling very good with yesterday, you know.  Today I was a little bit tired, but, you know, I still played a pretty good match, so I'm pretty happy how things are going, you know, I'm not worried if they don't work out right now in this tournament, but I know they will at any moment.  
 

Q.  Do you think anything can come about you complaining about the scheduling; do you think anything will happen in your favor? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  If I complain to somebody?  
 

Q.  If your coach says, you know, this is so unfair that she has to -- 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Well, I am going to have to do something, I don't know what, but I don't think it is fair, so I am going to do everything I can.  
 

Q.  To do something about it? 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah.  
 

Q.  Thank you. 
 
GABRIELA SABATINI:  Thanks.
