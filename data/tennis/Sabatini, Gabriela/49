 Q.   Was the match easier than you expected?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I think I make it a little bit easier.
 I knew it was going to be a tough match.  I was a little concerned,
and especially I didn't have many tough matches.  I had some weeks
off after Wimbledon, so I just played in San Diego last week,
and I wasn't playing very well.  So I think I need some rhythm
now, and to play some matches.  But I am very pleased with the
match today.

 Q.   That long layoff, was that because of your knee or you
had planned it?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I planned to take some time off.  Also,
I was recovering from the knee too.

 Q.   Do you feel like you are ready coming to this tournament
before this match and how do you feel after having played the
match?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I think there is a difference before
and after.  For sure, after the match I feel ready.  I am focused.
 I was very concentrated today, and mentally I have to be focused,
and I am.  I feel very good.

 Q.   Were you more concerned coming in this year not having
played as many matches and not playing so well last week?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, because last year, you know, the second
six months I was a little bit tired mentally, probably, so this
year, I tried to make a little different, and tried to take some
time off, and I am fresh right now, and ready to go again.

 Q.   You have a home on Key Biscayne; is that right?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Right.

 Q.   How did it weather the hurricane?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I think I was very lucky, because my apartment
was okay.

 Q.   Trees down, but nothing else?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I think Key Biscayne is destroyed.
 It was very sad.

 Q.   You come in here thinking only to win this thing as a
good tournament?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Sure.  I think my chances are to win the
tournament, and you know, I just want to think about each match,
and try to play my best.

 Q.   But you come in here thinking to win; not just to get
to the quarters or the semis?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Of course, yeah, to win.

 Q.   What happened with your knee?  What was the injury?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I had tendonitis.

 Q.   From constant playing or?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, started in Wimbledon, you know, the
match I was playing against Capriati, but I did some treatments
and it was very good.  It is finished.

 Q.   Which knee?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  The left leg.

 Q.   Are you completely recovered from it now?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I am completely recovered, yeah.

 Q.   What sorts of level are you on now as opposed to two
years ago when you won here?  Are you a better player?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I am a better player.  I mean, everything,
physically, technically and mentally, I am a better player, yeah.


 Q.   When you played this match, did you know the umbrella
fell, did you hear it?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I didn't know what it was.  I thought it
was a person.  Yeah, I mean, I hear something hard, so.

 Q.   Did it distract you?  Did it disrupt you?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No.  Not really, no.

 Q.   Has this tournament gotten easier to play? They have
done a pretty good job about keeping the jets away.  Has it gotten
a little easier?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I think a lot of players have been complaining
about it, but I feel very good very comfortable playing here.
 I don't know, I guess, is because this is the  place where I
won my Grand Slam, and it is fun to play here in New York.  The
crowd is good, and I just love it.

 Q.   How do you explain, Gabriela, if you are, as you say,
a better player in all those departments?  What do you put it
down to that you haven't been able to build on the --

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Most of all, I am much more mature on the
court.  I am taking more of my time and thinking more and my movement
is much better too.  I am faster.

 Q.   I mean, why do you think if that is the case why you
haven't sort of got on to win another Grand Slam after the U.S.
Open two years ago?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Why I didn't win Grand Slam?

 Q.   Yes.

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I think I was there.  I was very close to
-- I had some very good opportunities you know, I was very close.


 Q.   So just a few points could have been --

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, that is for sure.  My next goal is
try to win a Grand Slam.

 Q.   Does it frustrate you if you say you are a better player
than two years ago that you haven't been able to win?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I am not worried about it, no.

 Q.   During that time off were you still playing as much tennis,
practicing at all or--

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I took some time off without playing tennis.
 First I started to do some physical training and then few days
after, I started to play tennis.

 Q.   Did you consider when you won here that it was going
to be a breakthrough for you and that you would go on and pick
up one or two more or did you think it was going to be as hard
as it has been since?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  It has been always hard to win a Grand Slam
and I know that, it is the toughest tournament.  Each tournament
is a new challenge, and it doesn't matter if you win or not. 
I mean, you go again and you have to try to win again.

 Q.   Do you pay attention or care about the seeds and the
ranking?  You have been third here like for ever and now fourth.
 Does it matter to you?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I am not -- of course, it matters, yeah,
but I am not -- it is not an obsession.

 Q.   What makes a Grand Slam tournament harder for you?  You
said it is harder to win a Grand Slam.

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  It is just the tournament itself, you know,
everything, it is a two week tournament and everyone is playing.
 Everyone wants to win the tournament.  It is like there is more
motivation for everyone.

 Q.   Did the injury actually force you to skip any tournaments?
 Were you planning on taking that time off?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  No, I planned to take that time off.

 Q.   Having done that, would you do it again like next year,
would you say between Wimbledon and the Open, I want a big break?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  I don't know if that long but I will take
some time off.

 Q.   How do you like your -- I mean, everybody is talking
about Capriati, you know, Seles, Graf, how do you like your chances
here?  Do you think you can win?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I think I have the chance to win, sure.
 As I say, I just want to think about each match and you know,
I think it is more competitive than ever right now.

 Q.   When you took the time off, do you follow tennis or just
try to get away from it, what did you do?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, I followed tennis a little.  The Olympics,
of course.

 Q.   Were you in Argentina or Florida?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Both places, yeah, I have been to Argentina
and some time in Florida, too.

 Q.   Mary Joe and Harold Solomon were saying yesterday that
they were trying to get a benefit tournament for November, December,
down in South Florida.  Have they spoken to you about it?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah.

 Q.   Are you interested?

 GABRIELA SABATINI:  Yeah, if we can get the date, yeah, we may
do it.
