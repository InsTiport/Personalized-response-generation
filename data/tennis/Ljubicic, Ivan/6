 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You won the match, but also you lost on the ace numbers. Can you explain why is that?   
 IVAN LJUBICIC: The only thing that's important is to win the match. I'm really not too worried about the number of aces.   
 I think he's a good server. The court played especially very slow. There were some moments of the match where I felt it was more important to put the first serve in the court instead of bombing on the line and trying to look for the lines.   
 I think you all saw that I didn't feel very comfortable on the court today. I did whatever I could to win the match, which is probably the only and the most important thing in a tennis match when you go on court.  
  
  Q. His ranking his 400 and something. Was it surprising the way he played?  
 IVAN LJUBICIC: I think his ranking is 300 actually. I tried to check his statistics and tried to get as much information as I could before the match today.   
 He's a young player. As any young player, he's very dangerous. I think he has weapons. He's definitely going to improve and grow up as a player.   
 I chose today to play very defensive in the beginning just to check his skills and to see what he can do. He responded pretty well. So he made my life very difficult.   
 But I think I used my experience in the end, and he was maybe a little bit too nervous by the end of the match to get his opportunities.   
 I'm sure his ranking, it's something that is today, but it's definitely going to improve.
