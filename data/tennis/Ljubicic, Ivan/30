THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  What are your feelings just now?
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  How do I feel?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  Disappointed.  After third set, I thought I'm going to win because I felt everything much better.  Finally getting rhythm and play much better.  I think he was just pushing the ball back and running left and right.  I think I was very unlucky in the third set not to get the break in the beginning, then to lose service game after.  But that's tennis.  
 
Q.  He returns particularly well. 
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  Yeah, he returns well.  I mean, he's a good player, there's no question about that.  But I think I deserved this one.  
 
Q.  Did you have a problem with him in particular? 
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  No, no.  
 
Q.  You look so... 
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  No, I mean, I'm disappointed because I thought -- I mean, I have a feeling that I deserved to win.  But nothing against him, absolutely.  
 
Q.  When do you think the momentum changed in that fifth set?
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  I mean, those two games.  Those two games at 15-40 on his serve, he survived with unbelievable passing shots at 30-40.  Then that game at 2-1 for him, I missed couple forehands three centimeters.  I mean, you know, it happens.  Then he hit that unbelievable passing shot on breakpoint.  That what made the difference.  
 
Q.  The atmosphere was better than last year? 
 
IVAN LJUBICIC:  Well, I don't really like this wild crowd.  I mean, even if it's for me or against me, doesn't matter.  I really like to play in normal support, let's say that way.  Sometimes it's not good for me, it's not good for him if the people shout in the middle of the point or between first and second or during the serve even.  But you can't control that, obviously.
