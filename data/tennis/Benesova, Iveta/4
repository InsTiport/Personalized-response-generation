Q.  Compare playing the two sisters, how they're similar and how they're different. 
 
IVETA BENESOVA:  Well, I think that Venus, she's - I don't know  - she's better moving, of course.  She's more athlete.  She didn't make that many errors as Serena.  Also big serve.  But no big difference between them.  
 
Q.  How about your experience playing both of them back-to-back days, how will this make you a better player? 
 
IVETA BENESOVA:  Well, I don't know if I will be better player after this.  But it's really tough to play against them.  But, I mean, the first set was better than the second.  So, I mean, yeah, I think I played well.  
 
Q.  Is it tough to come back after yesterday?  You played so well in the first set.  The second set, it seemed like Serena really picked her game up. 
 
IVETA BENESOVA:  No, it's not.  
 
Q.  It must be easier now, after having played two of the top three players in the world?  Your next time out, you're back on the tour, usually you won't be playing No. 1 and No. 3. 
 
IVETA BENESOVA:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  Is that right?
 
IVETA BENESOVA:  Yeah, that's right.  What else to answer, I mean...?
