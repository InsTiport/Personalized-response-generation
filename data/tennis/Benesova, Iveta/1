 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How was it to play with Iveta? Did you enjoy it?   
 JURGEN MELZER: No, I didn't (laughter).   
 No, it was fun. That's the reason why we ended up playing. For me mixed has to be fun. Otherwise, I mean, playing singles, doubles, it's a lot of matches. When you step on court in mixed, you just want to enjoy.   
 I think that's what we did over the last, how many matches we play, four. We were smiling on the court. Of course, we wanted to win, but it wouldn't have been a nightmare or disaster if we would have lost the match.   
 So I think that's what made us Wimbledon champions in the end.   
  
  Q. You might repeat it in some time?   
 JURGEN MELZER: Why not? The only problem is when I'm still in singles, it's a lot of matches to play.   
 In this case, as she said, we were lucky I lost in singles.   
 IVETA BENESOVA: I was lucky.   
 JURGEN MELZER: I was lucky, too. I'm a Wimbledon champion now again.   
 So I cannot play three events at one tournament. But if she enters with me and says, Okay, I'm happy to play if you're out of singles; if not, that's bad luck, then we can maybe repeat that.  
  
  Q. Why did you choose to play with Iveta?   
 JURGEN MELZER: Well, I got to know her a little bit better.   
 IVETA BENESOVA: I have a good backhand.   
 JURGEN MELZER: That's what I always say, is she has the best backhand.   
 It's very important to know the person. You know what you're getting yourself into. If I would have somebody standing there who wants to win so badly, I couldn't enjoy it.   
 I think she's a funny girl. She's a nice girl. I enjoyed the time on the court. I think that's what's most important in mixed.   
  
  Q. Iveta, were you happy with your partner?   
 IVETA BENESOVA: Definitely. I think I was lucky that he asked me if I want to play. He was awesome. I think next to him could stand anybody with the racquet in the hand and he still would win it.   
 Yeah, I was lucky.   
  
  Q. Were you a bit nervous before going into the final? Jurgen already had one final last year behind him.   
 IVETA BENESOVA: Yeah, I was more nervous on our first match actually, I would say.   
 But the finals, I think we were relaxed. It was just fun.   
  
  Q. What could you say was the key to such a great relationship on the court?   
 IVETA BENESOVA: Uhm, I think his tennis, for sure. Definitely. I mean, he had like a hundred winners today. He was everywhere. Yeah, it's all his victory, I would say.   
 JURGEN MELZER: No.   
 IVETA BENESOVA: I was just solid a little. But, yeah, was lucky to play with him.   
  
  Q. Would you repeat the experience?   
 IVETA BENESOVA: Well, depends. I would love to, but we both have singles and doubles. It's difficult, so we'll see.
