MODERATOR:  Questions for Thomas.


Q.  Was the back bothering you at all?

THOMAS JOHANSSON:  No, no, I felt good out there. 

Q.  At the start of the fourth set, you looked pretty angry with yourself.  You seemed to crank it up a bit.  What actually happened in that final set?

THOMAS JOHANSSON:  Well, I don't think a lot of things happened, that's why I lost the fifth set.  I served a couple of match points.  I had Love-40.  I think it was 10-All or something like that.  To go up a break and serve for the match, that would have been good.  But I didn't convert the breakpoints so good today. 

Q.  Would you say he played well or you played bad?

THOMAS JOHANSSON:  I think if I played like I did today, I think I lose against most of the players in this tournament.  But I think he played well.  He deserved to win.
