About Andrew Murray:


"He is very, very tough.  He is already very, very good, but he's going to be even better.  He can certainly be a Top 50 player.  He serves 140 miles per hour, and to do that at 18 is very impressive.  The only thing he can improve is his second serve return."  "It was very tough out there today.  I'm very impressed with him and the way he was playing.  I was lucky because I saw his match on TV yesterday and saw how capable he was."  "He can be a Top 50 player.  With his strokes and serve, he is going to be really, really good."
