 Q. Is this the first time an opponent retired in your experience in a match? 
 
 THOMAS JOHANSSON: No. Actually, this year it's been a couple, so I've been lucky this
year. We actually played, Richard and I -- I think it was two years ago. The same thing
happened, exactly the same thing. He won the first. That time I won the second. Then he
retired because of his knee. I feel really sorry for him because he has some -- I knew
that he had some problems with his knee.
