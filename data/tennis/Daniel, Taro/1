 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Bad luck today.  A very close first two sets.  Can you just talk us through your match.
 TARO DANIEL:   Yeah, it was very, very difficult matchup.  I think the guy has a very unique game and crazy-good serve.
 It was close to impossible to break his serve.  I struggled with that a lot.  And then that obviously puts a lot of pressure on my service games.  That's I think the little difference that showed in the tiebreak where he played a little more aggressive than me, and that's why he was able to get away with those first two sets.
 So, yeah, it's unfortunate, but I gave it my all.  I don't feel horrible about it.  I don't feel bad about it, yeah (smiling).
