3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you talk me through a tough match today.  
TARO DANIEL: Yeah, I don't know what to say really, but, I mean, first I think he came out a little bit slow.  I was able to take advantage of that.   
But then he started, you know, concentrating a bit more in the second set.  I felt like I kind of got dominated a little bit throughout the match.   
So I was a little bit disappointed because I came in feeling pretty good, especially on grass.  I was pretty surprised at how well I was playing even last week in Antalya and stuff.  I feel like I would have had a chance and stuff, but still, four sets is not horrible.   
 Q.  Do you have much interaction with the other Japanese players here at Wimbledon?  
TARO DANIEL: Yeah, for sure.  We always have this, like -- all the players' friend, he throws a party always the Saturday before the tournament starts, and we have dinner all together and play games, card games and whatever.  Yeah, it's always fun.   
Yeah, we're very friendly, I mean, all the players.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you get to watch the football match last night?  
TARO DANIEL: No.  I'm not a huge football fan, but, I mean, yeah, I was following the score yesterday.  I couldn't find the channel on my room TV, so I was just watching some, like, movies.  But probably Japanese people would like kill me if I say that.  Disappointing, I guess (smiling).   
 Q.  So you would have watched it if you could have found it?  
TARO DANIEL: If I would have found it on TV I would have watched it.  But, I mean, not super concentrated, either, because I was by myself.
