  7‑5, 4‑6, 6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. When you have a changeover, is there such a thing as having sort of a productive changeover or not? Do you really try to think things through or just relax and chill out? 
TARO DANIEL: There are changeovers where you try and, when your game is not working, you want to think what you can do differently and stuff.
In today's case, many changeovers, I was running out of breath so I was just trying to get my breath back into a peaceful pace. Kind of just be mindful of my physical sensations.
Yeah, not thinking too much today, yeah. But usually I try and think if things are not going too well, then I will try and like think of things to do better.

Q. Do you want to look much in the stands to your coach, family, friends?
TARO DANIEL: That's more between points or something. Yeah, but not during changeovers, no. I'm usually just looking at the ground.

Q. Some people read or drink coffee sometimes. Have you ever done anything different?
TARO DANIEL: No, nothing like that. Yeah, just kind of (looking down). Yeah.
