  7‑6, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on your performance today?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, well, I'm really, really disappointed.   Uhm, you know, I thought she played a really solid match.   She can hit the ball incredibly hard off the ground, so it was tough for me to stay in the rallies.   
But, you know, I had my chances here and there and I just didn't take them.  
   
 Q.   How difficult was it to get yourself up for the second set having narrowly lost the tiebreak?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, well, you know, I stuck in it for the majority of the second set and then, you know, she broke me with a really good return game.   So, uhm, there wasn't a huge amount I could do, though.   
But, yeah, you know, I just tried to stay positive and, uhm, try to get my serve firing again.   
   
 Q.   What will you take out of this whole sort of nine days, what have you learnt from it?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, I think there's way too many things to answer in one question.   
But, yeah, it's just been this overwhelming experience.   Yeah, it's been crazy but in a good way.   You know, I'm hoping to do better next year.   
   
 Q.   How much did the pressure get to you?   Was it a big factor for you?   
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, I think I was putting a lot of pressure on myself.   At the end of the first set, you know, I had my chances.   I served for it.   In the tiebreak, as well.   
At that point, I was just trying to will myself to play unbelievable tennis when, you know, just making a serve would have been fine.   
But, as clichÃ© as it sounds, it's all part of the learning experience.   The more I get myself into those kinds of situations, the more I'm going to benefit.   
   
 Q.   Do you think in a couple of days you might look back and think actually it was a really good Wimbledon for you, a step up, better than you've done before?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Maybe.   I mean, we'll see.   I've still got mixed here.   Yeah, hopefully we'll do well in that.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe the crowd today?   
LAURA ROBSON:   Yeah, I thought they were good.   I mean, yeah, she played very well.   Uhm, they were obviously applauding her shots, as well.   I would have loved it to be even louder.   But, yeah, I thought the crowd was great.   
   
 Q.   US Open you may well be seeded now.   Is your intention for all future Wimbledons to be in the top 32, a seed, and have a better chance?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Yeah, uhm, that's the plan.   I didn't do too well, uhm, before Wimbledon and all the tournaments after the Australian Open.   You know, I have a good chance next year to get my ranking even higher.   But for the moment I'm just going to focus, you know, on mixed and, uhm, take a couple days off after we finish that.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
LAURA ROBSON:   I haven't thought about it really.   You know, it's going pretty well.   Yeah, I would say so.   
   
 Q.   You talked about her power.   Anything you think you can do in the future to address that?   Because there's just going to be powerful players on tour.   
LAURA ROBSON:   Yeah, it's always tough to get good rhythm against such a powerful player.   You know, you can always try something different, try mixing up the pace of your own shots, you know, hitting angles, things like that.   
Uhm, I wasn't really able to do that today.   
   
 Q.   I think a lot of people were getting excited at the prospect of you facing Serena in the quarters.   Serena going out, does that show the depth in the women's game?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Well, I didn't see the match, but Lisicki obviously played extremely well.   So, uhm, you know, it's great for the sport that another young‑ish player is able to step up.   
Uhm, I thought for sure Serena was going to win the tournament.   So, yeah, it's a big upset.  
   
 Q.   Is that part of the disappointment, the fact that Serena is out, and she was in your part of the draw, it opened up a little bit for you to go on and get to the final?  
LAURA ROBSON:   I think that was a long way off, seeing as Serena was still playing after I had already lost.   So, no, I wasn't thinking about that.   
   
 Q.   A lot of women, young girls, came to watch you particularly.   Do you remember watching someone when you were young thinking that's who you would like to be in tennis?  
LAURA ROBSON:   It was great that they came and watched.   Uhm, you know, I was hearing that people started queuing on Saturday to come.   That's unbelievable support.   
Yeah, I'm so happy that they decided to come and support.   But, uhm, you know, when I was young, I was kind of just watching everyone, learning as much as I could.   And, yeah, basic stuff.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it was unrealistic of people who made you the favorite, given her experience?  
LAURA ROBSON:   I mean, in theory I'm ranked higher, so I can understand it.   Uhm, you know, she's made quarters here before.   She's very tough on grass.   You know, she loves playing here.   
So I would say it was pretty evenly matched, and I think that's kind of the way the match went, as well.   
   
 Q.   There's been huge support for you from across the country.   David Cameron sent a tweet from Kazakhstan wishing you luck today.   Has that helped you, or do those messages put extra pressure on you?  
LAURA ROBSON:   No, I didn't know he did that.   That's nice.   But, uhm, yeah, you know, I don't really worry about it, I kind of just get on with it, focus on actually playing rather than everything else around me.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of Kanepi's chances against Lisicki?  
LAURA ROBSON:   I would say that the average pace of groundstrokes is going to be pretty high.   They both hit it unbelievably well.   Yeah, it's going to be a tough match for both of them, but I don't know who's going to win.  
   
 Q.   You said you were struggling to come up with a sign‑off as you left the court, a wave, blowing kisses.   Today there was nothing when you left the court.   Why was that?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Because I lost, and I was just trying not to cry.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you're a work in progress.   What kind of aspects of your game are you going to go away and work on between now and the US Open?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, you know, I think my forehand on the hard courts is going to be a weapon.   So, yeah, you know, in the last couple of weeks I've been working on getting a little more spin on that.   
That was something that I didn't really do too well today.   I kind of tried to do too much with the ball.   So definitely going to be working on that and continuing the work on my serve.   
   
 Q.   Does this feel much more deflating than going out at the same stage of the US Open last season?   If so, do you think that's because of the increased expectations you've now put on yourself?  
LAURA ROBSON:   Uhm, I mean, US Open last year, I was just kind of like happy to be there.   Today I went out and I really thought I had a chance of winning.   And, you know, I was feeling confident going into the match.   
So, yeah, it is more disappointing, I think.   But, uhm, just because I put so much pressure on myself.
