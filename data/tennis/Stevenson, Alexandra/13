THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Looked good out there.  You feel like you played well?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah.  I served well.  It was hard to return.  It was windy.  So I just got  -- I focused and just got by with it.


Q.  Seemed like big points when you came through. 

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah. 


Q.  A sign of maturity? You feel like you turned it around a little?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: What?


Q.  You feel like it's a sign of maturity tonight?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah, I think so.  I think in some of those moments I could have lost my serve.  I was down a couple times in the big points and I've been working hard and I got those points. 


Q.  Seemed like you wrong-footed her a lot.  Was that your strategy coming in?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah, just to mix it up and play my game and move her. 


Q.  She's been out of this a while, had back problems. 

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah. 


Q.  How about you, do you feel like this is an important year for you in your career?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yep.  I think this is a good year.  So far, it's been pretty good. 


Q.  Quarterfinals?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yep, and everything's going well right now.  So just getting better each day. 


Q.  Seems like yesterday you made the big splash.  It's been quiet for about a year and a half.  You want to make some noise this year?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Definitely.  I'm ready to make noise again.  This time it's going to be for the next ten years.  I went on a little hiatus.  It was kind of hard to get used to everything, and it was just like a big thing all of a sudden, then you had to get ready for the next.  So it took me a while, but I'm maturing.  I think I'm a late bloomer, like a guy. 


Q.  We won't go there?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah, I'm not a guy.  But guys mature later than girls do.  So my game is more suited to a guy's game. 


Q.  You feel like there's less of a maybe microscope on you, that you just can go out and play your game without all these expectations?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: There's still a microscope on me I think, but I don't really care anymore.  I kind of just said,  "Oh, well, they can say what they say, they can write what they write and I just won't read it or listen to it."


Q.  So you're not reading anymore, is that it?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: No, I don't read sports papers.  My mom has trouble because she's a sports writer.  She still reads them.


Q.  You don't read your mother?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: No.  I read about politics, I read about the Arts.  But I don't read about sports.  Only if Derek Jeter's in there, then I'll read it. 


Q.  Crush on the Derek man?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: I think he's a good player.  I'm not going to say I have a crush on him.  I admire him. 


Q.  If I was a girl, I'd have a crush on him. 

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: (Laughing.)


Q.  I want to be Derek Jeter.  Have you ever had a chance to meet him?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Uh-huh.  I made a big fool of myself.


Q.  You made a big fool.  What did you do?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: It's a long story.  I just had a big smile on my face and I couldn't speak.  (Laughing.) You know, like Ally McBeal, do you know her, I was Ally McBeal, it was just all over from there.  I blew it. 


Q.  Your tongue was out to here, huh?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yeah.  (Laughing.)


Q.  When did you meet him?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: About a year ago. 


Q.  Where was it at? What was the occasion?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: I was down at IMG Academies, he was just visiting there and I was there, all sweaty.  I didn't even look cute.  But that's all right. 


Q.  Guys like sweaty women. 

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: (Laughing.)


Q.  Who's next in the draw, have you looked?

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Dementieva.  So that's a good rematch.  I played her two years ago here in the qualifying and I lost 7-6 in the third, and so I'm ready to take her.  I owe her one.  (Laughing.)


Q.  Battle of tall women. 

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON: Yep.  It will be a good match.
