U. HUMBERT/C. Ruud
4-6, 6-2, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. It seems like you have developed a nice rivalry with Casper.  This is the third time you have played.  Why do you think you match up so well with him, and why do you think you won tonight?
UGO HUMBERT:   It's always tough against Casper.  We played three times.  Always three sets.
It's tough to win easily against him.  I'm really happy to win today 7-6 in the third.  Nice victory.  Really nice.
Q. You play Stefanos Tsitsipas in the next round.  Not much time to turn around.  I believe you play tomorrow night.
UGO HUMBERT:   Yes.
Q. What kind of planning will go into that match?
UGO HUMBERT:   I will try to do my recovery tonight because, yeah, it's another match against a good player.  I'm really happy to play him tomorrow.
Yeah, it will be tough, but I think I can do it, and that's it.  Yeah.
Q. Finally, now that you won Antwerp and now you've won your first match here in Paris, are you playing some of the best tennis of your life, or have you played better before?
UGO HUMBERT:   I don't know, but I think every day, every week I try to improve my game.  It's always a different tournament, different week.
I know I can play nice level like in the second set today.  And yeah, I'm happy with my game, and, well...
