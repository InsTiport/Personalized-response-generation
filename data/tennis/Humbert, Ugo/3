  U. HUMBERT/S. Tsitsipas
 7-6, 6-7, 7-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you describe your emotions and just how you're feeling physically and mentally after a battle like that?
 UGO HUMBERT:   Physically, I'm dead (smiling).  No energy.  But I'm super happy, super proud of myself.
 I was mentally very strong to win this match against Tsitsipas, one of the best players in the world.
 Yeah, I don't know what happened, but I'm super, super happy.
 Q. By the time you won, I believe it was roughly about an hour in between your first match point and when you finally won.  How did you manage to keep your focus out there for such a long enduring match that had so many ups and downs?
 UGO HUMBERT:   Yeah, it was very, very hard at the end of the second set because I was a little bit stressed and tight to finish the match.  I tried to play one by one, gave what I can.
 Yeah, I was very relaxed.  I tried to serve well.  And, yeah, it's very nice to win this kind of match like this.  So very, very happy.
 Q. I can only imagine, it's only too bad that you couldn't have had a capacity crowd there tonight to cheer you on.  Obviously very few people there.
 UGO HUMBERT:   Yeah, for sure.  It will be better with the crowd, but nothing change for me.  I tried to play my game, and that's it.
