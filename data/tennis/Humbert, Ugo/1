U. HUMBERT/M. Cilic
6-3, 6-7, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk about how you managed to recover physically from two very difficult first rounds and then battling through that three-setter today?
UGO HUMBERT:   Today I played doubles, and after my match against Tsitsipas I did physio, so massage, a little bit of cold, and, yeah, I tried to sleep.
Today it was physically hard, but I'm happy to be in quarters.
Q. Another great win, another three-setter.  How have you handled yourself this week?  Why are you succeeding?  You put together a nice winning streak between your last tournament and here.
THE MODERATOR:   Regarding the tournaments of Europe...  (translating).
UGO HUMBERT:   Yes, since beginning of clay I was a little bit confidence because I didn't play a very good U.S.
Yeah, it's a little bit, my game is a bit different.  I try to play more aggressive, good matches against great players.  It's continuing.
Q. What have you learned about yourself this week as you get through each round and continue to win?
THE MODERATOR:   (Translating.)
UGO HUMBERT:   I think I try to put energy I can put in each match, but I think mentally I'm very strong since one month, and I can win matches in three sets.  I won a lot of breaks, so I think I'm better in the key moments.
Q. Can you just look ahead to your match against Milos Raonic?  What do you make of that matchup for you?
UGO HUMBERT:   It will be tough, because he's in confidence.  He serve very well.  He had good result since restart of the tour.
But now I just would like to recover and I will prepare my match with my coach later.
