THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  What is your feeling?  Because this is a very short French Open.  
UGO HUMBERT: It's a very short French Open indeed, as was last year.  I'm quite disappointed first of all.  I think my game was not that good.  I'm disappointed, in a nutshell.   
 Q.  How do you assess your development over the last months?  Of course the surface is not ideal for you, but how do you assess yourself?  
UGO HUMBERT: I'm another player when compared to January, which is quite positive.  It's true that I haven't played that much on clay.  Last year I only did three tournaments in Futures and the quallies of the French Open, so I do not have that much experience on clay.   
But I have made some progress over the last two months.  I could work hard and improve.  I think this is something positive.  This is a period of time where I learn a lot, and I think it's a good omen for the future.   
 Q.  You're 20 years old.  There are not that many players who have a higher ranking than yourself at your age, so I guess this gives you a lot of hope.  So that's two questions in one.  And what could you say about the lack of Next Generation in French tennis or what people say about practice?  Because you see a lot of young players all around.  Do you feel that you work less or differently or depends on the private structures, the private camps or the federations?  What are the reasons, according to you, of French players having difficulties in getting higher in the rankings?  
UGO HUMBERT: As far as I'm concerned, this is not relevant for me.  I'm trying to focus on my career.  I work hard.  I am very much focused.  I've been with my coaches for five years now, and I do not wonder about French tennis.  I just try to carry on and deal with myself.   
It's more important to focus on my own career rather than looking around.  It could be interesting, but my own project is important for me.   
 Q.  Are you going to look for the grass season now or are you going to focus on clay?  
UGO HUMBERT: I have a doubles with Mannarino and then I am going to do grass tournaments.  I have never done it in the past.  I wanted to do Ilkley last year, but I did not manage to get in.  It's going to be a wonderful experience.  I did hit some balls on the grass last year, and I liked it.  I'm going to do a Challenger in Surbiton, and then I will play in 's-Hertogenbosch, and then I will do Ilkley that I couldn't do last year, and then in Antalya and Wimbledon afterwards.   
 Q.  As you have started on carpet actually it won't be that much different; right?  
UGO HUMBERT: Yeah, I started on carpet in Metz.  I think this surface will suit me.  We need to be very aggressive, so it's good.   
 Q.  I'm going back to my question.  When you say that you don't look around yourself, does it mean that you're not curious about what is happening around you?  
UGO HUMBERT: Yes, I am interested in what the best are doing, yes, this is interesting.  But what I want to say is that I don't want to tackle federation issues.  This is what you mean?   
 Q.  This is what you mean.  
UGO HUMBERT: I don't want to make an assessment.  It's not for me to judge.  I think that others play very well.  I'm in my bubble.  I'm focused on my own career.  I have my coaches.  And if some other players play well, I'm very happy for them.   
 Q.  And did you manage to grab things from the others saying, Oh, this is good playing method or it's a good game plan and I could actually draw upon that?  
UGO HUMBERT: Personally, being what I do with my coaches right now is something that is satisfactory.  I have made some progress there.  Of course you can always get some inspiration from the best, but I don't ask myself too many questions.  I'm quite simple.
