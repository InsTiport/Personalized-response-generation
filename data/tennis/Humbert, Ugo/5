  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I'm wondering, how do you feel coming into this tournament knowing the kind of success you have had this season?  What kind of expectations do you have of yourself?
 UGO HUMBERT:   I don't have any expectation this week.  Just really happy to be here again.
 I really love this tournament.  I'm looking a good match against Ruud, so just happy to be here.
 Q. Why do you think you have been able to kind of do really well this year?  What do you think has been the biggest difference in yourself and in your game this year?
 UGO HUMBERT:   I work every day to do that, so I think it's a lot of work.  The motivation was there, and that's it.
 Q. Some players have said that even though there haven't been that many tournaments this year, they kind of found it still very mentally exhausting just because of the difficult conditions and things like that.  How have you handled all of that?  Has there been anything that's particularly tricky for you, or what's your mentality like?
 UGO HUMBERT:   No, I think it's a real chance to play a tournament again after the COVID-19, and, yeah, just enjoy the game, to be on tour.  I'm happy, so nothing, nothing special.
