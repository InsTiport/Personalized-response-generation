6-4, 7-5, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Many people were saying Auger-Aliassime was the future of men's tennis.  Are you the future of men's tennis?  
UGO HUMBERT: I'm very happy about this match.  Felix is a great player and a good friend, so I was really happy to share the court with him.  For sure, it will be the next generation and the future.   
 Q.  You will be playing the champion next.  In your wildest dreams, did you imagine?  
UGO HUMBERT: Yes, it's a dream.  It's maybe the best match of my career, for sure.  I would like to enjoy this night, this victory, and I will prepare my match against Djokovic with my coach.   
 Q.  Your form is clearly very good at the moment.  Do you think you have a realistic chance of beating the champion?  
UGO HUMBERT: Yeah, I would like to play my game, and yes, I have the chance.  If not, I'm not coming on the court (smiling).
