R. FEDERER/M. Baghdatis
  6-4, 6-3

 Q. (On the match)
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I was feeling okay out there, but Roger was serving well. He didn't give me any chances. I was a little unlucky at 5-4, and he broke me there and then he was more relaxed in the second set. 
 He played very good. He didn't give me any rhythm and my serve was not working so well. He deserved the victory tonight.

 Q. (On feeling any affects from last night and difference from previous meeting in Indian Wells in March)
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I was ready today and even though I had the great win yesterday I don't think last night was a problem. He just played very good. I was hitting the ball well, but he made me feel like I had no solutions. He played really smart. He played a lot differently tonight than Indian Wells, where he was playing backhand to backhand. 
 Tonight he came to the net more, and I wasn't expecting that. He played really aggressive and it wasn't my day today and I couldn't push him to making mistakes.

 Q. (Overall week)
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: It was a great week for me, and now back in the Top 20. I felt great. I am fit and playing top guys well. I played three Top 10 guys and one Top 15 (Cilic) in the first round this week. 
 Playing those matches without any pain is a bonus for me. I have to continue the way I'm working and just be patient and more success will come. I don't have to think about any points or rankings and my ranking will go up by itself.
