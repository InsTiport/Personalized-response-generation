   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  The statistics showed there wasn't very much between the pair of you.  Where do you think you won it? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Maybe I played better than him in important points and I served much better than him in the fifth set.  I won so many points, free points, on my serve in the fifth set.  I served pretty big.  And I guess that's where I made the difference. 

 Q.  You looked as if you were out of the match in the third and fourth sets.  How did you get back in the fifth? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I wasn't out.  He was just playing unbelievable.  He was hitting the lines.  He was just playing so big.  And I felt that when I sat down at the end of the fourth set, I said to myself that I have to start serving big because I wanted to win easy with free points on my of serve, and that's what I did. 
 I guess that's where I made the difference. 

 Q.  Does this win set you up nicely for the rest of the tournament? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  For sure.  I mean, first two rounds were tough.  I took them match per match.  I'm pretty happy with the way I'm playing at the moment.  I'm playing very good.  I'm moving good on court.  I'm fit.  So I guess I'm ready for any opponent. 

 Q.  Have you been foot-faulted that many times before? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Not really. 

 Q.  Seemed to worry you a bit. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, it doesn't worry me.  I just have to work on it a bit tomorrow, maybe, and that's all. 

 Q.  How much do you think it may have taken out of you physically? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, I'm pretty fit.  I think I work hard in the wintertime and I'm ready for matches like that.  I have the day, the whole day, tomorrow.  I think I'm playing night session on Saturday, so I have the day also on Saturday until the match, so I guess I'm ready for another battle against Lleyton. 

 Q.  Do you prefer the night session? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  I don't mind, no.  I hope I'll play night session. 

 Q.  What is your record against Lleyton?  How many times have you played him? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Once. 

 Q.  How do you feel you play against Hewitt?  Does your game suit his game? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Well, it's tough to say.  I just played him once.  It was on grass.  It was the quarterfinal of Wimbledon.  He started the match really bad.  It was a very good fight at the end. 
 I think he's at home.  He's playing good at the moment.  He's confident.  So I guess I just go on court and I think I'll just try to find the solution on court. 

 Q.  I thought it might be your home game on Saturday night. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Meaning what? 

 Q.  The Greeks in the stands. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know.  I hope they come.  It would be nice atmosphere out there. 

 Q.  You had ice on your elbow at Kooyong after one of the matches. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  It's much better.  It was just the balls.  My hand was a bit tired.  I rested a bit before getting to Australian Open.  It's getting better and better. 

 Q.  You said you were working on your serve also at Kooyong.  Tonight the percentage was very consistent. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, I was good.  I was serving big.  Especially, like I said, when I needed it in the fifth set, it was there.  I won so many free points with my serve.  So I'm pretty happy the way I'm playing.  I'm very happy about everything.  I mean, I'm fit.  I'm moving good on the court.  I'm hitting the ball good, clean.  I'm serving not bad. 
 So I guess I just go out there and fight and try to find a solution.
