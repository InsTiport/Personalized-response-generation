   THE MODERATOR: Unfortunately it is my displeasure to announce that Marcos has to withdraw from the tournament due to injury. He will be replaced in the draw by a luck loser, and that lucky loser is Lukasz Kubot off Poland. Lukasz will go trait into the second round.   
 We'll now open it up for questions.   
  
  Q. Can you explain what your injury is.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, it's been on my left groin. It's been four days I have pain. You know, I don't want to risk too much by going in the match and making it worse, so I took the decision today with my team not to participate here.   
  
  Q. Is it a sudden injury or something you've been carrying for a while?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, like I said, it's only four days I felt pain on the left groin. I've been working on it with my physio. I cannot say it is not better. It is a bit better, but I just don't want to risk it.   
 There is the Open, Australian Open coming on, and today I felt it a bit. I tried some shots today. I tried to, you know, go for balls that yesterday or the day before I didn't go to. I felt a bit pain, and I prefer not to risk it.   
  
  Q. You didn't mention it yesterday. Was that because you were hoping you would be okay.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, I don't want mention. I don't want to make a fuss over something that maybe will not be, you know. So I didn't mention it, yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you feel it'll be 100% by next week?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I hope so. I'll try for sure.  
  
  Q. Is it something you've had in the past?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I just answered no. It's just been four days.  
  
  Q. I thought you meant it hasn't been a long-term thing, but previously at some point...  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Ah, no, no. First time. Never.   
  
  Q. When are you going to head to Melbourne now?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't know. I just took the decision. I don't know. Maybe stay couple of days, see my family, and I'll see what I have to do.   
  
  Q. Was it a difficult decision to make or easy in the end?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I mean, I'm a bit disappointed. I'm the defending champion here and I wanted to play so much. I have family here and I wanted to play in front of them, too. It was not an easy one, but sometimes you have to take decisions that are not easy.
