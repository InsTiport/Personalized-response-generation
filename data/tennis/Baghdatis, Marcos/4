J. TSONGA/M. Baghdatis   
6-7, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  What about your feeling about the match?  Got off to a good start and you slumped physically.  
MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I set up good tactics for the first two sets.  But I couldn't play the same tactics for the whole match.  That's it.   
 Q.  You delivered outstanding dropshots.  Was it part of the tactics?  
MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yes.  I didn't want to give too much groove to the game.  He's a very good player on clay, so I wanted to break up the rhythm.  I wanted to cut short the points.  I didn't want to remain far behind the baseline, so it worked out for the best for the first two sets.   
But I'm tired but I know why I'm tired.  That's the way it is.
