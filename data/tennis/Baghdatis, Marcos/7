MARCOS BAGHDATIS   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You had to soak up a lot of pressure before you got the best of him?  
MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yes, I had to.  I think I stayed strong, especially in that eighth game or ninth game.  Eighth.  Yeah, 4-3 for him.  Yeah, I had to stay strong.  I don't know what happened there with my serve.  I served four double faults.   
I had to stay strong through the baseline, not give points away, you know.  I did that, you know.  A bit lucky on the challenge where I challenged his forehand wide.  I thought was out, but, you know, you never know.  It could touch the line.  I was a bit lucky there.  Sometimes you need luck to go through, and I had it today.   
I'm very happy with the victory.   
 Q.  Was this how you expected the match to go or were you expecting it to be tougher?  
MARCOS BAGHDATIS: A bit easier (laughter).   
No, he's in great shape.  He's in great form, won two tournaments already.  I think he's one of the most confident guys, if you take Novak out, Djokovic.   
So I think he's playing great tennis.  I knew it would be very tough today physically, mentally.  I think that's why I held strong at that eighth game, because I knew beforehand that it would be tough.   
Yeah, I'm very happy, also, the way I ended it.  I think I started playing better and better throughout the second set.  Yeah, I'm very happy.   
 Q.  You will most probably be playing Djokovic next.  How are you approaching that match?  
MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I mean, he has a match today to play.  For me, it will be a privilege to play against him.   
I mean, he's one of the best players who we ever have had in our sport.  It would be a great privilege to have a chance to play against him again, and I hope I'll take my chance to find a way to win.
