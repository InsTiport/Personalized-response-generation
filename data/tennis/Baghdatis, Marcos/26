M. BAGHDATIS/R. Gasquet
  6-4, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. Is that the perfect preparation for the Australian Open?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah. It's confidence building up. I felt pretty good on court. I have some things to work on still. I have tomorrow and Monday to work on my serve, first serve percentage. I think that's all. It's the only thing that worries me a bit.
 But basically that's all. Yeah, just have to work on that a bit and that's all.

 Q. Do you get an extra lift when you walk into Melbourne Park?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, it helps, you know. Just won a tournament; your confidence is up; feeling pretty fit; two matches, three sets; playing good; moving good; feeling fit.
 So I think everything is positive.

 Q. Have you had a look at the draw?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yes, playing first round Lorenzi. I don't know too much the guy. Never played him before. Most important thing, like I said, is work on the things that I have to work on and get ready for the match on Tuesday.
 Then I think if I do that and stay focused, keep my feet on the ground, then I'll find a way to win.

 Q. Where is your confidence at in comparison to other Australian Opens you've gone into?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: For sure next week is another tournament. Obviously my confident is good, but I need to win some tournaments -- some matches in Australian Open to build up again.
 But if I stay focus and find the way to win the first two, three matches, then I could be very dangerous and confident.

 Q. Is Australia a second home for you?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: The first home in tennis-wise, because there is not too many tournaments in Cyprus.
 So, yeah.

 Q. So you obviously love coming to Australia.
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, I have great support here. People are very friendly and very nice. I like the cities here, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne. Every time I come I'm happy and playing great tennis. It's just great.

 Q. You showed a lot of emotion when you won tonight. Talk about how you felt when you won.
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I felt great. It's my brother's birthday, and I wanted to win for him also. It's been two years tough for him. He had some problems.
 So I'm very happy that I won today and can dedicate this win to him. It's great.

 Q. How long will you sign autographs for outside, or will you take a back door exit?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, I'll sign a few and go have a shower and go relax.
