  Q.  What seemed to happen towards the end of the first set?  What turned it around?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  First set, I mean, we both played great tennis.  I got broken at 3-All, I think.  Was 3-All or 3-2?  I don't remember.  I got broken being 40-15 up, made some not mistakes, but didn't finish it off, so that paid.  Then I got broken again at 6-5, 30-Love up.   
 Nadal got confident in the second set.  He wasn't missing a ball.  He was playing great tennis.  Too good for me today.  That's it.   
  Q.  If you had to say there's a major difference between his play and your play, what is his strengths versus your strengths?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know.  I don't really know.  It's the first time I play against him.  It was a good lesson for me to see how he plays and stuff.  He has a great forehand, great backhand.  He has every shot.  He's a great athlete.   
 I mean, physically he's amazing.  It was a good lesson for me today.  I think I know what to work on now more.  Not work on more but, I mean, I saw how he's playing, I know now his game, so next time I play him I will have maybe a tactic to play against him.  That's all.  That's a good experience for me today.   
 I didn't play so bad.  Like I said, he was too good for me today.   
  Q.  Do you have any words for your Greek fans?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Any words for my Greek fans?  Thanks for coming.  I mean, I'll keep fighting for my country.  We have an important Davis Cup match in two weeks.  I'll be there.  I hope they will be there.  I heard a lot of them are coming.  I want to tell them that I'll do everything for my country to go up.
