   THE MODERATOR:  Marcos Baghdatis.  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Can you sum up your feelings after that match?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Well, disappointed for sure.  I had my chances in the first, second set.  I didn't take them.  I had a lot of set points in the second.  Didn't take them.   
 I was a break down.  Start fighting back.  I don't know what to say.  I'm a bit disappointed because I lost.  It was a tough match.  Djokovic played well.  He had a good fight, too.  Somebody had to win today, so it was him.   
  
  Q.  How is your shoulder?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Shoulder wasn't nothing special, just a bit heavy with the balls, the wind.  I don't know, the balls are very heavy with the wind.  I had a bit of pain on the serve but nothing special.   
  
  Q.  You appeared to keep resting it against the wall.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  It was just a bit heavy.  It was tough to hold the racquet, but was okay.   
  
  Q.  Were you aware of how excited the crowd were?  It's the best match we've seen at Wimbledon this year.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  You know, when you lose, you're not aware of a lot of things.  No.   
  
  Q.  How about your fans?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  They were great, yeah.   
  
  Q.  There must be some consolation to you how well you played, coming back from two sets down?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, for sure.  I had a good fight.  I was proud of myself because I gave everything.  That's a good thing.  So I'm proud of myself for that.   
 But a lost is a lost (sic).   
  
  Q.  You lost to a very special player.  Not many people who would have beaten you in a match like this.  Can you say something about how you see Novak, and if he has a chance of going further?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, I think he's playing great tennis.  His serving pretty big.  He's returning.  He's really aggressive.  He's playing great.  He's feeling good.  He's confident.   
 I think at this stage of the tournament anybody can win it.  Roger for sure has a bit of an advantage because he's playing so well on grass.  Anybody can win it.   
  
  Q.  You were smiling for a lot of the match.  People were saying it was a great sporting occasion.  It was a gentlemanly game.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  We're human beings.  I accept losing.  I accept a lot of things in life.  That's life.  I mean, you have to accept everything.  You have to continue.  I lost today.  I'm a bit disappointed.  But I'm happy for Novak, that he can go through and maybe win it here.   
  
  Q.  Word about your supporters?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  They were lovely; they were great.  I want to thank them a lot for coming.  I know there is a lot of Greek Cypriots here in London, especially in north London.  I want to thank them again for coming.   
  
  Q.  Do you know how they get tickets?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, I don't really know.  They buy them.   
  
  Q.  Do they queue every day?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know.  Maybe they steal them (laughter).   
  
  Q.  There's a word of George Michael coming.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Who is a Cypriot.   
  
  Q.  He was in the crowd.  Did you know that?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I didn't.   
  
  Q.  Were you aware the police had to calm them down at one point?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, I didn't see them.   
  
  Q.  Are you quite friendly with Djokovic?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  He's jumping around all the time in the changing room.  This guy has a lot of energy.  He's just jumping, playing all the time like a small kid.  But he's a funny guy.  He's a great guy.   
  
  Q.  What makes him so difficult to play against?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  He serves well, like I said before.  He returns very good.  He makes you all the time play.  He's not hitting the ball very hard, but he's all the time on the ball.   
 He's just making you move from one place to another.  He's playing a lot down the line.  He's only making you move.  It's a bit like Andre Agassi but in a different pace.  He's just putting the ball in.  He's not like hitting it very hard.   
  
  Q.  Amazing record in tiebreaks.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  True, true.  Not only in this tournament, but the whole year.  He's having a great tiebreak - how you say it - record.  Yeah, maybe it's because he's winning all the important points.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it's a shame he's got to play tomorrow without any time to rest?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I think that's the way it is.  We have no choice.  We have to deal with it.  That's the way it is.   
  
  Q.  Who do you think will win between him and Nadal?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Tough to say.  I don't know.  I will just give Rafa 60/40 because Djokovic is tired.  That's why.  Normally it's a 50/50 match.   
  
  Q.  If you are advising Rafa about how to play him now, what would you say?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  What would I say?  Be aggressive.  Be aggressive with him.  Don't let him play.
