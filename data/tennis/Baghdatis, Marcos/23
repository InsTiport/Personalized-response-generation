 L. HEWITT/M. Baghdatis
  6-0, 4-2 (ret.) 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was the nature of the injury?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: We don't know yet. I just felt some pain in the shoulder. Felt a bit yesterday on the serve, a bit today, and in the match I just couldn't, you know, hit the forehand. I couldn't control the ball. I was pushing the ball.   
 Basically, against Hewitt, it's tough to...  
  
  Q. So you were aware of it yesterday but thought you could get over it?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, I wasn't worried about it at all. I wasn't thinking about it because I wasn't worried. I had a bit of pain, but nothing. I'm usual to pain, having a little bit of pain everywhere.  
 But I didn't think that it would be this painful and this bothering during the match.  
  
  Q. How did you feel during the warm-up?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I was okay. Yeah, when I warmed up I was okay. Like I said, I felt it a bit on the serve and forehand, but I wasn't too worried. We had a massage before the match. I thought it was a bit tense, but I guess not.  
 They say it's the tendon of the biceps, so I'll have an MRI tomorrow and see how that goes.  
  
  Q. You didn't get it playing beach cricket, did you?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't think so, mate.   
  
  Q. Was there a point in the match where you particularly...  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No. The whole match -- from the beginning, I mean, I wasn't serving over 200 kilometers per hour. I wasn't serving. I was feeling the pain when I wanted to hit the ball on the impact. You know, when you do that, then you stop moving, you stop -- everything goes wrong because you're just thinking about the pain and not the forehand and the serve.  
  
  Q. What did Lleyton say to you after the match?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, I mean, nothing. He said he's sorry. He wishes luck for me. That's all. Nice like always.  
  
  Q. What did you make of the way Lleyton was playing? A noticeable improvement from the last match?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't know, mate. I was on me and feeling the pain. I wasn't looking Lleyton. I don't want to talk about Lleyton.  
  
  Q. How do you rate his chances against Roger?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't know. I don't want talk about that. Sorry.
