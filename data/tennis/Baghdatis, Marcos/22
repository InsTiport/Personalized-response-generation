 M. BAGHDATIS/G. Simon
  7-6, 6-4 
   
  Q. Can you tell us about your game? How do you think it went?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I cannot say much, you know. And the only thing I can say I fought through and that's all. I didn't feel too much. Also concentrating on, you know, not throwing up on the court or some points.  
 You know, I served pretty okay, I think. I served pretty big on the important points. And Gilles, you could see he was out for a long time. He needs some matches, some confidence. He was making a lot of unforced errors, giving me three points so I took them basically.   
 In the tiebreak, he gave me the tiebreak basically. He made unforced errors, so I took them. I tried to stay in the match and that's what I did. And I won the match.  
  
  Q. What is it? Have you checked it? Is it food poisoning?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I think it is, yeah. It is food poisoning. I have cramps in the stomach, and I'll go see a doctor and maybe we'll see what's going to happen.  
  
  Q. You're one of the personalities who sort of gets involved with the crowd. Do you think the game or the sport needs more people like you?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't know. Everybody has his own, you know, his own character. His own way of being on the court, off court, you know. And it's a matter of personalities.   
 Sports needs a lot of different personalities. It's always nice to have different personalities, and I think that's important.  
  
  Q. How do you describe your personality?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: You know, it's not up to me to describe my personality, no. I'm just the person who I am. That's the way I grew up. That's the way I'm on court, off court. I'm a happy person and that's all.  
  
  Q. So you try to pass on this happiness?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, I'm not trying to do anything. Like I said, I'm just myself on court, off court. That's all.   
  
  Q. So how do you see your chances now after winning the first match, because it was a very tough day the first match?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I don't know, you know. We'll see the doctors first of all. See how things are going, you know. I'm happy I'm not playing tomorrow. Maybe I'll play on Thursday. I don't know. I'll see. But, no, no way? So Wednesday I'll play.   
 So I'll have a day off. I'll see how my stomach goes, see how I feel. And I cannot say much, you know. Maybe I beat Gilles today, but if I'm not fit, I can lose to anybody.  
  
  Q. 5-4, 40-15, you took that break. Was it specifically for that?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Sorry?   
  
  Q. When you took the break?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, it just felt that I needed to go to the toilet at that moment. So I couldn't hold it any longer, you know, so...
