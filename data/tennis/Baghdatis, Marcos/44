   THE MODERATOR:  Marcos Baghdatis.  Questions, please. 

 Q.  What was the key to the victory? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know really.  Winning the tiebreaks.  It was tough out there.  Conditions were tough.  We both didn't play very good.  We didn't serve very good. 
 It was tough to serve.  It was tough to feel the ball.  So I just fought through. 

 Q.  How hard is it to hit a winner against him, because he's very fast and steady? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  It's very hard.  He's moving pretty good.  He gets all the balls back.  It's very tough. 
 But I just tried to fight, just tried to put the ball more times than him in the court.  That's what I did.  That's why I won. 

 Q.  You have some great fans. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, it was nice having them. 

 Q.  Do they follow you everywhere? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Not really.  Not everywhere.  But I have some in Australia.  The Greek Cypriots, we are a lot in the whole world.  We have a lot in New York, in London.  We're 25,000 here.  They came to see me and that's really nice. 

 Q.  Does it boost your game? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  For sure it helps you.  It motivates you.  It gives you some energy. 

 Q.  Do you know some of them? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, not really. 

 Q.  Of victories like this or a guy like Davydenko, how much of the victory is more mental than physical and technical for you? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I'm just trying to play my game.  I mean, when I play guys like this, I'm just trying not to make more things that I know and just trying to do what I know, just try to play my game. 
 I've beat good players before in the past.  Every time I go there, when I play better players than me, especially in the top 10 and 5, I'm more concentrated.  I think that's the key. 

 Q.  Who do you think the steadiest player is? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Roger.  He's not only moving well, but his ball is really heavy.  It's really tough. 

 Q.  Now that you've got through, do you think the fans will be in the next game? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I hope. 

 Q.  You'll have loads more coming out? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know. 

 Q.  You had the breakout a year and a half or so.  Are you still surprised at how successful you've been, or do you expect more out of yourself? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I expect more. 

 Q.  Because? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Because I know I can play good tennis.  After Australia I didn't play so good, especially the last six months I wasn't playing good at all, losing a lot of confident.  I'm trying to find my way back and go up there in the top. 

 Q.  What have you done to put yourself in this point where you are playing well again? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Just had some changes.  I mean, had some changes, working hard, trying to be more consistent every day, working hard trying to find a new thing every day to work on and improve. 

 Q.  You're a guy who seems to get a lot of joy out of the sport.  Have you found it's also very much of a job? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, when I was a kid, I took it more like fun.  But now, like you said, it's more like a job.  I start to realize it.  I wake up every day and I know why I'm here and I know what to work on.  It's not like I don't have a coach tell me do that, do that. 

 Q.  Rafa, Moya and yourself are all from Mediterranean islands.  What makes it so special? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  The food.  I don't know. 

 Q.  What part of the food? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  The sun, I don't know. 

 Q.  In Cypress, tennis must have come on a lot. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, more kids playing tennis today than before.  It's nice to see that.  Not only tennis, but other sports.  I mean, there is more competition with soccer. 
 Before it was only soccer.  So now there is more sports in the country, so it's good, good competition.  It's nice to see that. 

 Q.  The shirts your fans were wearing, were they Cypriot shirts? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Greek. 

 Q.  Can you picture on Sunday Marcos Baghdatis holding up the winner's trophy? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Why not?  I know I have to play better, but why not? 

 Q.  You're feeling that good about yourself now where your game is at the level? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Like I said before, I mean, I can beat good players.  I can beat a lot of players.  I did it before.  Every day's a different day.  Every match is tough. 
 I need to stay concentrate and play my best tennis to win. 

 Q.  Talk about either Djokovic or Hewitt. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  They're both tough opponents, especially Djokovic is having a great year this year.  He's very consistent.  I think he's leading now. 
 But Hewitt is a tough player, too.  A lot of experience.  I can say he has seven lives.  He's never giving up.  He's always there.  I'm looking forward for tomorrow's game. 

 Q.  Has this Wimbledon been tough with the weather for you? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  It wasn't easy for sure.  It's boring, I guess.  That's the way it is.  We have to find a way to get through.  That's life.  That's what I did.  I just tried to stay concentrate. 
 Just try to go every time I go on court to be there and not out.  That's what I did.  It's working.  I'm pretty happy. 

 Q.  Do you like the grass? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No (laughter).  Of course, I do.
