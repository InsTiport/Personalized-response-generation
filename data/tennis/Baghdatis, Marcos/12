  3-0 (ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What was the problem? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: The problem is that it's been five, six days that I'm in bed with high temperature. Yeah, I flew in a bit late coming here. I couldn't fly because of the high temperature.
 Today I felt a little bit better, but I couldn't -- you know, on court just could not give my best. I think it's not good to stay out there. 

 Q. When did you arrive and where were you? Were you in Cyprus or Paris?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I was in Croatia. I went to practice there a bit. Yeah. 

 Q. When did you arrive here? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Sunday night. 

 Q. Not really feeling any better?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No. 

 Q. Hindsight is great, but should you have withdrawn before the tournament? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, I think I came here to give it a try. That's what I tried to do. Why not come here and try, you know? 
 I just couldn't. 

 Q. Did you feel dizzy on court? Did you feel unwell?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I felt no energy, no power. 

 Q. In terms of the extent of it, do you know if you'll have to withdraw from any other tournaments?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: The next tournament is in three weeks, Indian Wells, so, yeah, I'll get some time. And, you know, definitely I'll play in Davis Cup. 
 So, yeah, I'm going to go home and try to see my doctor and try to feel better and start practicing as soon as possible. 
 I mean, today before coming on court I thought I was feeling pretty okay. You know, I had more energy. But, you know, I think it would take a few days for my body to recover and come back. 

 Q. Has it affected practice? Have you not been able to? Have you been on the practice court or just not felt well enough while you've been here?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, I've been only ten minutes on the practice court the last seven days. So, yeah. 

 Q. Total of ten minutes?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yes. I was in bed for five days.
