M. BAGHDATIS/M. Ebden
  3‑6, 7‑5, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It's been a good run to Melbourne:   two quarterfinals back to back, Brisbane and here. 
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling pretty well.   Today was not the greatest match I've played, but very happy because I might get this conditions up in Melbourne.   It's nice to feel bad in these conditions and fight through.

Q.   How hard was it with the ball toss and everything out there with the wind?
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   Actually, everything was hard.   I wasn't hitting the ball very clean.   Yeah, didn't know where to move on court a bit.   It was kind of weird. 
But Matthew I think came up in the first set playing very aggressive and very good.   Towards the end, I mean, I'm happy the way I finished.   I was serving much better, and yeah, I fought through.   I found a way to win.
I played great in the tiebreak, so I'm very happy.

Q.   Do you normally have a hit after a match? 
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   Yeah, depends.   I mean, that's up to my coach mostly.   If he sees some things that we need to work on, then, yeah. 

Q.   Did he surprise you a little bit today?
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   I mean, surprise me?   I saw him play before, but it's a different thing playing against a player.
Yeah, in the beginning he was pretty pumped up and he played really well, but, you know, I started very slow myself. 
So, yeah, he did a bit, but I think if I started a bit better, then he would go down a bit.

Q.   Was it just the conditions that led to your slow start? 
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   Conditions, yeah.   I think so, yeah. 

Q.   You're up against Del Potro.   Thoughts on that? 
MARCOS BAGHDATIS:   Yeah, I don't know.   I didn't talk with my coach yet.   I just played 2 hours 15 minutes.   I'm happy I won today.
I will start thinking about the match maybe tomorrow.
