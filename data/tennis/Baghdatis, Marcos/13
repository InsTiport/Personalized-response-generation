 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You must be feeling pretty good about your game, the way you're playing.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Especially today. I had a not-so-good first-round match. I had to fight out there. I won that one today. With my coach, I think we put a great tactic in place and it worked pretty well.   
  
  Q. You've had a lot of long matches here. This could have easily been another one. Nice to finish it in quick time.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: For sure. It's nice to finish matches early to keep some energy for the next rounds of the tournament.   
 But, yeah, for sure.   
  
  Q. Are you feeling plenty of crowd support as well?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: It's great. Every time I come here, I feel great. It feels like I can say my living room. Rod Laver, I played so many matches. I feel so good there. I feel like home. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. How far do you think you can progress?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Take it match per match. I won today. It's a great victory for me. Just go relax today and start thinking about my next opponent tomorrow or maybe tomorrow night.   
  
  Q. What do you think about Jurgen Melzer? You're playing him the first time ever.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, I think so. I never played him before. He's playing pretty good. Lefty.   
 Like I said, I'm not at that match yet. You know, I just won a great match today. I played really good. Go talk with my coach about what I did well, what I have to improve, then start talking about Melzer tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Where do you see your level right now? How close to your best form that you had before?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I'm improving every year, like all the players are improving. I can say I'm playing the best tennis of my life every year. So I cannot say, you know. Everybody's improving. Tennis is changing. It's not like 2006. Everything is moving.   
 I think I'm in good shape, best shape.
