   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Down 6-2 in the tiebreak, what do you call on to maintain your focus and turn that around? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I just said to myself, Just stay focused and play every point - and that's what I did.  I guess the only two first serves in a row I put was at 6-3, 6-4 in the match (smiling).  That's what I did. 
 I was really solid, played a fantastic lob on set point, the fourth set point.  I'm pretty happy.  And Moya started to go down physically, mentally.  He just wasn't there.  I just wanted to finish it off as soon as possible, and that's what I did. 

 Q.  You're going to play against Robin Haase, one of the surprises for the tournament, who beat Berdych.  What are your expectations? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Haase is playing very good.  He played good last week in Washington.  He's coming up.  He's a young player.  He has nothing to lose.  He will just go in the court and play solid, play his game. 
 I'll just stay focused, just try to stay a bit better than today.  I'm not worried, I'm playing good from the baseline, I'm returning well.  The only thing I guess I have to do better is just serve better, just find my routines. 

 Q.  Were you surprised to see the air come out of Moya the way it did? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, it was surprising because I thought he would fight.  I don't know.  I don't know what went through his head. 

 Q.  Why did you shave the beard? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Felt like shaving it (smiling). 

 Q.  Can you explain a little bit about the film crew thing that has been going on evidently for quite a while. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  It's a film, a 'reportage' that they want to do for the academy that I was based in, that I'm based in now.  So they're following like seven players, other players and me, like to show what's the tennis life, how does a champion come through.  They started doing that when I was -- in 2004 when I just finished number one junior.  I guess just to show my career. 

 Q.  Have they been using the film as they go along or is it going to be one big thing? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't really know about that.  I'm not into it.  I'm not the one who is taking care of this. 

 Q.  The guy who shoots it, it's just one guy? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Four. 

 Q.  You don't know them?  They just follow you? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I know him now.  He's one of my good friends (laughter). 

 Q.  How long did it take to meet him?  I know they're not here this week, but how is it during a tournament? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I didn't know them before.  There are four.  I just tried -- the boss was traveling in the beginning with me.  I was feeling good with him, but he had to stop.  I tried two guys, and I didn't like them.  Then the third one was a good guy, I felt good with him.  He's a friend now. 

 Q.  At any one time, how many guys are following you around? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  One. 

 Q.  Just one? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, all the time. 

 Q.  The first one was in 2004.  Now you're on the third guy? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Do any of the other players think it's a bit strange? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know.  Nobody told me anything. 

 Q.  Does he come in the locker room? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, no, not allowed.  It's more about life.  It's like outside, what we do after match, between matches. 

 Q.  Go to dinner? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, stuff like this. 

 Q.  Do you think it's going to go on a long time? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  I don't know.  We're just discussing about it.  I don't know if it would continue.  For the other kids in the academy, it stopped.  With me, we don't know yet. 

 Q.  They're all other kids in the academy, not other tennis professionals? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  They're kids, 16, 15 years old. 

 Q.  They're playing in local or regional events? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  International, juniors, everything. 

 Q.  Do you like it?  Is it fun to have this guy around? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  Yeah, really the guy who's with me is like -- I don't know, I don't really notice he's here.  I just don't notice.  He's a great guy.  I feel good with him.  Feels like a friend.  Slowly, slowly you get - how you say - the rhythm.  You don't see that the camera's there. 

 Q.  Do you ever take him to dinner or does he watch you eat? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, he eats with us (smiling). 

 Q.  Camera on? 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS:  No, off.
