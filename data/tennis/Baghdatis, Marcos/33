M. BAGHDATIS/J. Benneteau
  6-3, 7-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on the match?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Tough conditions. Didn't play my best tennis, but I'm happy I went through. That's a nice first round to have in those tough conditions, 2 hours 40 under the sun. 
 It's a good way to start the tournament. 

 Q. You've played here a little bit. Is that some of the toughest you've experienced here?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yes, one of the maybe third toughest, yeah. 

 Q. Anything in particular that you found hard or different?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: The sun was very hard. You're talking about Benneteau or the conditions? 

 Q. The conditions. 
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Because I played Benneteau three times. 
 So, no, the conditions, the sun, the sun, it's just very strong. Just even being out there, you cannot breathe. I just want to, you know, puke. But I'm happy I went through, so... 

 Q. You escaped a pretty tight one, then?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Exactly.

 Q. How was your serving today?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Not so good, but I don't really care. I'm happy I went through. I have one day to work on it tomorrow. I'll try to work on it and get better. 
 I cannot be perfect every day. I think I need some matches. I'm confident. I think I'll take day by day and work hard. I think my serve will come one day. 

 Q. You say this is the third toughest conditions you've played in. What was the first toughest?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Stepanek 2006.

 Q. You always have the crowd, the loyal supporters. How much do they bring to it?
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: A lot. I mean, they help you get through tough moments. One more time that's what they did today. They were there. They helped me get through this tough moment.
