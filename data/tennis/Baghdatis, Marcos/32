 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How were you feeling out there under the sun?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Pretty good. I'm feeling good, you know. I had some time back home, so I'm pretty, you know -- I'm good in the head, good physically. I'm rested, so...   
 I'm pretty happy I'm playing that well on the court. That's good.   
  
  Q. How did you prepare to play Gulbis?   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I played him a month ago in Del Rey Beach not so far from here. Basically I know the guy doesn't give rhythm. He's smacking all the balls around, you know. So I just kept -- you know, played point per point. Just tried to put the ball back as many times as I can.   
 It's not easy playing guys like that. That's what I did. He came with lots of unforced errors. That's the way I had to play today, so I'm pretty happy I did it good and I won and I'm in the next round.  
  
  Q. Do you expect to get very far? I mean, what are your expectations for the tournament?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, you know, my expectations is the next round, you know. I'm just going to watch who I play next round. Today I'm going to have the day to relax, and tomorrow start talking with my coach about my next match.  
 Basically, that's it. Take match per match and just try to go throughout the two weeks here.   
  
  Q. Do you find it difficult having achieved so much coming to this press conference here and there's three or four people? Does it seem weird, or do you look at it as it's a whole new journey and an exciting journey?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: No, it's my -- it's my ranking. It fell down. I was injured last year, so, you know, I don't really mind people don't caring about me, because I know when I go up there they will start caring about me. I don't mind, you know. I don't mind.
