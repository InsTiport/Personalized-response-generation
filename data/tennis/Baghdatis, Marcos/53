THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. If you can, assess the way you feel. Last year, you didn't make it past the first round. Here you are, off to a nice straight sets start. MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, pretty good. That's one of my best first rounds in a Grand Slam, so I'm pretty happy about that.Q. This is your third US Open. You're 21 years old. What does it mean to come to New York and play with all of the sort of grandeur of New York City? How does that feel to you? MARCOS BAGHDATIS: I played lots of time here. Playing Juniors here I had great moments here. Playing two finals, had best moment of my life here playing against Roger in Ashe stadium. First time in my life I played in front of big crowd like that. So, I mean, had great emotions. Coming over here, every time here, I'm really motivated and want to do well. So I hope this year go better than last year and the years before. Q. Having gotten to a Grand Slam final this year, does that give you confidence? I mean, you went up against the best player in the world without argument. To have gotten into the final of a Grand Slam, does that help you? MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Of course. I mean, it helps me I gain confidence after the final in Australia and after also semis in Wimbledon. I gain so much confidence, and now I know that I deserve what I've been through. I mean, I'm just pumped up and ready for even maybe winning a Grand Slam. Q. How about this Grand Slam? I know it's early to say, but... MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, why not? I'll play every match and try to win every game I play and we'll see. FastScripts by ASAP Sports...
