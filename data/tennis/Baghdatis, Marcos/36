  M. BAGHDATIS/ T. Johansson  
6-4, 6-4, 6-4  
   
  Q. I was going to ask you how you were feeling first of all.   
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Oh, feeling great. Just wasn't playing unbelievable. Tough conditions, but I'm happy I won, which is the most important thing, and I'm feeling great. I'm enjoying it out there. So that's the most important thing.   
  
  Q. It seems like there's some heavy-hitting Eastern Europeans out in your corridor like Karlovic and Djokovic today. Do you feel that improves your chances or changes them in some way for the semifinal meeting?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Every match is tough and every player is playing good. Karlovic lost to a good player who was playing good on grass, so every match is tough. Djokovic lost to Marat Safin, who I think is a great player. He did a lot.   
 So every match is tough, like I said before, and I think that I have to stay focused in every match and just try to find the solution to win.   
  
  Q. I noticed your eye. Is something bothering you in your eye?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, something was.  
  
  Q. Did you take care of it?  
 MARCOS BAGHDATIS: Yeah, it's fine.
