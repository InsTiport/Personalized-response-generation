Q. You've had a certain amount of success at the US Open, but probably most known for
losing to Jimmy Connors on his way to the semifinals. Some sort of special place in your
heart for this event?

PAUL HAARHUIS: Actually, you know, I've had a fair amount of success here. The match
against Jimmy Connors, in my mind when I think of the US Open, it doesn't really -- it's
not the first thing that comes to my mind. It's one of the things, but it's part of a
fantastic match here at the Open. People say in the last ten years, one of the matches
they remember, I think that's one of them. You can look at it that way. You can also look
at it that, "You lost to Connors." I did lose to him. He was better that day.
I've had some great matches here. I always enjoy coming out here to New York. This is
where internationally for me it started in '89 when I beat McEnroe in the first or second
round. 

Q. Second.

PAUL HAARHUIS: That's where it started for me. I've had some great wins here. Beating
Becker when he was No. 1 on the way to the quarterfinals, US Open winning in doubles. It's
the whole atmosphere. Where you've been successful, you like to be back. I enjoy very much
being in Manhattan, New York. I think it's a great place to be. I don't know if I would
want to live here. For the two weeks that I'm here, it's fantastic:
