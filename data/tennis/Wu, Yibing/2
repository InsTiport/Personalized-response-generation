G. SIMON/Y. Wu
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Simon was very consistent from the baseline.  Do you feel that you needed to hit very big to win points against him?
YIBING WU: Yeah.  I tried to keep, like, ball more deep and tried to catch a chance when he hit, like, a little bit soft.
Q. In the next few months, as you play more ATP-level events, what part of your game will you be looking to work on first?
YIBING WU: I think, like, more baseline and I try to go to net more times.  Yeah.
Q. It's very difficult for many to transition from the juniors to the pros.  What advice have the other Chinese players given you?
YIBING WU: You mean other players?
Q. Other Chinese players, yes.
YIBING WU: It's more about mental.  Try to keep the same thinking and keeping tough.  Try to be more focused on tennis.
