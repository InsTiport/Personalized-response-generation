 Q.  What went through your mind when you missed the six match points?  
YIBING WU: That was tough.  My hand was shaking.  Only thing I can do is try to recover after that.  I think I doing well in the second service game, yeah.   
 Q.  End of the first set until middle of the second set, I think you won six games in a row, five, and started playing aggressive.  Was that your plan from the beginning?  
YIBING WU: No.  Actually, I a little bit tired from the doubles.  Yeah.  What I think is just doing my best and let's see.  My opponent has really, really good serve.   
So I just broke the return and try to hit more rallies.

 Q.  What do you think this title, both singles and doubles, means to your country and especially men's side?  Of course China has a lot of good female players, but maybe many people are expecting male, men good players.  What do you think...
