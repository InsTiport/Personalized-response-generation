Q.  Your thoughts when you were ahead 5-Love and how were you feeling at the time? 

LEA GHIRARDI-RUBBI:  She says I was trying to think nothing, just play point by point, but then at 5-Love I had began to doubt and I thought myself it couldn't go on and this was my mistake.  It was a big mistake. 


Q.  Can ask you her to assess Capriati's play. 

LEA GHIRARDI-RUBBI:  She says had her -- she hits really, really hard and at the beginning -- in the beginning I was playing well, but she was making a lot of errors and then she started to hit really, really long and really hard and I was doing all the running. 


Q.  Did it surprise you that the match turned so fast? 

LEA GHIRARDI-RUBBI:  Yes.  The answer is yes.  But she said the mistake I made was that I kept waiting for her to keep making errors and that was my mistake.  I should have gone trying to do -- to go for the points.
