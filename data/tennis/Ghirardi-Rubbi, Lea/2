Q.  If someone had told you before this week that you're going to making the quarterfinals after the qualifying process, would you have been happy with that, would you have taken that?
 
NICK KELAIDIS:  Excuse me?  One more time the question in the beginning. 
 

Q.  Starting out with the qualifying and somebody had told her before the week, before the qualifying if she, you know, were going to advance to the quarterfinals, is that something she would have been happy with?
 
NICK KELAIDIS: Yes, if somebody -- if it's said by somebody she trusted, yes. 
 

Q.  What happened with the injury and how did that effect her play after at that point?
 
NICK KELAIDIS: Already she was hurting a bit before, but then she really strained it when she slipped on the court.  As far as affecting her game, she tried to forget about it and didn't let it affect her game.  She continued playing the match as if there was no injury. 
 

Q.  Does she think her performance today will give her more confidence?
 
NICK KELAIDIS: This week or today only? 
 

Q.  The whole tournament with Sabatini and the other ones.
 
NICK KELAIDIS: Yes, obviously it is going to help her confidence in the future tennis, but she added saying that anyway every new tournament is a beginning and you have to forget the week before. 
 

Q.  You feel this is your best tournament performance so far in your career?
 
NICK KELAIDIS: It is her best performance, yes. 
 

Q.  One last question.  Did she feel the fans were with her out there and does she appreciate that; her being the underdog today, especially?
 
NICK KELAIDIS: Yes, a lot.  She's sorry she couldn't give them the spectacle that they should deserve to have.
