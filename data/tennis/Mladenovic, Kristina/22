7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  Can you explain your loss?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, as I said during my first press conference, that I was expecting a difficult match, because I never found a way to win Andrea in a one-on-one.  I think she likes the way I hit my shots.   
I think that we all know what the good points and the bad points of somebody is.  I don't really know hers.  I think that one of my weaknesses was the breaks and the not being able to save a set point.   
It was very close during the first set, and, you know, there is a very small, thin line, but obviously there's always something that makes things tip to one side or the other.   
I think that she released her shots much faster, and for me, it was harder to do.   
 Q.  There were these two double faults that were hard to swallow.  Do you think they may be related to lack of confidence?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, it's hard to get the point, but I was in a good position.  I was dominating.  I was leading.  I was managing my first serves.   
I think the details are very, very close to winning, and then there are double faults.  Maybe it's lack of confidence.  But not when I'm going to serve.   
I wanted to get my first serve, and I missed by very little twice.  But it's not a good thing to do two double faults at this very, very important stage of the tiebreak.   
 Q.  Thierry Champion was saying that you needed two hard wins.  You were lacking two hard wins to get back on track.  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: No, I don't really think so.  I think that quite frankly I had good matches in Madrid, and then what happened in Rome was, well, I was a bit under the weather, but obviously there is a draw, so it's very random.  You don't know who you're going to be playing.  Andrea was a semifinalist here.  She had already won against me three other times or four other times.   
I think it's a question of chance and who is your opponent on the draw.  Maybe I would have managed the first round, but you know that the first round, the two first rounds are the hardest.   
 Q.  It's a big disappointment.  What is your strategy going to be to recover?  Are you taking off for a few days?  Are you coming back?  What are you going to do?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, I lost a tennis match, but it's not the end of the world.  It's true that I'm the first disappointed.  It's always an important two weeks that I would like to share with everybody.   
But I think that you really have to continue and keep going.  There are some details that were not right, were out of sync today.   
But I think that I'm not going to question everything and go too far deep.  I think that there are clear details that I know about and that explain what happened, so I'll just continue to work on it.   
As you know, these seasons are very long, and I think that you just have to continue to work and learn from your failures.   
 Q.  The game of your opponent wasn't right for you.  What could you explain about this?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, I think it's a bit difficult to answer.  Everybody has preferences.  It's the way she hits the ball.  I try and play very strong, but when it comes back, the return is very low.  The bounce is very low on both sides.  Today is fine day.  It's a bit damp, and I felt that the balls were kept quite low near the court.   
I like to give more effects to balls, lifting them.  I tried to round up my backhands, but she wasn't disturbed by it.   
 Q.  We know that the French Open, Roland Garros, is your tournament.  So I guess the disappointment is compounded or it's just a loss?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, obviously it's a great tournament, and it's one of my favorite tournaments, no doubt about that.  But as we have always said, it's a match.  It's sport.  Nothing can interfere, I think.   
You can't write the script yourself every time.  I would have liked to remain here, but whatever happens, it still is my favorite tournament.  I still have very good memories and very good feelings.   
Today didn't work, but I enjoyed trying to do my best and fighting as I did today.  So we will try another time.
