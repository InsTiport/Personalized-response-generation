 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It was a tough match for you today, what can you take away from that one?
 KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   Not much, to be honest.  Well, I just think I was too short today, I couldn't find solutions against Jessica.  I have to give her credit, she really played really well.  I felt like she had control of the court, of her shots.  She was very aggressive, had lots of winners.
 I tried different things, but I feel like she was always coming up with an answer.  So, yeah, I didn't manage to find the solution to, yeah, to make it a bit closer and to give myself more chances.
