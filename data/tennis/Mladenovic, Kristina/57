THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   First time together?   
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   Yes.   Obviously it's our first title together, but it was just matter of time, I guess, as we played many of the finals already last year.  
Well, we are just really delighted.   We knew that at some point it will come because we are such good friends and we play amazing tennis together.   So we are just extremely happy, and especially since we discussed to play together and have high goals and we are just enjoying on court and happy.   
   
 Q.   What is it that you did last year in the three finals that you were together that you did something different this time?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   Well, one final was my fault.   I was injured, so I retired.   We won't count this one.   It was in Cincinnati, but it was big tournament.   
TIMEA BABOS:   And Paris it was ‑‑  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   In Paris was first time ‑‑  
TIMEA BABOS:   First tournament together.   Wimbledon I think we cannot really count.  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   We lost to Errani and Vinci.   
TIMEA BABOS:   They played the best tennis of their lives, so it was just...   
   
 Q.   What would goals be?   I think last year you missed out, you were 11th.   Goal to go to Singapore this year, goals?  
TIMEA BABOS:   Well, definitely this year we are playing full schedule, full year together, so it makes a huge difference, because last year we only started basically with Wimbledon and then we made some huge results on big tournaments, Wimbledon or Cincinnati, so then of course it was our goal already to get in.   
But then I think this year it's gonna be not easier because it's never easy, but I hope with more tournaments we can build up easier our game together and a way to the‑‑ yeah.   
   
 Q.   What were you especially pleased with tactics‑wise today?   What do you think you did well against them?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   Well, you know, we played many kind of different opponents this week, all style of game, more doubles, more singles players, and we were really ready for obviously Muguruza and Suarez, great singles players, and they have great baseline game, good serve from Muguruza.   
We always do actually trying to focus on our game, the first strokes, serve/return, and then just to show that we can do something different, be more present at the net, cross more, because they are like solid and they are playing more like singles players.   
So we were trying to push them to play what we wanted them to play.  
   
 Q.   Do you think the fact that they obviously went quite deep in the singles, both of them, do you think that maybe had a bearing on their stamina or how they felt or maybe their disappointment at not being in the singles final?  
TIMEA BABOS:   I wouldn't say so.   I mean, it happens on most of the tournaments.   No, maybe another week we're gonna have the same issue that we play a lot, and then we have to go on the doubles court.  
But, you know, they played very, very solid last year together.   They were in Singapore.   They had many big results.  
I think many times it happened to them, this situation, and I think also everyone is really ready to play two matches in a day.   I don't think it should be a big issue.   
You know, today we had quite easy morning, and then not playing on the sun in 30 degrees I think also helped for us.   So, you know, I think it's just our job to do this.
