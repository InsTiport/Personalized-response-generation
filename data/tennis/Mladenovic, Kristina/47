K. MLADENOVIC/F. Schiavone
6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. We could have expected a long match, but you managed to weather the storm today.
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: I don't know how long we have played.  One hour and a half, I think.  Of course I expected a tough match.
As I told you before, I was playing Francesca Schiavone.  She's older, but she won the tournament here on her best surface.  When Francesca plays here, it's something special for her.  She's trying to transcend herself in order to find her best tennis.
It was not easy.  Conditions were tough.  It was cool today.  The court was heavy.  It was very difficult to hit the ball and to put her in difficult position.  She imparts a lot of topspin to the ball.  It wasn't easy.
In the first set I managed my game very well.  I didn't make lots of mistakes.  I managed to hit lots of inside-out forehands.
So I had to be vigilant, because she has great variation in her game.  So I'm just delighted to get through to the next round, because it was not a foregone conclusion, especially when you play against Francesca here at the French Open.
Q. You will be playing the singles, the doubles, the mixed doubles.  In Australia you were supposed to be playing with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, but you will be playing mixed doubles with Pierre-Hugues Herbert.  Will you repeat this experience for the Olympic Games?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: The Olympic Games are just around the corner, so we talked about the situation all together, all the French players, men and women.  We talked about that.  Now I can tell it now.
At the start, we wanted to play the mixed doubles with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the Olympic Games in Rio, but we tried to come up with the best options.  A decision has been made.
I will play with Pierre-Hugues Herbert in Rio, so why not try here.  Of course, we will have to manage our schedule.  It will depend on how tired we are.
We won't have the opportunity to play the mixed doubles with Pierre-Hugues Herbert.  Maybe at Wimbledon.  And Pierre-Hugues will play the singles and doubles tournaments in Wimbledon.  So we will see what's going to be the schedule.
Q. Do you know Pierre-Hugues very well?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Yes, we have played in juniors together.  I start my career at 16 years of age.  I'm in the mixed doubles.  I had good memory with Pierre-Hugues, he was traveling with his father and at the time I was traveling with Georges and my father, so we spent a lot of time together in the juniors tournament.
I know him very well.  We get along.  And on court we will see how it works out.  But he's a very good tennis player, a very good doubles tennis player.  It's quite exciting.  We are a young team.  We talked about it yesterday.
It's a nice story, because we are talking about the young categories of players.  We played in the juniors together, and we will represent France for the Olympic Games, and we will try to get a medal.  That's a nice story.
