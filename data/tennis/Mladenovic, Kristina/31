J. GOERGES/K. Mladenovic
7-6, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough match today.  What do you think were the deciding factors in the match today?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, I think it was a very close match.  You know, obviously tough for me, because coming from Madrid was totally different conditions.
Yeah, I started the week -- I mean, I arrived Sunday and I practiced just a little bit.
You know, today was very close, and I just think like it turned out pretty well for her.  I don't think I did anything really wrong, because it wasn't too bad, actually, coming from Madrid, because it's totally different.
I just felt that she was very successful at times, you know, like couple lines here and there, because honestly it was 7-6, 7-5.  Some incredible shots she played.
Q. Can you kind of blame your body?  Maybe you were too tired coming from Madrid?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: No, I was not too tired.  As I said, I think I still played a quite okay match, and yeah, I was obviously unlucky, because all the previous years I think was a performance bye, and this year, when I made it to the finals in Madrid, of course there is not any more, so I've got to play from the first round.
But I think I recovered pretty well.  I think compared to the conditions that is totally different, I still think I didn't play that bad.  It was just some details here and there, and yeah, I think she was not more lucky but more successful, honestly.
Like some shots, like when I had occasion, she would serve, like, couple times in a row on the lines or something.  Just couldn't break her.  I think she hold her serve quite well, and that's it.
Q. Haven't you thought about skipping this tournament in order to, you know, to rest yourself?  Or you just didn't want to miss this tournament?  Because I guess you like it, you know, like being here in Rome?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Of course I like the tournament.  It's a big tournament.
I mean, I have been doing well since the beginning of the year, and I have been playing tournaments back to back.  It's a great problem to have.
I'm not thinking about skipping tournaments, because I'm going deep in a tournament, especially a tournament like that.
As I said, I was quite impressed the way I recovered.  I had two days but not enough maybe for tennis-wise to adjust.  But, yeah, no, there is no way I would have missed this tournament.
Q. Obviously strange timing because we are watching the FFT president giving out the French Open wildcards right this second.  What do you think is going to happen?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: What?
Q. On my screen.  See this?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: And?
Q. He's giving out the wildcards right now.
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: And?
Q. What do you think is going to happen?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: I don't care.  About what?  Wildcards?
Q. Yeah, in terms of Sharapova.
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: I don't care.  Doesn't change anything.  What would you want me to say?  I don't care.  You're going to have the news in a couple minutes, I guess.
I know what's gonna happen.
Q. You say you know what's gonna happen.  What's gonna happen?
THE MODERATOR: She said we are going to wait to find out what happened.
