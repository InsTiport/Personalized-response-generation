K. MLADENOVIC/T. Babos
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. How did you prepare this match?  Because you know this opponent by heart.
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, that's true.  It was extremely difficult to prepare this match.  And she is a girl I know by heart.  She's one of my best friends.  We have known each other since we were really kids.  We practice together, we played throughout the year together, doubles last year.
It was not easy.  You know, when you know your opponent by heart usually this is not good.  The match isn't really good, because there's pressure, there's tension.  You anticipate her shots, you try and change your game to surprise her.
But it's also the attitude, the general atmosphere.  You don't exactly know what to expect and what to do.
I tried to work a lot on statistics with my coach.  This is what we did.  We looked at her past seven or eight matches on clay in the recent weeks, or, for instance -- well, we looked at her stats.  That's to help me in what I was going to do.
And the anecdote is that her statistics in the past eight matches are not going to give you all the details yet.  But look at her stats, today she did totally the contrary of what you have in the data.
This is the beauty of our sport.  It's also why this match was difficult.  I was ready.
I told Georges, I said, Okay, I have these statistics at the back of my head.  For instance, she loves -- yes, she loves to serve out on the T, on the T on her forehand.  This time, no, she did this only twice during the whole match.
So it's difficult.  It's difficult.  But I was ready.  I was very much aware of the fact that she's smart.  She would change her game, and I'm very happy because I was there.  I anticipated her game.  And I think that in general my match, the match I played, was very solid.  When I served, when I returned.  She serves well.  Her balls are very heavy, and I managed to return quite often.
I had rallies with her.  I was holding.  That's the difference today.  That's what made the difference today.
Q. Next round you'll be playing against a monument of women tennis.
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: A monument?
Q. Yes, a monument.  So what do you feel?  Are you curious?  Are you afraid?  What would you say?  What can you say about her?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Well, the first word I would use is "at last."  At last because -- well, well, what can I say?  It's going to be difficult.  Maybe I wanted to have a better draw, but as I was saying, when it was the first round I was saying I'm not thinking about the third round yet.  But then also I think it's very positive.
I have to take it very positively.  This is an experience, something to do, it's a dream.  I grew up watching Serena play.  Then I'm going to play against her.
So she is the best, I think, in my sport, as if you were saying, you know, you were saying "a monument.  She's a legend.  I'm extremely happy, because this is a challenge.  Well, this being said, it's going to be very difficult.
She is dominating.  She's been dominating every single match in the recent years.  And it's going to be very complicated.  And as we speak, frankly, I'm very happy so far.  I enjoy what I have done.  I know how difficult it was for me at the beginning of the tournament, so what I will do is -- of course I will debrief my matches.  I will enjoy these two wins, and then I will try and get ready as best I can for this match against Serena.
And then I'll have to make no mistakes if I want to do something against her.
Q. You defeated Na Li and Genie Bouchard.  What about her performance this year?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Not bad already, what do you think?
Q. Are you not afraid of being afraid?  Afraid to meet Serena?
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Frightened?  Afraid?  Well, fright?  Why?  Why afraid?  You're saying it, as well.  I have played against the top 10 players already.  Na Li, No. 2 in the world, on the Lenglen.  That's not easy.
Well, no, I'm not frightened.  No, I'm quite happy, I must say.
Again, the word "dream" comes to my mind.  It's incredible.  It's fantastic.  I was telling my parents, I was saying, okay, she's not ready to stop playing tennis.  I played her twice when we were playing doubles with her sister.
It's such a great experience to play against Serena.  And I said, I told them I'd like to play against her.  And then, okay, it's the third round probably on the central court in Roland Garros.  What else would I want?  I mean, why should I be frightened?  No, I want this challenge.  I'm looking forward to it.  It's not "fright" I would use.  It's not the word that comes to me.
Of course if she dominates, if she defeats me very quickly I'm not going to be the first one nor the last one she beats.  I will try and prepare this match.  You have to prepare such a match, you know.  You can't say offhand I'll do it.  No, I'm very happy, very happy about this new, big challenge.
