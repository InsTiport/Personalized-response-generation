  PAES-HINGIS/Nestor-Mladenovic6-4, 6-3An interview with:DANIEL NESTORKRISTINA MLADENOVICTHE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. Looking back now to the game, what would you have done differently?DANIEL NESTOR: Probably just maybe a little less aggressive on some second serves to Hingis.  Too many double-faults.  I was overaggressive.  The court was playing a little bit different than what we've been used to.  It was kicking more when we were playing outside.  Today it was more of a dead bounce.  I was maybe a little too aggressive with the second serve.Q. Were you content with your game today?DANIEL NESTOR: Well, yeah, I mean, they played better for sure.  Obviously there were things we could have done a little bit better.  But they were the better team.  I mean, even when I thought I was serving okay, they were still making a lot of balls.  They played well.Q. Can you assess your Australian Open overall?DANIEL NESTOR: Not ideal, obviously.  We played well in Sydney.  Had a little bit of a letdown here.  It's nice to win some matches in mixed.  Not the result that we wanted.  But it was okay overall.
