6-4, 4-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Walk us through the match, how you performed today.  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: Yeah, was definitely not an easy match.  I think she deserve her spot into the second round.  I was not surprised she had such an amazing win in the first round.  I could really see her potential, her qualities.   
It's never easy to face someone you never actually saw, so it's tough to know what to expect, what are her best shots and patterns in the key moments.  It takes a little while.   
Also she compete really nice out there.  She has a big serve, very heavy spin.  You know, I think I didn't play my best, but there was lots of things to work for and to stay composed.   
Was also a night session match.  Since we're here, playing under the heat, the bounce and everything is different.  I'm just very glad I found the solution.  I stayed composed.   
 Q.  Talk about the crowd a little bit.  They were obviously behind her since she's home favorite.  Did that affect you at all?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: No, I think it's great, great for the sport when you have such an entertained crowd.  They remain here in the stadium even if it's late.  I knew before the match she's local, she's from here.  For me, it's completely normal that they cheering on her.  She's young and talented.  She deserves that.   
I think it's very normal.  They still stayed very fair and very nice.  I still had fans on my side.  Overall I just think it's sport, that's how it is.  You have to embrace it.  I kind of like it.  It's enjoyable to play in front of the crowd.   
 Q.  Next up you'll play Anna Kalinskaya.  What do you expect from that?  
KRISTINA MLADENOVIC: She's also an upcoming player.  She's quite young.  Difference compared to today is we actually faced each other twice already before.  It's not like a complete unknown territory.   
I will have my game plan ready.  I will rest, have a good day of practice tomorrow.  I mean, she made it through quallies to her way to the quarters.  It's quarterfinal now.  Everybody that is still in the tournament is bringing a great form.   
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it on Friday.  It's late, it's already Thursday.
