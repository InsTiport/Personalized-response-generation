 6-2, 0-6, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 KRISTINA MLADENOVIC:   Yeah, it was for sure a difficult match, a big match waiting for me against Maria and, well, it was a great battle even though the scores were up and down from both sides.  I think I played well.  I controlled better than her the first set and there was definitely a key start in the second that I didn't manage well and she took advantage.  She was really finding her strokes in the second set and dominating.  I mean, it was a tough 6-0.  But I still felt I was in the match.  I was in there, my focus was great and a match needs to be won in two sets, so I regrouped myself the best I could for the third and I think I did that pretty well.  There were lots of close games in the third set and eventually it turned out to be on my side.  So for sure it was a very good win for me today.
