This year, 2012, was the most memorable year.
Q. It's good to see that Canadian tennis is very healthy.  What do you think?
ALEKSANDRA WOZNIAK: Yes, I'm very excited to see those young players from Canada that are doing well on the professional tours.  It was not long ago, because when I was young, we didn't have as many players.  Now I see Canadian tennis is developing on the professional tours.
Q. How to you spend your days since you've retired?  We suppose you spend a lot of time in the sun because you're tan.
ALEKSANDRA WOZNIAK: Well, this is summer in Montreal.
The transition is going well since I retired.  I worked with 50 schools to encourage young players to start playing tennis.  Since I've been retired, I've been working with the Tennis QuÃ©bec Tour to encourage young players to be active and to start tennis.
I'm a consultant for a Canadian champion who is becoming professional.  And I work for a company doing therapeutic clothes, so I'm still working in sports.
I participate in several events, and I would like to create a small foundation.  So I'm committing myself to several things to see what I can do to help.  I participate in many events.
I would like to create a small foundation.  I'm doing different things because I want to see what I will like and what I want to do.

I wanted to become a professional tennis player.  The dream came true.  I'm so happy that I was able to play here.  It was a dream.  I made it.
