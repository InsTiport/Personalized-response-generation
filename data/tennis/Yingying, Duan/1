6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  So after this match what is your plan for more matches? Are you going to take more matches or is it time off?  
DUAN YINGYING: This is my, probably my last match this year.   
YANG ZHAOXUAN: I'm not sure, maybe I will play in Shenzhen. Maybe I will take a break.   
 Q.  So maybe you can recap on your performance for the whole year after the final match today.  
DUAN YINGYING: I didn't play doubles this year and I was sick for three months at the beginning of the year and didn't play, I stayed at home. And after the break I didn't play singles and I played doubles only, more doubles this year and only a few singles matches this year. I've been doing pretty well in the doubles and with some breakthroughs and I hope I can do better next first half of the year.   
 Q.  Next year is the Olympic year and you've been playing with different partners. So what would be your plan for the doubles next year?  
DUAN YINGYING: I don't know because it changes all the time and I think nobody's sure who will partner with who, because it's still, we still have time before the Olympics.   
 Q.  So you've been changing partners very frequently this year, maybe you can tell us why.  
YANG ZHAOXUAN: Maybe it's because we have performed not so well and I haven't found the ideal partner, just trying different partners and I haven't found one. Similar to Duan. We played two matches and we had issues on the first one and that's why we didn't team up.
