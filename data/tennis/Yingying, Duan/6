D. CIBULKOVA/Duan Yingying
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Was the weather a big impact on the match?
DUAN YINGYING: Well, for aggressive players, the weather wasn't that good.  When you are actually standing in the position with the wind behind you, the wind actually had an impact, but it wasn't really big.
Q. Before this match, what were your tactics against Cibulkova?  Did it play out as you planned?
DUAN YINGYING: Well, last night I watched her match last week with my coach.  She is a small player, but with great speed, good ball placement.  However, today I wasn't really good with my backhand.  The balls were very low.  I wasn't really able to play my backhand.  I lost many points because I couldn't return those balls.  That was the biggest reason why I lost this match.
