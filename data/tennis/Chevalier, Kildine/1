Q. Did you play at the US Open Juniors last year or not?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yeah, and the year before.

Q. How did you do? What was your best result?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Second round.

Q. And you?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: I came last year, lost second round.

Q. What is the difference this year?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: I don't know. I don't know. First, I improve, for sure.

Q. Is that primarily the difference?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Physically, I don't know. Well, it's not the same when you're first
here and second year in Juniors. I was seeded four this year. Last year I was, I don't
know, not seeded.

Q. Were you not the best of the French players at 16?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Say again? I think. Yes, yes.

Q. And then you had some physical problems? 

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yeah. My back.

Q. You're better now?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yeah, sure. No more problem. Is finished.

Q. What did you do?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: I stopped like two months for this injury, and I worked with the
physio, Roland Garros, at the center. I don't know. I have some exercise to do every day
to get stronger, you know, my abdominal. Feels good.

Q. When was that?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Last year in July, and August.

Q. You are one of the group -- Mauresmo, Dechy, Sidot, now yourself. Are there others?
It seems the French have a whole collection of young ladies.

KILDINE CHEVALIER: They are one year older than me. They are very good. I think they
are better than me because they have very good result before. I try to join this group in
the WTA ranking. I have to play more tournaments, bigger tournaments.

Q. Have they helped you improve?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: I never see them.

Q. You're not in Roland Garros, not part of the Federation?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: No. Maybe I'm going to go this year. I wasn't in Paris. 

Q. You're from Lyon,?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: Yes.

Q. You're from Morocco?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yes.

Q. You still live there?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: My family. I live in Paris now.

Q. You're part of the Federation then?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yes.

Q. The match today, lost the first set?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: And I had to win it. I mean, I don't know, kept fighting. 7-6,
2-Love break. Just kept concentrating on myself and my tennis.

Q. That's it?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yeah.

Q. How important is this to you, Grand Slam title?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: I don't know. I mean, it's huge.

Q. That's it?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yes. Yeah, that's it.

Q. You won the first set?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: Yes.

Q. Were you all right physically?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: Yeah, yeah. But it was a tough match. She was playing very steady. I
won 7-6, I played a good first set. She didn't play it so well. She missed, I think, maybe
something she doesn't have to miss. Then second set, I was a little bit maybe tired
because it was quite longg every time, to hit the ball I lost 6-1. Third set she didn't
miss. I have to win all the points. It was really tough. She played very good.

Q. It's a dumb question, but not being seeded, is reaching the final, is that important
for you?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: I think in this tournament, I prove myself that I can beat the best
junior in the world, so it's good for my self-confidence. But, I mean, every time the
girls who are seeded are a little bit afraid to play girls who is coming outside, I mean.
I think it's a good place to take when you play good and beat the seed.

Q. Arnaud, are you going to start playing satellites or have you already started?

ARNAUD di PASQUALE: Yeah, I already started. I played like four satellites since
September. I'm 5-40. I think in two months, I'm going to play one more in Argentina. I
don't know yet. I don't know if I'm going to play or stop playing juniors.

Q. For you, will you play?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: Yes. I played last year. I played this year. I just play $10,000 and
$25,000.

Q. What is your ranking?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: 370. I'm going to continue. I have to play much tournament because
of the new rules, so.

Q. So you will play Juniors then?

KILDINE CHEVALIER: Yeah. Maybe only Grand Slam, maybe one before each. I don't know.
But not so much.
