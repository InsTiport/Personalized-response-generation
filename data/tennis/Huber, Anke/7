MODERATOR:  Questions for Anke.  
 
 
Q.  What do you feel went wrong out there this morning?
 
ANKE HUBER:  I guess everything.  I started to serve not very good.  I tried to make the points maybe too quick.  It's difficult against her.  She doesn't miss a lot.  You have to do everything alone.  I just didn't finish the points well enough.  
 
Q.  Is there anything you feel you could have sort of done to fight back? 
 
ANKE HUBER:  I had a few advantages.  It was not like that every game away like that.  I think in the first set I had three or four times to make a game, and I didn't do it.  Jut to take these opportunities and don't miss that many easy shots.  I really missed a lot of easy balls, which I shouldn't have.
