THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Can you just talk about the last four matches against Pierce, you haven't fared too well.  Although your record against her in general isn't too bad, you're going to have to come up with a different strategy in your next match?

ANKE HUBER:  I think I have to be very aggressive, try to make a move, and, yeah, like you said, the last four times wasn't so good.  So can just get better. (Laughing.)

Q.  Do you have any kind of strategy going in? Is there anything special you have to do?

ANKE HUBER:   No, I don't think she really has a weakness on her shots.  Both sides are very good - forehand and backhand.  Her serve is pretty good.  Like I said, her movement is probably not the best part of her game, so I just have to play my game.  Nothing really special.  Play aggressive, that's it. 

Q.  How would you say you're playing right now?

ANKE HUBER:   I think I'm playing pretty good.  Today was a great match.  I felt really good out there.
