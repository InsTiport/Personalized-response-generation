Q.   Was she just playing too well today or you felt you weren't on your game?

ANKE HUBER: I played the whole game like I started yesterday.  I think I just couldn't find the rhythm and just -- well, she played well.  But I just -- wasn't the game I should play.


Q.   Do you have any thoughts on why you are having this trouble now?   Is it just the shoulder or --

ANKE HUBER: No.  Well, it is also the whole game.  I think -- I didn't play well already in practice, so my confidence wasn't that good.  It is tough when you are playing like this already when you are practicing and you should go into a match and play much better.  Yesterday I played a little bit better in the third set, but still not very good, so it is tough like  that.


Q.   What do you think she did well today?

ANKE HUBER: Well, she served pretty good. She took the ball early.  She played very aggressive, so it was pretty difficult for me to find the rhythm in the games.


Q.   Does playing at night make a difference for you?

ANKE HUBER: Yesterday I played from day into the night so that is much easier I think with the lights when you start already when it is dark, it is quite difficult to play, but it is for her the same so, I don't like it too much to play with the lights.


Q.   Is there anything to do to get over a lack of confidence besides win matches?

ANKE HUBER:  Well, I think if you are playing well in practice then it is already much better for your confidence, if you have a good rhythm; good timings.  And, that is what I didn't have already the last couple of days, so I think it gives you confidence already when you are practicing well.
