MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Why are you retiring this year?

ANKE HUBER:  I think I answered that question a hundred times the last few weeks.  I'm a little bit tired of it.  I just want to do something else.  I'm not feeling this is what I really want to do for the next few years.  Yeah, I'm just feeling happy about it, to do something else, to have a little like three, four months, five months where I really don't have to think a lot about doing anything, playing tennis. 

Q.  How did you play today?

ANKE HUBER:  I played okay.  I mean, it was the first match.  It's always difficult.  The conditions are not very easy.  It was windy.  The court is very fast.  It wasn't easy to play.  I'm happy that I got through.  The way I played is fine.
