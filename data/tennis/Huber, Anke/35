Q. Had you watched her playing before and did she do anything better than you had expected?
 
ANKE HUBER:  Me? 
 

Q. Yes.
 
ANKE HUBER:  I don't think so, no.  I wasn't very happy with my game today, so I don't know.  I didn't do anything better -- 
 

Q. Did she do anything; what did you find hard to deal with?
 
ANKE HUBER:  I saw her a few times before, but-- so I knew a little bit how she is going to play, but I think her serve was not very good today.  A lot of doublefaults, but again, her game from the baseline was very good.  She hit the ball very hard, took the ball early, so it was difficult to find the rhythm. 
 

Q. Thank you.
