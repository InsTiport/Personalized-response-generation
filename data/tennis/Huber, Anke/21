Q.  Is that you in the baby picture that's floating around this place?

ANKE HUBER:  Yes.  It's great.  My mother chosed (sic) it, I guess.


Q.  Anke, where do you find yourself in your career now?  Finishing up in the Australian Open, you played that tremendous match at Madison Square Garden, you've had some injuries and so on.  Where are you in your career right now?

ANKE HUBER:  It's hard to say.


Q.  Such a simple question.

ANKE HUBER:  It's hard.  I haven't played Indian Wells.  I'm trying to get into my game now.  I played good in Tokyo, good in Paris.  I don't know where I am at the moment.  I hope I'm still in the middle and not going to the end.


Q.  The end is not here.

ANKE HUBER:  Not yet, no.  I have a few years  left.
