Q. Very easy, well, 6-2, 6-1 or 6-1, 6-2, did you hope to have a little more work out
there? Were you disappointed that it was that easy?

ANKE HUBER: No, I am quite happy with the way I was playing, so I didn't really need
more work out. I am playing mixed doubles today, so I get another work out there. But, I
am happy with the aware I played and I feel very comfortable out there.

Q. For you, the level of player you are, are you playing your best tennis right now or
is there room for improvement?

ANKE HUBER: It is hard to say. Well, she is not well maybe a top 10 player top 20
player, so it is quite hard to say. But, I am playing really good right now. I am also
practicing well and so, I am feeling very good and I think it is one -- yeah, one of the
best I am playing right now.
