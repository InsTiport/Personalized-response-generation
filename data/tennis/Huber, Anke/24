Q. After you won the second set, how confident were you that you were going to win the
match?

ANKE HUBER: Well, I think I played a very good second set. She also missed a little bit
in the second. I was confident. I had a couple of chances in the third set, which I didn't
take. I guess that was the reason why I lost. I had some advantages, which I missed maybe
too easy. I guess she just played very well in the third set, too. She didn't miss
anything. I had to do everything on my own. It was quite hot. The court is not that fast,
so it was quite hot to play.

Q. When you saw the draw, did you realize it was probably not going to be an ordinary
first round match?

ANKE HUBER: I wasn't happy when I saw it, I have to say. She was the first non-seeded
player. It's always tough to play somebody like that first round in a Grand Slam',
especially first round, you never start to play great usually. I think I didn't play that
bad today; it was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played. It was
just a tough one, so... I wasn't happy with the draw at all, that's for sure.
