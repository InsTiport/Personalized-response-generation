 Q. It was very hot. Did you suffer? Did it bother you? 
 
 ANKE HUBER: Because of the heat? 
 
Q. Yes.
 
 ANKE HUBER: No, the heat was fine. It just made the game quicker than maybe the weeks
before in Hamburg and Berlin. That was the only thing that was different. The court is
very fast, but the heat, that was not really a problem. 
 
Q. Do you think you can go far in this tournament? Did you see the draw?
 
 ANKE HUBER: I looked at it once very quick, so I didn't really check it. I have to play
better than today, obviously, to get further in the tournament. I think I can win the next
round and then we will see what's going to happen. That's what I'm looking at at the
moment, the next round.
