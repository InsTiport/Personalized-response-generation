Q.  What is your impression, your thoughts right now?  Were you stunned that she quit or could you tell that she was having problems? 
 
ANKE HUBER:  Well, I saw it already from the beginning.  I mean, usually she serves a little better, yes, and a little harder, so I saw it.  But it was very tough for me to play because I knew that if I am leading maybe a little bit she is going to retire and so I don't know if I just put the balls in, she hits the winners, so it was very tough for me to play. But I don't know what I am thinking right now.  I am happy that I am in the quarterfinals, but I feel sorry for her. I saw her in the locker room.  She didn't look very happy, so... And we are quite good friends, so it is not -- 
 
Q.  Did she say anything afterwards? 
 
ANKE HUBER:  No, no.  I think she wanted to be alone. 
 
Q.  Is it hard to prepare for the next rounds when you have only played for a little while like that?
 
ANKE HUBER:  Well, I have a doubles today so I will play a little bit more and I saved some energy.  It is not too bad.  I think I play tomorrow again, so, I don't really mind about that. 
 
Q.  Do you know what your record is against any of those players, Dementieva and Osterloh?
 
ANKE HUBER:  I think I lost to Dementieva once and Osterlo I never played. 
 
Q.  Could be a semifinal appearance?
 
ANKE HUBER:  Could be.  They played good. Osterloh and Dementieva had already a good year, you never know what is happening. 
 
Q.  You feel like it is a good opportunity for you?
 
ANKE HUBER:  Sure, I mean, it is a great opportunity, but I better don't think about it.  I just concentrate and play my game and not think about it if I have a good draw, that it is a good opportunity, otherwise, I am not putting a ball in.
