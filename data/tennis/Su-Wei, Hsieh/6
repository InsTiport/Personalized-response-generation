THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What was the key to winning today?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Yeah, just never give up.  I fight until the last point.  I do really well.   
It was very tough because last time I give her lot of double-faults.  This time I thinking, okay, I try to put more ball in, and I do good, yes.   
 Q.  Naomi said she thought she learned a lot from the last match she played against you.  She said she forgot you learned also.  What did you learn from the last match and how you used it?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: I normally don't have a very good memory.  But the good thing is my team, they have a good memory.  So sometime they reminds.  On the court it's difficult.  When I was very into it, I even cannot feel the people, you know, the fans.  I cannot feel anything.  I just very in the court, thinking what I need to do.   
I was have a little plan and I was doing pretty well.  I'm pretty happy what I'm doing, yes.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Nothing special.  I just thinking what is my best shot.  I was trying to focus on that one because last tournament I was try to do more different stuff.  I tried too much.  I put too much pressure on myself.  I have little defending points last tournament.  I was thinking this tournament I maybe don't do this same mistake.  I just focus more on my game plan.   
 Q.  We talked to your boyfriend, he said he's your coach, doesn't know very much about tennis, don't talk about tennis.  How does your team work in this way?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: When they're not from tennis you're quite relaxed because sometime you don't know what they talking about.  Sometime on the court, like sometimes I see my little sister, she traveling with me, she need to come on court and coach me.  Long time ago I was doing less fitness, my tennis level was not going good like this year.  The fitness was not very good.  Sometime I will get tired.   
I feel I'm going dead, I'm so tired.  She say, I cannot help you.  Maybe drink some water, you forget you are tired.   
So I think it work pretty good.   
 Q.  Did anybody ever try to change your game and tell you that you can't advance hitting two hands...  Or no?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Yes.  Actually they tried to improve my serve.  I say, hey, look, my arm is like this, so don't try to break my little arm.  I will try to do something else, but don't try too much, yes.   
 Q.  You talked about what you learned from last time you played Naomi.  Did you feel anything different from the way Naomi played against you?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Last time, I mean, after the match, now I can think little bit.  Last time I think she tried to change the rhythm on the match.  This time I try to focus on myself more.   
I know I have leading a lot last time and I lose the match.  I was thinking, no matter what happen, I focus what I need to do, then I try.  I did it.  It's very good what I do.   
 Q.  What about Naomi's serve, kick serves, you seemed to go struggling in the first set maybe?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Yeah, I don't remember.  I just remember she always make a lot of ace, ace, ace.  I just thinking if she make a lot ace, I just get in.  If I get in, I don't get it...  My plan is very simple.   
 Q.  How is this arm big enough to beat all these top players?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Good question.  But, you know, I play double hand so they become one arm.   
 Q.  Fredrik talked about the importance of him and your brother going with your routine, not over-practicing.  How long did it take you to figure out the routine so you're fresh?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Sorry, I don't really get it.   
 Q.  How long in your career did it take you to figure out the perfect routine to prepare for the matches?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Yes, because with my situation, I was very little bit like other country people, they don't have many sponsor, they don't have a lot of help.  I was traveling myself long time.  I have a part-time coach.  Was not easy for the player to play in the tour when they don't get a sponsor or they don't get help.   
One year was very lucky because I get some sponsor and I get Paul straightaway, then my ranking went like this.  Okay, I make a good decision.  We was working really well for four years.   
I don't know if you know the story or not.  I hire Paul, I was already 25.  I tell Paul, I think I have a chance to win a Grand Slam in doubles or mixed doubles.  That's why I hire you.  I want you to help me to get the trophy, to get souvenir.   
So he come and he push me to play singles.  Then I become singles player.  Then my ranking, yeah, he push me.  One and a half year he push me to best ranking 23.  Unfortunately I twist my ankle, I have no physio.  I went down.  I couldn't move my leg on the court.  I still tried to play the tournament.   
Because my ankle was pretty bad, Paul asked me who is your best partner.  Then we win the Wimbledon.  This is the story.  Quite drama.  If you never give up, I think there will be a good thing happen.   
 Q.  What do you make of the way the crowd responds to your tennis?  Does that help you play better?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Yes, when people support you, you always feel we cannot give up, need to hang in there because people is supporting you.  They buy the ticket, they coming in to watch you.  Sometime they from the hometown, local.  It's amazing to have the crowd that supporting you all the time.  So thank you so much.   
 Q.  Is there a style of player that you enjoy playing?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: I like to play with older player because you know if you don't like some player hitting super hard, topspin, slice all the time, but you made it, you know you made it.  You will know the next time you know how to beat them.  Even you lose, it's okay.  Next time you know.  You will find a solution to do some change, to play against them.   
 Q.  Today in the second set Naomi was leading 5-4, serving, 30-Love.  In that moment did you feel the match was over?  Did you believe you would be able to come back?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: I don't feel the match is over and I don't believe at the moment.  I just thinking I just played the shot.  As long as she don't hit ace, I keep hitting every ball.  I'm do good.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
HSIEH SU-WEI: I don't remember, sorry.  I don't remember she made double.  She make a double-fault, really?   
 Q.  Yes.  
HSIEH SU-WEI: Okay, thank you.  I don't remember.  Sorry.   
 Q.  Caroline Wozniacki, your thoughts on her as an opponent?  
HSIEH SU-WEI: I'm glad I did marathon match today singles and doubles.  I think my fitness is improved.  Hope I can hang in there to have my stronger little muscle to fight.
