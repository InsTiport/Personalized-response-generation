   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Your best ever performance at a Grand Slam tournament.  How did it feel?   
 MARTA DOMACHOWSKA:  Well, it was for me amazing experience to play today against Venus on the center court.  Well, I hope I can continue like this all year and see.   
  
  Q.  You had a couple breaks of serve in the first set with a chance of winning that.  What went wrong?   
 MARTA DOMACHOWSKA:  Yeah, I had some chances.  I had a lot of chances, especially in the first set, but I didn't use them very well.   
 When I had the chance, then I was doing easy mistakes.   
  
  Q.  How did you rate Venus' performance today?   
 MARTA DOMACHOWSKA:  I mean, she's a great player.  I was trying to do my best, but she was better than me.   
  
  Q.  Do you think she's got what it takes at the moment to win this week?   
 MARTA DOMACHOWSKA:  Well, sure.  I mean, she's one of the players that can win this tournament.  We'll see how it will go.
