Q.   You looked really confident out there at least in the second set.
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I served pretty good in the second set.  When I serve good I am really confident.  I mean, I think the serve was a little bit the key of the match, but I was really consistent when I needed and that was good for me. 
  
 
Q.   Could you tell that she was having a bad day?   She said she was not confident.
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't know.  She played three sets yesterday.  I think she didn't play too bad.  Maybe she was a little bit tired from yesterday, I don't know.  I just played my game and I want to win.  That is it. 
  
 
Q.   She said she had trouble getting the rhythm. Do you think that that might have been partly because  of what you were doing?   Do you think you were --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I didn't give her never the same ball.  I always tried to mix a lot, come to the net a lot, and stay a little bit sometimes in the back.  And she didn't know what I was going to do.  I think that mixed her up, yes. 
  
 
Q.   You are going to play Irina Spirlea next. Any thoughts on that match?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't know.  I play Wednesday.  I have time to think about my other match, I play doubles tomorrow.  Well, I have to play my game. If I play like I play right now, I have a good chance. 
  
 
Q.   She said she doesn't like to play under the lights.  How do you feel about that?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I was fine.  I have nothing to say about the light.  I was good on the court.  I mean, she played yesterday on Center Court, I don't play that.  It was the first time for me and I wasn't really disturbed.
