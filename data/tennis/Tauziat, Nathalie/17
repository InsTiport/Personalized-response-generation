Q.  You played her a lot this year.  How well did you think she was playing tonight compared to the other times?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: She played good tonight.  But compared to the other time I don't play really good tonight so maybe that made the difference but she didn't make a lot of mistakes today, that is for sure.


Q.  What caused you the most problems in the first set?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Well, I enter the match pretty late and she played pretty good.  She didn't miss one ball.


Q.  Did you feel mentally ready?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: I was ready, yes.  I have no excuse.


Q.  Did you feel in the second set you were one shot away from really getting back into the match?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: No, second set was close.  I have breakpoint almost every game; she served and I didn't make it.  So I think second set was more close and I can change some way if I made this ball, but I didn't do it.


Q.  Did she seem like the No. 1 player in the world to you? You have played her a lot recently.

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Well, I think the ranking right now, you know, is not really important.  I think she played pretty good.  Some other players played pretty good.  You can be No. 1 and lose the match.  It is important to be No. 1, okay, but I don't -- tomorrow maybe she is going to play less and you are going to say:  Oh, she is not really No. 1.  I mean --


Q.  Sometimes you have played players in the past who have been No. 1, have they seemed sort of almost unbelievable.  Is she in that category?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Now you have like ten or fifteen players can be No. 1.  So it is completely different like five, ten years ago.


Q.  Your year has ended.  Do you look back at it as a great year; maybe your best year ever?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Well, I don't know if it is going to be my best year ever, I am going to try one more year to play like this, so I don't know.


Q.  'til now?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: So far, yes, it is one of the best.
