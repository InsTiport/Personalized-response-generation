THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  I'd like to ask you not about the match but about the accommodation in Wimbledon for the players.  Because there are so few hotels near here, a lot of the players rent houses.  Is that something you're doing, and is that a good thing?  Is that a welcome break from staying in hotels every week? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah.  I think it's good idea to stay close, I mean, to the site first.  And after, to be in an apartment I think is nice so you can cook yourself.  I am not cooking, but I can try.  And you can be close.  I mean, just  -- it's good when it's raining, you know, all day.  You don't have to stay on site all day.  If you play third or fourth match, you can go back in your home and have a rest.  
 
Q.  And do you stay in the same place every year when you come here? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, I change a lot.  
 
Q.  Do you stay in a big place or a small flat?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, I change also.  
 
Q.  This year, are you in a  --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  This year I'm in a flat.  First time. 
 
Q.  One bedroom or  --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Three.  
 
Q.  Three, it's a big flat. 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  It's true.  
 
Q.  And do you get bored of staying in hotels every week?  Is it very boring?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Well, that's the way it is.  If you boring, you quit.  That's what I'm gonna do. 
 
Q.  When are you gonna quit?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I quit because I'm start to be tired to stay at the hotel and travel and whatever.  
 
Q.  When do you quit? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  At the end of this year. 
 
Q.  Have you announced that before, or  --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah, this whole time.  
 
Q.  This is something you've been planning on for a long time?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q.  And you'll be happy to leave the hotels?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yes.  Just to home. 
 
Q.  This time next year do you think you'll look back at Wimbledon and have good memories of the atmosphere here? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 
Q.  What's special about Wimbledon for you? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  The centre court. 
 
Q.  Just the centre court? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Uh-huh.  When there is a crowd and when they clap, it's special.  (Smiling.) 
 
Q.  Some people said the atmosphere here is quite elitist.  Do you think that's true? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, no, I don't think so.  No. 
 
Q.  Is this the best tournament  --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  It's more elitist, I think, at the French than here.  
 
Q.  And do you think this is the best tournament in the world here? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Oh, depend for what.  I like the French Open.  Even if I didn't play good, I like the French Open.  It's in my country, so I prefer. But I like here because I play well here, you know.  It depend.  I think the organization at the French is very good.  
 
Q.  And here is okay? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah, it's fine.  I mean, for me, it's fine.  I have no complaints.  I have no complaint.  
 
Q.  Could I ask you one more thing about the accommodation?  It's quite expensive now to rent property in Wimbledon.  I think it's  --
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  It's very expensive. 
 
Q.  I think it's 3,000 or 4,000 pounds a week. 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't pay that, but some houses are that price, yeah. 
 
Q.  Is that a bit of a problem for some of the players? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Well, if you consider you have to  -- you stay in The Gloucester, you have to pay two rooms, for you and for your coach.  You don't pay for you, but if you have to pay for you and for your family, it's the same.  Approximately, it's the same.  So, I mean  -- and if you prefer to stay at the hotel, you stay at the hotel. But the price, I mean, I think The Gloucester is expensive.  That's what I heard from the players.  I never stay at The Gloucester, so... 
 
Q.  But do some of the players say that they should have more of the organizers here give more money to the players to help them? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  We have a per day. 
 
Q.  Is that enough, 165? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  We have a good price when we're here.  
 
Q.  There's no reason to complain then? 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, not for me.
