THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  How did you feel you played in your match today? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I didn't play  -- I didn't move well.  I was little bit tired from my first round, I think, today.  And she played good.  She played  -- she was really very motivate, because I meet her in LA.  She was very focus, and she start better than me. 


Q.  Were you disappointed in your performance? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Well, yeah.  When you lose 2 and 2, you disappointed.  But I know why, so it's not  -- I mean, the thing I don't like is I don't fight.  And I don't like that. 


Q.  Did that factor into part of your decision to retire this year do you think, or no? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, no, no. 


Q.  No.  Why did you decide to do that?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: To retire? 


Q.  Yes. 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Because it's time, I think.  I'm almost 34 and I pass my time on the tour.  I mean, 17 years, it's a lot.  And that's the time. 


Q.  You were ranked third last year at one point in the world.  To go from that to, you know, retiring this year, it seems kind of, you know... What happened in that span of time? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Well, I was supposed to retire last year, because I was supposed to play Olympics and everything and I didn't.  And at the end of the year, I was feeling okay.  I was in good shape.  In September, I had to make my commitment for this year, and I decide to continue at this time.  I said, "Okay, I feel good.  I feel Top 10.  And I try to play one more year."  So I play one more year, and that's enough I think.


Q.  When did you know that it was  --?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Last year already.  I know that was the last one, yeah. 


Q.  Did you ever get out on the court for doubles today? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No. 


Q.  No, you didn't go out there.  Did they cancel that or postpone it?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Not yet.  At 6:30 it's said what we're doing. 


Q.  What will you do after you retire? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't know yet.  I mean, I stay home for a while I hope, and I have some project with the French Tennis Federation.  So I'm going to see if I do that or I do something else. But I want to stay home for a while. 


Q.  It seems to me that -- you're 33? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Uh-huh. 


Q.  That's not old.  But in tennis it is sort of, right? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Well, in sports I think it's old.  Except maybe golf.  So I'm gonna start to play golf. (Smiling.)


Q.  Are you? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah.  (Smiling.)


Q.  Basketball? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, no.  Just have a normal life and stay home, I hope, for a while and see the opportunity I'm gonna have.  I'm lucky to take my time and, you know, and not be worried about money too soon.  So I want to take my time. 


Q.  Is it the traveling, too, that gets to you after a while?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah, yep. 


Q.  Where is home now? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  In France. 


Q.  I came late, so I apologize if this was asked.  Just talk about the difference between last year's match and this year's match with Kim, how different it was.  She was basically putting the pressure on you all day, and you weren't able to respond.  What did she do this time and maybe a couple weeks ago in Los Angeles?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Just like I said, I was tired from my first round two days ago.  I play yesterday again a tough round.  I play doubles again.  With the heat we have yesterday and everything, this morning when I wake up, I wasn't feeling really great.  My legs was hurting a little bit.  And I think it was a  -- I mean, not very good day for me. She played better.  She played well.  I mean, there is nothing to say about that.  She played better than me today, and she played good tennis.  I mean, she tried to put me every time the ball in the feet when I was at the net.  And I was slow, so that make a difference.  I mean, against Kim, I have to be 100 percent fit if I want to do something.  And today I wasn't, and that's make a difference.
