NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yeah, I don't play really well. She play okay; not very good, but me,
I miss a lot of smash, easy ball; a lot of unforced errors against her; you know not to do
that.

Q. Did she not seem as sharp as she has been in the past?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: No, she played good, but I don't think she served -- she served like
she was serving before. That is it, but her game was not too bad.

Q. Could you see her winning this?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yeah, why not. After more matches, maybe she is playing much better.

Q. If you had to give some advice to Gigi Fernandez or Chanda Rubin who play Steffi
next, what would that advice be?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Well, they don't have the same game. I think Rubin have to really get
Gigi. She play really good right now and I saw just Rubin play against Steffi and Gigi,
she, I think she have to go to the net. That is is her game. She like this; if she play
Steffi, she has to play like this. And Chanda, she hit the ball very good. She has a good
chance.

Q. You wouldn't be surprised if Chanda played Steffi and gave her a real tough match?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: No, I wouldn't be surprised.

Q. Is that because Chanda's game has risen or it is because Steffi's game has gone
down?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: No, Chanda's game is much better.
