Q.  Nathalie, like a good Beaujolais, getting better and better with age. 
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yes, exactly the same.  If you have a new Beaujolais, so, I think I'm not like Beaujolais, but I am like the good wine. 
 

Q.  Nathalie, this is sort of a delayed birthday present for you, isn't it?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Well, yes.  I play -- I mean, I play well since one months, and I improve my game, and I get a lot of confidence.  And I'm very pleased about that.  And I don't know what's going on, but I play pretty well.  And I like the game I play right now.  I know I can play this game.  And I made it during the match, that's why I am pleased for it.  But I know I can play like this during practice, but not during the match.  I know I can play match like this. 
 

Q.  Your serve was very good tonight.
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yeah, I serve pretty good tonight. But when I'm confident, I think that's one of my best shots. 
 

Q.  I thought you volleyed really well (inaudible) what was your strategy going into the match?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: My tactic was simple, I have to play my game.  That's -- if I play serve and volley, I can't be very strong.  And that was my tactic today.  I have nothing to lose against her, and I just want to play my game.  And I know since two months if I play really well my game I can beat anybody. 
 

Q.  The end of the match, your gesture was very pointed. Did you want to show somebody anything when you pointed out?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: No, I just want point to some friend and my coach, Alexandra Fusai, my doubles partner.  And I was pleased to share my victory with them.  That's it.  Simple. 
 

Q.  Nathalie, do you think that she was surprised at the strength of your game tonight?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Maybe.  Ask her, I don't know. 
 

Q.  You've never beaten her before.  Were you surprised yourself at how fast it went for you?
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Not at that kind of surface, no.  I know I can beat her on fast surface, and I -- I do it today. 
 

Q.  I think you played her on carpet before, though, and lost.
 
NATHALIE TAUZIAT: Yeah, a long time ago in Philly, and I lost in three set.  But I play much better right now. That's maybe the difference.
