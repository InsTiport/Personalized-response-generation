Q. What made the second set so much tougher than the first for?

NATHALIE TAUZIAT: I think didn't play so well, like I played the first set. First set,
I mean, I didn't miss a lot of serve, and I volley pretty well. And second set, I start to
play shaky a little bit, maybe go less to the net when I have the opportunity. And I think
she played a little bit better, too. She is a fighter and maybe she change a little bit
her game. It was tough. I think I was lucky to win the second set.
