Q.  Nathalie, looked so easy in the first set, what was the difference in set two and three? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  The difference is I just go for every shot in the first set, but after I stop to do it. 


Q.  Became a little timid? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah. 


Q.  Why do you think? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Why?  Because maybe that the first time I take one is set to Monica, and I start to say, oh, that's good, that's good, to think a little bit, and I don't have to do that when you play Monica Seles.  You just have to go for every shot and play.  I think today I missed a big opportunity to beat her. 


Q.  Did she change her game at all, or was it more about the way you played? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't think she changed her game, it was more my -- I did not really change, but I just play a little bit behind in the first set and that's enough.  When you play Monica will take the ball so earlier, if you late, that's enough. 


Q.  Did she put more pressure on you in the last two sets Nathalie? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Not really, no, the ball was the same, but me I didn't take the ball so earlier than the big -- than the first set. 


Q.  You said last night this match would be a good prep for U.S. Open. 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yeah, it's good.  I just have to think I can play like I play first set and be okay. 


Q.  Did you weird out at all?  Does the heat have anything to did with it? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Not really, no, no.  That's for both players, so it's the same. 


Q.  Did you play about the same as she's played against you in the past?  You've played quite often in the past. 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Me, I play different.  Monica play always like aggressive.  My game changed for a while.  I didn't play her so many times compared to she go after the other players.  Last time I play her was in LA, I think two or three years ago.  I lost four and four, but I have some opportunity, too, so today I know I can play, well, like I play yesterday, too, and I take my chance first set, but you have to play two set like this against Monica. 


Q.  Said last night if you could come back and play next year some of the tournament that would be your favorites; would this be a tournament you might come back to? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  I don't know. 


Q.  Have you been following the controversy with Lisa Raymond about how she wanted to get on the U.S. Olympic team? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Ah-hum 


Q.  Do you sympathize with her a little bit? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Ah-hum. 


Q.  Based on your situation?  

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Of course, yes.  We're in the same situation. 


Q.  But you never contemplated doing what she did, going to court, anything like that? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  Yes, I do, in France. 


Q.  You did already or you're going to? 

NATHALIE TAUZIAT:  No, I did already, but it doesn't work, like her.  And that's strange, because everybody said something, it was a misunderstanding between the Federation and the players.  I have the same result myself, too.
