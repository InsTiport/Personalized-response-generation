 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Nicolas. 

 Q. Did you feel very sharp and concentrated today? You seemed to come out of the blocks very quickly. What does it do to your confidence knowing you are the title holder?
 NICOLAS MASSU: Well, I think I have a lot of memories of this tournament four years ago. I won singles, doubles, gold medals. I think I came here again after four years again is a big motivation for me. 
 And today I play like very concentrate, focused on my match. I didn't have a good year this year, maybe last year. These two years for me was a little bit difficult. I lost some confidence. So for me every match that I play, of course in an important tournament like this, Olympic Games, every match for me is big, and I try to do my best today. 
 I think I play very, very good, very concentrate. I make my work like the way I like it. I'm happy for that. 

 Q. The last time you played him, I think you had match points against you at one stage. 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Three match points. Yeah, I play with Darcis last year maybe. Yeah, last year in Sopot, clay court, Poland. Yeah, I remember that I have two or three match points. I have so many chances to win the match in Sopot, and I couldn't take it. I finally lost that match. 
 But tennis is like that. Sometimes you have match points. So that's it.
