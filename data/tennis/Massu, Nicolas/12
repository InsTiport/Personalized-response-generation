NICOLAS MASSU: I lost the match and I feel so pissed about that. I can't believe that I lost. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Before I lost the match, because I have a lot of chances, and I didn't make it. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I going to speak about that, but I can't believe they -- what happened in the court. Is too much. Is too much in five hours to believe everything, to fight, to arrive to the locker, to accept that you lost the match. Is difficult for us, for me. 

NICOLAS MASSU: No, everything. Everything. Is hard to accept that you lost. I feel so bad now. I can't believe that I lost the match. I don't know. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Which violations? 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, the first two was okay. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, I know that I have to -- the first two warnings was okay, nothing to say. But the third one, I can't believe. I can't believe. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I don't know. You have to ask the umpire. But I can't believe. I can't believe that. I didn't lost the match because that, but is hard to believe that this guy didn't use the head a little bit, the mind. I can't believe. I have nothing to say about the first two warnings. You know, I don't know. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, but normally all the players throw the racquet. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Which one? 

NICOLAS MASSU: I just threw like this. 

NICOLAS MASSU: The first two, yes, but the third one, no. I didn't lost the match because that. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I lost. 

NICOLAS MASSU: When? 

NICOLAS MASSU: After the match? 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yes. 

NICOLAS MASSU: That I play for five hours, I fight a lot, and this guy come here, put me two, three warnings. I accept the two first. If I have to pay something, I pay, no problem. But the third one is unbelievable for the people. Five hours play. I threw the racquet like this, warning, game, break of serve. Is unbelievable. I can't believe this. The other day, I come here to the ceremony at 8:00. I have to wait all the day here. The next day, I play first match. I ask the guy from the ITF or ATP, I say, "Why I have to come here at 8:00 and I have to play the first match on the next day?" He say, "Well, we forgot. We forgot. Sorry." What sorry? If I lost, what sorry? 

NICOLAS MASSU: I lost because my mistake. But this umpire have not to umpire anymore. This guy's unbelievable. 

NICOLAS MASSU: He never going to umpire me again. 

NICOLAS MASSU: No, no. I say this. 

NICOLAS MASSU: What do you think about the match? You asking me a lot. You saw the match? 

NICOLAS MASSU: What do you think about? Was okay or not? 

NICOLAS MASSU: That's okay. 

NICOLAS MASSU: Yes. But you ask me a lot of this. I lost the match, my mistake. It's okay. I tell you like five times. My mistake. I didn't lost the match because Carlos Ramos is umpire. I lost the match, my mistake. But you asking me a lot of this guy. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I speak with him, and tomorrow is the next day, we talk tomorrow; not today. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I have problem with all my game today. 

NICOLAS MASSU: I have to work about that. I didn't play good today. 

NICOLAS MASSU: No, no. Today I lost because I play bad. He play better than me. I have nothing to say. I didn't play good. I play five hours. I was waiting to play good, and I play bad. He played better. I have nothing to say.
