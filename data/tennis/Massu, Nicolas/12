Q. Can you tell us exactly what happened, what is your argument with Stefan? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I lost the match and I feel so pissed about that. I can't believe that I lost.  
 
Q. But is it because you were complaining about the decision from the chair umpire? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Before I lost the match, because I have a lot of chances, and I didn't make it.  
 
Q. But not because you had the penalty against you? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I going to speak about that, but I can't believe they -- what happened in the court. Is too much. Is too much in five hours to believe everything, to fight, to arrive to the locker, to accept that you lost the match. Is difficult for us, for me.  
 
Q. Is it because you lost the match or because you had a violation? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: No, everything. Everything. Is hard to accept that you lost. I feel so bad now. I can't believe that I lost the match. I don't know.  
 
Q. Can you tell us about the violations, what happened? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Which violations?  
 
Q. Well, there must have been three because you got a one-game penalty. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, the first two was okay.  
 
Q. You hit the racquet, violation. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, I know that I have to -- the first two warnings was okay, nothing to say. But the third one, I can't believe. I can't believe.  
 
Q. What do you think happened? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I don't know. You have to ask the umpire. But I can't believe. I can't believe that. I didn't lost the match because that, but is hard to believe that this guy didn't use the head a little bit, the mind. I can't believe. I have nothing to say about the first two warnings. You know, I don't know.  
 
Q. But you threw the racquet down. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Yeah, but normally all the players throw the racquet.  
 
Q. It didn't break? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Which one?  
 
Q. On the third. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I just threw like this.  
 
Q. So for you it's not a violation? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: The first two, yes, but the third one, no. I didn't lost the match because that.  
 
Q. Why do you think you lost the match? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I lost.  
 
Q. Have you been speaking to tournament officials for the last hour? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: When?  
 
Q. Have you been having a discussion with one of the referees? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: After the match?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Yes.  
 
Q. And what was the discussion about? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: That I play for five hours, I fight a lot, and this guy come here, put me two, three warnings. I accept the two first. If I have to pay something, I pay, no problem. But the third one is unbelievable for the people. Five hours play. I threw the racquet like this, warning, game, break of serve. Is unbelievable. I can't believe this. The other day, I come here to the ceremony at 8:00. I have to wait all the day here. The next day, I play first match. I ask the guy from the ITF or ATP, I say, "Why I have to come here at 8:00 and I have to play the first match on the next day?" He say, "Well, we forgot. We forgot. Sorry." What sorry? If I lost, what sorry?  
 
Q. So you had some concerns about the tournament not only regarding your match today? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I lost because my mistake. But this umpire have not to umpire anymore. This guy's unbelievable.  
 
Q. Did you ask for that umpire not to be umpiring again? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: He never going to umpire me again.  
 
Q. You got that guarantee tonight? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: No, no. I say this.  
 
Q. You can't say that. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: What do you think about the match? You asking me a lot. You saw the match?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: What do you think about? Was okay or not?  
 
Q. It's a code violation but if you throw the racquet, I think the referee came too, yes, Alan Mills. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: That's okay.  
 
Q. But Ramos, if he's in the chair, he's in the chair, you have to play. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: Yes. But you ask me a lot of this. I lost the match, my mistake. It's okay. I tell you like five times. My mistake. I didn't lost the match because Carlos Ramos is umpire. I lost the match, my mistake. But you asking me a lot of this guy.  
 
Q. I want to ask you what can you say to Stefan about this match? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I speak with him, and tomorrow is the next day, we talk tomorrow; not today.  
 
Q. You had big problems with your backhand in the fifth set. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I have problem with all my game today.  
 
Q. But Sargsian played everything to your backhand and you made a lot of mistakes there. 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: I have to work about that. I didn't play good today.  
 
Q. Do you think the Olympics took out of you a lot of emotion, energy? 
 
 NICOLAS MASSU: No, no. Today I lost because I play bad. He play better than me. I have nothing to say. I didn't play good. I play five hours. I was waiting to play good, and I play bad. He played better. I have nothing to say.
