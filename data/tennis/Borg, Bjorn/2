Q. That was a remarkable battle. Why did you win that match?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, it's funny enough, I broke my shoe laces, and I had to continue. I didn't want to stop the match. I'm currently with broken shoe laces, as you can see. It's totally ripped off.
That was quite tough, because I was scared I'm going to lose my shoe during a point. I still managed somehow to keep playing.
I think the momentum changed in the third-set tiebreak. I kind of found my rhythm. I had to keep more clear mind on the court. Didn't rush so much. So I think that played a crucial role on closing it at the end.
Q. You didn't play like a Laver Cup rookie. What was it like for you not only to play in this atmosphere but to have a couple of the all-time greats cheering you on?
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, in the beginning it was quite weird. If you would tell me 20 years ago, actually 10 years ago, that I would be playing an event having Roger and Rafa and four more top 10 guys by my side, I wouldn't believe you. That's just magnificent.
Q. Captain Björn Borg, what about this guy? Pretty good for his first time ever?
CAPTAIN BJÖRN BORG: Well, it's not easy for anyone to play first-time Laver Cup. It's a lot of pressure. I think the guys that play the first time they understand really now for the first time that it's a lot of pressure, it's very serious, and a lot of prestige.
Q. You had two very close singles wins tonight. You must be feeling pretty good.
CAPTAIN BJÖRN BORG: I feel pretty good. A little nervous always, but in the beginning it's going to be a long week, eh, with a lot of tight matches, close matches.
We are up 2-1, but it's going to be some great tennis in the next couple days.
