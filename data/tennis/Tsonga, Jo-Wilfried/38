J. TSONGA/G. Andreozzi
6-3, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did the match pretty much go as you expected?  Were there any surprises for you?  You won in straight sets.
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I played well enough.  I served pretty consistently.  Then it was easier for me to put pressure on his serve.
So, yeah, I expect to win, of course, before the match, and I did it.  So, yeah, that's great.
