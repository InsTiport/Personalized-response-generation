THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Always nice to get a first round under your belt here.  How do you feel about the way you played today?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel pretty good.  I had a good match.  Was a full match for me.  Played pretty good, solidly on my serve.  I took opportunities on his serve, and, yeah, I just did a good match.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your form coming into the tournament?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm feeling good.  The last two tournaments was difficult for me, because I was playing good tennis, good level, and I had a good opponent in front of me.   
Yeah, I didn't have the results I expect last couple of weeks, but I know I did the job.  I worked pretty hard before that, so yeah, I'm just ready to play here at the U.S.   
 Q.  The results you have had the last couple of years here, you've gotten to quarters, do you derive confidence?  How hungry do you want to get beyond that to get to the semifinals and beyond?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Of course I want to do better.  I'm playing here since a long time.  I was not able to do better than quarterfinals, so of course I want to do better than this.   
But before that, there is many rounds, many good players to play, and it's not going to be easy, but of course I will give my best and hope I will be able to achieve that.   
 Q.  And you're healthy and fit?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm feeling good, yeah.
