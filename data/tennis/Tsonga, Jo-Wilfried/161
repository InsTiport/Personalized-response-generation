THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How difficult was it out there?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, it was tough.   Was tough.   I had a good opponent today.   Yeah, was difficult.   The ball was playing a lot because of the temperature.   I didn't play, you know, a really good tennis.   I didn't control, you know, everything.   
Yeah, it was not a nice moment, I mean for me.   
   
 Q.   It seems like you struggled to handle his serve even though Kei served not that fast.   Is there any explanation?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   About what, sorry?   About my ankle?   
   
 Q.   About his serve.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No.   Like I said before, because the ball was flying in the air a lot, it was just difficult.   But that's it.   
   
 Q.   His second serve bounces very high?   Is that why it's tough to handle?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, maybe.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Your size, your power, the conditions today negate your power over Kei.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   Usually I'm good.   Usually I'm good.   But he was just better than me.   
I mean, I will go out of the court, you know, I still feel like I'm fresh.   But I lost this one.   You know, sometimes it's not about run on the court or feel good on the court.   It's about your technique, I mean, about how you feel the ball, and that's it.   
   
 Q.   Do you have any pressure when you play serve?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, of course.   When you have a guy in front of you who return everything, even when you serve 215, it put lot of pressure, of course, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You played Kei two times, Shanghai and also Kooyong.   You lost both of them.   What makes Kei tough to play?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It's tough to play against him because he run a lot and everything's coming back.   Even when he's far in the point, he come back on his line.   Yeah, that's why.   
   
 Q.   What do you think Kei's chances are against Andy Murray?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   He's going to have some chance, of course.   But he will need a good recovering.   And, yeah, after that I think, if he play in the sun like this, he can do something.
