K. NISHIKORI/J. Tsonga   
6-4, 6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  What was the reason of the medical timeout?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, the reason of the medical timeout because I was just a little blocked with my back.  But nothing -- nothing enough important, you know, to stop or to say I'm not able to play.   
 Q.  You and Kei have played six times.  Most of the match wasn't very close, but what do you think was the difference this time?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think this time I did a few wrong choice, you know, at the start, and he just played really well at the start.   
Then I was not able to come back in the match.  I think he was just better than me on the three sets.   
 Q.  There was something like a close call or the audio system of the arena is not that good in that stadium.  Were you frustrated a little bit?  The audio, like jet, there were some close jets.  Was overruled or something.  
THE MODERATOR: Line calls.   
 Q.  You couldn't hear, but...  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, like each match something happen, you know, on court and it's just normal.  I will say I was not really happy because I just want to challenge and didn't want it, because he said it's too late.   
Nothing to say about it.  It's like this.  Anyway, we have to play.
