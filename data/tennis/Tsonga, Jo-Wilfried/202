 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. Returning from the injury, did that affect your confidence at all coming into this match? Did it take some time getting over any nervousness at the beginning in the first set?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course it affect my confident [sic] because when you don't play for two or three months, you lose your -- you lose your tennis. When you come back, you start to zero.  
 So for me it was really important to win my first match, and today I did it. I'm just really happy because it was not easy.  
  
  Q. The last time you came to Shanghai was two years ago. In some Chinese news, it said you don't like Chinese banana. Is that true?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't like what? Chinese banana?  
  
  Q. Chinese banana.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Oh, no, no, I don't have problem with Chinese banana. Because they are different? Chinese banana is different than the other one?  
  
  Q. Which is your favorite Chinese food?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Which is my favorite Chinese food? I don't know, maybe the duck. In French is canard laquÃ©.  
  
  Q. Back to the layoff from tennis.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You don't want to speak about banana (smiling)?  
  
  Q. Is there any specific area of your game that you felt you needed to work on more than anything else coming back, your serve or anything?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. I think I have just to work for everything because when you come back, you lose a lot of things. I have to practice, to practice my serve - of course, my best weapon and also my worst.  
 So I just have to work. I will not work one stroke in particular. I will just practice everything and I will see.  
  
  Q. Do the French fans give you power?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Sometimes they give me some courage, of course.
