  7‑5, 6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Are you happy with that?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, of course.   Of course I'm happy.   It's always good to win.   So I'm still in the tournament and I have a third round to play now. 
Yeah, I'm happy with that. 

Q.   Do you know any particular reason why you play well here in Melbourne? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   Maybe the condition are good for me.   It's pretty warm.   The surface also‑‑ you know, it's not really quick, not really fast.   So maybe it's good for my game. 

Q.   Also it being early in the season, do you think that's good for you, as well?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   I really don't know.   But, anyway, I play well here all the time, and it's good for me. 

Q.   Do you think the crowd plays a role?   You have a lot of fans here.   Do they give you a bit of a boost?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah.   Anyway, they support me.   You know, it's good.   I feel good on the court.   Yeah, for sure it help me a lot. 

Q.   Why did you have such a good run here in 2008 and how can you recreate that this year?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, maybe I had the good draw because of my win on Murray on the first round.   Then after that the draw was open.   I didn't play, you know, a top player before quarterfinals.   So really that's why I played well in 2008. 

Q.   Last night Marcos Baghdatis broke four racquets in one minute.   What do you think about breaking racquets, and have you done that sort of thing? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, sometimes you get angry and it's difficult to control yourself.   But, I mean, one, it can happen.   Four, it's a lot (smiling). 

Q.   Have you ever broken a racquet when it's been in the plastic still?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Never.   Never.   But, anyway, my father told me all the time, If you broke the racquet, I broke you.   (Laughter.) 
So I go easy with the racquet.   Sometimes I prefer hit myself than my racquet. 

Q.   How do you feel you're actually playing this year?   Do you feel you're playing better than last year?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Anyway, physically, you know, I feel really good.   Last year it was difficult for me because I was a bit injured.   This year, you know, I don't have injury, so I feel good. 
I don't know.   I will see on the next match.   But, anyway, you know, I'm in a good shape.   I hope and I expect to play a good tournament. 

Q.   You obviously don't have a coach.   Is there anyone else that you speak to about playing, tactics, or are you doing everything yourself?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, there is some guys with who I can talk and have some advice.   Yeah, I'm not alone.   I have people who help me.

Q.   Such as?   Who? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, you know, I will keep it for myself.   But, anyway, there is people who help me. 

Q.   Serena Williams was worried about the insects on center court.   She was afraid of them.   Are you afraid of bugs or anything similar?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No.   I mean, that's okay.   If it's not dangerous, that's fine. 
But, yeah, I play with some ‑ how you call it ‑ bugs.   I played last night with bugs against Istomin.   It was okay.   Good neighbors (laughter).
