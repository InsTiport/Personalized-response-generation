J.W. TSONGA/M. Llodra
  7-6, (Retired)

 Q. Somebody said on court that you were not feeling well also? Is that correct? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. It was difficult because today I was a bit sick. So with the travel from Marseille, it's really tough today. But I won. He stopped before for me. So I will continue, and I hope I will feel better tomorrow play against Ivan.

 Q. What is the sickness, exactly? What is the problem?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I have a problem with my stomach. 

 Q. Did Michael tell you what was wrong with him?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Not really.

 Q. Have you any idea? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think he's got some problem with his muscle. I don't know.

 Q. Are you taking any medicine for the stomach?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. I take medicine since three days, yeah. 

 Q. It works?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Little bit (smiling).

 Q. Would you have been able to carry on had you lost the first set?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: If I lost the first set? 

 Q. Would you have carried on? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, you know, I'm a pro, and I would continue even if I don't have a lot of energy, you know. I just try to finish my match and see what's happened. And today you can see what's happened. He stopped before me. So you never know.

 Q. But you weren't considering retiring before the end of the match?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Me? 

 Q. Yes. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. No, no. I said, okay, I'm tired, but I will continue. 

 Q. So your prospects now of going further in this tournament, how do you rate? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What? 

 Q. Your prospects of doing well in this tournament, how do you rate? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, I don't know. You never know how you wake up in the morning. Maybe tomorrow I will feel really better and I will play my best tennis tomorrow. So I will see. 
 You know, I just take every match step-by-step, and we will see tomorrow. 

 Q. What did you think about the tiebreak? Saved a couple of set points in that?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I saved a couple of breakpoints, but, yeah, with good serves. Sometimes you are unlucky and sometimes you are (smiling).
