 J. TSONGA/M. Matosevic
  6-1, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Playing first, did that bother you at all?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, a bit, because with the jet lag, in the night, of course I prefer sleep than play at this time.  
  
  Q. Did you have any trouble changing your clock last night? You lost one hour of sleep.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, we lost it, but I was in my bed early, so it's okay.  
  
  Q. Did you know anything about Matosevic before the match?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, nothing.  
  
  Q. What do you think?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think it's a good player.   
 He has good serve and good forehand, so maybe he can play on the tour.  
  
  Q. How did you feel you played?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Okay. I played my level.
