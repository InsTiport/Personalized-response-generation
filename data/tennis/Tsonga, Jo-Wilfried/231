 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you tell us a little bit about what was hampering you on court with your injury tonight. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Tonight my back was very stiff. But I won, and I'm happy of that. 

 Q. Did you consider calling the trainer at all?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, because I know what I have, and I know I can play with. You know, I tried to do something who don't hurt me, and that's it. 

 Q. Will that hamper you at all going further into the tournament?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no. 

 Q. Were you at all worried when it kept going and going and going, tiebreaks, then the final set? Were you worried about whether you would win or lose? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. You know, every time I try to think positive and say, Okay, I keep going, keep going all the time. 
 Today I was a little bit lucky. But I did it with my hurt, I think. I think it's really good to win like that. 

 Q. Can you please tell us something about your friendship with some French guys like GaÃ«l Monfils, Gilles Simon, Gasquet. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Well, what do you want exactly? 

 Q. Just tell us something about your friendship. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, we're very friend. We had a lot of good time together in juniors and before. And they are really good guys, so I appreciate to be with them. And that's it. 

 Q. Do you think your game's as good as it was last year, your form?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think I play better. I play better. I'm a little bit more confident maybe in my game. And, yeah, I think I'm better.
