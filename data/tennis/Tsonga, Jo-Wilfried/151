  7‑6, 3‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   He was a difficult player to get on top of, wasn't he?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, it was a tough game.   I played well.   Today the conditions was not easy, really windy.   Yeah, it was close, but today I lost.

Q.   How much of a disappointment is it before Wimbledon and after the good result you had last year?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, of course it's not good.   I mean, play well here, you know, it's important to play many matches and to get ready to Wimbledon. 
It affect a bit my confidence, but it's like this, you know, and I will practice.   I hope I will play better and better every day on the surface.

Q.   You're still playing Eastbourne next week?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, no, I will not play. 

Q.   Despite today's result, you're still obviously one of the main contenders for Wimbledon the way you've played there in the past.   How can you break the monopoly people like Nadal, Djokovic, Federer, have held there?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   How I can do that?   I mean, just need to play my best tennis, you know.   I have to play my best tennis.   I know I'm able to beat everybody, you know, when I play my best tennis.   So I'll just have to play my best tennis, you know, and be consistent in this.   That's it.

Q.   Why have those players been able to dominate so much after the last several years?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, because they are too good.   That's it.   They're just too good.
That's it.   I don't know.   I don't have reason, you know.

Q.   You had such a draining match against Novak in the French.   Was that a problem today?   Were you a bit tired from that?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, of course.   When you are in the tournament, in Grand Slam, you know, you give a lot of yourself, and sometimes after that you're a bit tired, you know, and stuff to get back the motivation. 
But anyway, there is Wimbledon, and for me, you know, it's something huge.   Of course, I get it, but, you know, it's ‑‑ you know, we play every week.   I mean, I'm not a player consistent like the best players in the world.   Sometimes I have some match where I don't play well because I'm tired or because, you know, I don't feel really good.
That's it.   Just human. 

Q.   What's the story with your injury, your finger?   Is it quite serious?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think it's serious.   I didn't do, you know, exam for the moment, but it sounds very bad.

Q.   Does that pull you out of Wimbledon?   Is it that serious?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know. 

Q.   Could be?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   We will see.   I mean, I will do some exam.   You know, you never know before, but I felt like I broke something or I stretched, you know, a lot of ligaments, I would say.

Q.   In your leg, as well?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, no, only on my finger.   But it's tough, because I have to play with my hand.

Q.   How did you do that?   What was the actual point and incident that caused it?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I just fell down.   I just fell down.   That's it.   I fell down on it, and that's it.

Q.   You have to get it checked, of course, but if it's a broken finger, Wimbledon looks very, very unlikely, surely?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, for the moment.   For the moment, I don't know what is it, so I will stay positive and I will see.
