J. TSONGA/L. Lacko
  6‑4, 6‑3, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was there any point in that match when you didn't feel comfortable?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, every point.   Every point.   I mean, today was windy.   The condition was difficult.   I didn't play a good tennis.   My opponent, too.   It was not a really good match.   So it's like this. 
But I'm happy to go through.   I'm already exciting to play my Round of 16, and that's it.

Q.   Where did you think your game wasn't up to your normal standard?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   All my game on my baseline, you know, I mean, I didn't play one shot properly, you know, at the center of my racquet.   That's it. 

Q.   Does that mean English people should hope for bad weather if you ever come to meet Andy Murray?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, definitely. 

Q.   Is that his best chance of beating you if that match were to come about?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No.   But, I mean, this is my worst chance to play against Andy.   I mean, you know, if I play against him anyway I don't have many chance for the moment.   But for sure I will have some.   Few, but some. 

Q.   You give the impression of being pretty relaxed on court for all the problems you say you were having.   You have that joyful celebration.   Can you talk a little bit about that. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, this is something I did when I start on the tour, when I enter in the top 100.   I started at Queen's. 
And that's it.   I did it.   The crowd did a standing ovation for me, so I said, Okay, if it works here, it will work everywhere. 
And anyway now it's my brand and I like to do it. 

Q.   Do you feel at home here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, yeah, I feel good.   I feel good.   I have a lot of support, except when I play Andy.   Yeah, I feel good. 

Q.   Even then some English... 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   The English crowd, it's all the time really fair and they cheer for me and for Andy.   Of course, a bit more for Andy.   But it's normal.   I know the English crowd is very fair, and I like it.
