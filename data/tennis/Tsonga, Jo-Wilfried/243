   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  What are your thoughts after the match?  What are you thinking?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Lot of things.  I'm very proud of myself.  I'm happy for Novak, because he played unbelievable today.  I don't know if I have to be sad or happy of this final, but I feel great.   
  
  Q.  What was your feeling coming in?  Were you nervous at the start of today's match?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, no, no.  I was okay.  Like every day.  Very relaxed.  I don't know what say.  I think Novak played very good today, and it was tough.   
 When you have a match, you have one player and one opponent, and you don't know who's gonna win.  At the end, all the time you have a winner.  So today was Novak.   
  
  Q.  Now that you've been in the final, how hungry are you to be back in a final again?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  It's just unbelievable because the crowd was unbelievable.  A lot of noise and everything.  I had frisson (goosebumps).  It was crazy (smiling).   
  
  Q.  You seemed quite happy about the amount of time he was playing between points.  You mentioned it to the umpire.  Do you think it's fair the gap between points?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, sometimes, you know, when you have to return, you are like this (ready).  When your opponent take a lot of time, you go for be ready, and after not, and you are like this (back and forth).  When he serves, you are not ready because you are like this (back and forth).   
 It's very difficult.  Between points you have like 25 seconds for play.  When it's 40 seconds, the umpire have to say something, you know.   
  
  Q.  How does it feel to be in the top 20?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Pretty good (smiling).   
  
  Q.  Does this give you the confidence now to maybe break into the top 10?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, of course, of course.  Not everybody can beat player who I beat.  So I know Richard or Youzhny or Rafael, they are very good player.  And beat them, it's very difficult, and I did it, so...   
 Of course, I'm confident now.   
  
  Q.  How good was it having your mom and dad fly over for the match?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  For me it was very important, because one of the dream of my father, it was to come here, and I did it, so it's good.   
  
  Q.  It was a dream for him to come here to see you play?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  How long has he been speaking about that?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Since a long time.  I don't know.  I cannot say the time.  Maybe since I play tennis.
