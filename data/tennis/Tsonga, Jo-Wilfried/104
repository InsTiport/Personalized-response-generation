J. TSONGA/P. Kohlschreiber
  6‑4, 1‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   What happened to you in the second set?   Were you injured, sick? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I just had a bad period.   I felt my legs were very hard.   I didn't feel well, so I called the doctor to explain what was happening and that this was unusual. 
He gave me homeopathic treatment. 

Q.   Does this worry you for what is coming up next?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No.   It's maybe because I practiced too much or I didn't manage the amount of effort I made. 

Q.   For the rest of the match, how did you feel on the court? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, as I said, I was tired so it was a bit complicated for me.   Fortunately I had an early break in the first set and I was able to hold my serve.   But I knew it was going to be tough. 
Then I had this letdown in the second set.   I was able to hang in there in the third set, and he ended up letting it go. 

Q.   What about your next match, Fognini or Bautista? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Both are good players.   They force you to play many shots.   You must be ready to play them. 

Q.   Which one would you prefer?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Maybe Bautista because Fabio is playing like at home here. 

Q.   What about the transition from hard courts?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I didn't play much on clay, as you know.   After Davis Cup I needed to rest.   I was tired especially going into the Davis Cup after the American tour.   I took some days off.   I came here on Friday.   I didn't have much time on clay yet. 

Q.   Given the level of game of Kohlschreiber, do you believe it was better he was not at the Davis Cup?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I didn't think about that.   But maybe, yes, it's better he wasn't there because he's able to play very good matches. 
But I don't believe he has a positive record against me or GaÃ«l. 

Q.   Do you feel pressure because of the points you have to defend? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I try not to think about it.   It's just there.   Every year I'm told, You made the quarterfinals of the French, you have points to defend.   You made the semis in Wimbledon, you have points to defend. 
But, anyway, I always have points to defend every week.   It's usual.   I just take this as routine. 

Q.   Rafa says he just takes care of the ongoing year and doesn't think about previous years.   Might be a good idea. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, yes.   I look forward to what's coming up.
