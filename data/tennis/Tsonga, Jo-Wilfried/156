THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   Is this victory a birthday present?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I was very happy that I was able to make it through this first round (smiling).   
   
 Q.   You said it was the first time you played on your birthday since you were a pro.   But when you were younger, did it happen?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I said that, but I'm not quite sure it's entirely true.   But I don't remember playing on my birthday as a professional.   I'm sure it happened when I was younger, of course.   
   
 Q.   During the match, did you feel in control or were you worried at times?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, I had some moments where I got worried because I was almost broken several times.   But I remained solid and I played well on the important points.   
   
 Q.   You played many dropshots today.   Do you practice that shot in particular to use it on clay?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, that shot works a lot better on clay than on other surfaces.   Normally when you are being aggressive, you try to have your opponent step back.   Sometimes it's a very good idea to play a dropshot.   You can win important points thanks to that shot.   
   
 Q.   Do you do dropshots naturally?   Does it come naturally to you?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes.   I don't particularly work that much on this shot.   Of course, in practice I try to improve it.   But it's a shot I do, like I do my serves, my forehands, my backhands, my volleys.   
   
 Q.   Of course you know how to do a dropshot, but my question was, do you think of doing dropshots very often and naturally?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, maybe I did more dropshots today than I do on other days.   Maybe now I have a better touch so I can do it more easily.   
   
 Q.   Do you believe the birthday is an important moment for an athlete, more than for a normal person?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes, because you see time is going by.   I know now I'm 27 and I'm in the second part of my career.   I'm not that young anymore.   I played my first professional match at 19 years old.   I've been on the tour for eight years.   I know I'm not going to be on the tour for the next eight years.   
   
 Q.   Would you say, rather, three or four years more?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I try not to think about it.   I have no plans because I don't know what the future holds for me.   I'm just living one day after the other.   
   
 Q.   Players like LÃ³pez reached their ranking after 30 years of age.   Is that an inspiration for you?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   He's not the only one.   Many players play their best tennis late in their career, mainly French players.   Apparently French players get better after 27 years old.   
It encourages me, of course.   Many players play their best tennis when they are 30 years old.   
   
 Q.   Do you sometimes think of what you've done and what you will do in the future?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Maybe now it's more clear.   The main thing is I try not to lose so much time.   
   
 Q.   You believe you lost a lot of time?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Sometimes, yes.   But, on the other hand, I can say that the time I lost was part of the learning process.   So is it really lost?   
What I'm doing right now is good.   I'm top five in the world.   I made a lot of progress.   
   
 Q.   When you look at the past, do you see the good moments or the bad moments?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't look back.   I live in the present.   
   
 Q.   But sometimes when you have to play someone, you think about the past record against them.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, I have no particular admiration for what I did in the past.   I don't think what I did was bad either.   I just think that I might have even more beautiful things to experience in the future.   
   
 Q.   Did you receive presents for your birthday already?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I never ask for presents, but I do receive some sometimes, and I got a few already.   
   
 Q.   Will you have time to celebrate your birthday?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It all depends on my results here.   In fact, if I play well I'm punishing myself because I won't have time to celebrate.   
   
 Q.   Do you think Verdasco is a present?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Certainly not.   But, on the other hand, he's a great player, and it's always good to play against the top players on clay because you can get used to the high quality of their game and you will not be surprised when you play them in major events.   
   
 Q.   The two matches you played for Davis Cup here, did they help you?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Certainly.   But I don't know what I would have done today if I hadn't played those matches.   Anyway, I was able to get used to the clay and to start sliding on the surface.   Certainly it was an advantage.   
   
 Q.   Do you only see Verdasco for the time being or do you see further into the draw?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I only see Verdasco, a very large image.   I don't look further.
