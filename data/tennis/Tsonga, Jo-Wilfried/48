An interview with:   
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  If you're injured, can you just explain.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  I just stretch my adductor this morning.  So, yeah, that's it.  I was sick when I left Madrid for two days, and I came here and I tried to play a little bit to see how it goes, and this morning I just stretch a little bit my adductor, so I will take rest and recover for the next step.   
 Q.  Are you scared about Roland Garros coming up next?  Do you think it will hamper you?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course for me it's not something good to be a little bit injured, you know, before this event.  I hope I will have the chance to recover enough quick to prepare as good as possible.   
Yeah, we'll see.  Of course it's something that -- it's not something, I mean, I'm looking for, and I hope it's going to be all right.
