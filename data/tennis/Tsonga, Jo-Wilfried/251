   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  You were serving for a two-set lead.  What went wrong there?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  What's wrong?  I don't know.  He was better than me on this game.  I don't serve very good.  I didn't serve very good.   
 I serve only second serve, and I don't know what happened, but it happened.   
  
  Q.  What was it like out there, the big court, your first Australian Open?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  For me it was very big event because it's my first time here at the Vodafone, and I was very happy to play there, and that's all.   
  
  Q.  No nerves?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Nerves okay, because for me it's a chance.  Two years before I was in practice for my injury.  So today for me it was a chance.   
  
  Q.  Early on, was that the best that you've ever played?  It was a very tough first set.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  The best what?   
  
  Q.  Was that one of the best sets that you've ever played?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, maybe not because I played a lot of match before, and some very good sets.  But today it was different because it was against Andy Roddick, and it's a very good player, and it's special to play against him and win the set.   
  
  Q.  He questioned a lot of calls.  Did that bother you at all?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, no.   
  
  Q.  Did you think at all that he was trying to bother you by questioning so many calls?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I don't know, maybe.  But it's a game, you know.  It's a game.  You can do that if you want.
