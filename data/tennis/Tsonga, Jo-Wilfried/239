 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Are you quite pleased with the way that you played today?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Sorry?   
  
  Q. Are you happy, content with the way you played?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Can you describe how you felt out there today?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I was just happy to be on the court. I didn't play a really good tennis, but I played with what I'm possible to do, and that's it.  
  
  Q. I think he's the last person that you played, is he not?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So kind of coincidental. But how do you feel health-wise after the surgery? Do you feel anything from the surgery? You feel healthy? Feel strong?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel healthy, I feel strong. No, I'm a little bit worried on my knee, and of course it's different than before.   
 But I feel good and I can play tennis, so I play and I see.  
  
  Q. Did you have any question in your own mind about maybe should you play here best of five, hardcourts?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no.  
  
  Q. You thought you were going to do well?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Has this been sort of an agonizing year? Tremendous Australian Open and then not much since.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Sorry?   
  
  Q. Has this been a agonizing or very difficult year for you? We watched such a marvelous Australian Open, and then nothing much since then.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course it's difficult, but it's life, you know? Sometimes you have things like this or you are happy and sometimes you are not.   
 So now I'm happy to be on the court, so that's it. I have nothing to speak, to tell about what is.   
  
  Q. Your health is perfect?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Some players experience depression when they're away from the tour, especially with injury and a few weeks goes by they're not on the tour. They're wondering what's going to happen in the future. Did you have any difficult periods during your layoff?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Sorry, can you repeat.  
  
  Q. Some players experience depression when they're away from the sport, especially with an injury. Seems like the world is moving and they're staying in one place. Mentally, some players struggle with this. Did you have any problems like that?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no. No problems, because when I don't play tennis I have a lot of things to do, like see my family, see my friend, because when we play tennis we don't have time for that.   
 So at this moment it's good for that, and it give me a lot of, I don't know, a lot of power, you know, when I come back.  
  
  Q. You said you had a little bit of fear or anxiety about your knee, but obviously now it seems like it's fine. At what point during the match did you feel like it was back or that...   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I can't say that.   
  
  Q. No?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: If I tell it, I give lot of things to my future opponent.   
  
  Q. For those of us who weren't familiar with the accident, your knee, was it a one-moment thing or was it a slow...   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, it was slow. It was slow. It was -- I don't know how you say that in English, but it's -- it was not broke like this.   
 It was, you know, on the time. So for me, it was obliged to make surgery, and that's it.  
  
  Q. Ligament?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No ligament, meniscus.  
  
  Q. Meniscus?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. In Casablanca your last match was a walkover with Simon, I believe. Was that because of your knee injury?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, right. Because my knee was like this.  
  
  Q. To look at your record, you would make an appearance here, you went down to Indian Wells, you went down to Florida. You were trying to play, but it just got to be too much. Was that it?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: (Speaking French.) No, no. Only on clay. Only after Davis Cup, and all the tournament on clay I played.   
  
  Q. How was your play against Monfils? Have you played Monfils again?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Juniors. In juniors and before.
