 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Are you playing anywhere near your form of last year?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, it's all the time different. You know, when you play a new tournament, it's new conditions, so is different. Every match is different. That's why I'll play again and again this tournament because every match is different. That's it.   
  
  Q. What did you like about your game today?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think I was -- I don't know (smiling). I don't know. It was not better than before yesterday, but it was okay. So no problem.   
  
  Q. And your back is okay?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, perfect. My back is perfect. I enjoy it.   
  
  Q. The French men are doing very well in this tournament so far. Why do you think that is?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Because maybe we are four in the top 20, so maybe of that, yeah.   
  
  Q. Have you been practicing together?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes we practice together.   
 But, yeah, we are all in the top 20, so we are all seeded. Maybe it's normal, you know.   
  
  Q. Is there a rivalry between the four of you or do you all hope each other does well?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no. Like between players, I don't know, not more.   
  
  Q. Like to be the No. 1 French player?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no. I think for us it's good if one Frenchman can win a Grand Slam. Of course, I want to win a Grand Slam. But if Richard or GaÃ«l or Gilles win a Grand Slam, I will be happy for them and it will be good for the French tennis. So that's it.   
  
  Q. There has been a lot of talk at this tournament about who the favorite is. Why do you feel you are in the category?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. I'm seed No. 5, so I think this is my place maybe (smiling).   
  
  Q. How do you feel about someone like Novak, who is the defending champion, being told he's No. 4, not the favorite? Do you understand why he feels extra pressure?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think he is the favorite because he won the Masters, and the condition of play is very good for him. I think he's in a good form. We'll see what's happen. But he's, of course, one of the best favorite.
