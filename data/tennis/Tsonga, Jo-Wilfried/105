J. TSONGA/V. Hanescu
  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Roger said the other day that the court is playing pretty quick here.   Do you like the court here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I like the court.   I mean, it's good for me, it's good for my game. 
It fit well with my game.   I never played very well here, but I expect to. 

Q.   Was tough against Nikolay last week when you played him.   What sort of a plan do you have against him?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, I will try to make a serious match like I did last week.   Yeah, try to dictate the game again, because he likes to be in the court and play fast.   I will try to dictate my game.

Q.   How are you feeling physically and mentally?   Obviously it's not that long from Marseilles. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I feel mentally really good.   You know, I want to play, I want to win, but of course physically I'm a bit tired, but I think it's for all the players.   We all come from a tournament before except maybe the top guys, and so I think he's tired like me tomorrow. 

Q.   I'm sure you're asked this question several times:   Do you feel that you have not been able to live up to your potential as a player, carrying on from what you were as a junior?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, we all have our own way, you know, to join the top.   I had many, many problems at the beginning of my career, so I lost a bit of time.   But after that, you know, I came back, was not easy every day, but I came back and I did some good things.
Today I'm still looking forward and I'm still looking to try to win, you know, some major and stuff like this.   But that's it, you know.   In the world now there is maybe five or six guys who won, you know, Grand Slams since ten years, so it's not a lot.

Q.   Do you see yourself like say in the top 3?   Or what sort of goal do you see for yourself?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I see myself continuing to work, continuing to improve my game.   Nobody knows what will happen, you know, in few weeks.   This week, next year, you know. 
So I keep fighting.   I stay confident, anyway.   This is the key, and that's it. 

Q.   An assessment of your season so far?   Losing to Roger in Australia.   Did well in Marseilles, did well in Davis Cup. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, for the moment, you know, it's not a bad start, but I didn't play a lot, so I need to play some matches, you know, to get the rhythm. 
But anyway, you know, it's coming match after match, and I'm sure I will be a better player, you know, every day now. 

Q.   You say you haven't done well here or as well as you'd like.   What do you need to do to do better here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think my best is quarter, so I will try to play semis and see after that. 

Q.   Have you had a look at the draw?   Have you seen your... 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I don't see everything.   I know I play Nikolay.   I just saw the two first games for the moment, because I came from Marseilles this morning, and it was not easy already to be on the court tonight. 
I go step by step.   But you can tell me who I have, who I play, who is seeded after? 

Q.   You have to beat Davydenko. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Okay (laughter).   But you can tell me.   It's not really important.   Anyway, there is a good guy after that. 

Q.   Berdych. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Berdych? 

Q.   How is it adapting to the conditions here?   It's a faster court from Marseilles?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, it's not faster.   No, no, no, no.   It's maybe slower.

Q.   Than Marseilles?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah.   Marseilles is quick.
