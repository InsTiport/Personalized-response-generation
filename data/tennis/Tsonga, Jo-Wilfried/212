 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. How did you enjoy your first five-set match?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Good. It was good. Good to win in five sets, first time for me. You know, like tennis -- when you win your first five-set match, you're happy.  
  
  Q. You won the first two sets. What happened after that? Did he play better?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: After that, I missed some occasion, and after that, he begin to believe in himself, you know.  
 He played just unbelievable, and it was just tough, you know, to play against him at this moment because he hit the ball very hard, and it was tough.   
  
  Q. What was going through your mind when you started the fifth set? Did you feel good?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Cool, I will play a fifth-set match. Yeah.   
  
  Q. Djokovic is next.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, Djokovic is next, and I have to recover and I will be -- I think I will be ready for that.   
  
  Q. What is your game plan against him?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Against him, stay aggressive, very aggressive, and give everything. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. What do you feel you've learned since the 2008 final against Djokovic?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What I learned, I don't know. But I beat him four times, I think, since this moment. So I learned to beat. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. You don't have any fears going into this match?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, I don't have. It's a tennis match, and like I say every time, I will do my best and we will see.
