  6‑3, 7‑5 
   
   
 Q.   Where do you rate this effort in reaching this final?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, it's a good victory for me because I was really tight.   I mean, I didn't play a good tennis, but I won.   This is the goal of this sport, you know, is to win at the end.   I did it tonight.   So I'm just really happy, you know, to reach this final.   
But, you know, for the moment, I'm still in the tournament.   And for me, the big match will be tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You face Roger Federer again, who you met the first day.   What did you learn from that match and what do you feel you have to do differently in the final?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, what I learn, it's I can do it.   I had the occasion, you know, all the time.   I mean, you know, Roger is the best player for the moment indoors.   I think I can join him on one match.   
   
 Q.   What do you think worked so well for you in the Wimbledon and MontrÃ©al matches which maybe haven't worked so well in the last few?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Maybe I was physically, you know, better.   But I really don't know.   Sometimes it depends a lot of the level of Roger.   If he's playing well, you know, it's difficult.   
   
 Q.   Three consecutive Sundays versus Federer.   You lost in two sets the first Sunday, in three sets the second Sunday.   What do you expect to happen the third Sunday?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know what I expect.   I expect to win, of course (smiling).   
It's all the time really exciting to play against Roger.   It's going to be really special here, you know, for my first final here.   It's going to be amazing atmosphere I think on the court, and I like that.   I'm sure I will respect Roger a lot and play my best tennis.   
   
 Q.   Will there be part of you, because it's your last match of the year, that will just want to seize the moment and just go for it?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, anyway I will give everything.   If I have to break my two ankle to win, I will do it for sure (laughter).   
But, yeah, you know, I know it's the last match so I will give it everything.   I know right after that it's the party, so it's good (smiling).   
   
 Q.   How have you found the whole tournament this week?   How pleased have you been with the way you've been playing throughout this?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, was really different than my first time in Shanghai.   The organization is just perfect.   The court is perfect.   The crowd is perfect.   Everything is perfect.   
I saw that two years ago, you know, when I was on the bench.   And this year, you know, I played.   When I qualify, I was just so happy to play because I saw two years ago was a really good event.   
   
 Q.   Have you set up a time or deadline to have a coach?   Have you thought, for instance, in January?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Why you speak to me about coach?   Tomorrow I have to play a final against Roger.   Come on (smiling).   
I mean, yeah, you know, I improve my game every time, so I think I'm fine for the moment like this, and I will see in the future.   
   
 Q.   This year you've reached your highest ever ranking of No.6.   What are your goals for next year?   Maybe a slam or top 5?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah.   This is what I say, you know, every time, for 2012 it's going to be my goal.   But it was my goal also for this year and the past year.   You know, is difficult to achieve, but I hope I will do it soon.   
   
 Q.   I don't want to upset you about asking about a coach again.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I'm not upset (smiling).   
   
 Q.   You've been working with the adidas guys.   Have you been walking to Darren and Sven on the telephone?   Is there somebody else here you've been chatting to and working out tactics with?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I didn't speak with anybody this week.   You know, I'm just by my own and that's enough.   Sometimes we are two or three in my head, you know, so it's enough (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Everyone in London, in the UK, love watching you.   They love your personality.   They think anything can happen at any moment.   What will you do if you win the title?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Wow.   
   
 Q.   Something crazy?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I really don't know what I will do.   But for sure I will be really happy.   I don't know.   I will see.   I will see tomorrow if I win, of course.   I don't know.   
I will improvise.   
   
 Q.   When you beat Federer in Wimbledon coming from two sets down, you thought it was probably the best day of your career.   Tomorrow winning, would it be even better, or that day will always be the first?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think it's going to be better because it's a title anyway.   There is the eight top player in the world in this tournament.   You know, win this one, I take part of something, something really good, because we can see each name, you know, on the trophy.   They are all, you know, big champion.   So if I can reach them, it's going to be amazing for me.
