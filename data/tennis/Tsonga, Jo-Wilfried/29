J. TSONGA/D. Lajovic
6-2, 6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. How do you assess the match today?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, the match was good for me.  I played well.  The conditions was not easy.  A lot of wind for both of us.  It was not the best tennis I played, but it was a good match.  Really solid.  I was focused on the game.  Yeah, it was good.
Q. Do you feel confident about chances of going into the second week?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, every day is different.  I'm playing well for the moment, so I will prepare for the next match and see how it goes.
But of course I'm confident, because I played well the two first match.  I hope I will be able to play at this level or even better on the next round.
Q. You will possibly meet Jack Sock in the next round.  You had two tight wins against him.  How would you imagine a match against him here?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course it's gonna be a different match than the others, different condition.
Anyway, it's going to be important for me to try to put my game on the court and not let him play a good match.  He's got a good forehand.  He's gonna go for it, for sure.  It's going to be important for me to be good on my move, to make him play one more shot.
Q. I understand you will be a father this year?  Is that right?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I will be a father.  You know, I touch on wood (smiling).
It's for April, so, yeah.  I'm waiting for it.
Q. Chatted to other players who might be parents?  Maybe Andy Murray?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Not especially Andy, but I have some friends and some people around me who got kids.
So, for me, yeah, it's gonna be a new experience and new adventure.  It's great.
