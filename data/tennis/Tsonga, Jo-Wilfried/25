THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It appears you are withdrawing from the tournament with a shoulder injury.  Can you explain what exactly the problem is, please.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, the problem is I stretch a muscle in my shoulders.  I don't want to take any risk.  And, yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  Is it something you did in your previous match against Kuznetsov?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: It's something I did, I think, last week on the practice.  I had little bit of pain from the match of Kuznetsov.   
Yeah, like I said, I don't want to take any risk anymore because there is other tournament in few weeks.  I want to play them 100%.  So no risk for me.   
 Q.  Are you still intending to play Rome next week, or is that still in doubt for you?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, for me, for the moment I will see on the next few days, how it goes.  I'll take, of course, a decision later if I go or not.
