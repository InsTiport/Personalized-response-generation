   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  I suppose it's a bit cliche, but can you describe the emotion and the feeling you felt when you won that match point and collapsed to the ground? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I don't know how to say that.  It's like I want to cry, I want to smile, I want everything.  And it's a lot of emotion, so... 

 Q.  You were very emotional when you spoke to Jim Courier afterwards.  Was that part of the process of the long road back that you have had from all those injuries and just sort of overwhelmed you? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yes, of course.  I have a lot of image in my head, and it's coming like (indicating) like this, and it's very -- it's very big.  And, yeah, it's a lot of emotion. 

 Q.  When you had those injuries, was there ever a time when you thought of giving up, of not coming back, and that this day might not happen? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Sorry?  Yes, not really, but, yes, sometime it was like, oh, it's too tough. 
 I don't know if I will do it. 

 Q.  Can you just talk briefly about obviously the semifinal and how you see a matchup with Nadal.  How will you approach that? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I don't know.  Like every match before.  I try to stay on this world and that's it.  I will do like every time I do before, to be relaxed on the court, and we will see what's happened. 

 Q.  Nadal is a different player from every other player. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yes, maybe, but he has two arms and two legs like me, so we will see on the court. 

 Q.  Have you played Nadal before? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, one time. 

 Q.  US Open? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  US Open. 

 Q.  Youzhny is a player with a lot of big wins.  He's won against Nadal, won against Federer.  Was it a sufficient match, and what was the approach for you before you went into the game? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  To the game?  No, I know it will be a tough match.  But I play better than last year, and I'm very confident in my game, so I will see.  I will see after tomorrow.
