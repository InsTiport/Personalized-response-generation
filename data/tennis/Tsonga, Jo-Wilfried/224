 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Were you a little bit rusty today, do you think?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What I think of what?   
  
  Q. Your match, did you feel a little bit rusty? You took a while to really get going?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, I was ready to play. No, I was good.   
 But Rainer played well at the start and it was tough for me to -- the first set was tough for me, and after that I played better.  
  
  Q. If Gilles Simon wins, you'll play him in the next round if he wins his match today. What are your thoughts on playing against him if he is to win?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, my own play, I need to play my game. After that I will see what's happen.
