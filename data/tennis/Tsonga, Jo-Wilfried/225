 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Unlucky today. Can you describe the experience of being aced 46 times in a match? Can you describe what that feels like?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Nothing. Nothing. What I can say? He served well, and that's it. That's the only thing I can tell.   
  
  Q. Do you feel helpless? There's nothing you can really do about it when somebody is serving like that?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, you cannot do nothing.   
  
  Q. Do you think, with that serve, he can go a lot further in the tournament?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course.   
  
  Q. How about your own level today? Are you happy with the way you played?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I didn't play, so... I don't have to be happy or not. I don't play, that's it.   
  
  Q. How do you mean, you didn't play?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I didn't play. He served well, and that's it.   
  
  Q. You looked to be getting very frustrated out there.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes and no, because it's like this, you know.   
 You play. Sometimes I play against a guy like that and you lost and sometimes you win, and that's it.   
  
  Q. Is he the best server you've played against?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course.   
  
  Q. Before the match you said it will be a mental battle. Did you expect such a tough mental battle?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think it was just mental because, you know, you can just maybe play good points in the tiebreak, and the match, you know, turn.   
 Yeah, and I didn't have these points, so that's it.   
  
  Q. Did you have high hopes of getting far in the tournament before the start?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no, no, no. Just lost first round (smiling).
