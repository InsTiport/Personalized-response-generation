N. DJOKOVIC/J. Tsonga
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you give us your thoughts on your match tonight, where you felt the differences were. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, you know, I just had many chances in the first set.   I missed it again.   I think the difference was there.   It's more he's taking his chance all the time, and me, I miss on big points. 
That was difficult for me then because he's playing free in the second set.   It's easier when you are one set up. 

Q.   Last year you lost your first match to Roger Federer and reached the final.   In this round robin competition, you can still build on this. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, of course.   I'm still in the game.   You know, the next match will be really important for me.   If I want to stay in the competition, I have to win it.   I will give everything to do that. 

Q.   Can you reflect on the season.   It's the end‑of‑year competition. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I'm more involved in my game, in what I do every time on court.   My passion for tennis is growing up all the time.   I'm sure I will find a solution, you know, to be a better player. 
You know, anyway, every time when I play against these guys I have some chances to win, I mean, to be better anyway.   So, you know, I will keep fighting and I'm sure I will play a better tennis in the next few months.
