J. TSONGA/A. Rublev
4-6, 7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. It's been a spectacular first round with a wonderful match against Rublev.
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I'm delighted to have won today. Everything was not perfect, obviously, but the most important thing is to have won.
On the last two sets, I played good tennis. Now, I have to pursue that path to hope that I can continue my adventure in the RPM tournament.
Q. It seems that during the first set you played well, but you didn't manage to hold your own with the break points. At the second set, you felt better. Something seems to have put the light on. There was a better mix-up of tactics as well.
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: During the first set, I was lagging behind on my return game. I wanted to play loose and let him play so as not to make too many mistakes. It turned out that it was not efficient at all.
So during the second set, I was closer to the line. The aim was to outpace him. And I wanted to be very aggressive and play on my forehand, to put a lot of pressure on him, so that he couldn't be neutral on his return game. Then I was in completely.
And the fact that I used my forehand, I managed to be more aggressive in my game. So it was quite good.
