  2‑6, 7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   Do you feel you missed an enormous opportunity today? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I know I was not far, but saying it was an 'enormous opportunity', maybe not. 
It's not like if I had had a match point.   I did have one breakpoint that I didn't play that well, but that's all. 

Q.   You were up 6‑5, 30‑Love on his serve, and the match got out of your hands.   What happened? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   The conditions were changing a lot during the match.   It was becoming colder and the balls were not bouncing that much anymore and it was difficult for me to give them some height. 
So he had more and more of those balls at the height of his hips, and that's where he feels most comfortable.   So it was then more difficult for me to put the ball away from him. 
I forced myself a bit and I got into trouble. 

Q.   Were you thinking about what happened in the second set when you started the third set? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Not so much.   But I was hit on the head after losing that second set.   That's when he played a lot faster during this moment where I was a bit down. 

Q.   What will you remember from this week? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   That I played good matches and I had a good fight against Roger. 
Now I have to get back to work.   The final goal is the French Open.   I need to play more tournaments to try to increase my level and I have to practice a lot. 

Q.   But are you reassured after those few days here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I was never totally worried.   I am in it, so I know that you can't just lose your game entirely overnight.   I knew I was able to put balls in the court. 
The important thing for me is to be very consistent during my sessions if I want to go one step further. 

Q.   Did you see Nadal's match?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It was impressive.   1 hour and 25 minutes.   David was incredible.   The rallies were endless.   I believe David was able to take control of the match and made Rafa run all over the place.
