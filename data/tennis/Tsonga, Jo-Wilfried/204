  6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Are you happy with the way you're playing?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, happy because I won, so it's good. 
 It was not really an easy match. I didn't play really well, you know. But it was good to win because it was against another Frenchman, and these match are all the time, you know, really tight. So it was good. 

 Q. Not sure of your next opponent. Possibility it will be Andy Murray. How do you see that matchup? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, I know Andy like grass. He play well at this surface. He is at home. He will give everything. I know that. 
 But I obviously will be the outsider. Yeah, maybe the pressure will be on his, you know, shoulder because for me I have nothing to lose, you know. I will play the first quarterfinal in my career here in Wimbledon. 
 So for me, yeah, I have everything to win in this match. 

 Q. How is your confidence just now? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: My confidence, I feel confident. I know I can beat everybody. So I will play my game. I will try to play, you know, relaxed and be offensive and that's it. 

 Q. What has made the difference this year with you feeling comfortable on grass?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: For me, there is not a lot of different than the other years. Maybe I have more experience, so maybe I'm better. 
 But I don't feel a lot of difference than last year and everything. But last year I change racquet just before the tournament, so it was tough for me. So this year it's better because I play with my racquet since some months now, and it's good. 

 Q. And your back is fine now?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, my back is perfect. I feel good. 

 Q. You seemed to be a little bit frustrated at times. Was it because you weren't playing as well as you felt you should be?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, all the time. I'm all the time like this, you know. Even when I win 6-Love, 6-Love, 6-Love, it's the same, you know. If I miss one ball, sometimes I'm a bit frustrated (smiling).
