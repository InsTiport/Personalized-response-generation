T. BERDYCH/J. Tsonga
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So you had a tough one, the double‑fault in the tiebreaker, kind of pivotal.   How do you shake it off and get ready for the next tournament?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, we used to it.   Today I didn't play my best tennis.   But I did, you know, what I can.   Unfortunately today Tomas was a lot better than me.   I will just take some rest and I will wait until the next tournament. 

Q.   You said earlier this year you would have finger surgery.   When will you have it? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I contract this injury in June.   But now I'm feeling a lot better.   Today I didn't lose because of that. 
No, I recover well and fast, so it's okay. 

Q.   We noticed in the first set actually you held your own games very well.   It seems it was becoming difficult for you.   Is it because of health, especially in the second set?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I would say all match, you know, I was not feeling really good physically.   I didn't have the same energy as the last couple of days.   So that's why maybe I didn't play my best tennis. 
But, anyway, in the second set I played better than in the first, but it was a bit late. 

Q.   What do you think is the gap between you and the top four players?   Do you have plans to find a new coach to help you to fill the gap? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think there is many difference between them and me.   At the base we don't have the same story.   There is also the difference that technically I think they're a bit better than me.   I have to improve. 
They are also physically better than me.   They are everything better than me, so it's tough for the moment (smiling). 
But, you know, they're just better than me for the moment.   I'm working, you know, to join them. 

Q.   And coaching?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I mean, I have some plan, but I will tell you in time. 

Q.   How is your back? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, my back is okay.   Sometimes I have some problem who give me some difficulty to move well.   But, I mean, that's okay for the next tournament.
