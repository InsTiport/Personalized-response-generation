 Q. How did you feel about your game tonight? How did you feel about how you played?

 Q. What are you looking forward to tomorrow in your match against Roger?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I know it's going to be difficult, because Roger is the big favorite here and the first player in the world, and I will do my best to win. I will see.

 Q. You said in French earlier (speaking French). What did you mean by that? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I just said I'm able to play good tennis, also. Maybe not as Roger when he's really, really good, but I think I have really good tennis, also.

 Q. What do you have to do to be successful against him tomorrow?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I have to play my game to stay aggressive, and -- yeah, stay aggressive.

 Q. Tonight the top 8 guys in the world all reached the quarterfinal for the first time. How does it feel for you to be part of that?
