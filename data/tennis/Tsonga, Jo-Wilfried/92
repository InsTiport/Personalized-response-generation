J. TSONGA/E. Roger‑Vasselin
  7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Quite a tough first set, and then the second set you run away with it.   What was the difference for you?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I was a little bit tight at the beginning, and he was pretty aggressive.   And after winning the first set, it give me, of course I felt a little bit more free.   Then I played better tennis.

Q.   It was quite a celebration really for a first‑round victory at the end of the match.   Was there a sense of relief at the end of that match with all the rain delays and everything today?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, for me it's a victory, and every victory is good to take, especially now for me.
No, I mean, it's important for me to win, I guess.

Q.   This is obviously your first tournament since Wimbledon.   How do you assess today's match and where you're at coming into the US Open sort of season?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It's always difficult when you didn't play for a few weeks, but it was my choice and I practiced a lot during those weeks.   Of course, you know, when you come on the court for the first time again, you want to be good.   You want to see if your practice was good or not. 
So I was a little bit more stressful, but in the second set, you know, I played well.   So it's good.
