6-7, 6-2, 6-1 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What was the exact problem for retiring?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I have a back problem. It's annoying, annoying me when I play. Since I'm arrive in Doha, I've got some pain.   
So, yeah, it's difficult for me to deal with it for the moment. It's new. I will go home and see with my doctors what I have to do exactly and think about it.
