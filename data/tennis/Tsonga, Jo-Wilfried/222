 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How did you feel when you were down 5-1 in the third set and it looked like it was going to be over?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I feel not really good. (laughter.)
 5-1 down, and Roger play well and I have no solution, no? That's how I feel when I'm 5-1 down.

 Q. How were you able to turn it around? I mean, it's just remarkable. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: You know, I don't know. I just said to myself, You have to put the ball one more time than him, and I did it. 
 Yeah, it's a good thing for me. Yeah, it was just amazing to change this match. 

 Q. At what stage in that third set did you really think you could win it?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: After the first break I said, Okay, well, why not? (laughter.)

 Q. The injury, can you describe it? And did the pain of it lessen as you continued to play?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Sorry? 

 Q. Did you have an injury, and did it lessen as you continued to play, the pain of it?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. It was -- you know, I had a bad movement on the set point, the first one, and then I was a little bit, you know, pain in my arm. I lose the rhythm, you know, on my serve.
 It was really hard, because against Roger, if I can't serve, I cannot win, you know. Then it was better, and that's it.

 Q. What does a victory like this do for your confidence from now to the US Open?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, you know, it's really good, because before this tournament I played maybe three tournaments, and I was like very frustrated by my results and my level. And now I'm happy because I play really good and I beat some good players, so it give me a lot of confidence.

 Q. I wanted to know what you thought about playing Andy Murray tomorrow in the semifinals. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I know it's going to be difficult because Andy is one of the best players of this last month, and you know, I know I have to play my game, stay offensive, and I will see what happened. I know I have my chance, and I will take it.
