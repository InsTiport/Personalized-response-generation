7-6, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What went on in the first set?  You looked to have exchanged some words there.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, sometimes it happens.  Sometimes it happens.  We can talk during the game.   
Nothing special, yeah.   
 Q.  Could you enlighten us?  My French isn't that good.  What did you say?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: We just spoke about things that I think is only between him and me, and that's it.   
 Q.  The first set was pretty tight, then he got the upper hand.  What do you think made the difference today between you and him?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: To be honest, it's a little bit early for me.  I'm disappointed.  Yeah, I wish I can play a better match anyway because I was not able to beat him today because I was not enough good.  That was the difference.   
He was a little bit better than me.  Yeah, it makes the difference.   
 Q.  Do you manage to see it as a promising beginning of the season?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, for me it's really a promise.  Yeah, it's good for me to play a quarterfinal anyway.  After what I did at the end of last year, it's still on the same level.  But if I want to do better, of course I have to play better than this.   
But anyway, yeah, today, I think it's something good for me to be in quarterfinal.  Of course, I wish I can win today.  I hope I will continue to learn for the next time.   
 Q.  After the fourth round here, you got a letter from a ball kid.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, it was nice to have this letter.  I didn't do something really special, to be honest.  I just saw her last year.  She was struggling.  I saw that she needs some help.  The only thing I did is I took her and I bring her to outside of the court, and that's it.  I didn't save the world at all.   
But it was really kind to receive something after that.  That's why I post it.
