  7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What did you think of your game today? What went wrong in your mind? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Nothing was wrong. I think Fernando played better than me. He was more aggressive. He served better than me and that's it. 
 When you play a tennis match, there is a winner, and today it's Fernando. 

 Q. You had a lot of breakpoint chances you didn't get today. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. Today everything was wrong and all the time when I get the possibility to make a break, I missed or Fernando play a good point. 
 So I didn't make a lot of break. But I had a lot of breakpoint.
