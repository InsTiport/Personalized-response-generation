J. TSONGA/D. Goffin
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   You were saying you had trouble finding your marks.   How does it feel now? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   For sure I played better than yesterday.   This is a new step.   I'm happy I was able to play at that level today.   The goal is to repeat this or even do better next time. 
I know I can beat the top players, but I still need to play better than that.   There's room for improvement. 

Q.   Your opponent said he was surprised that you changed the pace so often and you mixed it up. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I know David thrives when there's a lot of rhythm.   He's able to create good tennis.   He sees the ball well. 
So the goal for me was to give him no rhythm, to mix it up as much as I could so that he would have to play a neutral shot that would give me an opportunity. 
He's not very tall.   So on clay he has to hit the ball high, which is not easy.   I tried to take advantage of that. 

Q.   He was injured.   Can it sometimes be difficult to play against a player who is just coming back after an injury?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't think about that kind of thing.   I was injured, too, and I'm coming back.   I still play at a good level.   Cilic, my next opponent, always beat me, so I really need to move forward into the court. 

Q.   You seem to feel a lot better than in Miami. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I thought I wasn't playing bad in Miami.   It's just that the context is totally different.   I was just starting to play again.   I hadn't played many sets in practice, whereas here I was able to practice three weeks before that.   So I feel a lot more comfortable on the court.
