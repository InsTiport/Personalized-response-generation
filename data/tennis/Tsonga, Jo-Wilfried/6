7-6, 6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I just wanted to ask you about the news this morning about Bernard Tomic, that he got fined all of his prize money from your first-round match.  Curious what you thought when you heard that.
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: That's touchy.  I can say that, "touchy"?  That's touchy.  Because you never -- they will do that with him and not with others?  And I think it's a little bit too much.
But that's the way they decide to deal with it, and I respect that.  That's it.
Q. Do you think they hold his reputation against him maybe?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course.  Of course.
Yeah, and -- yeah, I will say it's also, for me, it's like what I did was not win.  It's like me was just here and I just won because they said he didn't play enough.
Q. It's devaluing your victory?  You're saying it's devaluing your victory?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: A little bit.
Q. Disrespecting?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: A little bit.  A little bit.  But it's okay.  It's okay.  I won.  I continue.  It's great.
Q. How much work was it to sort of stay focussed in that match against Bernard?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I mean, sometimes some player against him, it's him, it's going slow, he's not running, but then you start to lose some points and it's close, and finally you are in his game.  He's really good in this one.
Yeah, I mean, he's in the top 100.  It means that it's not easy to beat him.  Yeah, that's it.
Q. So you're saying it was not easy to beat him in the first round?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I mean, you have to play every match.  I mean, you have to be focused against a player like this, because he's playing like this, but if it's tight, he's gonna play.  He's gonna play, for sure.
In the third set he played and it was tight.  And I played well to win this set.  So I don't know.
Q. 100% fine you think is too harsh?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think it's a lot, but that's just my thing.  You know, I'm not the one who decide.  I'm not the one who have the right speak or right thinking.  That's it.
