 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Are you sort of looking at this tournament sort of as an opportunity for you to take perhaps the next step in your career? You've established yourself obviously as one of the top 10 players, and perhaps this is going to be an opportunity to get even further than that.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Every Grand Slam you are -- you know, I'm here to win, you know, and to go to the next step.   
 The next step for me is to be in the five best players in the world, so yeah.  
  
  Q. How did you feel about the way you played today? Just seemed like everything was working for you.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: It was all right. I hit some balls and I run a lot, and it's good for me to start in this tournament.  
  
  Q. How important is it to get out there and get off to a start like you did today?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: It's good, because you don't leave a lot of energy on the court. But I played well, and it was good.  
  
  Q. Going forward, you're either going to play Fognini or Nieminen. Do you have a history against those guys? If so, how do you match up?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I know both. Both good players. Nieminen come back after injury. Fognini is not really in good shape at this moment, but I know it's going to be a tough match because it's a Grand Slam and everybody want to win.  
  
  Q. Nieminen won.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Nieminen then? So it will be Nieminen than. So yeah, I know it's going to be difficult, because he's going to be very hungry. It's going to be tough.  
  
  Q. You said you're here to win. Do you have a real belief that that's a legitimate thing that you can accomplish at this US Open?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. I'm in good shape and I play well, so why not?
