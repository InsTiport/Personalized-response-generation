THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   I noticed that a lot of French players are living in Switzerland.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Okay, I don't want to talk about this today.   I just want to talk about tennis.   If we could have another question, it would be perfect.   
   
 Q.   How did you find your first match out here in the Australian Open today?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I played a good tennis.   I'm really happy with my tennis today.   I did everything great.   
It's never easy to play a guy like Michael because he's very offensive.   The point is very short and you have to be, you know, really focus on every shot.   
So it's good for me to go through this one.   
   
 Q.   Not that many serve‑volleyers on the tour.   How do you find playing that sort of style?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, it's always difficult because it's different.   But I think it's tough to play the serve and volley every time like this now because of the quality of the returns of every guy, you know.   We all return just somebody's ball, so it's really difficult.
