 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. At the end you danced a bit of a jig. Was that a matter of coming back from two sets down in your previous match? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it was good for me. I did it over time. No, it was good to win in three straight sets. Anyway, for the rest of the tournament, it's good. 

 Q. Was it important to win in three after a grueling match in the first round?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Of course. 
 It's all the time important to spend less times a possible, so... 

 Q. Were you happy with today compared to the first round?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I'm really happy because I played better tennis than yesterday and I'm just happy with my level today. I was healthy. I felt good on the court. So I'm okay.
