 R. FEDERER/J. Tsonga
  6-2, 6-3, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Were you fully fit tonight? You grabbed at your stomach a couple of times. Did your stomach give you problems?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no. I was just a bit more tired after the first set. And, yeah, it was tough to play against him today. He was really good, and that's it.   
  
  Q. Were you tired because of the previous two five-setters you've had?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Yeah, because of my tournament, that's it.   
  
  Q. Federer was pretty awesome out there tonight, wasn't he?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, he was good. He was good.   
  
  Q. What did you think of his game?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: He took the ball earlier than me, and he was just better than me today.   
  
  Q. What did you learn from the game? Did you learn anything from it that you've got to do in the future?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I learned maybe I have to play better. That's it (smiling).   
  
  Q. Were you surprised by how good he was tonight?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, yeah, a bit.   
  
  Q. Why?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Why I'm surprise? I don't know. Because, you know, sometimes you play a guy and the guy play well, but not so good. And sometimes you play against him again and he play just unbelievable.   
 You know, each day is different, and today he was really good.   
  
  Q. Do you think you can play better against him next time?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Maybe. Certainly.   
  
  Q. How?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Maybe be more aggressive, yeah.   
  
  Q. What was wrong with your game tonight?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What was wrong? My serve. I think I was at 50 or 55% of first serve. My speed serve also. And also I miss some volley at the beginning of the match, and after that was tough, no?   
  
  Q. Were you mentally exhausted, as well?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Not really.   
  
  Q. If Roger plays like that, do you think anyone can beat him?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think nobody.   
  
  Q. What were your tactics before the game to try to counteract Roger?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: First to play, that's it, you know. Just enter in the match with offensive mind. That's it.   
  
  Q. What do you think Andy Murray could do to stop Roger Federer on Sunday?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Do you have any advice for him?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Advice? Be ready to run maybe (smiling).   
  
  Q. How do you rank yourself now? You were a finalist two years ago. Are you a better player now?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know if I'm better, but I'm more consistent, for sure.   
  
  Q. So you're reasonably happy with this tournament, the way it went?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I mean, it's okay. I did a good tournament. I beat some good player. I played two five-set match. It was the first time for me.   
 So it's more experience for me. I think it's good, even if I lose in semi. But next time I will try to do better.   
  
  Q. The Australian Open is your best Grand Slam. Why do you like playing here?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. Maybe a bit the surface, and also because I played my best tournament here. It was also one of the first Grand Slam I played. Before 2009, I played only -- 2008, sorry -- I played only two, so that's it.
