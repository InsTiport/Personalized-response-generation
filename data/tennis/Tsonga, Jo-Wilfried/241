   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. First two sets were pretty tight, and then you kind of raced away in the third. What made you have a better showing in the third?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Him, maybe. Maybe he was not very good in the third set. He played very well the two first sets. I was lucky to win the second set, so...   
 In the third I was better also and it was the difference.  
  
  Q. What was the trouble he was giving you in the first two sets? What do you think he did best?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. He played well. His serve and volley, he goes to the net a lot of times. Yeah, he was very good in this third set.   
  
  Q. How is life different for you since Australia? Do you notice more people are interested in you? More commitments?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, for me it's the same. I try to keep it just tennis.
