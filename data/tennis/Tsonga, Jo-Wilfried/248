   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Very tight match to come through. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, it was tough.  But I played well.  I don't know, I'm just happy to win today because it was very difficult. 

 Q.  What pleased you most about your game today? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I don't know.  I served well.  I go to the net.  It worked, so... 

 Q.  Did you have some leg problems? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, some leg problem, cramping.  I don't know why.  Maybe of the stress. 
 It was tough because the third one and the fourth one was very difficult.  And I tried to, you know, keep my body healthy, and I won. 

 Q.  How good does it feel to have beaten someone ranked so high? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  So good because it's my first win here, so I'm just happy it was on the Rod Laver.  It was just nice.  I don't know what to say about that.  Unbelievable. 

 Q.  Were you worried when he came back so well in the third?  How worried were you at that stage? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, I said, Okay, we have to play a fourth one and a fifth one if I need, so... 

 Q.  Is consistency something that you've got to work on? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Sorry? 

 Q.  Being consistent. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, I try to.  I try to.  I think it's the way to go for me, you know, play on the baseline, go to the net.  I just try to be - I don't know how say that - like complete, no? 

 Q.  You missed a couple of years with injuries. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  You've had some good results at the U.S. and French Open.  Your development is a bit slower than Marcos, who is the same year as you.  Are you confident of continuing that push through to a top 20 or top 10? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah.  If I can do it, I will do it.  But for the moment, I will see.  I have to play a next round here.  I will see what's happen. 

 Q.  Are you worried about a let-down at all? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, no, no. 

 Q.  How do you avoid that, to make sure you keep going on, to remain concentrated? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I do my best, that's all.  Try to do my best and I see after.  Yeah, just do my best. 

 Q.  How do you stay mentally tough in a very stressful situation like that?  You talked about your leg cramping up because of the stress.  How do you deal with the mental side of the stress? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, I just say in my head, you know, I practice a lot all these months before, and I say, Okay, I practice is not for nothing, so I have to do it. 

 Q.  You won the support of the crowd out there.  Did you feel that at all? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, I feel it.  I feel it.  It was unbelievable.  The public was great with me.  Amazing.  Just amazing. 

 Q.  You approached the net 102 times.  Is that usual for you?  Did you go in with a game plan of coming to the net a bit more often against Murray? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, I don't know.  I think it is the evolution of my game.  So I have to go to the net. 

 Q.  Do you think the doubles performance in Sydney helped that aspect? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, of course.  Of course.
