 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How did you feel today?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel great. I did a great job. I just win, and it's what I need. That's it. (Smiling).  
 One more. One more.   
  
  Q. Do you feel you will be successful like 2008?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, you know, I feel healthy. I'm good on the court. I don't know if it will be the same, but I try to take every match one by one. That's it.   
  
  Q. I don't think we know yet who you play next, do we?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: We don't know yet.  
  
  Q. Do you have a preference on either?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Fognini.  
  
  Q. Why?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Because he's not really offensive, so it's better because I don't have to run when the player in front of me is not offensive.  
  
  Q. So you're hoping for an easy match for round two?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. If I can have easy match all day, it's good.
