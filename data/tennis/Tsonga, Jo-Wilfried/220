  7-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Obviously great for you last week, but this week, tough first match. He's a big server, too, no?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, he's got a big serve, and it was really tough to play. I had a lot of occasion, you know, in the first set, and I am not did it. 
 That's it, I guess.

 Q. Is it difficult when you lose a first set like that, it goes 14 points to 12 in the tiebreak, and then you'd just be a little bit flat at the start of the second; is that what happened with you?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it's tough to come back after that, especially in this first set, because I had like five set points, a lot of breakpoints, and I am not did it. 

 Q. I mean, last week obviously you had an incredible comeback against Federer. Sometimes you can't always come back, can you?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, but, you know, played two times against players like this last month and I lost, so maybe I have to do something else to win. 

 Q. Do you feel happy with your preparation for the US Open? Have you had enough matches? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel good. I feel good, and I think I will play well in the US Open. 

 Q. You did well in Montreal. Were the conditions here much different?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it's different, and -- yeah, it's different, of course.

 Q. What did affect your game?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Nothing, you know. But I just played a different player. That's it. 

 Q. How is your physical? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel good. I'm all right.

 Q. No more injuries? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No more. 

 Q. How hard was it to get back in that second set after losing the tiebreaker like that?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it's tough to come back, because if you lose the first set you have a lot of occasion and a lot of breakpoint, set point. Since one or two months when I have had a lot of occasion like this I miss. I was very frustrated. 

 Q. What is the Grand Slam you dream to win the most? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: The French. 

 Q. French Open?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.
