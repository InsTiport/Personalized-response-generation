 A. MURRAY/J. Tsonga
  6-4, 7-6 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your decision not to go up to the net more? Is that because of Murray's ability to hit very good passing shots, or did you want to go to the net more? Is it better to stay back?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I went to the net more than my last match, and I'm happy with that. Of course, I can go more and more every time, but it was okay. And Andy's a very good player and it's tough to go to the net every time against him.  
 That's fine. I'm okay with that.   
  
  Q. Andy has moved to No. 2 in the world. What makes him difficult to play?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: He's difficult to play because he defend very good, and he's really, really quick, because after his shot he's going directly to the other shot, and it's tough to put him far off the ball, you know.   
  
  Q. Based on your experience here, do you expect to come back to this tournament again regularly now?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, but only here. I don't go to Toronto. (laughter.)  
  
  Q. How do you feel the tiebreak went today? Because you had a couple of chances to win.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I had couple of chances, but I missed on the chance, and you know, it's like this. Next time I will try to do it.   
  
  Q. Do you think it was those dropshots that made the difference?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. If I put it in the court, maybe different. I don't know.
