J. TSONGA/F. Cipolla
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Difficult conditions again.   An opponent who used a lot of slice and came to the net.   Two set points to save.   It was quite difficult out there for a little while, wasn't it?
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   Yeah, it was quite difficult, like yesterday, but I played better today.
I moved better, and I was a bit more aggressive, so I'm happy because I improved today compared to yesterday.

Q.   And is it also useful to have a real challenge like that for a little while, competitively useful to have an obstacle to overcome?
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   (Through translation.)   Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.   For me, you know, it's really good to play and to stay a long time on the court. 
Against Mr.Cipolla today it was good also to play some slice, you know, in the wind.   It's very difficult to play, and so we did some good rallies.   
I saw in these rallies, you know, I feel good physically, also. Yeah, it's good anyway to play some tough matches to get used to the competition.

Q.   Was the match enough to show you whether your preparation has been balanced right or that you've got your preparation for this season correct?   Can you feel that yet or not?
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   Yeah, I can 
feel ‑‑ you know, I had a good practice, because when there is good rallies, I don't feel the pain, I'm not tired, and anyway, it's a good sensation. 

Q.   Out on the court you talked about your net play.   Maybe you could talk a little bit more about your plans for this year, how you're going to use, you know, volleys and dropshots and come to the net more and why you're doing this. 
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   Yeah, you know, I just try to improve my game.   And also, one of my goals, you know, it's win against the best players in the world.
Today, you know, I think to beat this guy, you need to have something different.   They all have something different.   I mean, Rafa is running a lot, play with a lot of spin.   Roger, you know, take the ball very early, and Novak, too.   Andy Murray, he's an incredible defender, and his passing shots, you know, is just amazing.
I mean, you need something different to be the best player, anyway, on the court, so I try to follow my way, and I think my way is to be really offensive and play with my serve, my forehand, and of course my volley, too.   So I just try to improve my volley.

Q.   But like yesterday, you don't make it easy.   I mean, when you look at the statistics, I think, okay, it's going to be an easy match for you, but then you definitely made it interesting out there.   For people watching, it was definitely a much more competitive match than maybe they expected. 
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   Yeah, but of course, you know, because of the conditions‑‑ you know, maybe without these conditions it's maybe different.
You know, I saw a film before yesterday called Le StratÃ¨ge.   It's with Brad Pitt and the baseball. 

Q.   Oh, Moneyball. 
JO WILFRIED‑TSONGA:   Yeah.   This film talk about mathematics, you know, in sports.   And in this film, you know, you can see mathematics will never win against sports, you know.   And on one match, you know, you never know what's happen.   You never know what's happen.
So even if I'm, you know, a best player, I play in the top 10, when I will play against a guy, you know, 100 or 80 or 60, you know, I have a chance to lose.
So, you know, it's like this.   So today, it was like this.   That's why sports is very good, you know, because you never know.   You never know.
