  J. TSONGA/P. Carreno Busta  6-4, 6-4, 6-4  An interview with:  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Your third straight-sets win.  You must be very happy with your progress.  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I did a good performance today.  Happy to go through, of course.  Now I have another opponent.  It's going to be the possibility for me to play a good match again.   Q.  Someone you know very well?  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, someone I know very well, against who I don't have a good record. But, you know, I'm feeling good.  I expect to play a good match.   Q.  How much confidence can you take from the match against him in Toronto?  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Anyway, it's positive because it means that I'm able to play well against him.  I hope I will do that again.   Q.  You had a long run of not beating him going back to the Australian Open.  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, exactly.  But we never, except in Wimbledon, played in Grand Slam.  I can't remember, but I don't think.   Q.  In Australia.  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: In Australia, yeah, only once, the first time. So it's going to be interesting to see how it goes.   Q.  Do you think that changes things against him, playing over five sets?  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Anyway, it's always different.  It's always different.  Playing three sets, you know, it's always more physical.  I like when it's in three sets, so we'll see.   Q.  Do you feel different after Toronto?  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, I just feel the same.  I'm playing good.  I just expect to continue in this way, continue to play good tennis.  If I play good tennis and I win, it's good.   Q.  Andy hasn't beaten a top-10 opponent since Wimbledon last year.  Do you feel it's maybe a good time to play him?  JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I mean, it's never a good time to play Andy.  But, you know, for me it's the best time to play against him just because I'm feeling better than few months ago.  So that's a good time for me. To play against him, it's never the good time.
