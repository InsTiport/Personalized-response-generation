 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. The difference between Roger tonight and maybe at Wimbledon and Montreal, was this a different Roger?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. I don't know. Sometime it's difficult to evaluate. Sometime it's difficult to judge, you know. Maybe was better, maybe not. But I was not as good, also.   
 So I don't know yet. I will see the video. But I knew I didn't play really well. I didn't move well, and I think it was more easy, of course, for him to be in the court and play his game.  
  
  Q. Do you think he's playing well enough to beat Novak and to maybe win the tournament?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I hope for him. I hope for him.   
 You know, every time when he lost, you know, everybody say, you know, Roger is finished. But for me, he's still the same player. He is very good.  
 When the confidence is here for him, you know, it's for everybody to play against him. That's it.  
  
  Q. Were you disappointed in your serve or what were you disappointed in in the way you said you didn't move well?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm disappointed. That's it. I didn't serve well. I didn't use enough my forehand. I didn't move enough well.  
 My energy was down, so also it was not a really good match for me.
