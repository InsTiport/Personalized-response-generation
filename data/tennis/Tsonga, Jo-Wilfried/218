 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How do you feel you played today? Was it a pretty quick match. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it was a quick match. I played great. 
 Yeah, I am happy to go through this far. 

 Q. How do you feel you're playing so far this tournament? What do you have to do for the second week to raise your game?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: First I have to finish my first week. I will have a match Sunday, and I have to win. So after that, maybe I can answer you.

 Q. You mentioned that you've lost some weight recently. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, a bit, but not a lot.

 Q. Can you talk about that? Is that something you are trying to do to get lighter to improve the movement, or it just happened?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, it just -- just practiced more and eat diet. That's it.

 Q. But it was conscious?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Of course, it was.
