 J. TSONGA/S. Bolelli
  (Walkover) 
   
  Q. Today was a walkover. What do you think? Are you shocked or were you prepared for it?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, I'm sad for him because he's maybe injured. I don't know what he had for the moment. But I'm happy to be at the third round. That's it.   
  
  Q. Does that shake your plans for Wimbledon?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think anyway it's good for me because I played a long match for the first round, and now I don't play for the second, so I will be ready for the third.   
  
  Q. Do you know that in Congo-Kinshasa they are rooting for you? Are you aware?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I know, of course.  
  
  Q. Have you been back since the last time you went to the Congo?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No.  
  
  Q. Any plans to go back?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Not for the moment, but yeah, I will go there for sure.   
  
  Q. What does Wimbledon mean to you?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Wimbledon means a Grand Slam tournament, a tournament with a lot of history.   
  
  Q. What do you think of the significance of Federer for you? What's so special about Federer for you?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Maybe how he's relaxed on the court.   
  
  Q. You are from a family of sportsmen.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, only my father, because my mother did nothing.  
  
  Q. And your brother?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: And my brother plays but my sister nothing.  
  
  Q. And your cousin is a sports person in New Castle?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, and I'm not originally from Congo-Kinshasa. I'm from the other side of the river.   
  
  Q. So how did you get into sports, your family push you or you like to play?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, it was just natural. When I was a kid I was all the time outside of the house, and that's it.   
  
  Q. Is your family here with you now?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: My brother.
