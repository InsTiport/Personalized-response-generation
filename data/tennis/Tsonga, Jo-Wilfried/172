 J. TSONGA/R. Nadal
  7‑6, 4‑6, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess your own level today?   How do you assess Rafa's?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, tonight I just played well, amazing tennis.   I mean, I don't know if Rafa played really well.   But, anyway, he fight to come back.   This is what champions do every time, you know.   
You know, me, I just played well.   I mean, I was really aggressive.   I had a good percentage of winners.   I put a lot of pressure on him today.   
   
 Q.   You remind us of Stefan Edberg coming after a second serve to the net.   The volleys remind us of Australia 2008.   Is it practice or what?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, sometimes you just need little things to improve a shot.   Maybe today I found something.   I mean, yeah, that's it.   
   
 Q.   You obviously don't know who you're going to be playing in the semifinals.   Does that make it more difficult to prepare?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, for me it's not a problem.   Anyway, I will know tomorrow and then I will think about my match after that.   
But, you know, for the moment I just need rest and enjoy this victory today.   
   
 Q.   Do you think this year has been the best tennis of your life considering that in the past you've also been in a Grand Slam final?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   You know, yesterday I was looking some movie from three years ago when I was playing at the Australian, all the year of 2008.   I said,   Wow!   Before I had a lot of energy and I was running faster, I was hitting harder, but I was crazy on the court.   
I think, you know, this year I just improved this.   I'm maybe less fast, less powerful, but I'm better in my head.   This is why I'm good this year.
