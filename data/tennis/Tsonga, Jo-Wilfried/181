 J. TSONGA/M. Cilic

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You've had a lot of success recently against Roger. Can you identify a few things you've picked up in his game that have worked.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. Next time I will play against him it's going to be another story maybe, so, you know, every time I try to be aggressive against him and that's it.   
 I'm really focusing on myself, and that's it.   
  
  Q. In your match with Cilic, was there anything that you weren't happy with in your game? You won in straight sets, so...  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Today?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, today I played well. You know, I didn't play the last two days because of my arm, and this morning at the warmup I was feeling really good.   
 And also during the match I felt really good. It was really a -- I don't know how to say that -- a fluid match. Like everything was easy for me today to serve and everything.   
 So it was good.  
  
  Q. What, in your opinion, are the keys to being an excellent returner of serve, and who do you least like to serve to?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: (Through translation.) Against who? Of course against Novak. Who I don't like? You know, especially the -- I don't know. I don't know, you know. Anyway I prefer serve than return, so...  
  
  Q. What makes Novak so good returning serves?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, because he's really quick and all the time when he's on the ball, you know he will put the return inside.  
 That's why. It's because he's so consistent.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your arm a little bit? How is it feeling for this week?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I feel good. I feel good. Like I said, I didn't play for the two last day, and this morning I was feeling good. So it's okay.   
  
  Q. US Open is coming up. What's so special or weird or strange about playing in New York?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Nothing weird. Special of course, because, you know, we come from Europe, and anyway New York everything is so different.   
 It's like another world for me, so it's really special.  
  
  Q. What's so different about it? What do you like to do?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Everything is big, and, yeah, it's another culture. That's it.   
  
  Q. You have a trademark celebration dance you do when you win matches. Another player who does that is Andrea Petkovic. She's changed her dance several times in the last year. Have you ever thought about introducing new choreography to your celebration?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no. Not really. I like that one, and that's it.   
  
  Q. Do you like playing in the combined event at this venue, for instance? Obviously this is the first year both men and women are together here. Talk about that.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Well, you know, I have nothing to say about it. I think if the crowd is happy with that, that's fine. Me, I don't have a problem. The site is really big, and I think it's okay. We can all play on the court and share courts with the girls. There is no problem.  
  
  Q. Are there any women whose matches you would like to watch?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Um, next question. (Smiling.)
