   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. You must have great memories of last year in Australia.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, great memories, you know, in Adelaide, here, and also in Melbourne, of course.  
 Yeah, happy to be here again, and I hope I will play better than last year.  
  
  Q. There were no great expectations on you last year when you came to Sydney. Probably a little bit more this year to perform.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No pressure, because I just prepare the Australian Open. I just want to play my best tennis all the time on all tournaments, so I never put pressure on me. I just play my game. That's it.  
  
  Q. How is your game at the moment?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Well, it's all right. I play three matches last week, and now I play better than last week and two weeks ago.  
 So I hope I will play better and better every day. I will play some matches here and go through the draw, and I will see at the end how it's happen.  
  
  Q. Do you feel as strong as going into the last Australian summer?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel stronger. You know, tennis is every day different. Sometimes you can win and sometimes you can lose, even if you play well, so I will see.  
  
  Q. The three matches you had in Brisbane, did you bring anything down that you want to work a little on the practice court?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Of course. I have to to continue to progress. And, you know, I miss -- my offensive game was not very good last week, so I'll try to improve it.  
  
  Q. They're talking about maybe temperatures getting up to 40 degrees tomorrow. Is it any concern for you to have a hot day when you're trying to prepare for a Grand Slam?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. I think it's a good thing for me to be on the court at this moment, because I have to for the next week because maybe it's going to be hot also.  
 So I have to play with this temperature one time to be ready for next week.  
  
  Q. Last year Australians really had much to cheer for. Players in the crowd embraced you as one of their own. Do you feel like perhaps they might do that again this time? Is that your hope?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Of course. I hope the crowd will be with me, and I will do everything for that.  
  
  Q. Did it help you last year that you think the crowd got behind you?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, a lot. Because I know for me tennis is pleasure, so when you have the crowd with you it's just amazing feeling.  
  
  Q. If you could touch on one or two things that you think your game is different 12 months on from Melbourne last year, what are those things?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think I have more experience than last year, and also I think my backhand, I improve my backhand a lot, so...  
 That's it.  
  
  Q. Everyone is talking about the top four favorites.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Do you feel as though you're close to or with those guys on that level?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I think I can beat them because I did it already, so I will try another time.  
  
  Q. How do you feel the courts are playing this year compared to last year?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: The courts?  
  
  Q. The courts here in Australia, are they similar to last year?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think it's similar. I don't know it it's really similar, but I feel it like this, yeah.  
  
  Q. Still looking to play as attacking as possible and come to the net?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. I think that's one of the big things the Australian crowd embraced last year. You really played attacking tennis. It was fun and exciting.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I will do it again.
