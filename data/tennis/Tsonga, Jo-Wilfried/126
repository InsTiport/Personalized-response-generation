J. TSONGA/B. Kavcic
  6‑2, 6‑1, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You said after your last match you weren't too happy with your attitude and performance.   How do you feel after today's game?
JO WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I played a better match.   I mean, was not easy because it was really windy today and not easy to feel the ball really well.   So I'm happy to go through this one in three sets. 
Yeah, I look forward for the next match.
