J. TSONGA/B. Paire   
6-4, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  More phenomenal serving today; no break points faced.  How do you feel on the serve?  What's going through your mind?  How's that working?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it's one of my best weapons since I'm kid, so it's something I don't really need to focus on.   
But, yeah, it's going well.  I think today the rest was also good, and when I'm playing good, you know, outside of my serve, then it's even easier to serve.   
 Q.  Thoughts on playing Cilic next.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, now I will play against Marin.  He's a good player.  He beat me a few times in the past on big matches.  For me, it's gonna be important, you know, to prepare this match as well as possible and try to find a way to go through.
