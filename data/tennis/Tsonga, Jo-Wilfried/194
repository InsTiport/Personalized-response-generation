I. LJUBICIC/J. Tsonga
  7-6, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please. 

 Q. You must be very disappointed because that match was not out of reach for you. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, I am very disappointed. I had the feeling I was playing extremely well for a set and a half. In spite of that, I was not ahead in the score. 
 Many details went wrong. There were some bad bounces, but also I missed the important points. So I'm playing tennis better during this period; however, I'm not winning, and that is frustrating. So I'm playing well: this is positive. But I lost: this is negative. 
 I will have to turn it around. I am working a lot for that. 

 Q. You're playing better. At 4-3 you got broken back. At 3-1 you made a couple of mistakes at the net because you were rushing. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know if I was rushing. I call that a missed volley. 

 Q. That's what I saw. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: At another moment of the match I played exactly the same volley and I made the point. In that case, you're not going to say I was rushing. So it's not negligence; it's a lack of confidence. 
 I didn't play many matches on clay yet. But now it has to work and I must start winning. 

 Q. But if you lack confidence, isn't it worse approaching the net all the time? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What I'm saying to myself is that if I have to regret anything, at least I need to try everything I can. 
 Ivan is a good player, so it's better to try everything instead of doing nothing and just letting the match slip away. 

 Q. What is your schedule now? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm going to train next week after playing doubles here. Why not, maybe Munich. 

 Q. Are you going to play doubles with GaÃ«l, again? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: If we play well, yes. 

 Q. So it's only for winning, not for pleasure? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Well, it's all right to enjoy yourself, but it all depends on the results. If we are both complementary on the court and play well together, we might play more doubles.
