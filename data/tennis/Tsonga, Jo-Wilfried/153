THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of Jamie?   Do you know his story?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Jamie, what I think about him?   I mean, we have the same age.   We played a lot, you know, in juniors together.   We played a lot in futures.   I saw him many times play.   
Jamie, he's a good player, you know, like solid for his ranking, but maybe need to be a bit more crazy.   (Smiling.)  
Maybe it will be ‑‑it sounds strange, but he need to be crazy.   
   
 Q.   Because he's done very, very well just to still be able to play tennis.   He was very, very ill a couple of years ago.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah.   It was good.   It was good, you know.   He was young and he was a good player when he was young.  
I think he need to maybe relax, you know, relax and just enjoy what he's doing.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about this tournament now with so many of the big names going out?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, I think it's still the same tournament.   I mean, if Andy lost today, it's not because he was not good.   I mean, it was maybe also because Nicolas was unbelievable.   I mean, everybody know, you know, he's able to play fantastic tennis on grass, and he did it today.   
So he played already a final here.   He had some match points here like me last year.   So on grass he's maybe one of the best players in the world.
