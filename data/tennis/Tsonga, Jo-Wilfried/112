  6‑2, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You started off slowly in the first set, but came back strongly in the second.   Talk about the game.   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, it was a great set at the beginning.   I didn't serve enough good in the first set to cause him some trouble, but after that I played better and better.   I served better.   I was more into it.   So for him it was a bit more trouble, but it's still 7‑5.   
That's it.   What can I say?   Nothing special.   
   
 Q.   Physically how are you feeling?   Do you plan on playing Vienna next week?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I feel okay.   I will see in a few hours how is my knee, how I'm feeling.   But for the moment I'm going to Vienna.   
   
 Q.   With the World Tour Finals pretty near and Andy Murray not going, there's still a few places to grab.   Is this on your mind?   Are you planning to try your best to get there or you're just trying to get your level back?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, I mean, anyway, I have to play if I want to go.   I will play, and that's it.   I cannot do something special to go there.   I just have to play and try to win as much as possible.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   It's your first semifinals since Queen's.   Is it a matter of getting fully fit now for next season?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I'm going better and better.   Today I played well in the second set.   I know I can play a lot better.   So I will continue to work.   Yeah, I will continue on my way.   I think I'm on a good way.   That's it.
