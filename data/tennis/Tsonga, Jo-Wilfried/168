  7‑6, 6‑7, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   He turned out to be a pretty good player, didn't he?   Was it good to get a lot of court time for yourself?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, it was good for me to play a long time, to stay a long time on the court.   But was not easy, not easy today.   Malek was in good shape.   With the wind was really difficult to play my best tennis.  
But it's good condition to start because it's really hard, and then it will be more easier to play without wind.  
   
 Q.   When you start the new season, what do you look to do?   Are there certain things that you try to go through as a kind of routine rather than concentrating on winning the match?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah.   You know, for the moment I just try to play some points, play, play, play, and it's gonna come.   It's gonna come maybe next week, or I don't know, or in two weeks.   I don't know.   But anyway, for the moment, I fight, you know.  
   
 Q.   You said your preparation had gone well.   Has it gone better than ever before, or did you do anything differently?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I really don't know.   I think next tournament or this tournament will tell me if I'm ready or not.  
   
 Q.   What was so difficult with him?   Obviously he was playing really well at the net, but for you what were some surprises?   What made it so tough for you out there?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   What was tough was maybe the wind, you know, because sometimes I have the shot to finish and I cannot finish.  
I think he played well, you know.   He was a wildcard, so nothing to lose, and I think he played good tennis against me.
