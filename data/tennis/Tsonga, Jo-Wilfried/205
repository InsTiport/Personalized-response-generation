J. TSONGA/R. Kendrick
  7-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. I take it you dragged yourself away from the television, or you cannot bear to watch what's going on on the soccer field. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. And? 

 Q. Would you rather be watching the French game now?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no. I'm here.

 Q. But was it difficult to come here now rather than...
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. It's not a problem. It's okay. 

 Q. Okay. We'll talk tennis then. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: We'll talk tennis. 

 Q. Does your performance today give you a lot of confidence? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. Yeah, because Robert is a very good player. I knew before the match it would be difficult, and it was. 
 So I'm really happy to win today. 

 Q. It looked hard work for you out there. Was it hard to get a read on his serve? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, on his serve, because this is his best shot. He served unbelievable and I didn't return a lot, but enough to win this match. It's good. 

 Q. How confident are you coming into Wimbledon? You've saved your best slam performances for Australia so far. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I only played two times here, so for me it's the third one. You know, I'm new on this surface, so maybe I can do something good. 
 Because the first one I did the fourth round; last year the third. So maybe I can do better.

 Q. Is it a learning curve on grass for you? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. We can call it like this, yeah.

 Q. Do you think you have the all-round game to challenge the Federers... 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.

 Q. And are you now injury-free given what happened in...
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, now I'm better. I'm healthy. Everything is okay. So I hope I will continue like this.

 Q. What exactly what the problem? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Problem with my psoas. (Through translation.) Tear in the psoas muscle.

 Q. And that's now no problem?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No.
