J. TSONGA/P. Kohlschreiber
  7‑6, 4‑6, 7‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   So how do you feel to go through to the semifinals?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I mean, I'm really happy.   Really happy.   You know, for the second time I will reach the semis.   For me, it's going to be also a second chance. 
So, no, I feel good.   You know, exciting about play these semis, and that's it. 

Q.   You obviously don't know who you're going to play yet.   Do you mind telling us about the challenges Murray or Ferrer might give you, please. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, it's going to be‑‑ yeah, of course it's different.   If I play Andy, you know, he's able to come a bit more to the net and come to finish the point. 
With David, he's of course aggressive also, but a bit less.   He play with a lot of spin.   Andy play flat.   I think Andy have a better hand than David.   But David is a fighter. 
So they are different.   So I will see who I will play. 

Q.   How will you deal with it if it's Andy Murray?   He'll have the home support. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I mean, that's all right.   I mean, all the year I'm outside.   Sometimes I play against a player who have lot of support and I win.   I remember at US Open I play against Fish in a tight match.   Was not easy, but I won it. 
So I think for me it's of course an advantage to play at home.   But it's still tennis, and you never know what's happen on court.

Q.   You beat Ferrer here last year.   How has Ferrer's game changed in the last 12 months? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, he's able to go a bit more to the net, to be a bit more aggressive.   Of course, he's still consistent.   I think also he served a lot better this last few months, yeah. 

Q.   You spoke about a second chance in your TV interview.   Going back to last year, what are the emotions you remember from last year?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, for me last year was already something huge, to reach the semis.   This year it's going to be a bit different.   I'm a bit more favorite in the tournament.   You know, I'm seed No.5.   I go through and I will play semis, but in a different way. 
Because at this time I didn't play, you know, a player who was better than me, so it's going to be different. 

Q.   In the Australian Open match, you obviously played a good match and everyone was aware of you after that match against Andy.   What has been the difference in the five other matches, do you think?   You beat him on a grass court way back in 2004 maybe at a challenger, I believe. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, it was indoors.   We played indoors finally because of the good weather, yeah (smiling).
No, I mean, for me Andy's one of the player I don't like to play because he's returning really well and he can play some really good passing shot.   He's really quick.   He's all the time on the ball, so is tough for me. 
But, you know, I beat him once.   Yeah, I beat him once.   And last time we play together on grass, I had a match point and it was really close.   Yeah, last year in final in Queen's. 
So, I mean, if it's Andy, you know, I will have a chance.   I mean, on 100% I have maybe less than him, but I will have some and I will try to take it. 

Q.   You talked about playing at home.   Often the French seem to not manage the pressure of playing at home very well.   Andy is playing at home.   How do you think he's managing the pressure of playing here in England?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, manage the pressure in France, you know... 
I mean, when you have a player who are 5 or 4 or 1 or 2 you manage of course better the pressure.   But, you know, in the past we had some player in France, we had some good player, but at the French we didn't have a player who, you know, really played well on the surface.   That's it.   It's not about the pressure. 
So I think here for Andy is difficult because he's alone.   I mean, in France it's okay.   We have many players and that's fine, but here for him it's really difficult because every eyes are on him and it's tough for him, so... 

Q.   When you speak of pressure and you talk about being in the favorite role here in more of your matches, how does that emotion carry over to you going forward both in a semifinal and looking toward the possibility of a final here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Me, I take it like a second chance.   For me it's a chance for me to be here.   It's already a chance to play tennis.   So, you know, I will go on court and I will try to take my chance, and that's it. 

Q.   You've spoken about not having a coach and all that many times, but... 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I didn't talk.   It's because you guys ask me all the time (smiling). 

Q.   If you play someone like Murray it could be a very complicated match.   The night before do you think of things you want to do, or do you maybe ask ClÃ©ment or some other French guys who are around?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Of course, of course.   Even if I'm alone, I like to ask.   I like to learn from the others.   So every time, you know, when I play, I try to have some advice from other guy like Guy Forget or Arnaud ClÃ©ment and player who are still on the tour. 

Q.   If the great British summer continues, you could be playing under the roof on Centre Court.   Have you played under the roof on Centre Court?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Never.

Q.   Andy has.   Does that give him a slight advantage or... 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, maybe.   He will know the condition.   Of course it's an advantage.   But that's okay.   It's okay.   I mean, you know, I'm fair.   I will just play and we'll see. 

Q.   What would it mean in France ‑ a long time since Yannick Noah ‑ for you to be in the final here?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I really don't know.   I really don't know what does it mean.   But for me it mean, you know, I complete something good, because since I'm kid, you know, I'm dream about play matches like this. 
You know, for me it's going to be something big, but for the others I don't know. 

Q.   What would it mean to you to be able to be in that position?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, like I said, it's something big because I'm dream about it since I'm kid.   So, you know, I don't know for the moment.   Maybe I don't realize what I did and what I do, but maybe I will realize, you know, after my career. 
But for the moment I'm into it and I try to enjoy it. 

Q.   How have you changed in the past year?   What have you improved?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think I'm a bit more consistent, and that's it.   I mean, I turn my head in the good sense, so I'm a bit better.

Q.   What do you mean 'turn your head in a good sense'? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, before I was not enough consistent in my head.   I lose many time my concentration.   It was tough for me to play tennis honestly because I lost my concentration every single day and it was difficult.
