  7‑5, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Jo‑Wilfried is the first Frenchman to win the title here in Canada in tournament history going back to 1881; second career ATP Masters 1000 title, 2008 Paris‑Bercy; also the first player to beat four top 10s in an ATP Masters 1000 since Guillermo CÃ£nas here in Toronto in 2002.   
Let's open it up for questions.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   How does it feel to win your second Masters title?   And how does this compare to the first one that you won in Paris?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I feel good.   You know, I think for the moment, you know, I don't realize really what I achieved this week, but it's a big achievement for me.  
It's completely different than before when I won in Paris.   In Paris it was the first one, you know, behind my family, all my friends, everybody.   I think I did it with my hurt, you know, in Paris.   Here I just did it with my level, with my game.   
I played well all this week.   I beat many good guys.   You know, it's a big achievement because I worked really hard to come back from my knee injury last year.   
For me, it's just good to be here in front of you and speak about, you know, how I win this tournament.   (Smiling.)   
   
 Q.   You met about 16 times together.   This year it's third meeting with Roger.   What's the difference between, for example, Australian Open and here, the game?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Between these two matches there is a lot of work from my side, you know.   At the Australian I still had problem with my knees, but I was playing pretty good.   Roger did just a great match.  
But I think, you know, on this tournament, you know, I was stronger.   Since couple of weeks now I'm playing better and better.   I played pretty good in Roland Garros.   Then I played good also in Wimbledon.   Today I think I'm a better player.  
   
 Q.   You have eliminated a lot of top 10 players this week.   It looks like you figured out the secret.   Can you share the secret to win?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Oh, unfortunately there is no secret.   You know, people see that maybe like a one shot, but behind this there is a lot of work, like I said before.   I'm waiting for this since couple of months now.   I was looking for my best level.   
Today I had it and it's great, you know.   It's something maybe it came a little bit quick.   I didn't expect to be that quick, but it happened and it's good for me.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel when you ran out of challenges in the second set?   Were you worried at the time that that could be a problem for you?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, it was not a problem, because, you know, I just ‑‑ you know, I just asked the challenge because I was not sure, and this is the game.   That's it.   
But then I just decide to be confident in my umpire.   I mean, it's in the past now because I won it, and it doesn't change anything.  
   
 Q.   Your impressive performances this week, do you think they add a little more pressure to you heading into the US Open now?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Not really.   Not really.   What is achieved is achieved, and I will, you know, just continue on this way, continue to work hard.   
 This win give me a lot of hope for the rest of the year, of course.   But I will continue to do my work like I did last couple of months, and I hope I will continue to win.  
 Q.   A lot of Roger Federer fans out there but also heard a lot of Tsonga fans.   Just want to get your thoughts on the crowd today.   
 JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I mean, when you play Roger, of course you are always the challenger for the people in the crowd, so some of them are for you because they want you to do a good performance, but most of them are for Roger because he's the guy who did the most for tennis since a long time now, and he deserve it and that's it.  
 Q.   What made it click for you this week?   Anything in particular?   What made a difference this week?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Like I said, you know, it's not only this week, you know.   I'm working hard.   My motivation came back.   You know, I want to win.   I want to play my best tennis on the court.   And it happened today, but it's a lot of work behind this.  
   
 Q.   I believe this is your 11th career ATP victory.   Where does this one rate for you when you look at your career on the tour?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I think for me it's gonna be a new motivation because, you know, this last year I always lost against those guys, and it was really frustrating for me.   
Then today, you know, a win against them, it's good for me, it's good for my ambition, and, yeah, it's good for my career.  
   
 Q.   When you were coming back from injury and you were struggling a bit, did you ever doubt that a week like this was possible for you again?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes, of course.   You know, you always have a moment where you doubt.   But I think, you know, when you decide to be a tennis player you know that will happen and you know that there is no ‑‑every mountain, you know, can be reached at the top.   
So you continue to believe in it.   Even if, you know, people around you say you're not able to do it, you believe in it.   And when you believe in something, you know, it make it sometimes possible.
