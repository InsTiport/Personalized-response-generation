J. TSONGA/J. Struff
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   I'd like to know if the fact that Roger Federer became more aggressive and started to win more last year, with Edberg, gives you let's say some idea to be aggressive, to attack even more than you were used to, it would help your game and your wins, or not?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   That depends.   It depends.   I don't know if Roger won more on clay courts, for example.   I don't know if he won more last year than the year before with this game. 
So I think it's important to play the good tennis on the good surface.   Each player have his own, you know, style of game.   That's why tennis, it's so attractive.   That's it. 

Q.   Doesn't change at all your strategy?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Not mine, anyway, to be aggressive. 

Q.   And being close to 30 years old, does it make any difference in your attitude to the game?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I would like.   But, you know, I'm still very angry when I miss something (smiling). 

Q.   You're more mature than you were?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, for sure, I'm a lot more mature.   But maybe not on the court (smiling). 

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   How was the doubles? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Nice. 

Q.   What is the goal playing with GaÃ«l?   He's not a specialist in doubles.   There is no particular Davis Cup goal in that? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   The goal is to make him become a doubles player, and then he will no longer bother us in the singles (laughter). 
Well, we agreed that we would play together now and then.   I think it's good for the French team to have an extra player able to play doubles.   You never know.   Also I can get some practice in doubles myself.   That gives the French team an additional option for a doubles team. 

Q.   You've been changing surfaces, Miami on hard, now on clay.   How is it? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It's the same as previous years.   We all need to adapt to those changes anyway. 

Q.   But you were injured and played very few matches.   Is clay easier to start playing again?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Not really.   Of course, when you change directions, it's not as tough on your body and on your joints.   But on the other hand it's harder for your abductors and also because of the sliding. 
But after so many years, you're used to those changes. 

Q.   You've been lacking some matches.   How much do you have to change your game to adapt to clay?   Do you have to construct your points differently?   Are you satisfied with the way you played in this match? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, I believe it is not bad.   I'm very happy that I won.   It gives me the right to play another match. 
But I must say, I'm quite satisfied.   The goal is to play as many matches as possible.   If you want to play many matches, you need to win. 

Q.   Do you think you're going to improve next week?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes.   I believe my game is going to improve.   The goal is still to play the way I'm playing now, with the same type of game. 
I did the main thing today:   I won the match. 

Q.   What didn't you like in his game today? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Oh, it was not easy because my opponent was playing Russian roulette.   So it was difficult for me to use what I have been practicing before during that particular match.   I can't really say I felt comfortable on the court. 
But, as I said, I managed to win. 

Q.   Are you going to change things in your game on clay this year compared to last year?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, the goal is to do exactly as I've been doing until now, but do it even better. 

Q.   Many players are saying that they have to improve by going more to the net, moving forward a bit more.   You always did that, didn't you?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, in tennis you can't really win matches by staying so far back.   Now players are more and more clever from the baseline.   The only way they can improve their game is to be able to go more to the net. 
It's not my case.   For me it's rather the opposite. 

Q.   Are you looking further in the draw for this week?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Absolutely not.   This is only my second victory in two tournaments, so I'm only focusing on my next match against David.   I'm just hoping I will be able to win it.
