J. TSONGA/K. Anderson
6-3, 6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk about the challenges of facing a player who is as tall as Kevin is and how you were so successful in winning the match and combatting those challenges?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Anyways, it's never easy to play that kind of player.  He's serving well.  He's also moving well from his baseline for his height.
Yeah, today it was a good challenge for me to beat him.  I did it well, for sure.
I am maybe also a good server, so was tough for him, too.  Yeah, it's always a big challenge because you never know what to expect.  Sometimes they can serve and serve and serve and you never return, but anyway, today I did it well.  It was a good match for me.
