J. TSONGA/D. Goffin
  7‑6, 6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you feel playing in first round? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I'm feeling good.   I played well today.   I was really relaxed on the court, and it make me save energy and play good tennis.

Q.   Everybody is talking about your side of the draw.   It's very tough.   What do you think about it?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I mean, it's tough.   It's maybe a bit tougher for Rafa or for Roger or maybe for Andy, but for me it's always the same.
Anyway, I have to play one of the best player in quarterfinal anyway, so one of the top four. 
For me, it's like usual.   (Smiling.)
