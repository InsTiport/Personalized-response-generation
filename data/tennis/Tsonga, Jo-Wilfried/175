 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You didn't seem to have a whole lot of energy in the beginning of the match, the first set. How were you feeling out there today? How do you think it went overall?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: How I feel? Of course, disappointed because I lost. But today I had a good opponent. Was really good. Even if maybe I didn't play with a lot of energy, I played a good tennis. And today my opponent was just better than me.   
 I have nothing more to say (smiling).   
  
  Q. He can be a very clever player. A lot of people have been talking about him for a long time. How talented is he?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Oh, he's really talented, especially when everything work, you know. But, no, today he didn't miss one dropshot. He played really well. He returned unbelievable. I think nobody breaks me many times like this.   
 So, no, he played really well. I hope for him he will play again like this. If he play again like this, he's going to win a lot of matches.   
  
  Q. You have several points advantage over Nicolas Almagro in terms of the race towards the World Tour Finals in London. Despite this result, are you still confident you can get there?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, of course, because for the moment I'm the leader. Not the leader, but how to say that? I have more points than all my opponents. So, of course, for the moment I'm confident. I will take some rest and then I will come back to qualify.   
  
  Q. I'm assuming you're playing Bercy. Where else are you playing before then?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Before I'm supposed to play Vienna and Valencia. That's it.
