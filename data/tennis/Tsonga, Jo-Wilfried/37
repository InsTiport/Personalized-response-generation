6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Hard-fought match.  You got through it.  Your thoughts on the match and how you're playing right now.  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Today was a good match.  I played well.   
I don't know what he will say, but I think it was a good level.  I saw the statistic after the match, and, yeah, I served well.  I returned well.  The only thing, I had -- I did only four breaks on my 25 break points.  That is the only dark things on my statistics.   
Today I'm pretty happy the way I played.   
 Q.  Talk about your form coming into the tournament and expectations.  You had a great run here last year.  Do you feel like you have a deep run in you?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel great physically.  That's the most important for me.  Last couple of months I had few little things that make me play bad.   
Yeah, today I cross fingers.  I hope it's going to continue in this way, but I'm feeling good.  I have expectation.   
Anyway, my tennis is there.  I hope I will improve and improve match after match.   
 Q.  You say expectations.  What is that expectation?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Oh, the expectation is of course to try to do as good as I did in the past, and even better, of course, if I can.
