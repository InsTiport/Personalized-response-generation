A. MURRAY/J. Tsonga
  7‑6, 6‑1, 3‑6, 4‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. How disappointing is it to have come so far, yet you didn't get to cross the finish line?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, the finish line was far tonight. I came back strong on the third and fourth, but I didn't play well in the fifth. Andy was a little better than me on this last set. 
Yeah, like I said, the finish line was far. 

Q. What was it in the final set that you let him get there first before you?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think he had the opportunity to break me, and he did it. Then he was a little bit more aggressive and relaxed. He did it twice, and then it was tough to come back in this set.
