 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Obviously your serve was dominant today: 85% on your first serve. Is it tough to lose when you're serving like that?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, it's tough to lose when I play like that, when I serve like that. Yeah, I did a great job today on my serve, and yeah.   
  
  Q. Is it tough to play I imagine a friend and countryman?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course it's tough all the time to play against a friend. You have to separate, you know, your sentiment. You know, like when you are on the court you have to see your friend like as another player.  
  
  Q. And Djokovic is maybe not such a close friend. He beat you in the Australian Open, but since then, and he told us today, you've been tough. You've beaten him like four times in a row. What do you have to do to beat him again?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I have to stay really concentrate and play my game, like I did all the -- the last time. We will see what's happen.  
  
  Q. A lot of people say, and I see it too, you look like Muhammad Ali a lot in so many ways, from the way you smile and wink. Have you ever met him? Do you feel like you do look like him?   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no. I don't feel like this. I don't know, I just look like him, but maybe I don't have the same thing in my mind. I don't know.   
 That's it.   
  
  Q. He's not a bad guy to copy though, one of the great athletes of all-time.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, he's a really good athlete, and if I can look like him, I will look like him.
