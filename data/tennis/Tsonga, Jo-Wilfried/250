   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Are you enjoying your first experience of Wimbledon this week? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, of course.  Of course, I'm very happy.  I played very good these matches.  I feel good. 

 Q.  Your serve is especially a great weapon.  What was the fastest serve you've registered this week?  Did you notice? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, no, I don't know.  But my serve is good.  My forehand, too.  My backhand, too.  My volley, too.  My dropshot, too (smiling). 
 Yeah, today I served very well.  For me it's a good advantage. 

 Q.  If it is Henman that you play next, will you enjoy having all the attention on that match and the support that Henman will get? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah.  The more there is people, the more I am -- the better I am, sorry.  So for me I hope play Henman.  For me it will be a good experience. 

 Q.  You haven't played him before, have you? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No. 

 Q.  What was your reaction when you discovered that you had a wildcard into Wimbledon? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  My reaction? 

 Q.  Yes. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I was very happy. 

 Q.  A little surprised maybe? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  A little surprised because my coach asked the Federation for me.  He didn't tell me what's happen.  For me it was a big surprise.  I was very, very happy. 

 Q.  Could you tell us, because Surbiton and Queen's you were going back and forth to play, what was that like? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, yeah, I played my first match on Saturday, I play my first match at the Queen's.  After I took the car for go to Surbiton.  After my match at Surbiton I came back to Queen's for playing my second round of qualification.  The same thing the day after.  It was tough, but I make it. 

 Q.  You've had some injuries. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Can you tell us what those injuries have been and how long you've been out, how you recovered? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  It was for about two years, but I played a bit, like six tournaments per year.  I played very good these two years, but it's not enough.  Only six tournaments, I can't get up in the rankings.  It was my back and my shoulders. 

 Q.  You're perfectly okay now? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah (smiling). 

 Q.  You showed at Queen's when you beat Hewitt you're capable of beating the world's top players on grass.  Against Henman, you'll be confident of the same outcome in that game? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah, I'm confident because I make it three years ago, I beat Moya.  He was fourth in the world.  I'm very confident because I know my game, I can play against some guys like this.  I'm very confident, yeah. 

 Q.  Are you in the best form of your life, would you say, at the moment? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  No, maybe not.  But, you know, I just want play and be healthy.  I will see what's happen. 

 Q.  When you saw the draw, you must have thought you may well get some British opposition because you could have Murray. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Have you been prepared since the draw was made thinking you may have to play against the local favorite? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA:  I played him lot of time, and also in England, and I beat him.  For me it's the same thing.  If I play with lot of people or two people, it's the same thing for me.  Maybe I prefer when there is lot of people.  Also if it's against me, it's no problem.
