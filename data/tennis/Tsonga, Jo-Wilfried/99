 J. TSONGA/J. Melzer
      6‑2, 6‑3, 6‑4 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.   
   
 Q.   How did it go?   Did you feel okay out there?   
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I felt good.   The weather was not enjoyable, but it was a good moment for me because I won.   I'm really happy to go through this round.   I will have the chance to play a third round here for maybe the fifth time.   So it's good.  
   
 Q.   The weather hasn't been brilliant for the past couple of days.   What difference does that make on the court to you?   Does it affect your mind or does it affect the way you play?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, the weather, yes, a little bit, because the surface, you know, has become different.   The game is slower.   It's not ‑‑your muscles are tight.   And, yeah, that's it.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   The conditions weren't very good.   It was chilly, it was raining.   But was that the match you needed to feel you are really in the tournament now so that you're more confident for the next round?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, not really.   I mean, it was a very good match, clearly.   I know I can do even better.   
    In the third set I had a bit of a slump ‑‑not really a slump, because he played well, but I maybe could have finished earlier.  
    There is always something one can improve.   I hope that in the next round I'll be able to deliver a performance as good as this one or even better.  
   
 Q.   If you compare with last year, two first rounds in three sets, are you feeling the same or is there something you can improve in your game?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I'm feeling like last year.   Last year I had not set myself any objectives.   I simply tried to take the rounds as they came.   I'm going to do the same this year, and I just hope it's going to work out and take me as far into the tournament.  
   
 Q.   What score would you give to your serve on this match?   I thought your serve was good or even very good.   I believe you saved three break balls with an ace.   So, you know, a score out of 20, like kids in school?   
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, it was good.   My serve was good.   When I serve like this, I mean, it's not always the case, 210 kilometers per hour, a good percentage, 65 in the first, 73 in the second, 71, which is a good percentage.   No, I served well.  
    Maybe 17 out of 20 because I had to save a few break balls.   
   
 Q.   Considering the conditions, especially, it didn't help.   
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Of course it didn't help.   I mean, the speed of the serve depends on that.   There is a lot of wind, as well.   So, yes, I had a good performance regarding my serves today.  
   
 Q.   Next round Janowicz is your opponent, if I'm not mistaken.   Is he one of the most difficult players on the tour because of the way he plays?   Because of his behavior?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, Jerzy is a difficult player.   You never know exactly what to expect on court.   
    I'm not really talking about his behavior but rather his game.   He's rather unpredictable.   He's very tall, he strikes hard.   He can have a very high first ball, first‑serve percentage, striking really hard.  
    So you have to find a way to neutralize him, and it's not always that easy.   If we compare with Raonic, let's say, how can I phrase this, it's a bit more unpredictable.   Raonic has some basics in his game.   Obviously he has a very good serve with a kick, and then he takes time to move around on the second shot.   He takes balls on the forehand.   
    Whereas Jerzy will go up on anything; forehand, backhand.   He will play dropshots.   Whereas Raonic, well, it's like more structured.  
   
 Q.   You were slightly below your game level in the last few weeks, but now in Roland Garros it seems like everything is clicking into place.   Why is everything clicking into place?   Are you more motivated?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No.   
    Honestly?   It's the conditions.   It's the conditions.   They're different.   We play on clay in Rome and Madrid, but there it slides.   It slides a lot in Rome and Madrid.   And I can't stay on my two feet (laughter).  
    It really is an issue for me.   I can't lie.   It is an issue.   Whereas here in Roland Garros, the clay is different.   It's not so difficult for me.   
    In Monte‑Carlo the clay is different.   The clay in Monte‑Carlo is more similar to the one in Roland Garros, and that is probably the reason why players who win in Monte‑Carlo or rather players who play well in Monte‑Carlo usually very often they play well in Roland Garros, as well.  
    And I believe this is due to the conditions which are rather similar in Monte‑Carlo and in Roland Garros.  
   
 Q.   The three‑sets format, is that reassuring?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes, of course.   Best of three sets ‑‑well, three winning sets is something that you can expect.   You can be more relaxed.   
    Yes, three winning sets, it's obviously a format that I like, because I can use my fitness to my advantage, and the fact that I control the game is always, for me, a way to make my opponent run around the court.   And I end up wearing him out.  
    I do like Grand Slam tournaments.  
   
 Q.   Away from tennis, soccer, yesterday the French national team won.   There is renewed enthusiasm around the French soccer team.   Do you follow them?   Are you confident for the World Cup for the French team?  
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yes, I do follow them, but I'm not an expert.   I'm not going to say anything really bright regarding the French soccer team.   They are athletes, just as I am.   And there is one thing I'm sure is that they do their best.  
    I suppose I hope they will do even better than the other teams.   
   
 Q.   I was not on the central court.   It was the Kids' Day today, and did they sing, "Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, OlÃ©," and when you hear that as a player, is it unnerving or you don't notice?   
    JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Well, sometimes I will go "OlÃ©" with the kids.   I don't mind.   I like it.  
    When you're a kid and you come to Roland Garros, you have to do it.   It's compulsory.   Somebody must be brave enough to get it going, and usually the one who is brave enough will be appreciated by the others.
