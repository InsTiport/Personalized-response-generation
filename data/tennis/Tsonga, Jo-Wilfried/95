J. TSONGA/J. Melzer
  6/1, 3/6, 3/6, 6/2, 6/4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How was that today and how far do you think you can go?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   It was quick.   I played only four points. 
But was not easy to come back after yesterday night.   I played a good four points and finally I won.   It's good.   And tomorrow I have a new match. 

Q.   What are your thoughts about the years of domination by those four guys and what it will take to break that? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, what to say?   They play good.   They're just too good for the moment.   All four, they keep the major in their hands, and it's tough to deal with it because we practice the same time as them, we do the same job, but we don't have the ‑ how you say that ‑ same reward as them. 
So, of course, it's frustrating.   But, anyway, we continue to fight because we like it and we dream about it.   I think the most important is to dream about it, to have the chance once to get that. 

Q.   How close do you think it is to ending that domination?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know.   I don't know. 
You know, the only thing I know, all the players behind them trying to break it.
