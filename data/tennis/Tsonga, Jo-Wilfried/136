 J. TSONGA/M. Baghdatis
  6‑2, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk us through the match.   Looked pretty straightforward.   Secondly, you must feel pretty confident about getting to the London for the end‑of‑the‑year tournament.  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, for moment I think about this tournament.   You know, I try to play my best tennis.   After, of course for me London is a goal.   But I also have another goal:   it's to win some tournament and try to beat the guy before me.   
So I try to keep focused on the game and not on the competition, you know, in four weeks.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the way you're playing since the US Open.   Are you feeling like you're reaching your top level at the moment or have you got a way to go?   
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I feel like I play really good level.   I played great, you know.   
I think I improve a bit my game these last couple of months.   You know, I work a lot.   You know, it's only now I start to play well, so I hope I will continue to play like this.   
Anyway, I'm happy with my game.
