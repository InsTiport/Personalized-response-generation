J. TSONGA/R. Bautista Agut
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

Q. Do you remember starting off this tournament as greatly, without problems, quietly? 
JO‑WILFRED TSONGA: Well, first thing, I don't remember everything. Well, no, not really. I don't remember that kind of thing. No, I don't think I did. 
It went well, but at any time during the match I was thinking, you know, something might happen, I should be careful. I wanted to do well, I wanted to keep focused and not give away anything along the way. And this, I did well. 
I didn't want to get caught in a very long match. It was too dangerous. I was really cautious until the end.

Q. The match, as you say, didn't last long. But did you have time to appreciate the welcome the crowd gave you and the atmosphere here?
JO‑WILFRED TSONGA: Well, yes, of course, like every time I come here, things are great, the crowd is great with me. Honestly since the beginning of my career, every time I step onto that court, it's so good. It's even sometimes disrespectful for my opponents. But I enjoy it, of course.
