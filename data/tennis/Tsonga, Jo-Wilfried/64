J. TSONGA/R. Bautista Agut
  5‑7, 7‑6, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR: Questions in English. 

Q. A lot of the top players are playing in the doubles as well. What are the reasons you play in the doubles at this tournament? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: The reason is I didn't play for a long time on hard court. You know, I need some rhythm on the surface. That's why I'm playing doubles with Gaël this week. 
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please. 

Q. A very long match. A very difficult match. How were you able to turn it around? 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: It was a very intense match with a very high level for the three sets. It was very difficult. 
I was able to win that match because I was tough mentally. I was able to react. It was difficult because I served for the set and I missed it. But I struggled and fought until the end. I'm very happy I was able to put it away tonight. 

Q. Weren't you afraid you might lose focus maybe because of the frustration because he never gave anything away?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, he gave me nothing. Unfortunately I gave some points away in the first set which might have changed things because then he became more confident. He started playing better. So I was frustrated that I wasn't able to finish off that set. 
I lost that set, and after I was behind. But when I was able to take control again, I never let go. So for me it was a very high‑level match, a very good match, and I'm very pleased with the way I played.
