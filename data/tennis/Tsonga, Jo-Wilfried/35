J. TSONGA/J. Sock
6-3, 6-3, 6-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You two have a very similar style.  You both have strong serves and strong forehands.  You both avoid the backhand a little bit.  Do you see yourself as a similar player to Jack in that way?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, we are a little bit different.  He's playing with a spin.  I used to be a little bit more flat.  And, yeah, we use our serve a little bit differently.  He's doing a lot of kick serve.
Yeah, so we are a little bit different.
Q. But the forehand...
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: (Smiling.)
Q. We obviously don't know what will happen tonight.  If you ended up facing Novak again, certainly he's had his challenges here physically.  What do you see the biggest challenge for you and your game at this stage facing him?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: For me it's to always play the right shot, don't give him too much free point.  Yeah, that's the most important for me.  Anyway, I will play my game.  I will be aggressive, as always.
But, yeah, the most important for me is stay focused on what I have to do and play the right shot.
Q. At this stage of the tournament, heading into the second week, who would you name to be the favorite?
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: To be honest, I don't know.  You have few guys who are able to do something great.  For sure Andy and Novak won a lot before, so they are I think the favorite.
But we are all outsider and we all want a Grand Slam, and that's it.
