THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   In the second set there, your first service game, you had a point which included just about everything, and yet he still won it.   Did that sort of take some steam out of your game?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   (Through translation.)   No.   I mean, you know, I'm not disappointed about this point, you know.   More about my feelings today and the whole match, you know.   I did a lot of mistake.   Was tough for me to keep the ball in the court.   Not because he put me a lot of pressure.   
I don't know.   Just because it was ‑‑I don't know.   I don't know how to explain that, but it was a day for me without sensation.   Everything I tried to do, I missed it, and not about a point like this.   In the match you have many, many points.   
   
 Q.   Could you talk about some of the positives you take away from this tournament?   I know today was obviously disappointing, but you obviously won some matches, too.   What are some of the positives you take away?  
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Positive things it's I won some good matches.   It was the first time for me here in quarterfinals, so it's always good, you know, to have a better result here.   I mean, then what is positive?   (Smiling.)  
I just practice a lot and played a lot, and it's always good, because the more you play, the more you improve your game.
