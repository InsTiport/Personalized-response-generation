  THE MODERATOR:   As you know, Jo has received a walkover.   He will actually go on court in about 15 minutes.   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just your reaction to Federer pulling out and his back injury, your thoughts. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   You know, it's really sad.   It was good for me, you know, to play against him to see how is my level, how I feel, you know, at the beginning of the season against a guy like this.
So I'm sad that‑‑ I'm sad for him, I'm sad because I will not play, and I'm sad also for the tournament because it's all the time difficult when you have two good semis like this, you know, to have one cancel.

Q.   Who are you thinking you're going to meet in the final?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Oh, I don't know.   I think it's going to be very open, because I think GaÃ«l is in good shape, and Rafa, you know, is coming back.   He want to play better than the end of last year, I think.   So it's going to be very open today. 

Q.   What are all the feelings you have about this situation, Jo?   I imagine some disappointment and maybe some empathy for Roger.   Also, is it an advantage or a disadvantage to have no match?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I don't know if it's an advantage or a disadvantage, because anyway, you know, I want to play.   I want to play.   I need some time on the court to feel better for next week, also. 
Yeah, that's it.   So I have a lot of empathy for Roger, but, yeah, also for the tournament and for me.   You know, it's not very good, you know, to stop today, but it's like this. 

Q.   After last night's match where you came off, you're feeling very good, you're kind of excited, it must be a real letdown to come and find out, oh, jeez, now I can't go on, like the momentum that you had from last night suddenly gets slowed down a bit, I guess.   And also, where did you find out about this news?   Where were you?   Were you already walking to the court, or where were you?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   No, I was in the car to come here this afternoon for the match, just one hour before the match, and they told me that. 
But, you know, anyway, I think it's not a disadvantage to don't play today, because tomorrow it's going to be also a tough match.   So anyway, I will play another match, and that's good.
