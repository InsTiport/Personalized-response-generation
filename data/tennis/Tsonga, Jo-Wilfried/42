  6‑1, 6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. You must be very happy about winning so quickly, after waiting all that time to get on court. As soon as you got off, it started to rain again. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, especially because now today I'm waiting for my match. So, yeah, I'm really happy the way it goes today because it's better to go back home tonight than stay here. 
Yeah, hope it's going to be something good for me for the rest of the tournament. 

Q. You played very impressively. You must be very happy with how you played. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, today I played pretty good tennis. It was a lot better than my first round, so I'm really happy. Hope I will continue in this way. 

Q. Why do you think you can play so well against him on any surface? You beat him on hard and clay also. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. Maybe because my game fit perfectly with his game. Yeah, I don't know what to say. 

Q. Can you speak briefly about what you like about grass that most French players don't. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Well, I like, I will say, the rallies are short. I don't know. I like many things. 

Q. You like Wimbledon, though, don't you? Two semifinals. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. But I played also semifinal in other tournament. For me, I will not say it's my best surface because I played well also on hard and clay and other surface. So for me, it's still tennis. 
Anyway, I'm really happy when I play good tennis.
