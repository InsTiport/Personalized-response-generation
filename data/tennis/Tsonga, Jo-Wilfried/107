J. TSONGA/G. Simon
  7‑6, 6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That must have been bittersweet for you to play a fellow Frenchman.   One of you has to go out of the tournament. 
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, exactly.   I mean, it's good for me because today I won.   Maybe not for him, of course. 
But, yeah, it's sweet. 

Q.   Your next opponent is Roger Federer.   Do you feel like this might be your best chance to beat Roger in a Grand Slam?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   I already did twice in the past.   So, you know, for me it's the possibility to take revenge because last year I lost against him here in quarterfinal. 
It's a good opportunity for me to play him again.   And, you know, it's always nice to play against such a good player.   Yeah, anyway, the tournament continue for me and I'm feeling good. 

Q.   Do you feel with each game you're improving?
JO‑WILFRIED TSONGA:   Yeah, I think I did a better performance.   Anyway, it was a good match, a full match.   Maybe at the beginning I was a bit tight, but after that I played great. 
Yeah, I will continue to get up my level.
