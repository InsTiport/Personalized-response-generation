R. STEPANEK/J. Tsonga
  6-2, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. He's always a difficult player to play against. Seemed like you kind of ran out of steam a bit towards the end of the match. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Sorry, can you repeat? 

 Q. I'm saying you kind of ran out of energy perhaps a bit at the end of the match after a tough week you had. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Not at the end of the match, also at the beginning. It was difficult for me today, because I played doubles last night and I didn't recover enough, you know, to play today.
 So I tried, but it was tough.

 Q. You must feel you have had enough grass court preparation for Wimbledon, though?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. I've played a lot of matches. That was my goal for this preparation. Today, you know, I'm just tired, but I'm sure I will recover enough to play Wimbledon and to be ready.
