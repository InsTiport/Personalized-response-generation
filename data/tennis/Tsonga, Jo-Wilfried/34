N. DJOKOVIC/J. Tsonga   
6-3, 6-2, (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Why did you make the decision to retire after the second set?  
JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Just because I have a pain on my left knee.  It's something I had already in the past, so I know exactly what's happen.   
So, yeah, I knew it was over for me straightaway, because when I have my knee, of course, it's already tough to play against one of the best tennis player.   
But when I don't have my knee, I have no chance to come back from two sets to love.  So for me, it's important to save what I can save.  And that's it.
