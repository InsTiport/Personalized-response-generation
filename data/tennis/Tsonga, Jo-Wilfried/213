  6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You must feel pretty pleased, it seemed, to be at the end of the match, even though you seemed a bit up and down. You got through it pretty well. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I'm pleased I didn't play a fifth set. And, yeah, it was good for me to win in four sets, because I save a bit of energy. It's good. 

 Q. Do you feel as if this is a tournament in which you can go all the way or at least be very dangerous?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think I will be dangerous. Now it's a new tournament begin, you know, and it's gonna be the second week. Yeah, it's gonna be different. I know I have my chance, and I will try to take it. 

 Q. Against Tommy Haas, what do you think made the difference in the end?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. Maybe I was a bit better physically than him. I think it was the difference. 

 Q. How happy have you been with your game throughout the first week? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm happy, because I don't play my best tennis and I win. It's good. 

 Q. So you've got room for improvement then? It can only go up.
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.

 Q. What about your memories of two years ago here and the great run you had? Does that help a bit when you come back here?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, of course, because I know I can go all the way. Yeah, it give me confident, and I like to be here. (Smiling.)

 Q. What do you need to do to play your best tennis in the second week? You said you haven't played your best tennis.
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I don't know. Maybe the best opponent. I don't know. 

 Q. Some players get intimidated when they walk on to center court and there's 15,000 people there. You seem to really enjoy being out there in front of the crowd and putting on a show for the crowd. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, of course. Of course. I like tennis like this. I like, you know, watch tennis like this. You know, it's better to play in front of, you know, 10,000 people than two people that, I don't know, somewhere in the bush. 
 So of course it's good for me. I enjoy, you know, every moment, every match, every point I play on this court.

 Q. What about your next opponent, Almagro. Tell us how you need to play against him. 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I know he's a dangerous player. A bit the same profile as Tommy Haas. Maybe he put more spin on his ball, but he's really dangerous. He can hit the ball very hard from everywhere on the court, you know, and it's a good player.
