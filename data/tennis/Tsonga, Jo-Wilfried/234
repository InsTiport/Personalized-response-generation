  Q. How is your back feeling?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: A little bit pain. A little bit stiff.  
 I will see for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Did you consider pulling out?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, no, no. Not for the moment.  
  
  Q. So it's not a concern for the Australian Open? Is the injury a concern for you leading into the Open?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No. It's all right. You know, it's a little bit stiff like sometimes, and I have to do -- to play with it, so that's it.  
  
  Q. How do you find the conditions out there?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: The condition? Perfect.

  Q. You don't mind the heat?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, I don't mind. That's all right.  
  
  Q. Why do you enjoy the heat or like the heat, playing in the heat?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: For me, the ball go faster and I can serve faster. I can hit the ball faster, so for me it's okay.  
  
  Q. Your serve was very good today, yes? 87%.  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Is that as good as you hope it to be next week?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Of course, uh-huh.  
  
  Q. Is that as good as it is ever?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, every day is different. Sometimes you can serve very well and sometimes it's more difficult. Depend also of the guy who return your serve.
