   THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Looked like your back wasn't giving you any troubles today.   
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: No, that's all right. I played without pain. So it was a nice match. That's it.  
  
  Q. You're fully recovered? You feel fine?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I feel okay.   
  
  Q. When you come back here playing this match, do you get the same feelings you got last year?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, exactly the same feeling, yeah. It's really a good feeling to be on this court, and I play all the time well on this court.   
 I hope I will continue like that.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like your run to the final last year was sort of like a breakthrough for French tennis - it made all the players think if he can do it, I can do it?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, maybe. Maybe. Since this moment, all the French players played better. So, yeah, maybe.   
  
  Q. How did you play today?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I played well tennis. I'm happy of that.   
  
  Q. Must be happy with your start to the second and third sets?  
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yes, and also the first one (laughter). Because I play a good tennis, but he was better than me on the two first game. I continue on the same way and I come back. I was playing better than him after, so...
