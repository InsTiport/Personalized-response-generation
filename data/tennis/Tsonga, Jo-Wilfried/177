J. TSONGA/Z. Zhang
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. It's not a surprise that you beat Ze Zhang, but would you like to say something more about this match?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: What can I say? Of course on the paper I was better than him; but on the court it's all the time different. It was not easy today, and I'm happy to win, of course, even if I was supposed to win. 

 Q. Your opponent said the biggest difference between you and him is the serve and the return of serve. Do you think so? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: Yeah, I think when you reach the top 100 you can see the difference with the serve and with the returns. 
 Yeah, I think the best difference between each player, it's really the serve and the returns. 

 Q. Is Yao Ming the tallest guy you have ever met? 
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: For sure. (Smiling.) The guy, Yao was really big just in front of me. Was impressive. 

 Q. I'm just wondering, where do you stand on the controversy about the ATP schedule at the moment? Andy Murray of course has came out talking about how it's too full. What do you think?
 JO-WILFRIED TSONGA: I'm stand here. (Smiling.) You know, I'm agree we play a lot, and maybe we can do better and have a better schedule. But it's not easy, and I think we need find the solution all together. 
 Anyway, of course best player will lead this movement, but they need to take in consideration every player. Yeah, that's it.
