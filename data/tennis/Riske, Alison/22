M. KEYS/A. Riske
4-6, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Where did you think the match kind of turned a little bit on you?
ALISON RISKE: It's 2:00 a.m.  Maybe that has something to do with it.
She played very well.  I did the best I could.  Yeah.
Q. It was the latest finish ever for a women's match here.  Do you think being in that sort of unfamiliar territory of playing after 1:00 a.m. was tough for you?
ALISON RISKE: No.  I thought I had a high level out there, I really did.  I was just joking about the fact that it was 2:00 a.m.
I didn't feel like it was, you know, anything different than what I'm used to.  You know, no, it didn't feel different.
Q. Are you a night person?
ALISON RISKE: No.
Q. When you went out there, you really took it to her and played a good, aggressive style.  When is the last time you remember being consistent and hitting the ball that consistently that deep in a match like this?
ALISON RISKE: Two weeks ago at Cincinnati when I was playing against Kuznetsova.  I feel like I've been bringing this level pretty consistently, and I think it's only a matter of time before things start turning my way.
Q. When you're out on a night session on Ashe, is that most dominant for you, or that you're playing a friend of yours?
ALISON RISKE: Neither.  I played on Ashe before, so I've had a couple matches under my belt.  Tonight I felt the most comfortable I have, so I feel it's a step in the right direction.
Madison obviously is an unreal player.  She was able to pick it up in the end.  That's why she won the match.
Q. Did you actually notice what time it was?
ALISON RISKE: No, no.  I had no idea.  I had no idea.
