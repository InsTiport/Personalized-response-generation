ITF:  questions, please. 


Q.  What does it feel like?  What does it mean to you?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  It means that I'm the best here.  But it's only here.  I don't know what will be.  But here, I'm the best.

Q.  Your ranking now with the win, win or lose, you would have been No.  1.  You're No.  1 in the ITF ranking. 

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yes, but I won yesterday.  If I wouldn't won yesterday, I will not be, I won't be the No.  1.  I won yesterday, so I'm No.  1. 

Q.  You've done very well at the French and Wimbledon, as well.  Which was the tournament where you felt you were really making progress, breaking through?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Here.

Q.  This one?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yes.

Q.  Why?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  I don't know why.  I thought that I will win, so.

Q.  You say clay is your favorite surface. 

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  No, it's not true. 

Q.  It says in the notes. 

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  It's not true.

Q.  You won on grass and hard court. 

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  My best, it's hard, then I like grass.  I don't like clay because it's too slow for me.

Q.  Can you talk about where you're from?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  I live near Moscow in Obninsk.  It's a little city.  It's better than Moscow, I think.  I've got everything I need.  I'm only one in the city.  They give me time to practice, everything.

Q.  How little is it?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  It's 100,000.

Q.  Can you tell me how you started playing?

Q.  When do you remember starting?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  At three, I start.  I start to play tournaments at six.

Q.  Your mother is your coach now?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yeah, my father and my mother, both. 

Q.  Do you have a nickname?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  No, I don't have.

Q.  Is Lina the full name?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yes.  But here, the people gave me one name.  It's Skaia.  I don't know why.  My surname is so big, they make it short.

Q.  Who calls you Sky?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  The guys who call us downstairs.

Q.  In the first set, you served for that, did very well.  The second set, you were up 3-Love.  When did you start thinking you could win it?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Every time.  When it was 3-2, I thought I will win.  In a game, usually two or three games you go down, then up. 

Q.  Do you think she was a little nervous?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  I don't know.

Q.  When she came back to 3-2 and 15-40 on your serve, were you worried?

Q.  What made you say that?  Was there any one thing?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yes.  It was last year I played with Clijsters and Dokic.  Now they are in Tour, so I can be in the Tour, too, and I will be.

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Yeah.

Q.  How did you do against those two players?

LINA KRASNOROUTSKAIA:  Clijsters, I beat her last time in Roland Garros.  Dokic, I played only one time with her, last year at Roland Garros, too, and she beat me.
