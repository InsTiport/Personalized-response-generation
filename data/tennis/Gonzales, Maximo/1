THE MODERATOR: Okay, we will start with some questions in English and then Spanish. Any questions in English?
Q. My question is to Diego. Can you tell us how you guys are feeling? And how exciting is it to be against Chile here in Madrid?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Well, I think we are ready to start. Many days practicing already, one week, we arrived one week ago. So we are ready to start our matches and we are happy to be here. It's a great place. Everything is working good.
So we just want to start tomorrow against Chile. It's going to be a really tough match. We know each other a lot. And I think it's going to really be tough because they have a very good singles. I don't know who is going to play the doubles.
But it's going to be close, tight. I'm happy to start. So it's good for all of us.
(Questions in Spanish.)
