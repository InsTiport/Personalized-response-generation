Q.  Are you proud of your performance, and were you surprised on how hard you pushed? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) Yes, I am proud because I played a great match.  I knew that it was going to be very difficult against him because he has a big serve.  But I was able to break him and also like in the fifth set I had the chance to break him back and he played an incredible point at one stage.  So, yes, I'm very happy with the way I played. 

Q.  Do you think maybe the rain break was a good or bad thing for him? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) I don't think that today's interruption for rain affected the match.  It was more like last night when they stopped for darkness. 

Q.  You hold five sets to Karlovic, now you hold on for five sets to Roddick.  Did you know you were that good?  Those are two of the biggest servers there are. 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) Yes, I have a great return of serve, but also I have a very good serve.  Karlovic served like 51 aces, and I had 31.  So, yes, I think I have both:  a good return and a good serve. 

Q.  When Roddick changed tactics and began to serve and volley, come in more, did it surprise you?  Did it throw you off your game just a little bit? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) No, I wasn't surprised because I knew that he had to change something because when he was playing from the baseline, trying to put pressure on me from the baseline, he wasn't winning the points.  So I know he had to attack more.  That's what he did to turn the match around. 

Q.  Do you think he got some advice during the delay from his coach that caused that change in tactics? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) Yeah.  If he has a good coach, I think that's what he got told to do. 

Q.  There was a point where he broke you at the end in the sixth game when you hit a very good dropshot.  He got it for the point.  Were you startled that he was that quick?  Did you think you had won the point? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (In English.)  The first point of the game, no?  He played well, but... (Translated from Italian.)  He played well that point, but I was sleeping a little bit.

Q.  Do you know what costata fiorentina is? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) My father is a butcher. 

Q.  When the rain hit yesterday. 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (In English.)  No rain. 

Q.  Darkness.  Roddick immediately goes to pack his bag, you wanted to play on. 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (In English.)  Yes. 

Q.  Were you angry with Andy? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (Translated from Italian.) I was a bit angry because, you know, when they stopped the match, like it was 10 to 9 last night, and I was asking why because it was earlier the other days.  And Andy said something, you know, with the "F" word, so I was angry with that basically. 

Q.  He said the "F" word to you? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (In English.)  I don't understand very well.  I don't know if it was for me. 

Q.  If not you, who? 

DANIELE BRACCIALI:  (In English.)  The umpire maybe.
