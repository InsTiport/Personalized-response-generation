 Q. You worked hard there. 
 
 PATRICK RAFTER: Yeah, I do whatever it takes to win. You know, obviously it is nice to
be an easy match, but when you are playing someone as good as Todd, you are not going to
get that. 
 
Q. Did you expect him to return that well?
 
 PATRICK RAFTER: Yeah, I know how Todd plays and, you know, and I know every time I play
him, I am under pressure every time I serve, so, I know I have to serve very well. In the
first set and a half, I didn't really serve that great. From then on, I just -- everything
just came together. I hardly missed a serve. 
 
Q. Three weeks ago in Munich you said you have no chance to become No. 1 already yet
this year because Pete is so strong. Now he has lost very early. Many points are away. Do
you see a new chance? Perhaps you win here; you are No. 2?
 
 PATRICK RAFTER: That is what I have heard too. It is a long way to go and I have got to
win two more very, very tough matches. So, I mean, it is still a long, long way away for
me at this stage. For me just to get close to No. 2, it is a pretty exciting prospect.
