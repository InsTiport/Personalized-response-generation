   THE MODERATOR: We have Pat Rafter and Samantha Stosur. 

 Q. Pat, obviously this is pretty close to home for you. What did it mean for you today to play in this match? 
 PAT RAFTER: For me it was just great to see the support that it gets and the recognition. These guys, everyone's out there, the guys and the girls, supporting it. 
 I don't know, for me it's a big thrill to see everyone out there supporting it, understanding the enormity of what's going on not just in Brisbane but in the whole of Queensland. Now we're seeing it down here, northern New South Wales. It's just nice to see that support. 

 Q. Sam, with all the pressure and expectation, I guess a nice reminder that tennis isn't the most important thing in the world at the moment? 
 SAMANTHA STOSUR: Absolutely. We're lucky to do what we do. We love what we do. But there's far greater things going on in the world. So if we can all come together and support something like these floods, I think it's great. 
 For all of us, for a couple of hours the day before a Grand Slam, to go out there and have some fun, try and raise as much money as we can, I think it shows the spirit of the tennis world. Everyone cares about everyone, whether you're involved in tennis or not.
