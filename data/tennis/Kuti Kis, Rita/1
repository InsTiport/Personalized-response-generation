Q.  How does this win compare to other wins in your career?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, you know, my best success in my career.  Because I've won against Jennifer Capriati, who won the Australian Open and in this year she played very well.  I played against her last year in Strasbourg.  I won there also but this match was much more better because she play very well now, and I am so happy now.

RITA KUTI KIS: Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  I am  -- yes, I feel myself is very strong.  Yeah, technically, yeah, because I played very good in the baseline.  I hit in the end a lot of winner and it was very important for me. 


Q.  Did you change anything in your training or practice like mentally, or something like that in the last period?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, you know I have a new coach now.  Yeah, and it's very good for me.  And if we make a lot of physical preparation, I hope I can up in the ranking. 


Q.  In your game?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, in my game also. 


Q.  Do you think you have to do it more technically, physically or mentally, too? Both sides of the game?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, both.  But the most important is the physical, yeah.  Uh-huh. 


Q.  Does it allow you new hopes for the French Open?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah.  You know, tonight is a very good feeling for me.  I have motivation also.  Here last year I won two matches in the French Open.  I would like more, more than.

RITA KUTI KIS: I would like to go to the third round now.  (Laughing.)


Q.  Can I ask you the name of your new coach?

RITA KUTI KIS: Thomas Bogyo.  He's from Hungary also. 


Q.  How does your game suit Jennifer's game? It seems like your game, you have in a lot of ways a very perfect sort of style to play her.  You don't mind the rhythm, you don't mind the speed.  You seem like you have the perfect style to play Jennifer. 

RITA KUTI KIS: Sorry, can you help me?


Q.  Yes, you seem to have a good style when you play Jennifer.  Your technique, approach, your game is well suited to play her. 

RITA KUTI KIS: Sorry. 


Q.  Your game, when Jennifer plays, she has a lot of pace.  She hits the ball very hard. 

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, yeah. 


Q.  It seems like your game with your shots is very well suited. 

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, you know, I think Jennifer and I play the same games, I think.  Because she hit also the ball, me too.  But, you know, in the end of the matches, I didn't make too much mistake, you know.  And I hit a lot of winner in the end and, you know, I was mentally very, very strong.  I can suggest this. 


Q.  What about your next game?

RITA KUTI KIS: Against Jelena Dokic?


Q.  Yeah, yes. 

RITA KUTI KIS: I played against her in last year.  I won against her in Australian Open.  You know, I would like to play also the same today.  I hope so I can win again, but I would like to play my best form. 


Q.  According to you, which is a favorite player for the French Open?

RITA KUTI KIS: The favorite player? Now? Martina Hingis.  She's the best. 


Q.  What do you think about Amelie Mauresmo?

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, sorry.  Lot of player, you never know who win Roland Garros.  But I think Martina Hingis, she's the best. 


Q.  Why is she the best? She hasn't won Roland Garros yet.

RITA KUTI KIS: Yeah, she never won.  Because she has  -- she also very hard mentally, you know.  But last year and before, you know, I  -- she lost because she didn't was so hard mentally against Steffi Graf.  But she know everything for tennis I think.  She very good in hardcourt, on grass, on clay and she's a top player here. 


Q.  Do you think it will be tougher for you psychologically to play against Dokic here or not?

RITA KUTI KIS: I am same here, the same of today.  Yeah.  It was a little bit  -- little problem you know last year, what was said. 


Q.  That's why I asked you.
