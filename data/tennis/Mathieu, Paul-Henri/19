  Q.  How was your game before you became sick?   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  I played only twice between Sunday and here.  Nothing has changed in my game since Sunday.   
  
  Q.  This gastroenteritis and this loss, are they bad timing?  We are only in the beginning of the season.   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  It's not easy after the Davis Cup.  I had no rest after that tie.  Two days and a half after I was on clay already, and then here.   
 This is not the best preparation, because I'm playing the quallies in Rome and Hamburg.  It's a handicap, but I'm going try to do well in Estoril (I'll be in Casablanca before) even if it means I won't go to Rome.
