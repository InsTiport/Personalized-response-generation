Q. You had good chances in the second set. Towards the end, you had good momentum. Do you have the impression that you let it go? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Mainly I played a bad first set. I started off bad. We didn't know when we were going to play. I ate my plate of pasta just before I went on the court; it is not ideal. I had trouble finding my rhythm. During the second set, when we started playing again, I missed two opportunities that I should not have missed.  
 
Q. How is Coria playing on clay? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: He sends back everything. He waits until he's able to counterattack, and he moves very well.  
 
Q. You missed some volleys. 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, especially when I had a chance to go 4-1. But I also won points with my volley. When you go up to the net, you have to accept that there might be some mistakes.  
 
Q. Are you disappointed, frustrated? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I am frustrated. It's the type of match you should win if you want to be at a higher level. It's a pity because thanks to the wildcard, I was directly in the main draw without playing the quallies. For the next two tournaments I will have to play the quallies.  
 
Q. What did you lack during that match? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I should have been more consistent. I wanted to do too well; therefore, I was tense, and that made the difference.  
 
Q. How did you manage the rain delay? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: It was difficult because we didn't know when we were going to resume play. We were waiting.  
 
Q. When you came back on the court, you seemed to be fitter than Coria. 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: No, I felt already better at the end of the first set.  
 
Q. Were you upset that play stopped? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, I believe we could have finished a game, an extra game.
