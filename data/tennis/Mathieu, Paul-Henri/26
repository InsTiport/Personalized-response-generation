Paul-Henri Mathieu
START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT








PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Mainly I played a bad first set. I started off bad. We didn't know when we were going to play. I ate my plate of pasta just before I went on the court; it is not ideal. I had trouble finding my rhythm. During the second set, when we started playing again, I missed two opportunities that I should not have missed. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: He sends back everything. He waits until he's able to counterattack, and he moves very well. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, especially when I had a chance to go 4-1. But I also won points with my volley. When you go up to the net, you have to accept that there might be some mistakes. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I am frustrated. It's the type of match you should win if you want to be at a higher level. It's a pity because thanks to the wildcard, I was directly in the main draw without playing the quallies. For the next two tournaments I will have to play the quallies. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I should have been more consistent. I wanted to do too well; therefore, I was tense, and that made the difference. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: It was difficult because we didn't know when we were going to resume play. We were waiting. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: No, I felt already better at the end of the first set. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, I believe we could have finished a game, an extra game.
