   THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English.   
  
  Q.  Mixed emotions after playing a great player so well for so long?  One respect that you played at a high level, but obviously disappointed?   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed, but I play -- I think I play a good match.  He fight good till the end.  I had a couple of chances in the second set, and I didn't take them.  But, then it was tougher.   
 But it's not easy to play against him, because he plays very, very high.  So you have to be 100% all the time.   
 So, no, he deserves to win.   
  
  Q.  Hard to play a long match over your shoulder all the time?   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  Yeah, he's very hard to play because the ball is really high.  So when you play for two, two hours and a half, under your shoulder - I mean over your shoulder - it's very tough.  I mean, it's not easy.   
  
  Q.  That's another thing?   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  What did you do in the first set that you didn't do in the second and the third?   
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU:  I didn't win (laughter).   
 No.  Like I said, I mean, I was -- I mean, I think I play better in the first set.  Then physically I felt maybe a little bit -- I felt better in the first set.  That's why I didn't win the second set, I think.   
 But it's not easy because he played the level very, very high all the time, so you have to be 100% all the time.  And this is very tough against him.
