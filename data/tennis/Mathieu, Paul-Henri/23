PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: The score is very tough, I think. I play a very good match, I mean, I think the best of the week. No, I mean, I play great first set. I won 6-1. The second set, at 3-1 I had a chance to break him for the second time. I didn't took it. He start to play better. But I was serving good, so it was okay. Even if the score is easy, it wasn't that easy. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I don't know. I mean, we are a lot around 100, 110, 120 in the world. Now they're coming up. We try to come in the top 50. Gasquet play well before the French Open. So we start to playing good. I don't know why. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: In every tournament, you want to win some matches. I'm happy to win three matches in a row. I hope I can win again tomorrow. Every tournaments are different. You always want to win. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Beck is very solid, I think. But Davydenko is very tough. He played very good, it seem, this year. He is in the top 10, so he is very tough. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I mean, I play a great match, too, against Roddick. I think today, no, I mean, today was another great match. I was feeling better on the court. Before I play Roddick, I didn't win so many matches. Today I won two already. So I had little bit more confidence. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I don't know. I will tell you tonight when I go out for dinner (smiling). I don't know. I mean, you get used to it. It's kind of nice. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes. I mean, sometime we say I'm a clay court player. But, no, I like to play on these courts. I like to play when it's fast. I won two tournaments indoors. No, I like it. It's true, is fast. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I played a super match against Roddick. I didn't say I played that much better today. But I think on the important points, I was strong. I played a wonderful first set. I think he played well also. They were close points, but every time I was the one who won the point. I played with a lot of confidence. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I don't know why because if I knew why, I'd win all the time. But it had to happen one day because of all the work I put into it. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I think since the beginning of this week, I've been serving very well. I knew that when I make a high percentage of first serves, confidence grows a lot with that, and I win most of the points after a good first serve. How many points did I win? 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: One thing for sure is I must not feel happy because I am now in the quarterfinals. I've been playing late two nights in a row. When I walk out of here, it's time to go to bed. When I wake up, it's time to get back into match situations. This time around, I can recuperate a little more. But I must find a way to keep focused. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Not much. At 2:30 room service knocked on the door for no reason, and I had a hard time falling back asleep. It made me nervous. I woke up at 8, so I didn't have a very long night's sleep. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: We mostly do warm-ups. We have trained before this tournament in Paris. Those training sessions were very demanding. But nothing replaces a victory in the tournament. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: It's difficult. All matches are difficult matches. Beck is a very good player. He beat Nalbandian yesterday. He plays very well at this time. Davydenko is in the top 10, and he'll be difficult also. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes. I lost, so I want my revenge. Winning here is a great motivation to continue working as hard. Against Davydenko or Beck, they will be difficult matches. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I have my chances. Playing as well as I do, I think I have a chance to win for sure. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I like hard surfaces. Most people say I'm a clay court player, but the last two tournaments I won were indoor tournaments which were on hard. I love this surface. I learned to play on this type of surface. I adapt very well. I've always liked fast surfaces. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Roland Garros, I started to play very well there. I lost against CaÃ±as. I had two match points. I was getting to play better and better. It's too bad I lost.
