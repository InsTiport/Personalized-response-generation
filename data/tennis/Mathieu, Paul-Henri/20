PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: My serve, no, I think I serve good at the beginning of the match. Then it let me a little bit down in the second set, and I serve really good in the third set. So it's help a lot when you have a good serve. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, I had a very good week last week. So for sure, I mean, it give me some confidence for this week even if the condition are a little bit different. So I just try to keep going. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: When I was...? 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: My favorite player was Boris Becker, so... 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, yeah. When he won the French Open, I was one years old so... 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: No, I didn't even see the tape. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, yeah. With Monfils, Gasquet and a lot of French players. I think we have a good relation. I think that's good for us. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, I mean, I think we are -- at the beginning of the year we were a lot about 100 in the world, and now everybody is going up. So I hope it will be -- I mean it will continue, yes. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I like every one. I like to play on clay because the French Open. But I like hard court, too. I like to play in indoors, too. I like every one. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, we talk to each other. I mean, he's -- yeah, yeah. He's like Gasquet. All the French player, I mean, we are together sometimes. We go out for dinner. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I think, yeah, since last week I start to serve really good. I mean, that the shot I improve a lot I think in the last few weeks. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, of course. That is what we play tennis for. I mean, yeah, I enjoy it and I hope to beat some more great players. I hope I will be continuing. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: On hard? Yeah, ten times better results on hard courts. I won two tournaments in indoors, so it's even faster than here. I think I'm better on the fast surface. But when I am very good physically, I'm good on clay court, too. 

PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I don't think about New Haven yet. I mean, I am here in this week and I hope I will go far.
