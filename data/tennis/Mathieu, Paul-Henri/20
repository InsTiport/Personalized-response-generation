Q. Talk about your serve today. It seemed like you really had him off balance from the get-go. 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: My serve, no, I think I serve good at the beginning of the match. Then it let me a little bit down in the second set, and I serve really good in the third set. So it's help a lot when you have a good serve.  
 
Q. Talk about the nice little roll you're on right now. You're beating a lot of high-ranked guys. You must feel pretty confident right now? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, I had a very good week last week. So for sure, I mean, it give me some confidence for this week even if the condition are a little bit different. So I just try to keep going.  
 
Q. When you were growing up, were there any French players that you admired? Who were some of your favorite players on the tour? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: When I was...?  
 
Q. When you were growing up. 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: My favorite player was Boris Becker, so...  
 
Q. Did you watch Yannick Noah? Was that before your time? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, yeah. When he won the French Open, I was one years old so...  
 
Q. Must have seen a tape? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: No, I didn't even see the tape.  
 
Q. Do you have a relationship with Monfils? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, yeah. With Monfils, Gasquet and a lot of French players. I think we have a good relation. I think that's good for us.  
 
Q. Is it nice to see all the French players doing well particularly in the hard court season? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, I mean, I think we are -- at the beginning of the year we were a lot about 100 in the world, and now everybody is going up. So I hope it will be -- I mean it will continue, yes.  
 
Q. What's your favorite surface to play on? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I like every one. I like to play on clay because the French Open. But I like hard court, too. I like to play in indoors, too. I like every one.  
 
Q. Do you have any type of relationship with Monfils? Have you hit with him? Do you see him in the locker room? Do you talk to him? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, we talk to each other. I mean, he's -- yeah, yeah. He's like Gasquet. All the French player, I mean, we are together sometimes. We go out for dinner.  
 
Q. You talked about being more confident. Is there any part of your game that you feel like has really improved during the summer? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I think, yeah, since last week I start to serve really good. I mean, that the shot I improve a lot I think in the last few weeks.  
 
Q. Do you enjoy taking on these big shots and beating them? You've been beating a lot of the high-ranked players. Do you enjoy the challenge of playing the big players? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: Yeah, of course. That is what we play tennis for. I mean, yeah, I enjoy it and I hope to beat some more great players. I hope I will be continuing.  
 
Q. You say you like clay. Do you feel like you have a hard court game? You feel pretty comfortable on the surface, you can play pretty well on it? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: On hard? Yeah, ten times better results on hard courts. I won two tournaments in indoors, so it's even faster than here. I think I'm better on the fast surface. But when I am very good physically, I'm good on clay court, too.  
 
Q. You're going to New Haven next week. Are you pretty excited, the way you're playing, going into that tournament? 
 
 PAUL-HENRI MATHIEU: I don't think about New Haven yet. I mean, I am here in this week and I hope I will go far.
