    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   How tough was it out there in the heat today?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   Yeah, not very used to it here.   Is always nice to play with this weather here.   It's beautiful.  
   
 Q.   You have Andy Murray in the next round.   How do you feel about that?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   It's always interesting match to play against him, and especially here in Queen's on grass.   So it's going to be a very tough match for me, but it's gonna be his first match on grass, too.   I'm going to try my best.  
   
 Q.   How do you see a way of beating him?   How do you think you can beat him?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   If I can beat him?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   How do you think you can beat him?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   I think if not, I'm not gonna step on the court.   So you will always have a chance even if the chance is pretty small.   You have to go on the court and believe in yourself, and I think just to believe you can win.   That means you have a lot of respect of the opponent.   I have a lot of respect for him, so I'm going to try my best.  
   
 Q.   What do you make of the appointment of AmÃ©lie Mauresmo as his coach?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   What do I think?   
   
 Q.   What do you think?   
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   Yeah.   It's going to be an interesting relationship, too.   
    Honestly, I don't really know.   I didn't see her, I didn't talk about this with her.   But I think if they are starting something like this, I mean, I think they thought about it and they talked pretty much together, so I think it can work.  
   
 Q.   Do you know her well, AmÃ©lie?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   Yeah, I know her pretty well.  
   
 Q.   What sort of personality does she have?   What will she bring?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   I think she have a lot of experience in the game, and for sure, I mean, she loves tennis.   She always play with a passion, and I think like Andy, as well.  
    I think approaching the game and the big event, I think she can help him, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised at that appointment?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   Honestly, yes.   I think I'm not the only one who is surprised, I mean, because it's the first time this is happening that a woman is going to train a man.   
    I don't think it's bad.   Maybe we're gonna see more and more.   But I like the fact that AmÃ©lie is going to train Andy.   Going to bring something new in our sport.  
   
 Q.   What specific qualities does she have that can help Andy?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   I don't know.   So much to tell you, I mean, tell about this.   I mean, she had a great career.   
    For sure, I mean, she's very professional, and like I said, I mean, she's very passionate about tennis.   I think this is the most important thing.  
   
 Q.   Is it a good time to play Andy, bearing in mind he was still playing on clay in Paris on Friday?   
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   I played on clay until last week, too.   I think he has to get used to grass pretty quickly, for sure, quicker than me.   I'm happy that I play a match on grass before playing him.   
    And I think right after his loss he say, I'm going to have to turn my mind on the grass season.   I think he's going to be ready for it.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it will be a problem for AmÃ©lie because she won't be able to go into the dressing room or locker room?  
    PAUL‑HENRI MATHIEU:   I mean, they will have to do something for her.   But no, I mean, they're going to find something out.
