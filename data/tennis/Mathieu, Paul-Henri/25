PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: What was that? 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: It's a great victory for me. I mean, I play a very good match today. I knew, I mean, I could beat him. Two years ago I beat some great players, so I knew I had my chance. 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: I mean, I don't know what to say. I mean, it was a great point. I don't know. I just try to put the ball in play. What a winner. But, I mean, it was a great feeling. When I saw the ball was in, I mean, it's a great feeling. You try to enjoy it. 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: When I broke him back I think in the first set. He broke me at 2-All. At 3-2 I broke him back. I think I knew I had my chance. 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: No. I think I was returning very well today, so I really serve pretty good. So I think that was the key. 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: At 3-1? 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: Yes, I mean, it was a very important game for me. I didn't make a lot of first serve. I think it was very big game for me in the second set. 

PAUL HENRI MATHIEU: No, I mean, I was trying to playing my game, try to put the ball in play, not to miss so much. And when the ball was short, just go for it.
