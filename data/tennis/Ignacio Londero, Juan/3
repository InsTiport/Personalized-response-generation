THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  It's the second Grand Slam of the year, and I heard you are playing for a German club in the First League in Dusseldorf.  All the other guys know it as the World Team Cup.  What is your motivation and your contact, how you had relation to this German club?  
JUAN IGNACIO LONDERO: I don't know the players.  It's my coach currently in contact with the club.  I haven't been in contact personally with the club.   
 Q.  Okay.  So it was about the management, and they did the contact, and now you're playing in German First League for the very first time?  
JUAN IGNACIO LONDERO: Yes, it's my first time I'm going to be playing there.   
 Q.  And I will be there for sure because I'm from Germany.  How to go there to support you?  Juan Ignacio Londero, how can I support you?  What do I need to shout to support you?  Just "vamos" is easy but --  
JUAN IGNACIO LONDERO: Vampos topo.   
 Q.  Yeah.  We will see each other in Dusseldorf.  
JUAN IGNACIO LONDERO: Thank you.
