   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  In a tight match like that, what was the difference between you and Serena? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I think she used her chances definitely much better.  You know, she's definitely a great champ.  She played the tight points very well.  I had my opportunities.  I didn't use them.  That was the big difference. 

 Q.  Quite a number of unforced errors on your side, but also a lot of winners.  What was your pregame plan? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  You know, I think I struggled on that a little bit today.  Needed to keep the ball in play much more than I did.  I was trying to go for a winner or easy shot too early.  I think that was a little mistake. 

 Q.  How does this semifinal compare with the one at Roland Garros last year?  Do you feel you're a more mature player? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I mean, two totally different players.  Two totally different occasions, surfaces, everything.  I don't think you can really compare it much. 

 Q.  Were you affected by the sun glare at any stage during the match? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No, didn't notice anything. 

 Q.  You didn't notice any glare coming towards your eyes during the match? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Not really.  It was sunny, of course.  But, no, not really crazy that I noticed. 

 Q.  There was a suggestion on the Channel 7 commentary that a member of the Williams box was shining his watch into your eyes. 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I didn't see that.  I tried to focus, not pay attention to anything.  I really didn't notice that. 

 Q.  Did your nervous system go on and off, back and forth? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No.  I think I was, you know, calm the whole time.  I didn't have anything, no. 

 Q.  There was a point in the tiebreak where Serena's first shot, she screamed incredibly loud.  You lost the follow-up one.  Did you find that off-putting? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No.  I'm used to it.  There's a lot of players who grunt a little too much.  But I just, you know, like I said, I try to focus on my game, not really pay attention. 
 I think after a couple points, you kind of shut it out.  No, it didn't distract me. 

 Q.  There was nothing about it that struck you as a bit odd, out of place? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No.  I mean, I've seen her play before.  I was ready for it.  It's not going to probably be a silent match.  I knew it was coming.  No, it didn't distract me at all.
