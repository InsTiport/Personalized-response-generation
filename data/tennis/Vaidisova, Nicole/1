 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Nicole.   
  
  Q. You were hitting that forehand rather hard. Is it more of a question of she winning than you losing?  
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: I feel like she was the better player today, yeah. She was hitting the ball great.   
 I was just trying to hang in there and try to turn it around in the second set. It worked a little bit.   
 Actually, I have to give her credit. She played great.   
  
  Q. What was it that was working for you in the second set that enabled you to win but that you couldn't keep going in the third?  
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: I think I just tried to keep the ball more in play, don't give her so much opportunities to really put it away. She made a little more mistakes than she did in the first set. I kind of gained from that a little bit.
