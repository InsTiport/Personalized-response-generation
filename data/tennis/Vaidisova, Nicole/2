  N. VAIDISOVA/A. Chakvetadze
4-6, 7-6, 6-3

 Q. You've had a pretty tough year. Do you feel like maybe you've turned a corner here this week?
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: Yeah, I'm definitely very, very excited. Playing here in the quarters last year and being back here just feels very good.

 Q. What do you feel that you still need to do to get back to that top-ten level?
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: I think I'm working on it. I'm just practicing every day, getting better, and communicating with my coach, and just I think working in general a lot. So I think it's finally paying off.

 Q. What do you think the turning point today was for you? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: Definitely the tiebreaker. I played a great tiebreaker. I think that kind of got her down. 

 Q. She said that you were quite lucky in the number of net courts that you had. Do you feel that luck was on your side, or is that just something that someone who loses says?
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: Well, it's tennis. One of the players always hits the net once in a while. I just think, yeah, of course, luck was a little bit on my side today. But I don't think I won because of a net court. 

 Q. You seemed to be a little bit more calm on the court. Do you think that's a fair comment?
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: Yeah, I was just very excited to come out there and play. I've never played on Court 1, and just enjoyed being in the second week of Wimbledon. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on your next opponent, Jie Zheng? She's knocked out some pretty good people. 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA: Yeah, she's a great player. I saw her a little bit playing last week. She hasn't played for a while. So it's the quarterfinals, so it's definitely going to be an easy (sic) match.
