   THE MODERATOR:  Questions? 

 Q.  You seemed to be kind of frustrated or anxious to get the game moving or finished today.  Is that correct? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No, I just think I had more opportunities in the second set to really, you know, step it up, take a bigger lead, and finish the match.  But couple good first serves, shots made it more difficult for me. 

 Q.  Do you see this as a big year for you? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I haven't thought of a big year.  I've just, you know, I said my main priority is going to be healthy. 
 That was definitely a good last year, and, you know, played good.  Obviously I want to do better in the Slams than I did last year. 

 Q.  Do you have goals, or just play it tournament by tournament? 
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Tournament by tournament, match by match probably.  I'm not the person who looks at the draw, thinks how far they could go, and just take each opponent as it goes.
