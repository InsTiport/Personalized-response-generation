THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Tell us how you felt when you were up ahead in that second set.  What was going through your mind? 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  That I could take the second set, you know, and get to a third.  But then I had few bad shots and it turned her way again.  I missed my chances.  I had definitely chances in the second set and I let them slip away. 
 
Q.  When you enter a Grand Slam and you're drawn against the No. 1 player in the world, it's a great opportunity to show people how well you can play.  Were there nerves before the start of this match, or were you just very excited to be able to play her?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I was both.  I was very excited but, well, actually I was nervous, too, because I was playing in Arthur Ashe Stadium against the No. 1 player in the world.  So you just want to play your best, and it gets you a little nervous. 
 
Q.  Did you have a game plan?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, of course I did.  All my matches, every time I have a game plan, no matter who I play. 
 
Q.  So how do you play Justine? 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Uhm, well, she's a great player.  I mean, she has a lot of weapons.  You just have to play -- I just played my game, you know, tried to play my best.  
 
Q.  Your backhand looked very strong.  Is that your best shot? 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Well, I don't really have a best.  I think all my shots are like equal.  I think I serve good, my forehand.  So I don't really fancy one shot.  I just play all-around. 
 
Q.  How did you feel when you saw your name beside Justine's in the draw?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I was like, "Wow, yeah, that's a good one."  But, yeah, I was excited to play.  You know, it's a great opportunity to play the No. 1 player in the world, my first Grand Slam, Arthur Ashe Stadium.  It's a great experience for next year, you know, so it was good. 
 
Q.  When did you come to the United States? 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Like the first time ever or...?  
 
Q.  Yeah, when you came from Czech Republic to the United States to live. 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I came four years ago, but I don't live the whole time in the USA.  I just live five months out of the year in Bradenton, Florida, to practice, but not the whole year. 
 
Q.  So you also live in Czech Republic?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, yeah, I live the next seven months in Czech Republic. 
 
Q.  And your parents are there?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, my family goes with me back and forth.  
 
Q.  Where exactly do you live?  I know it's in the Czech Republic. 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  In Prague, the capital.  In Prague. 
 
Q.  What part of Prague, any part?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Just Prague (laughter).  
 
Q.  Noosa, you know where that is?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I'm not from Noosa.  
 
Q.  Want to give us your impression of Justine?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  She's a great player.  I mean, I have a lot of respect for her.  I still see from the match how much I still have to improve to beat those players.  So I think it was a great experience to see that.  
 
Q.  There are two great Czech players living in Florida: Petr Korda and Jana Novotna.  Have you met them?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, I met them, but just couple times.  
 
Q.  Are they at all people that you looked up to when you were younger?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Well, when I was growing up, I didn't really look up to somebody.  I didn't have like a tennis idol.  But I just played, you know, tennis for fun and then just tried to play by my way and not how everybody used to play the best way.  
 
Q.  How important was the good results in Vancouver to your confidence?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  It was a lot because there were some top players who I beat and, you know, how you see you can beat them and can win the WTA tournaments, it gives you a lot of confidence for the next couple months.  I think it was good for confidence there, too. 
 
Q.  If Sesil says she could beat Venus or Serena, is that you saying it, too, or is it her personally?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Well, I don't really look what  Sesil says.  I'm not Sesil.  We're good friends and we practice together, but we are two totally different people.  You know, it's not that we have the same personality, we say same stories.  We're totally different.  So, you know, I don't think I would say the same as she does.  
 
Q.  How much would you like to go out there now and play her again right now? 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, I definitely want to go out there at 4-1 in the second set, try to win that.  
 
Q.  I heard you like ice hockey.  Are you going to have time to follow the World Cup of Hockey this week?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, I hope I will on the Internet and around.  But I watched the Stanley Cup a lot.  My favorite team, Tampa, won.  I was cheering for them every match.  
 
Q.  And who will you be cheering for in the World Cup of hockey, Germany or Czech?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Czech Republic, of course.  
 
Q.  But you used to live in Germany. 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I was born in Germany.  I lived there for six and a half years.  I'm Czech. 
 
Q.  Who's your favorite hockey player or one or two or three. 
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  (Smiling.  Like Lecavalier, the Canadian, and some Czechs, Bosbesheil (phonetic) and Cabeno (phonetic) maybe.  
 
Q.  How many Lightning games do you go to each year?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  How many Lightnings, a lot.  Depends, 10, 12.  How do I have time, I don't know, after tournaments when I'm in Tampa. 
 
Q.  You have good seats?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Yeah, I have pretty good seats (smiling). 
 
Q.  Do you play hockey?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  No, no. 
 
Q.  Can you skate?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I can't even skate.  I was afraid of ice, actually.  But I still like hockey.  
 
Q.  So what is the attraction with ice hockey?
 
NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I don't know.  I just like it, even though I'm scared of it myself.  So probably I just like it because those people can go out there and skate so...  I never can do.
