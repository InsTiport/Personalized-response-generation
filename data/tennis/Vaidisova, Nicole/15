   THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.   
  
  Q.  Your impressions of the game?  What did you think?   
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  I'm pretty happy.  I've got a fourth round again.  Tough conditions, you know, waiting here the whole day.  Don't know really when you go on.   
 But served pretty well.  Got the breaks where I needed them.  Was the better player on the crucial points.  Just very excited to play on Sunday again.   
  
  Q.  There's been a few different delays.  How hard is that to keep yourself mentally up and about?   
 NICOLE VAIDISOVA:  Well, I think we got all the delays we could possibly have.  We had the rain, we had the heat.  Just waiting for a tornado to come or something.   
 But it's part of it.  One match I played under the roof, now outside.  But it's part of it here.  You have to expect it and just get ready for it as best as possible.
