 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Stephane in French.   
  
  Q. Do you have any regrets? You were not far?  
 STEPHANE ROBERT: I had a few regrets, indeed. I had a set point in the first set.   
  
  Q. What happened?  
 STEPHANE ROBERT: I don't remember that point. I have amnesia (smiling).   
 I remember he served a very good first serve.   
  
  Q. In the second set, you were almost able to come back again?   
 STEPHANE ROBERT: Yes. We were playing tricks on each other. At the end of the second set, he gave away a few points. I changed my racquet, and I made good choices.   
 I am much more comfortable on clay than on hard courts, so I was able to mix it up. I played around with him. I'm very happy with my game today. I believe my serve has a better quality to it and I was able to serve much more relaxed. All this was very interesting.   
  
  Q. You are becoming more and more consistent at a higher level now.   
 STEPHANE ROBERT: It's not so much about being at a higher level; it's more about me. Like this week was completely different from last week. Here I was able to make decisions and to stick to them.   
 I'm no longer being obsessed by the score; I just play my match. I'm happy about all this.   
  
  Q. What is your program now?  
 STEPHANE ROBERT: Barcelona, the quallies in Rome, Munich and Nice before the French. Two weeks off for practice.   
 Depending on what I will do in Rome, I might not play the Nice tournament in order to have some rest.   
  
  Q. How would you describe the past months?   
 STEPHANE ROBERT: Nothing changed for me. The only difference is the courts I play on and what is around the courts. I worked hard and I am now able to play big tournaments. For me, it's extraordinary to play here in Monte-Carlo. I try to make the best of what I have.   
 I am in the process of changing for the best. It's a lot of pleasure for me.
