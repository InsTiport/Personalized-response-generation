Q.  Can you talk about if you heard anything home about your winning effort here, reaction from Sweden?

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  Yes, we have heard some from the Prime Minister of Sweden, Goran Persson.  We got a fax from him, and a lot of friends.  The old team members, Magnus Larsson called me today, Tillstrom and Enqvist called me also.  So, yeah, a lot of people have sent us faxes congratulating us.


Q.  Was last night a celebration for you all or did you think about today's matches and maybe save it for today?

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  I think we saved it for today. We like to be professional and give the crowd good matches today also, and fight to the end.  I think that's the way it should be.  Today, after the game, our job is done, we can celebrate.


Q.  For the captain, what would be the secret to Sweden's success in the Davis Cup? 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG:  They are sitting here around me (indicating).  They are the secret.  We have eight players who has competed for Sweden.  They did a great job this year.  That's the secret.  Also we have a unique system in Sweden with the tennis clubs where people are working on their free time with lots of juniors.  I think that's the main reasons.
