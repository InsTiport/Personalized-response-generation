CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: I think so. 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: Yes. That's not unusual for Jonas (laughter). 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: Thank you. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: In a week, me and Carl and my other coach Stefan, my sister and her son, we go to Austria for skiing one week, five or six days. It's going to be nice. After that, we start to prepare for next year. But we're going to have two nice weeks, not play too much tennis. 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: I'm proud of my team, the way they have acted the whole week, fantastic job. That it's 5-Love, I said in the beginning that it's going to be five tough matches. But 5-Love, I didn't think really of winning them all. We have the luck on our side. It was a pity for Pete, for the U.S. team, that he was injured, yeah.
