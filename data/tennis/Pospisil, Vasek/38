  THE MODERATOR:   Vasek comes in off his second calendar title of the year in Vancouver yesterday, the fourth of his career.   He comes in a career‑high 71 in the Emirates ATP rankings.  
Questions for Vasek.   
   
 Q.   Strange match last night.   Down 4‑1 in the third.   Talk a little bit about the match.   
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, strange match.   I mean, ups and downs.   You know, a little bit more than other matches, perhaps.   
But still thought it was a high level of tennis throughout the whole match.   I played my best in the first set, then he played extremely well in the second.   Kind of took turns playing well.   We just battled it out in the third.   
So just fortunate to have won that one.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about where your game is now.   Career‑high 71.   Must have a lot of confidence.   
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, the important thing is I feel like I'm improving every week.   I'm never really settled with anything.   I'm always trying to improve every day on the practice court, trying to get better.   If I can keep doing that, the ranking will speak for itself however much I improve.   
Yeah, but I'm feeling very, very good about my results lately, especially just the way I've been playing.  
   
 Q.   What did you think when you heard you got Isner in the first round?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Mixed feelings.   Every match here is tough.   There's very few good draws.   So obviously I've beaten him before, which is positive for me, which I know going into that match that I can win.   
Obviously, you know, he's had two long tournaments, so he might be a little bit tired.   Maybe I can use that to my advantage.   He's also confident.   
Either way it's going to be extremely tough when you have a server like that, a dangerous player.   I mean, I'll do my best, though.   
   
 Q.   You must be a little tired yourself after coming off a red‑eye.   
VASEK POSPISIL:   Maybe this morning a little bit (smiling).   I'm sure I'll be a little bit better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to train today?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I'm going to have a light hit at 3:00.   
   
 Q.   Get some rest?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   As early as I can.   With the time change, it will be difficult.   I didn't sleep much, so it won't be any problem.  
   
 Q.   Do you have many points to defend over the last couple months?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I do not have too many points to defend coming up.   Obviously, I won a round here last year.   Well, in Toronto.   I don't really have too many points after that.   Quarterfinals in Kuala Lumpur, and a round in Vienna.   So relatively open to make some moves in the rankings if I can play well.   
   
 Q.   Cincy quallies and US Open quallies?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I'm playing Cincy quallies and playing main draw US Open.   
   
 Q.   You're main draw US Open?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   Because of your new ranking?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah.   I was high enough before.   I was 89 on the list, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you think (indiscernible) is something that is possible for you this year?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I would like to think so.   That was one of my goals at the beginning of the year.   That was a very high goal I set for myself considering my ranking at the beginning of the year.   Yeah, I mean, I'm on the right path, for sure.   I've been playing very well, especially the last few months.   
Anything is possible.   I could also not win another match the whole year, so you never know (smiling).   I also could have a great run somewhere.   
Sport is like that:   very unpredictable.   You never know what's going to happen.   Try not to look too far ahead of myself but at the same time set realistic goals.   So, yeah, hoping.   
   
 Q.   You won first round here two years ago.   Do you remember that match?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yes, against Chela.   I remember it very well.   
   
 Q.   You have to go through the first round.   It's a tough contender.   
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, for sure.   Playing John is very tough, so...   But, yeah, the match I played two years ago was a great match, very emotional.   Obviously the first ATP win I had, first ATP main‑draw match I played.   Good memories coming back to MontrÃ©al.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember the last time you met Isner?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I played him at the beginning of this year.   I lost in three sets indoors in San Jose.   
   
 Q.   The tournament that Milos won?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yes.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   Can you explain what you've been doing to reach your new ranking of 71?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I worked hard with my new coach.   Since the beginning of the year I've been trying to play more aggressive and to avoid long rallies and not to be passive on the court.   
I have a very good coach, so I was able to improve a lot.   That's the most important for me.   
   
 Q.   What can you say about your next match against Isner?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   It's going to be a very tough match.   He won Atlanta and has reached a final just before this.   He's always dangerous when he's confident.   I know it's going to be tough, but I am prepared.   I will try to serve well and play the best I can.   
   
 Q.   When is that match scheduled?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   I don't know at what time.   
   
 Q.   Did you change anything in your routine, your diet maybe?   Did you do anything different?  
VASEK POSPISIL:   Well, yes.   I made a major change in my preparation.   I changed my diet.   I lost 12 pounds, which is a lot.   I'm not as heavy on the court anymore, and that makes a great difference.
