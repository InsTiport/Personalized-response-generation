  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It seemed like between Davis Cup against Israel last year and a few matches this year, you really seem to thrive in the matches that go deep.   Is that something about your game?   What does that say about you?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it is.   The longer the matches go sometimes the better I feel on the court.   You know, I start swinging freely and muscle memory takes over, I guess.   That helps because I don't have to think much and just my abilities or whatever take over.   It's probably an advantage for me. 

Q.   Never in doubt, right? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, no, I mean, obviously very close match.   I had chances, momentum in the second set, and kind of gave it back to him.   Felt like I was starting to gain some momentum, so I tried not let to get to me too much.
Yeah, I was able to raise any game and had chances in the third and didn't take them, the early ones, but hung in there, and, yeah, managed to pull another win here. 

Q.   What did he feel like?   He's a guy that's been in the top 50 for almost six years, ver solid player. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I've played him before so I knew what to expect.   I lost a tough two‑setter, I think like 7‑6, 7‑5 last year, so I knew what to expect.   I knew if I played well I would have a chance to win.
But he's very solid.   He returns extremely well.   Doesn't give you any cheap points, so you know you have to work really hard to win a match against him. 
He's top 30 right now so that ranking speaks for itself, his consistency.   So it's just a great win for me. 

Q.   How does your game plan change now facing Monaco who is obviously a little bit higher seed? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I mean, I haven't really thought too much about that match.   I just finished this one in terms of game plan.   But I go into every match more or less the same way, because I try to implement my game onto my opponents. 
But he's a similar player:   baseliner, I guess.   But it's going to be obviously very tough.   He's top 10.
At the moment I'm going to enjoy this victory, recover, and play well tomorrow.

Q.   When you go back and forth and have an up and down third like that, you came into the match 0‑11, I think, on the ATP.   When does confidence get involved there, and is there any self‑belief that comes into play?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, I didn't have a great year on the ATP Tour this year.   I played well at the end of the last year, and it's tough when you don't get too many wins.   It can start playing in your head. 
I think for me it was more that than my game, because as soon as I went to challengers I played extremely well.   I lost tough matches.   You know, had match point in Eastbourne, so it's not easy. 
But it helps obviously to play in Canada.   I feel like I play my best tennis when I'm here.   Just looking forward to tomorrow. 

Q.   Was there something with your thighs in the last couple points?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I mean, a little bit of cramps again.   Last time I had them was a year ago in MontrÃ©al Rogers Cup, so it's something about the tournament. 
But I guess I start getting, I don't know, nerves or whatever.   But it didn't affect me too much.   Just couple points maybe.   But, yeah, I feel fine.

Q.   You weren't too panicky at 6‑All thinking you couldn't get in a long rally or anything?
VASEK POSPISIL:   No.   I mean, obviously would have liked to have won that match point on my serve before, but, no, I wasn't panicking too much.   Maybe if I would have lost that 6‑all point on my serve would have been a bit different.
But overall, felt okay. 

Q.   What are you most pleased about with your game today? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I think just hanging in there after losing the first set and, you know, kind of blowing my break in the second set.   I could have, you know, folded or not played so well and kind of given it up in the second. 
But I tried hard to keep fighting, and, you know, stay at least on serve in the second and wait for my opportunities.
So I think mentally I handled it pretty well. 

Q.   Where does this win rank for you? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I mean, very high obviously.   Any win here at Rogers Cup also because it's in Canada, that's that much more special.   It's my third top 30 win.   I mean, I don't have too many of those right now, so obviously it's a huge win for me.   To do it here in Toronto in front of my home crowd and Canadian crowd, it's awesome.

Q.   What have the last few weeks been like for you representing your country at the Olympics and coming back to play the main match on the on home soil?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, no, incredible.   I feel the last couple weeks I've been playing pretty well, and so perfect timing for the Olympics.   Had a tough draw in singles there and a tough loss in doubles, but played well. 
Incredible experience.   Then to come right over here the next week and play a tournament that I've been looking forward to all year, for sure it's a pretty exciting summer for me.   Just hope I can keep going. 

Q.   There is a lot similarity between your career and Milos.   There is any special thing which probably Milos gave you some advice during your career?   Do you think there is anything you can utilize climbing the rank list the way Milos did? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   No advice.   I mean, it's tough.   Milos is obviously playing extremely well.   He has, in my opinion, the best serve on the tour right now‑ one of the best with him and John.
So, I mean, he has a huge game.   That's more the reason why he's top 30 right now rather than some tricks that he could help me out with. 
But, you know, I fought my way to the top 100, and I still have some good years in front of me in feel like.

Q.   As Davis Cup teammates, between you and Milos is there some communication and probably can happen that...
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you mean like he gives my advice or not.   We get along and stuff, but we have our own coaches and schedules. 
When we see each other at tournaments it's great, but when we don't we don't talk about our games and what to improve and stuff very much.   We keep that to ourselves a little bit.
