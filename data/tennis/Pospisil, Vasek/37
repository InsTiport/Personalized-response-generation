V. POSPISIL/J. Isner
  5‑7, 7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Anybody tell you that Isner never loses a tiebreaker?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Well, the time I beat him, I beat him in a third‑set tiebreaker also.   Obviously I knew that he doesn't lose many tiebreakers.   But because I beat him in the past in one, I felt confident about it, so... 

Q.   How do you feel about your game in general?   Is this the kind of match you expected? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I'm feeling obviously lately very good about my game.   Today, to be honest, from the baseline I wasn't feeling too comfortable 'cause the conditions are extremely different from Vancouver, where I played.   The balls there were very heavy and low‑bouncing.   Here they're flying a lot.   I felt a little bit of difficulty controlling the ball from the baseline. 
I made some adjustments.   Obviously I played a great match. 

Q.   Was it Wilson out there?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yes, it was a funny kind of Wilson.   It wasn't like the US Open Wilson.   That one is more lively.   This one was a strange one. 

Q.   What did you like best about the win today?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Doing it in front of a crowd like that, for sure.   Obviously I've had similar wins against players that are ranked 20 in the world, but that was extremely special.   A lot of people there.   The atmosphere at the end was incredible.   It was that much more special, for sure. 

Q.   I was thinking you might mention a comeback and fighting spirit down 4‑1. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   As well, yeah, of course (laughter).   Kind of pick and choose. 
That, of course, obviously, as well.   When you're down 4‑1 against somebody that is one of the hardest guys to break on tour, you come back and win, that's extremely special, as well. 

Q.   It's four players in the second round from Canada for the first time since 1992.   A thought on Canadian tennis. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I mean, I think us four, and Milos, it would be five.   I don't know the last time we had five. 
Obviously Canadian tennis is doing well right now.   We have a lot of capable and good players that can play at a high level.   Yeah, so it's just thrilling really there's so many of us right now in the second round for tomorrow. 

Q.   Can you describe the emotional rollercoaster from the beginning till the end. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, I mean, it wasn't too bad emotionally like in terms of the ups and downs because we were kind of holding serve.   I didn't really have too many opportunities.   I was really playing from behind the whole match until the second set.   When I won the second set, we were on even terms.   Even then, I was playing from behind. 
It was tough, but emotionally difficult as well from last week, because I played two matches on Saturday, a very emotional rollercoaster match in the final on Sunday in front of friends and family.   I flew overnight with no sleep.   So, obviously, mentally it was a couple very draining days but amazing at the same time. 

Q.   I was standing beside Nestor when it was 4‑All in the tiebreak.   He said you picked the service return.   Was he right?
VASEK POSPISIL:   He was right.   John was serving out there quite a bit throughout the match.   I didn't want to start covering that side too early because I wanted to save it for the bigger points.   I knew if I started covering that, he would start mixing it up.   If he starts mixing it up, you're in trouble.   I was saving that for a big point. 
I got lucky obviously that it went that way. 

Q.   There is some thinking going on inside your head?
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, of course.   I do think a little bit sometimes on the court, luckily (smiling). 

Q.   Is this the biggest win of your career?
VASEK POSPISIL:   It's definitely up there.   I mean, it's definitely up there.   I think it's my first top‑20 win.   I'm not sure.   I've had three or four wins with guys that were right around 20, 21, something like that. 
Definitely up there in the top five wins in my career.   Also the Davis Cup is up there as one or two.   I've had some other matches here at Rogers Cup that were incredible.   My first match against Chela here two years ago rates very highly because it was my first ATP match.   This is definitely another extremely special match.   They're all unique and different in their own ways.

Q.   What do you think this day means for Canadian tennis?   Was there a change of attitude in the last few years?   A few years ago nobody would have thought you would have four or five players. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   Yeah, maybe a little bit of change in attitude.   Maybe some belief.   Obviously Milos has been doing well.   That propels everybody.   We want to do well, as well.   Nice we have a lot of young guys, young talent.   Obviously Milos, Peliwo who won today, too.   Yeah, there's obviously a lot to look forward to in the future. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   In the third set at 4‑1, knowing how good a server he is, what were you feeling in that moment? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   I knew he was having a letdown.   But being 4‑1 against Isner in the third is not something you want to have, especially with those light balls that go very fast, it makes it more difficult. 
I really just tried to hang on and tried to take my chances, if I had any.   I was lucky because I was able to take the chance I was given. 

Q.   How is your level of energy after what happened to you these past days, then winning your matches in MontrÃ©al?
VASEK POSPISIL:   My energy level is okay.   But mainly the spectators are giving me a lot of energy.   This helps me. 

Q.   What is happening to Canadian tennis?   There are four of you in the second round, and Milos is up in his match. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   It's incredible.   It's extremely exciting for Canadian tennis.   All these young players, like Frank, me, the others winning their matches here.   We are many.   It is great. 
I believe all the Canadians are happy about this.   I hope there will be many of us in the third round, as well. 

Q.   How do you explain that? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   It can be explained by many different things.   First, it's a good timing, like many young players with talent are succeeding right now.   Also Tennis Canada is doing the right thing.   With Louis Borfiga and Guillaume Marx, things have changed a lot.   They've been doing really well for Canadian tennis. 
Also Milos playing so well gives a lot of confidence to all of other players. 

Q.   Can you describe the feeling you had after winning the match against a top player? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   It was incredible.   You can see the smile on my face.   That explains it all.   Especially winning against a player like him makes it even more special here in MontrÃ©al.   I hope I will experience that many more times because this is exactly the reason why I'm playing tennis, just to live those moments. 

Q.   Can you talk about your next opponent. 
VASEK POSPISIL:   He has a lot of experience.   He's a very good player.   It's going to be really tough.   I hope I can win, but it's always difficult matches here and anything can happen.   I will try to have a good night's sleep and to be focused for tomorrow.   I know things are not finishing here.   I have to play the match tomorrow. 

Q.   You and Vasek have Czech origins.   Do you speak Czech together? 
VASEK POSPISIL:   A little bit.   His parents know my parents very well.   They stayed at our place about 11 years ago for a week. 
I know him a little bit.   We sometimes speak Czech together. 

Q.   Are you going to celebrate tonight?
VASEK POSPISIL:   No.   Tonight I'm going to rest.
