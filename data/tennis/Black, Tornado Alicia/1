A. KONJUH/T. Black
      3‑6, 6‑4, 7‑6

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How much was your left thigh a factor in the match today?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, I mean, it was hurting a lot, but I was trying to focus on the match, not on my leg.

Q.   Obviously you're disappointed now, but that was a very close match.   You know, she has way more experience.   Can you see the bright side?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, I mean, it's really good I got to the finals in my first like ‑‑well, my first final. 
    And I don't have much experience in that and she does.   She's a really good player.   She's the one that played better today.

Q.   Do you feel you were a little bit unlucky at all not to win that match, I mean, when it goes to the third‑set tiebreaker?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Whoever wants it more.   It was a really tough match.   She played really well. 

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the crowd support, just that huge crowd that was out there and the support that they were giving you. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   It was really nice from the U.S. that they come out there and support me.   I was really happy.   I loved them out there.

Q.   Is the aim now to play some more of these junior events?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah, hopefully next year I will get to go to the Australian and go to the French and Wimbledon.   That will be exciting. 

Q.   Did you know you won more points than she did?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, no.   Didn't really pay attention.

Q.   Now you do.   About four more. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Okay. 

Q.   I know you have already answered some of these questions, but you were so close.   Could you taste it?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah.   I was up 5‑3, but she started to play more aggressive and I got a little bit tight.   That's what happened. 

Q.   You are considered a pro, right? 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yes, I turned pro.   Yes. 

Q.   When did you turn pro?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Last year beginning of the year.

Q.   And can you fill us in a little bit on your future plans for development, training?   You're not with the USTA, I know. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   No, hopefully ‑‑I want to play all the junior slams again next year and hopefully start playing some pro tournaments, 10s, 25s, 50s, and work my way up.

Q.   Could you talk about how you got your name and what is the best single story you can come up about your name?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   I wasn't born in a tornado.   That's what everyone always asks.   I had an older sister that played, and my parents wanted storm names for me and my little sister.   That's kind of what happened.

Q.   Are you happy with the name?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah.   It's fine.

Q.   Your friends call you Alicia, Ali, or... 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   They call me Alicia.

Q.   How does it work that you can be a professional and play in the juniors?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   I'm not exactly sure.   Like I think you can play in the ITF, of course, but if you play at the lower tournaments like in your country, I don't think you can play.

Q.   So you couldn't play the U.S. National Junior Girls?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, yes, I can play nationals, but just not like lower tournaments than that.

Q.   You're still such a young person and such a young player, but do you think you can win the main draw tennis tournament here one day?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, hopefully (smiling).   Just gotta work really hard.

Q.   If there was one player that you could meet and have a conversation with, maybe not even a hit with, somebody either on the tour now or who played before, who would that be?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Maybe like Federer.   Yeah.

Q.   What would you ask him?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   I don't know.   I'd just be like, I love you (smiling). 

Q.   There are lots of us who say that. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah.

Q.   Where are you at in school now?   Are you doing online?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah, home school.

Q.   Where are you located on the grade level?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   I'm going into 10th.

Q.   A generation ago, or back when Serena was first coming in, she won ‑‑ I believe she won this tournament at 17.   Seems now that the players who are winning at the top level are older.   When you did turn pro, did you discuss it with your family?   Have they talked about this probably being a longer process based on the way the game has evolved?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, not really.   I don't really talk to them much about it. 

Q.   You're based in Boynton Beach now?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Do you reside there as well as play tennis there?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Sorry? 

Q.   Do you reside there?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um... 

Q.   Live. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   No, I live with my mom.

Q.   In Boynton?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   In Boca.

Q.   In Boca?   So you go back and forth every day?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   It's only like 20 minutes.

Q.   I thought you were living in Boynton Beach. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Oh, no.   With my mom.

Q.   We were talking just outside about the reasons why you switched from Boca to Boynton.   Shall we say expenses have maybe come into it?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, I mean, I was there for a year and a half.

Q.   At the USTA?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   At the USTA.   I just wanted to get a change.   Right now I'm happy where I'm at, and it's working. 

Q.   Do they help you at all in covering anything at all in Boynton Beach?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   No. 

Q.   But they did in Boca, I'm told. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Well, yeah, that's federation, so when you're with them they cover everything.

Q.   So you forewent that to go up to Boynton Beach?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Yeah.   I just wanted to try something new.   So it's working now. 

Q.   Is there something cool about you that we don't know?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Um, not really, no (smiling). 

Q.   Who is your coach now?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Lawrence Carpio. 

Q.   You are 15 years old?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Well‑done.   Very, very good effort at 15. 
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Thank you. 

Q.   Where were you born?
    TORNADO ALICIA BLACK:   Boca.
