THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just going back to what happened today on the court, have you experienced that sort of like heat stroke before in matches or is this the first time?
SHILIN XU:   This was my first time, so it's a pretty frightening experience.

Q.   I have to ask, because your English is remarkable, so why?   Why are your language skills so great?
SHILIN XU:   I went to the U.S. when I was eight, and I stayed there for six years and came back I think 14.

Q.   Where in the States?
SHILIN XU:   Florida.

Q.   In Bradenton or... 
SHILIN XU:   Actually, I moved to quite a couple of places, but I ended up in Port St. Lucie.   There is an academy there called Club Med Academies.

Q.   What brought you over to the States?   Just tennis?
SHILIN XU:   Yeah, just tennis. 
And my parents wanted to see how everything was there.   It was different, so... 

Q.   I would imagine.   So you came over with your parents?
SHILIN XU:   Yeah, my whole family went there with me.

Q.   But now you live in China?
SHILIN XU:   Yeah.

Q.   And train in China?
SHILIN XU:   Yeah, I train in China now.
