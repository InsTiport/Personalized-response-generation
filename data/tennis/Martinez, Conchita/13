Q. Conchita, you've beaten her five for five. What's the difference? You, her? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I don't know. Probably me, I don't think I played very good today. I mean, especially I was really, really tired so it was really difficult to get up for this one, and I didn't play right - I mean, not like the other times. I gave her too many angles and she played comfortably.  
 
Q. Do you think it's playing singles and doubles both? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, definitely. I mean I played three weeks straight, singles and doubles, so that gets to you. And, you know, the hours were late for the last two weeks, nonstop. So, yeah, I feel (inaudible) quite a bit today. And playing semifinals and against players like this, you have to be really, you know, fit.  
 
Q. Did she improve? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah. I mean, but -- I don't know. I just don't think I played all right. I mean, before I played, you know, much more to the middle, much more to the forehand, you know, and this time I just couldn't do much. For the way that I played, she played great.  
 
Q. What does it mean for you for Dokic for the future? Do you think she could win on clay in Roland Garros? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: You know, she's very young, she has a lot of years to play. So, yeah, anything could happen. I mean, she's a good player.  
 
Q. Will you play doubles at the French? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.  
 
Q. With Dokic? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Uh-huh.  
 
Q. So you're kind of baby-sitting her? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I'm eleven years older, so... I mean, I'm gonna take a few days off next week and hopefully recover and be all ready for the French.  
 
Q. Do you feel a little bit "old" when you play someone like Dokic who is so eager? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, not really. If I play my game and if I play good, you know, I think it doesn't matter the age. I mean, I'm still there and I mean, I can play, you know -- if I play good, I can play a couple more years or three. Who knows? It doesn't really matter. I mean, the most important thing is to be fit and to play your game and, you know...
