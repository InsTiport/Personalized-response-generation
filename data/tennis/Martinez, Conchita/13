CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I don't know. Probably me, I don't think I played very good today. I mean, especially I was really, really tired so it was really difficult to get up for this one, and I didn't play right - I mean, not like the other times. I gave her too many angles and she played comfortably. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, definitely. I mean I played three weeks straight, singles and doubles, so that gets to you. And, you know, the hours were late for the last two weeks, nonstop.

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, not really. If I play my game and if I play good, you know, I think it doesn't matter the age. I mean, I'm still there and I mean, I can play, you know -- if I play good, I can play a couple more years or three. Who knows? It doesn't really matter. I mean, the most important thing is to be fit and to play your game and, you know...
