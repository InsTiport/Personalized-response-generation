Q.  Conchita, what is the injury?  How much did it bother you?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  It was just a blister.


Q.  Blister?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yes.


Q.  On the foot?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Uh-huh.


Q.  How much did it bother you?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Oh, nothing.  When I covered it up, it was okay.


Q.  Conchita, why did you ask for that injury time-out?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I just answered that.  It was a blister on my toe.


Q.  Which toe?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I don't know, one of them.


Q.  What do you suppose you did that seemed to turn the match around for you in the second set? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I was more aggressive.  Went for my shots a little bit more.  Tried to play deep.  That worked pretty well.


Q.  How come you turned it around again?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I think she was on and off. She was really, really aggressive in the first set, going for her shots a lot.  Really didn't let me do anything.  I was not getting to the ball fast enough.  I think the second set, I moved better.  Then all of a sudden, I mean, I couldn't -- some of the games were tight and I couldn't put her away.  She played well, didn't make any mistakes.


Q.  Was there ever any time during that three-minute injury time-out when you thought you might not be able to return within the allowable three minutes?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No.


Q.  Twice you were within two points of winning the second set.  Did you have questions about whether you could win it or not?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No.  I mean, I always thought that I could win it.  It was pretty close, but I think she played those games pretty well.


Q.  Are you going to remember this as one of the best matches you played against her?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No.  I mean, I play well.  I'm  not very happy the way I started playing, you know.  If you play her like this, you can't give her so much advantage in the first set.  I think it was over, I don't know, less than half an hour.  You have to try to stay really aggressive and hopefully I can do that next time.
