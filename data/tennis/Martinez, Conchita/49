 Q. You seem to get more confident on the hard courts. Is this the best you ever played
on this surface?
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I would say I have been having a lot of good results lately on
hardcourts. Yeah, I am playing good and hopefully I can play better through the Open. 
 
Q. Is it easier with all the attention on Monica and Steffi, for the most part, for you
and maybe Arantxa to just continue to forge ahead and then see what happens next weekend?
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It is okay. I mean, I am just concentrating and playing my matches,
trying to play the best that I can, and what happened outside, I mean, it is not my
concern. I just try to concentrate on my tennis.
