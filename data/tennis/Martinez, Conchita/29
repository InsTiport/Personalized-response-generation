CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was a good match. I didn't play well at all. I made a lot of unforced errors. My forehand wasn't there today, make a lot of errors with my forehand. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm okay. Physically I'm okay. Sort of a little bit of timing, don't hit the ball with topspin. At the moment I'm hitting the ball late. Timing. The court was fast. Keep practicing, try to be ready for the next one. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, not today.
