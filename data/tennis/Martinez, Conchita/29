Q. Conchita, what was your assessment of the match today? I was afraid I didn't get to see it. Can you tell us what happened a little bit? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was a good match. I didn't play well at all. I made a lot of unforced errors. My forehand wasn't there today, make a lot of errors with my forehand.  
 
Q. Is it a timing problem or is it something else? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm okay. Physically I'm okay. Sort of a little bit of timing, don't hit the ball with topspin. At the moment I'm hitting the ball late. Timing. The court was fast. Keep practicing, try to be ready for the next one.  
 
Q. Did the heat bother you at all? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, not today.
