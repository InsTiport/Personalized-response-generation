Q.  You and Arantxa had similar matches  where you both went to tiebreakers in the first  set and then it kind of got easier in the second  set.  Could you describe your match a little bit?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, the first set was quite really  difficult to play against her because she plays  high balls and deep and she tries to make you run  around the court.  It was really difficult but it  was good that I could handle the match there and  try not to make many mistakes and try to make her  tired because I knew she was a little bit tired.   
 

Q.  Was she up 4-1 or 4-2 in the first?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I think it was 4-2,.  Not 4-1, I don't  think.   
 

Q.  Could you feel her getting tired in the  second or; you were starting to play better?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  What happened is I tried to play just  the same, tried to, you know -- because against  her, it is difficult just to hit the ball hard  because she plays so high and with so much topspin  that it is really difficult, so, I tried to not  make any mistake and try to play even harder if I  could, but -- and then she start making a little  bit more mistakes because I think she was a little  bit tired, I don't know.   
 

Q.  Were you more confident after winning  the first set tiebreaker?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, of course I -- confidence -- you  are there fighting the whole set; then you win the  set 7-6, of course that gives you a lot of  confidence for the second set.
