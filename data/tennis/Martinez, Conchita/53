Q.  Comment on the way you played today.

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm very happy with the way I played today.  She is a very good player, she hits the ball hard and, you know, she's comes to the net.  She's a good player and, you know, I think I play a very good match.


Q.  A little bit of a struggle in the second set?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.  I think she played pretty deep and she was coming to the net.


Q.  How did you feel; pretty good, no injuries or anything like that?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No.


Q.  Do you feel pretty much in control out there even despite the second game?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I think -- yeah, I feel like I was in control of the match pretty much the whole match.  You know, the second set I was very close but, you know, I was feeling pretty good.


Q.  How do you feel about playing Majoli again?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: All right.  I just finish my match so I didn't even think about it. But I'm fine.


Q.  Was the last time you played in Barcelona?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.


Q.  And she won?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.


Q.  Do you consider yourself a claycourter?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.  I think I'm an all-court player.  I mean I play very good on all surfaces so, you know.


Q.  Have you had much of a chance to look at the draw to see who's left?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, I don't look at the draws.


Q.  Is that typical, you don't look ahead?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No.  I mean, I don't care.  I just play the player that I have to play.  I don't have to see who's winning or who's losing.  It's the same for me.


Q.  Has it always been that way for you?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.  Maybe before I was looking some more, but not really.


Q.  What did she do in Barcelona the last time she beat you; can you describe it at all?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't remember very much.  I know that I wasn't playing that good and especially mentally I wasn't.  She's a good player and she's very aggressive so it's going to be a good match.


Q.  Straight sets?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: When?


Q.  Barcelona.

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.


Q.  Is she a pretty tough player to play?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, since that time I didn't play against her. She's very tough.


Q.  She's kind of aggressive?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Very aggressive.


Q.  Do you think you have to play more aggressively then to beat her since she is an aggressive player? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Kind of mixing up the balls, some high balls.  We have to see.  Maybe like for me to be aggressive I have to mix the play.


Q.  After two matches how do you think you stand; your chances of repeating?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, still a long way to go.  I mean, I'm in quarterfinals and, you know, Majoli is a tough match so I go match by match and we wait.
