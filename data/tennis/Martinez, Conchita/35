Q. Was it as easy as it looked. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I don't know. The only thing I know is I played great tennis out there. I was concentrating in the whole match, willing to win all the points. That was my job and I did it.  
 
Q. What's your confidence level like at this point? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, right now I'm pretty confident. I mean, I'm playing some good tennis here at the Open. I played great my first four matches. Now I just have to keep going, do it one more time, you know, my next match.
