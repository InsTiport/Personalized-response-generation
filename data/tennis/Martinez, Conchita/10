CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I had really good matches against her. You know, I had to play with a lot of patience, like I did tonight. Hit a lot of topspin, wait for the short ball, dominate with my forehand. I think I did that good tonight. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I always had tough matches at the beginning of the tournaments. You have to get your rhythm. The first match I almost lost. I mean, I was losing in the second set. I don't know, I didn't feel like I was playing my best tennis. But then I got two matches in me and I started playing much better, became more comfortable with my game. I think the last two matches I played really, really well and I've been feeling the court a little bit better than the first two. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, definitely I'm playing much more consistent. I didn't start very well in Australia. I play much better in Qatar and Dubai. Here it's just great to be in the semifinals again, in a Tier I. Yeah, I'm playing very good tennis. Hopefully I can keep it up. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, if I play my game and I play good tennis, I know I can do very well. I actually, you know, go without with a game plan. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, definitely I have to play a little bit more aggressive because Clijsters is going to hit the ball much harder than Coetzer. She's going to try to keep hitting hard and moving me and everything, so I can just not play high balls. I mean, there's no way I'm going to go out there and play serve and volley. I still going to do my game but try -- we'll see. I just finish this one. I'm still not there yet. I'm sure I'll be ready for it tomorrow. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, you can say that, that it is power. I mean, everybody hits the ball harder. There's a lot of young players out there. Yeah, like you said, there's not many players left in the game that play like me. I mean, there was more years before. But I guess it's just the way it is, the way that tennis is playing right now. Everybody's very fit and hitting the ball hard. I mean, it's a disappointment. Particularly I like a little bit more variety. But, you know, that's just the way it is. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I know, like I say, if I play good tennis and I use my shots the right way, many people don't like to play against me. Yeah, there's not many players left that play like me. Many players play the same, just hitting, hitting. They used to that. But, you know, it takes a lot of effort to play the way I play. Playing against young players like right now, be ready for all of those matches. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't remember. That was kind of weird to finish the match like that. I was really happy to go to the semifinals, but you sort of don't want to celebrate after a shot like that. No, I don't remember. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm 30 still (smiling). Don't give me more. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Is it? Gee! I mean, it does mean a lot. For me it's very important to play at this level, playing against -- well, today, no, because Amanda is my age or a little bit more. Yeah, I mean, it's great to be in the semifinals of a Tier I, playing great tennis after, I don't know, 14, 15 years. It's great. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah. It's taken a long time. I mean, coming back from when I was injured with my Achilles, I mean, I was six months out. It took like a long time. I mean, just now I'm feeling like I'm coming back. You know, your rhythm, everything. But, yeah, definitely work is paying off right now and I'm really happy. I mean, I'm coming back, I'm getting my ranking back. I mean, I'm not going to stop right here. I mean, I feel very good, with a lot of chances to still do good. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was my right Achilles. I got treatment for both basically. They're still both not in the greatest shape, but they're holding up. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I remember one final, the one I play Steffi. That one I remember. The other one I didn't. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm not sure. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I remember Steffi. The other one, who was it? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, it is. Definitely playing Steffi or playing people like you play at the moment, it's totally whole different generation. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Definitely I feel very good physically. I think, I mean, I'm in a good shape. You have to be in a good shape to keep up with all the hard-hitters. You know, I always try to improve. I try to play more aggressive, variate (sic) my game, always try to do the same but definitely a little bit better. Sometimes it works and sometimes is not so good. At least you keep trying. If it works like this, it's really nice. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I'm sure she's playing great tennis right now. I mean, she's one of the players that is playing the best tennis right now. It's going to be very tough. It's been a long time since I haven't play her, so I don't really know what to expect, I mean, other than she's going to hit the ball very hard. You know, she's a great player. Hopefully I can play my game and play some good tennis and keep up with her. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, that's my game, that's the way I play. I always try to do that different slice or different topspin. If I feel confident with my forehand, I win a lot of points with my forehand. I have to be aggressive and try to prepare the points so I have short balls to finish with my forehand. That's sort of my game plan. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, yeah. When I'm not injured, it's great to practice, it's great to feel good and win matches. Do I enjoy it more? I always enjoy winning and I always -- I mean, winning matches, it's a great, great feeling. I don't know. I mean right now, yeah, because being injured and having to come back, I mean, it's more rewarding, I guess. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I was a little bit disappointed to know itself going to play at 12. Being an oldy like me, we don't recover as fast (smiling). Hopefully I'll do the best I can, that's all I can say.
