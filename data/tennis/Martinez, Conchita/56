Q.  Conchita, what was the problem physically in the third set when you went over to the umpire? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I don't know how -- if you would understand in English, I thought it was a stitch; do you know what it is?  
 

Q.  Your stomach? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yes, and I couldn't breathe, so that's only what happened.  
 

Q.  Stomach problems? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No, it is a stitch.  I don't know.  It was difficult for me to breath and I couldn't reach up on my serve, and so, I just needed it to breathe and take my time, but it was so painful that I couldn't breathe.  After three points, it was better.  
 

Q.  Would you describe it-- maybe the best way to describe it is like a pinched nerve? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Describe the pain?  
 

Q.  I know what it means, but describe it. 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  It is not a muscle, you know, like when you drink water and you don't have enough air, it's, like, funny.  
 

Q.  At any point were you worried you wouldn't be able to continue? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No, I just need to breathe, but it was painful to breathe, so I need a little bit of time, and I -- I mean I thought of -- I went to the umpire to ask if I could call the trainer in the middle of the game just in case I couldn't serve.  And after two points, I was getting better, so, I thought, just keep going.  
 

Q.  What was going through your mind after five match points had come and gone and she got back to 5-4 and serving? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  You know, I mean, I was fighting the whole match and after I was playing quite well and, you know, I had so many match points that I didn't make and I thought, maybe have to put the first serve in because I only put the first serve in in the last match point, and so, that's gives her a little bit more of a chance and -- I don't know, I just thought -- try to play concentrate. At 5-4, just try to return and play concentrate and don't make mistakes, and of course, I played it perfect.  
 

Q.  What happened in the first set? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I was tense, maybe nervous, and I made so many mistakes.  I couldn't move and, you know, just from the tension.  
 

Q.  Conchita, what were you looking at during the changeover; you were reading something? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yeah, I mean, some notes that I have to do when I'm nervous.  
 

Q.  About tennis or -- 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yes, about tennis and psychological--  
 

Q.  Did it help? 
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  You can tell me, I mean, I was losing and then I won, so of course it helped.
