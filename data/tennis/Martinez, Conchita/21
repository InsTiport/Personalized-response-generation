CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was just a blister. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Uh-huh. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Oh, nothing. When I covered it up, it was okay. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I just answered that. It was a blister on my toe. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know, one of them. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I was more aggressive. Went for my shots a little bit more. Tried to play deep. That worked pretty well. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think she was on and off. She was really, really aggressive in the first set, going for her shots a lot. Really didn't let me do anything. I was not getting to the ball fast enough. I think the second set, I moved better. Then all of a sudden, I mean, I couldn't -- some of the games were tight and I couldn't put her away. She played well, didn't make any mistakes. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. I mean, I always thought that I could win it. It was pretty close, but I think she played those games pretty well. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. I mean, I play well. I'm not very happy the way I started playing, you know. If you play her like this, you can't give her so much advantage in the first set. I think it was over, I don't know, less than half an hour. You have to try to stay really aggressive and hopefully I can do that next time.
