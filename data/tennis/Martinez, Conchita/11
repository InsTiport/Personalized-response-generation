CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I think the Williams sisters are very strong right now and they're pretty much on a roll. They've been playing very good in all kinds of surfaces. But, you know, that can change. I mean, I'm sure that -- you know, everybody has ups and downs. It's very difficult to stay up there for a long period of time. And we'll see. But right now I see them being very, very strong. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, definitely. I mean, they are very strong physically and very well-prepared. I mean, yeah, they can play in every surface. (Inaudible) Their strengths are better. They're hitting the ball very hard. They definitely have an advantage, but of course they've been working for that, too.
