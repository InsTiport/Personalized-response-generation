CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I think I have to do my game, no? Try to change the rhythm, play with a lot of topspin. I think I started out slow. After, you know, I could play my slice. I don't think she likes it. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah. I think, yeah, it went well. You know, the results says. I'm pleased. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Oh, yeah. I mean, I had a really tough first round. And this was a very tough second round. You know, probably that first match helped me, helped my game, you know, to be ready for a tough second round. You know, of course, I'm ready for the quarterfinals. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She likes to hit the ball really hard. You know, I'm not going to overpower her because, you know, that's not my game. That would be not good if I will try to hit everything. So, you know, I don't think she like my slice. I was trying to move the ball and play low slice, a lot of topspin with my forehand, and wait for the short ball to hit winners. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, maybe. I mean, maybe -- you know, she's had to play Rubin, which plays heart like her. I think they like to play like that, you know, just hit the ball and all that. If you can -- if you're able to change the pace and the rhythm, this then, you know, it's good that you can confuse them. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Compare? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think she's a good player. She's a great player. I mean, Hingis probably plays more smart. I mean, she plays the right shot all the time. You know, she's still young and she can learn that, but she has the shots. I mean, she's probably needs a little bit more patience.
