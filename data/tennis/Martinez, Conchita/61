Q.  Conchita,, a little bit of a surprise  today?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Not at all.  I mean, I don't think I  was surprised at all.  I knew that she is a good  player, that she can play well.  I had my chances  to finish the match in two sets, but I didn't,  because I started playing a little bit too  passive, and she was hitting the ball well, but I  know she can play well.   
 

Q.  Could you tell us about your foot  problems?  What was going on?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I just have two big blisters.  They  were bothering me a lot.   
 

Q.  One on each foot?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yeah. Normally I had only on the left  foot and another one was coming, so we have to  tape that one.   
 

Q.  When did that start bothering you?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  In the second set, right.  I don't  know, 5-4 or something.  At the end of the second  set.   
 

Q.  How did the blister affect your play?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, when they hurt, they hurt, you  know.   
 

Q.  Was it hard to concentrate or move or  anything?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Sometimes when I was slicing, it was  pulling my skin.  I can show you if you want -  big.   
 

Q.  Was there a point where you thought  about not continuing?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  No.  I mean, for a blister, you can fix  it.  They just put the padding around and after  she did that, it was better.  Then the other one  came, so I had to do it again.   
 

Q.  First time forced you into the  tiebreaker --  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yeah. She had to do it really in a  hurry.  She came to see if everything was okay  and, of course, it is better when she has a little  bit more time, but it is difficult when she has to  hurry so much.   
 

Q.  Did the timeout stop your momentum,  when your feet were being looked at?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Probably.  I don't know.  It was hard  for me to continue in 6-5, but probably I should  continuing because after the timeout that I take,  it was difficult because I was a little bit cold  and I lost that game straight-a-way, easy, and  then I lost the tiebreaker, but, I mean, I had to  do it because I couldn't continue.  It was really  painful.   
 

Q.  How much confidence do you have going  into the finals now?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Oh, a lot.  It is good.  I needed this  final; it is good for my ranking.  It is good for  everything.  I have a lot of confidence.  I have  to play with Natasha.  She is a really good  player.  She is making really good results at the  moment and I know it is going to be another tough  match, so I have to just fight and fight and try  to win the match.   
 

Q.  How have you done against her in the  past?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, we play a couple of times and I  don't know, I just-- I hardly remember, but we  played once this year in Australian Open.  I beat  her, but it was really hard.  I think it was 6-4,  7-5 in the third.  She is a tough opponent.   
 

Q.  Second time the trainer came out, was  she treating your right foot, the second time?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Yeah.   
 

Q.  Did you expect Iva to be as streaky as  she was today?  It seems that she would hit five,  six errors in a row; then come up with four, five  winners in a row, is that typical of her?  
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I don't know.  I haven't seen her.  I  didn't see her play that much, I don't know, but  she can play well and made some mistakes like you  just said, but you know, I think I played a little  bit short in the second set, so that is why she  was coming in with her forehand.  I had to move  her a little bit more, but I was - I don't know -  I was -- my arm was a little bit shaky and I  couldn't just play my best in there or play long  balls.  I was playing a little bit too short and  she has good strokes from the baseline.
