CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I did. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, not at all. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: 10. I was practicing at 10:30. Half hour or less. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was quite a strange match. She's a strange player because she make a lot of mistakes, then make unbelievable points. She might serve you two aces and then a double-fault. You have to really concentrate on the opportunities that you have, try to keep the ball in the court. She doesn't give you a lot of breathers. It was difficult. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. I didn't even think about it. Now that you point it out, she has done well here. The only thing I was concentrating was on my game, trying to be, like I said, aggressive, take my opportunities, make her play. She play weird today. She want to put pressure on me, but she didn't start serve and volleying. It was all over the place. Even though I'm satisfied the way I played, it was also difficult with the shade and sun. It was hard to see. You were losing the balls sometimes. The most important thing that I'm in the fourth round. Hopefully I can play good tennis in the next match. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I'm fine. I'm not happy, I'm not sad. I just do my own thing, concentrate on my tennis, concentrate on the tournament. You're taking notice of me. I'm happy that you do. The most important thing is to play tennis, be happy.
