CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm not sure yet. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: What's that? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. Actually, one of the worst years. I mean, I had a couple good tournaments, but after that, not much. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think I started playing really good but mentally I didn't -- I didn't hang in there, you know, for the whole match. She started playing a little better, and then I started playing worse, too, making unforced errors. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm sure if you're used to it, it doesn't bother you as much. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: A little bit. It's humid and we're not used to that. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: The next is... I'm thinking. I'm not sure yet. I mean, I have a couple tournaments in the fall. But until that, I have a big break. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I have like until Luxembourg is my next tournament. So I have I don't know if it's a month or something. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Of course. I mean, it's not nice to lose in a first round of a Grand Slam. I mean, it's not the first time it happened; Wimbledon was and Australian Open, I think, was first round, too. So it is disappointing. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: 6-Love, yeah. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: And then what? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Do you know the score or no? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She started playing better and I started making more unforced errors. The second set, I mean, the first three, four games she started playing more aggressive. I thought I didn't last mentally.
