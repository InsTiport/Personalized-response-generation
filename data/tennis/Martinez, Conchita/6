Q. I suppose this is the last year you'll be playing here. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm not sure yet.  
 
Q. You keep firing. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: What's that?  
 
Q. You've had a good year, actually. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. Actually, one of the worst years. I mean, I had a couple good tournaments, but after that, not much.  
 
Q. What was your problem today? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think I started playing really good but mentally I didn't -- I didn't hang in there, you know, for the whole match. She started playing a little better, and then I started playing worse, too, making unforced errors.  
 
Q. With your home in California, your part-time home there, does this humidity bother you more, do you suppose, than it would somebody who's more used to it? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I'm sure if you're used to it, it doesn't bother you as much.  
 
Q. Did it bother you today? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: A little bit. It's humid and we're not used to that.  
 
Q. What's next for you? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: The next is... I'm thinking. I'm not sure yet. I mean, I have a couple tournaments in the fall. But until that, I have a big break.  
 
Q. You gonna take a big break now? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I have like until Luxembourg is my next tournament. So I have I don't know if it's a month or something.  
 
Q. I get the feeling you're very disappointed by losing this match. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Of course. I mean, it's not nice to lose in a first round of a Grand Slam. I mean, it's not the first time it happened; Wimbledon was and Australian Open, I think, was first round, too. So it is disappointing.  
 
Q. Forgive me, I walked in late. You won the first set. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: 6-Love, yeah.  
 
Q. And then? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: And then what?  
 
Q. Then what happened to your game? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Do you know the score or no?  
 
Q. I know you lost the next two sets. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She started playing better and I started making more unforced errors. The second set, I mean, the first three, four games she started playing more aggressive. I thought I didn't last mentally.
