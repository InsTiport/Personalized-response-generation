Q.  You've always struggled against Jana before.  Did you figure this would be another tough match for you?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I mean, very tough player, especially indoors.  She has a very good serve.  She's very aggressive; comes to the net.  And I knew this one was going to be tough.  But I have a lot of chances there.  And, you know, my serve would break her.  So, you know, I kind of blue my chances today, because I could have won that match.


Q.  I'm sure this has been a difficult year for you with the injuries.  Do you think you settled down now and will have a better season in '98?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I'm happy this year's over. I mean, I've been very unlucky, like you said, with the injuries and a few matches that I should have won, so, you know, confidence kind of goes.  And then when you're, like, again, my summer was very good for me, I was playing very good, and then I got injured again.  So it's been a really roller coaster year.


Q.  You think Jana is playing the best you've ever seen her or not necessarily?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, this year has been a very good year for her.


Q.  Today.

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Today she played very good match, I thought. I mean, she was very determined.  She was coming in very deep and serving well when she had to.  So she's been playing well.
