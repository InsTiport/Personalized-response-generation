THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  I was wondering about your ankle.  You had that wrapped.  Was it just rewrapping? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Sorry? 

Q.  What happens with your ankle?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  I have an Achilles sprain. 


Q.  It is just a matter of rewrapping it?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Sorry? 

Q.  You just needed to get it rewrapped? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, it's one thing that she said it might help to rewrap.  Not to rewrap, to wrap it, and so how that was going.  That didn't really help much.  You know, I have pain during the whole match.  I just couldn't move very well.  So after the first set, all I tried was to hit the ball as hard as I could and serve as hard as I could so I could maybe dictate with my forehand. But I could only move one way.  To come back or to fight for points was pretty difficult. 

Q.  When did you injure it?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  It's kind of a chronic thing I have.  It's been worse for the last week, getting worse every day. 

Q.  Is that going to change your plans for Miami?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, I'm going to see how I wake up tomorrow and reassess. 

Q.  Changing that tactic seemed to work for you the second set. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I hit some great shots out there, you know.  It was difficult.  I mean, my forehand was going fast.  I serve unbelievable, too.  Yeah, it did work.  The second set I was on a point where I was almost going to quit.  You know, it seemed that that was working.  You know, I just try my best with knowing there's only that much I could do. 

Q.  How would you assess Kim's play so far?

CONCHITA MARTINEZ:  Oh, she's playing well.  I mean, I think she did some unforced errors.  But, I mean, great comeback.  You know, she's I think playing better and better every match.  It's not easy to come back after such a big time off with injury and stuff.  You need your matches to get match tough, and she's doing well.
