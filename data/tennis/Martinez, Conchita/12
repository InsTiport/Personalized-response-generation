CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Obviously, she's having a great year. She's playing a lot of tournaments. She's playing some great tennis. She's a great player. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know who has advantage. I mean, she's better seeded than me. You know, I think if I play some good tennis, I have a lot of chances. But it's an open match. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, that helps. I mean, I'm playing with a lot of confidence. I'm feeling great on grass. Hopefully, the weather can keep like this and I'll be happy.
