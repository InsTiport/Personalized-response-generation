CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I felt like I played up and down. I had my chances in the first set. I have so many set balls in that 5-4 and I think I have 15-40 and I didn't take that. Little bit too passive on my returns. In the tiebreak, it was really up and down. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was a little bit uphill after that. I think I was thinking a lot on the first set and missing those opportunities and then I think my balls were not as - she was hitting them really hard. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, maybe a little bit. But she played well. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Not at all. She is a player that hits the ball -- hits every ball very hard and I just think I played too much at her -- I couldn't get the rhythm and the pace of the ball. Normally if you change a little bit the topspin, which is my game, I would have a better chance, but just hitting-- (inaudible) 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, I think this is my least favorite surface and indoor. It is a very tough, very tough to do well because it is only 16 players and they are the best. From the first round you get a very, very tough round and you have to be really ready. And, like I said, I mean, playing indoors, it is not my game. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It is very hard to keep the year going so long. It is very hard because we don't have an off-season. We end the year in November, what, 22nd, and then we have to start in January. It is like: Go, go, go. By the end of the year, any player -- mostly any player you ask, they are either burned out or injured. So I think it is very, very hard to keep your concentration up until this tournament being so important and, I don't know, I think it is to late to play a tournament. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It was -- I mean, at the beginning of the year it was great and until, I think until Wimbledon was pretty good, much better than last year - winning a Tier I in Berlin and all that. I was playing pretty good tennis. Then after Wimbledon then not very good. But what I have to improve is being consistent with the whole year which I have always been and past two years have not. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Sydney. That is going to be my first tournament.
