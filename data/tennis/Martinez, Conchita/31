CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I think it was a tough match and could go either way. And Iva played well in the important points and she beat me. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I just thought the umpire was very unfair to me. And sometimes I feel like they have all the power and first of all she made an unbelievable call in 5-All in the tiebreak, and I think sometimes they should see the replay, and they should get fined, not only us. And after that, I mean, I throw the racket. The racket didn't break at all, but she just was very unfair today, I think. And then after that she gave me a penalty point, I don't know, I cannot say. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know, I just think she was tired. And when you're tired finally you can't recover and you can't breathe. I had that before. And I didn't think she was going to be tired. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I didn't know.
