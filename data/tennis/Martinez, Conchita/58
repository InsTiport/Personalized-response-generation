Q. Conchita, were you a little surprised at how well she played? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I never played against her, but I think it was just nothing,
she was hitting -- she was missing like that far or making unbelievable shots. So it was
kind of difficult. She didn't give me any rhythm, so, what can you do. 

Q. Do you find that the surface is playing slower than in years past? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I have to tell you, I haven't played on this court very much. So, I
don't know. It looks quite fast there. It is not that slow. 

Q. How do you rate your chances on this court and in this tournament? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I like to go slowly and match by match, and I have some pretty
good match, everybody can play and, of course, I'm the third seeded and I'm going to do my
best to go and keep going in the tournament, but you have to play well here in New York to
get to the finals or the semis. 

Q. Do you like the atmosphere here? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: The City is really difficult to concentrate. Like on the changeovers
and when the players are ready to serve, everybody is still moving, a lot of people, and
speaking loud and so it's quite difficult to concentrate. It depends if they go for you,
it's great, but if they don't go for you -- you lost, so, but it's okay. 

Q. Since Wimbledon, have you become closer in popularity in Spain to Arantxa? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: In Spain I was always popular. I didn't have any problem in Spain.
The most different was in the rest of the world. In the States and I don't know, in Europe
maybe, now. I'm not going to compare Arantxa, but I'm more well known now.
