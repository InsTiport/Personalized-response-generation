Q. Your thoughts on playing Jelena Dokic in the next round? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, it's gonna be a tough match. I mean she's a great player and she's playing good tennis. So, you know, just got to play my game and try to play aggressive and try to win the match.  
 
Q. Psychologically do you feel you have an advantage on her? You've beaten her in all your previous matches. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, that always helps, but I mean this is a whole new match and it's gonna be tough for sure.
