 Q. Conchita, how has winning Wimbledon affected you? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I was thought it was a great win and I felt really good after that
and especially with the confidence, you know, I keep playing, and it is great when you
always have a good win. It's like you can do anything.  
 
Q. Is that how you felt today? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I felt pretty good. It's good to play the first match in a
tournament, and you advance now, you get a little bit nervous. Tough to get my rhythm back
because I haven't played for two weeks or something. So it's always difficult to play next
round at this match.  
 
Q. Do you think you can win the whole thing? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It's so far away that I don't even want to think about it. I see,
and I have to go match by match and I have to play well here, but you never know. I prefer
not to talk.  
 
Q. When surface to you like best? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I like any kind of surface. I feel comfortable in any kind. I'm
getting used to hardcourt and fast surfaces. Before was clay and now I can play on all
fast surfaces, so it's great when you can play on all surface.  
 
Q. Have you changed your game any for this surface? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think I improved my serve a little bit. I tried to don't go so
quick on my motion or whatever you call it. I try to make a little stop and then, you
know, work more with my legs and get more power, and everything is more quiet and, I mean,
I feel really comfortable today.  
 
Q. How do you like playing here at the U.S. Open? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It's all right. It's difficult. I don't know, I never play my best
tennis here at the U.S. Open, but, you know, maybe too many distractions, you have to
really concentrate and be ready, ready mentally for this tournament and I'm working on it.
I was working in Barcelona, to get concentrate and, I guess, I think I'm more prepared
now.  
 
Q. Did you watch the tape of the Wimbledon final? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Not the whole tape, no, I didn't have enough time, because, after
Wimbledon I only have ten days and they were really busy, and I went to play for one month
or more. And then when I came back from the States, I only had like ten days again, and
you know, it's like, if you practice and everything.  
 
Q. So, what part did you watch the end -- 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: The last set. The last set it was really exciting.  
 
Q. Did you like the result? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's difficult -- for me it's difficult to see
myself on television. It's like, oh, so, I have great feelings of that match and, you
know, I keep that inside.  
 
Q. Did you watch the Spanish version or the BBC? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No--  
 
Q. How many times did you see it? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Not much.  
 
Q. Why do you think Spaniards are doing so well this year? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Everybody asks the same question. I have no idea. We are all playing
good, but I don't know why.  
 
Q. Even golf Masters was won by a Spaniard? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Sorry?  
 
Q. Even golf. 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: We're having a great moment in sports in Spain. I think we have
great athletes and it's great.
