Q.  Can you just talk about the way the match started off and how it turned around?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I didn't start very well the first set and then I start coming back and fighting and tried to play every ball and then, you know, everything turned around. 
 

Q.  You didn't start well but you had to be pretty -- I mean, she went for almost all the lines and she was hitting --
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah, she was hitting pretty good and you -- but I was making too many mistakes but, you know, after that, after hitting the ball a little bit more over the net and she started missing, so that can be little faults that she play better I think but... 
 

Q.  Were you bothered at all by the weight and the conditions out there?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah.  Yeah, especially about the conditions.  The court was terrible.  The balls didn't bounce, the balls were getting wet all the time from the water on the plants and all that, so I was very, like, very -- not concentrated because was all that. 
 

Q.  When you hit your shoe with the racket, was that because you were mad or trying to get clay off your shoes?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Both. 
 

Q.  Was it getting pretty hard to see out there, is that why you had asked --
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Right now, yeah.  I can't see anything. 
 

Q.  When you were down 3-Love in the second set did you think oh, well, this is, you know -- she's got me today?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, if I would have think that I would have lost 6-2, 6-Love, so that's why I'm here because I didn't think that.  I kept fighting and, you know, tried to win that match. 
 

Q.  Looked like your best shot today seemed to be when you had a short angle, you know, on your forehand, that seemed to be an effective shot.
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah. 
 

Q.  What do you think your chances are against competition?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Huh? 
 

Q.  What do you think your chances are of winning overall?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Oh, I don't know, I still have to play semifinals tomorrow and, you know, it's playing match by match and try to play like today, fighting every ball and never giving up. 
 

Q.  Do you have any comment about Arantxa pulling out of the --
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Do I have what? 
 

Q.  Any comment about Arantxa pulling out of the tournament?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, the only thing like I say that, you know, I saw it on television and it looked pretty bad to me and, you know, she pulls out because she's really hurt because, you know, as we saw yesterday she tried to play and she won that match  hurting so much so, you know, it's pretty bad. 
 

Q.  Players know pretty much when they have to stop.  I mean, they don't usually --
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I mean, she didn't play, especially her, if it's because she had a lot of pain. 
 

Q.  Feel like that opens the door for you?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She wasn't on my side so I still have another player to beat again for the finals. 
 

Q.  Were you a little surprised that she continued on?  It really looked like she turned that over --
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think she was lucky that it already was taped and that helped her because -- I mean, I saw it on television in slow motion and no way.  And probably because it was, like, warm she could continue.  But I saw today, it was swollen and I'm sure it was bad. 
 

Q.  You saw her today then?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yeah. 
 

Q.  When, this morning you saw her?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, after. 
 

Q.  Did she seem to be moving -- I mean, walking pretty well?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She was sitting.  She was sitting. 
 

Q.  Your doubles partner seems to have a very good sense of humor.  She related to the crowd well. Does that help you?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: She's great. 
 

Q.  Does it wreck your concentration?
 
CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, no, no, she's great. She needs that -- she always wants that we have a lot of fun together and it's great to play with her.
