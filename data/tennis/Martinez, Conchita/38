CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I had won the first set without playing well. I didn't play well, and I won the first one. And I failed a lot, I did a lot of bad maneuvers, and I was very, very tense. And she knew how to attack and I'm not very happy how I reacted. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I would have perhaps had a better opportunity if I had played in a different manner. My level of play was very low. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, everyone has seen why. When something doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. I will try not to ever let it happen again. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, I was just very tense. I was slow with my arms and I didn't attack. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: A little, yes. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It has lasted a long time, but you have to be ready for all types of games. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, but I didn't go through with them. I wanted length and height. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, they're two different stories, nothing to do, one with the other. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I started off tense and she made a few mistakes at the beginning, but afterwards she caught up with me. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, I always have the hope of winning, but she was a -- she played very well, and there was nothing to do. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, one time I had a 3-0, but I never give anything for lost, it's very difficult. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, I think she will. She knows how to play very well. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Doubles have nothing to do with today, it's an entirely different thing. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know, it could be, because I was tense. I don't know why I was tense. Perhaps the public, but she also looked tense to me. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: We didn't give the public any motive to be angry at us, so we didn't take it personally. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yesterday was different, the crowd wasn't at fault. They had the right to do what they did. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I still have doubles. I'm going to be here. There's a good chance I will stick around for a while.
