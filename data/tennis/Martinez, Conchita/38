Q. Can you explain why you lost? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I had won the first set without playing well. I didn't play well, and I won the first one. And I failed a lot, I did a lot of bad maneuvers, and I was very, very tense. And she knew how to attack and I'm not very happy how I reacted.  
 
Q. What is your reaction to the loss? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I would have perhaps had a better opportunity if I had played in a different manner. My level of play was very low.  
 
Q. Why? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, everyone has seen why. When something doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. I will try not to ever let it happen again.  
 
Q. What about the heat? Has the heat affected you? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, I was just very tense. I was slow with my arms and I didn't attack.  
 
Q. Your right hand is your best side when that fails you, do you get nervous? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: A little, yes.  
 
Q. The game was very long, how did this affect you? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It has lasted a long time, but you have to be ready for all types of games.  
 
Q. Did you have any tactics planned? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, but I didn't go through with them. I wanted length and height.  
 
Q. Does this affect your morale for the doubles? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, they're two different stories, nothing to do, one with the other.  
 
Q. Were you not able to relax in between the sets? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, I started off tense and she made a few mistakes at the beginning, but afterwards she caught up with me.  
 
Q. Did you lose the hope of winning? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No, I always have the hope of winning, but she was a -- she played very well, and there was nothing to do.  
 
Q. Do you ever remember having a game where you were -- the scoring was so far off from your opponent? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, one time I had a 3-0, but I never give anything for lost, it's very difficult.  
 
Q. What do you think of Arantxa, how she plays? Do you think she'll get to the finals? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yes, I think she will. She knows how to play very well.  
 
Q. What about doubles tomorrow? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Doubles have nothing to do with today, it's an entirely different thing.  
 
Q. The American public, fans, they were cheering for Mary Joe Fernandez, and not for you, and did it cause you to be more tense? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know, it could be, because I was tense. I don't know why I was tense. Perhaps the public, but she also looked tense to me.  
 
Q. What about the riot of the other day? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: We didn't give the public any motive to be angry at us, so we didn't take it personally.  
 
Q. Cheers. Do you have any bad feelings against the person you lost to? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: No.  
 
Q. It just wasn't your day? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Yesterday was different, the crowd wasn't at fault. They had the right to do what they did.  
 
Q. Are you going to stay around to watch the Olympics? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I still have doubles. I'm going to be here. There's a good chance I will stick around for a while.
