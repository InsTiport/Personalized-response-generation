CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Just keep playing, keep fighting, you know. Actually, I don't know, I had to think about it, but probably like in the first set I was hitting a lot of slice and she was missing. Suddenly I started playing high balls, and they were really deep. I started playing short, and she was hitting the ball very hard. At the end I started hitting slice again, tried to hit it deep. It worked. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I remember three. I don't know about the others. Five. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It's going to be a tough one. I mean, I played a long match tonight and have to go out there and play tomorrow a game. I'm just going to try to do everything possible to be ready tomorrow. This match is going to help me a lot because I played a lot of points. It was great. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. I don't really know. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think, like I said, I started hitting short balls instead of hitting it deep. Also I think I was going -- I had so many chances, so many advantages, didn't really take them. Probably I was playing with not a lot of patience, you know, I wasn't patient enough. At the end I started trying to not miss, hit slices, hit my forehand, try to hit it deep, try to move her around. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. Like I said, I don't know -- it felt to me that hitting slices, cross-court, cross-court, sometimes changing it down the line, she didn't like that and made some mistakes. I have to think it was that. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: They were out of control, actually. Yeah, I mean. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, you just got to play your game. They're young and they got to learn how to be, got to learn. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Sorry? 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I've been drink ago lot of water. You have to drink a lot. With this heat, you can get dehydrated. 

CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. A liter. I'm not sure.
