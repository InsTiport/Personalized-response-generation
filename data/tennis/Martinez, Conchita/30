Q. Conchita, how did you do that? How did you come back actually in this match? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Just keep playing, keep fighting, you know. Actually, I don't know, I had to think about it, but probably like in the first set I was hitting a lot of slice and she was missing. Suddenly I started playing high balls, and they were really deep. I started playing short, and she was hitting the ball very hard. At the end I started hitting slice again, tried to hit it deep. It worked.  
 
Q. How many match points did she actually miss? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know.  
 
Q. Do you know? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know.  
 
Q. A few? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I remember three. I don't know about the others. Five.  
 
Q. Tomorrow is Mary Joe. What do you think about that? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: It's going to be a tough one. I mean, I played a long match tonight and have to go out there and play tomorrow a game. I'm just going to try to do everything possible to be ready tomorrow. This match is going to help me a lot because I played a lot of points. It was great.  
 
Q. What's your score with her, playing? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. I don't really know.  
 
Q. Conchita, what happened mentally when you were down 5-2? What changed? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I think, like I said, I started hitting short balls instead of hitting it deep. Also I think I was going -- I had so many chances, so many advantages, didn't really take them. Probably I was playing with not a lot of patience, you know, I wasn't patient enough. At the end I started trying to not miss, hit slices, hit my forehand, try to hit it deep, try to move her around.  
 
Q. Is there anything she changed at that point that made it easier for you? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. Like I said, I don't know -- it felt to me that hitting slices, cross-court, cross-court, sometimes changing it down the line, she didn't like that and made some mistakes. I have to think it was that.  
 
Q. I wanted to ask a question about your doubles match with Williams. Seemed pretty animated on court. Did that bother you at all? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: They were out of control, actually. Yeah, I mean.  
 
Q. Does that affect you at all or can you ignore it? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Well, you just got to play your game. They're young and they got to learn how to be, got to learn.  
 
Q. How much water have you consumed, if you had to guess in a day? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: Sorry?  
 
Q. How much water do you think you've been drinking in a day? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I've been drink ago lot of water. You have to drink a lot. With this heat, you can get dehydrated.  
 
Q. A gallon? 
 
 CONCHITA MARTINEZ: I don't know. A liter. I'm not sure.
