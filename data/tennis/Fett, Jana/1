THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about the whole experience in the final.   
JANA FETT:   Well, it was great playing on Rod Laver.   Such an amazing feeling.   I wish I could play better.   It wasn't my best tennis.  
But I gave my best today and lose a played very, very well.   It's okay.   Doesn't matter.  
   
 Q.   How were you feeling this morning before the match?  
JANA JETT:   I felt excited.   I had a bit pressure when I came, but I was happy.  
That is all that matters I think.   
   
 Q.   She did play very well...  
JANA FETT:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   But you started okay.   
JANA FETT:   Yeah, I start okay, but my serve wasn't so well and I wasn't moving as good as I did matches before.  
So I think that's the main reason I didn't give so much to like this match than before.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think that was?   
JANA FETT:   Just my legs weren't‑‑ I wasn't feeling so well with my legs and serve.   I guess because of all the pressure and it's a final, my first final of a Grand Slam, I guess that's why.  
   
 Q.   It's a tough week to get to the final.  
JANA FETT:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   That catches up with you in the end.   
JANA FETT:   Yeah, I think so.   You get tired.   
   
 Q.   But overall it's been a good week?   
JANA FETT:   Yeah, it's a great week for me.  
   
 Q.   What were you expecting when you started the week?  
JANA FETT:   I expect quarterfinals.   Yeah, that was like my, let's say‑‑ that's what I thought.   The biggest thing that can happen is quarterfinals.   
Then I played semis and final I was like, Okay, I'm so happy now.   Just relax and play.   But it was still a bit pressure.   
   
 Q.   What are your plans for the rest of the year?  
JANA FETT:   I'm not sure yet.   I would play some 10,000 and 25,000s.   I have to talk with my coach and everything.  
I think I will play Grand Slams from juniors.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   Probably not much else?  
JANA FETT:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Have you spoken to your family yet?  
JANA FETT:   No.   I will speak to them now, after.   
   
 Q.   Obviously it's disappointing to lose, but you don't sound too disappointed.   
JANA FETT:   No, it's because it's a final, it's a Grand Slam.   So it's okay.   It's not that bad.
