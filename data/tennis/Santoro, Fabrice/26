THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Can anyone beat Roger? 

FABRICE SANTORO:  It's tough to say, you know, because first of all you have to keep in touch with him, you know, with the score.  Yeah, keep in touch.  Then maybe he can start missing. But he's the best.  I mean, he's much better than anyone on the tour.  But maybe someone can beat him, yeah. 

Q.  What were your problems today, with your leg?

FABRICE SANTORO:  No, not my legs.  My first problem with Roger (laughter), and also because I have a wrist problem.  Because of this problem, I said yesterday, I went to see the doctor and I said, "Okay, I want to be able to play a real match against Roger."  So I took one antiinflammatory and I'm not used to take this kind of stuff.  So last night I was sick.  So I was feeling very, very bad stomach, you know.  Had a tough night. But that's not an excuse.
