FABRICE SANTORO: Well, you're right. At least we know what we have to do now. In our group, one team is in the semifinal, another one is out of the group. Now two teams has to fight on Friday to be able to play the semis. There is only one possibility if you want to keep going in the tournament: we just have to win.
