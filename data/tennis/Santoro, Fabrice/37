ATP: Questions, please. 


Q.  How did you feel in the third set when you were down 1-4 and Agassi it looked like he obviously came back after winning the second and then leading 4-1 in the third set, did you still -- I mean, always every player always have to think he still has a chance but how do you feel about it?

FABRICE SANTORO:  The same.  I was feeling like I have a chance to come back in the match even if the third set was -- he had a better start than me, I was feeling I have a small chance but I am going to try to take it. 

Q.  You returned fabulous today and Agassi's normally the man who returns everything.

FABRICE SANTORO:  I think it was very important point today.  Didn't really give free point with his serve.  Every ball was coming back and with  pretty slow conditions, he had some troubles to hit winners. 

Q.  You also live like some of the French players the young French players, but I think you don't live in Boca like Grosjean?

FABRICE SANTORO:  No, I live in London.
