 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
    
  Q. This is a frequent question, but is this really going to be your last season?  
 FABRICE SANTORO: Yes, it is, yeah.   
  
  Q. You'll miss Dubai, won't you?   
 FABRICE SANTORO: What?   
  
  Q. You'll miss Dubai. You've been here over a period of 17 years.   
 FABRICE SANTORO: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of normal for me to come here in February, since 17 years.   
 But I'll be 37 at the end of the year, and I think it's time to maybe try to do something else. Even if I love my job, I have to take a decision one day.  
  
  Q. Is it going to be a difficult year going to places you know that you won't go back to?   
 FABRICE SANTORO: I'll be back to Dubai. Not as a player probably, but I'll be back to Dubai. Every city, every week, is special for me, because when I land in the city, I say, it's the last check in, as a player.   
 But I was very lucky. I've been doing this for 21 years, and I feel very lucky. When I started, I never thought I could do it for more than ten years.   
  
  Q. There will be places you won't go back to; which place would you miss most?   
 FABRICE SANTORO: I will miss -- this week, I will miss Dubai. I will miss Melbourne. I will miss actually all four Grand Slam, and playing in front of the French crowd. Yes, I will miss -- what can I say? Yeah.   
  
  Q. You said you want to do something else. Do you have any plans, as yet?   
 FABRICE SANTORO: Doing something else means sleeping in my bed first. Something that's normal for you, but not for me. (Laughter).  
 Then, I will see. I have started to think about it. Nothing is fixed yet, but every day I'm thinking about it.  
  
  Q. Do you think you will still be in tennis?  
 FABRICE SANTORO: I can play one part probably in tennis and one part, I hope outside of tennis, to keep one foot in tennis, and also to see if I'm able to do something out of tennis, it's a good challenge for me.
