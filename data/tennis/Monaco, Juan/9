J. MONACO/A. Murray
  1-6, 6-3, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You looked after the first set. How did you turn things around? 
 JUAN MONACO: At the beginning I think I start very nervous. Then on the second set I start thinking to be a bit calm, start playing slow. I was trying to hit very hard the ball on the first set, and that wasn't tactic to play against Andy. 
 Then I play calm like six, seven balls every game, every point, try to make him a little bit tired. 
 Then at the final set, I trust a little bit on my game. I was playing very well the second set. That's it. I was playing well. I have the chance, and I think I played very well the last three or games.
