 A. MURRAY/J. Monaco
  6-4, 6-1 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You almost did it in the first set. So what happened?   
 JUAN MONACO: What happened? The other side was Andy Murray. So it was difficult for me.   
 I have a few chances. That moment maybe I didn't play very focus I think when I was serving 4-5 to make the 5-5. He made an unbelievable point, which his string broke. I was totally unfocused there after that. I have like five smashes and I couldn't finish the point. Then was tough for me. He broke. He won that set.   
 At the beginning of the second set, I start feeling very tired my legs and he start playing really well. So I have very few chances, that I didn't take it. I think Andy was playing very well today.
