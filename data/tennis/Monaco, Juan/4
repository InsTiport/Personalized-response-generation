THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations.   First semifinal here.   Also on your birthday.   Can you talk a little bit about what you're feeling now?  
JUAN MONACO:   It was unbelievable.   I think the way to celebrate my birthday, playing like this like I did today, feel proud and very happy for be here on my birthday and talking to you.   Very happy now.  
   
 Q.   In terms of the speed of the court, did you feel like that was favorable to your game also in terms of ‑‑because some of the outside courts are playing a little bit faster than the stadium court.   
JUAN MONACO:   No, I didn't feel much difference from the court from outside.   I mean, I play on grandstand when I play Monfils, and I play against Roddick, and today I feel the same.   
Could be because of we play after the noon, and maybe the night it's a little bit slow.   But same conditions, I guess, for me.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Djokovic/Ferrer?   
JUAN MONACO:   Tough, tough to say.   I'm very happy now.   I'm feeling great, playing well.   And both, they're such good players.   They have to play already.   I have to see the match, but I'm very friend of these two guys, so I don't know.   The winner will be the best.
