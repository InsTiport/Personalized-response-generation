CAPTAIN MECIR: It happened earlier also many times that singles players played doubles in our team. As the referee said, the doubles team may be changed one hour before the match. I don't see any problem with playing with two players. Of course, as I said before, the US team is a big favorite in this match. 

JAN KROSLAK: Yeah, I think -- I hope that we'll lose the nerves and I think we have nothing to lose and we'll put our hearts into the game and we'll fight. 

KAROL BECK: I would like to play second match, but the draw is the draw. Jan would like to play first. I would try to do my best. I am very happy that I can play against Sampras. Maybe he'll finish his career and I can tell I was playing Pete Sampras. 

KAROL BECK: It was a couple years ago and it was different player, good serves, very good forehand, he plays very good game. That's different in juniors and mens. He had a good season. 

KAROL BECK: Yes. 

JAN KROSLAK: Yeah, we wanted the black hats. We were trying the white, but we said we would like to have black because we eat like pigs and they get dirty so we would like to have a dark one. You don't have to wash it so often.
