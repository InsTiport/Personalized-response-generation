Q. What do you think about playing Mats in the next round? 

MIKAEL PERNFORS:  I wonder why I thought that question would be the first one.  I think-- I mean, I'm really going to enjoy playing him, because I really like Mats and I have a good time with him and I think we've only played once and that was WCT, Dallas, in '89.  But I think-- first of all, I think it's good to play him now so he doesn't get a couple matches under his belt, because I think if he can beat Oncins in first sets, if he gets in a groove here and starts playing well, this is probably the best time to play him.


Q. He wouldn't characterize what he's  doing right now as a comeback.  Are you on a comeback?

MIKAEL PERNFORS:  I don't know if a comeback is called a comeback when it's like the third time.  I wouldn't consider it a comeback the way he's making a comeback because I tried to play a couple times and, you know, I played-- I played some last year, so--


Q. He said in his interview-- he said his goal for this tournament was -- 
MIKAEL PERNFORS:  To beat me.


Q. Yes -- 

MIKAEL PERNFORS:  What was his goal?


Q. To play you. 

MIKAEL PERNFORS:  Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.  I think-- I think you'll have a problem finding two guys that hit the ball that easily and-- I mean, not as hard as all the other guys in the second round of the Open, but at least we know we're going to get the returns in, we don't have to worry about it.


Q. He had nine aces today and his serve is very strong? 

MIKAEL PERNFORS:  He had nine aces?  I guess you can take that remark and throw it away then.  Well, I still think there's going to be a lot of points, a lot of rallies.
