 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. You have been working with Javier Frana for some time.  How have been these months with the pandemic in the middle?  How much do you know about Argentina?
 JURIJ RODIONOV:   Hello, first of all.
 Yeah, we have fun constantly and talk.  During the pandemic we were chatting three, four times a week.  We were talking a lot about how we are as humans, just to get to know each other better.
 Yeah, he also talks about Argentina.  I'm not sure what I'm allowed to say that he said (smiling).  I'm not sure.  I didn't ask him for permission to tell you what his opinion is, what he said.  I'm just going to be careful.
 But what I know that he's a proud Argentinian.  He loves the Argentinian people, that's for sure.  I can tell that for sure.
