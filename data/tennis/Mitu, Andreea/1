THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Obviously in your first main draw appearance here in Roland Garros.   Overall what do you take from the experience?  
ANDREEA MITU:   Just positive thoughts and good matches.   I'm happy with my result here.   
   
 Q.   After beating Pliskova in the second round, did you feel you had any more pressure on you after that win?  
ANDREEA MITU:   Well, no, I felt more nervous against Francesca, to be honest.  
Yeah, I mean, I didn't realize, you know, when I played Pliskova that I won the match.   She was a good seeding, you know, 12.  
But, yeah, probably after the match against Francesca I realized both wins.   
   
 Q.   And you're projected to hopefully crack the top 50 after this run.   Is this a goal you had set for yourself, or have you exceeded your expectations?  
ANDREEA MITU:   Yeah, they told me before that the live score showing for me is pretty good, but I just want to see it like next Monday when it will be updated.   
Of course the first goal was to be main draw here.   I achieved it, for sure the next one will be top 50.
