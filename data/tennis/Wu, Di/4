  7‑5, 7‑5, 7‑6 
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
 Q.   You seem to be getting closer to winning your first Grand Slam match.   Do you think you're getting closer now?
  DI WU:   No, I don't think so, because I have chance and then I lose the set.   I lose little bit of confidence. 
  But for future we can getting better, I think.  
 Q.   Are you confident it will happen soon, that you can win your first match at a Grand Slam?
  DI WU:   Yeah, because right now I'm ranking no good.   I'm hope after tournament I get better ranking and then I can play Grand Slam first, then I can maybe win the more Grand Slam matches.  
 Q.   Do you think the level Chinese men in general is going up? 
  DI WU:   Yeah.   Before we didn't have so many Chinese player play the Grand Slam.   Then last year first time I been in main draw.   This year we have two Chinese player. 
  I think we can getting better and then more future, more Chinese player will come here.
