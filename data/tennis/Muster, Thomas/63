Q.  Speechless?  Tell us, you are in unbelievable  shape.  Did you plan this to get into top shape at this  period of the year?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Well, I think that the main  goal was to improve my tennis.  I didn't really care  too much about the results at the beginning, but I  think suddenly it starts paying off the way I have been  practicing and preparing this season.   
 

Q.  Are you planning to play in Oporto after  Roland Garros?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: No.   
 

Q.  For sure?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Yeah.   
 

Q.  Thomas, do you think you are playing some of  your best tennis ever on clay this season?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: No, I don't think so.  It is  just -- I have been playing good tennis for the last  years, but I just -- now everything works better.  My  serve works better and is faster and I am going to the  net and I mean, I just, all the way, I am playing more  aggressive and that is maybe the basic things.
