Q.  How do you feel with your game?

THOMAS MUSTER:  Today was much better than yesterday.  I played pretty well, especially in the second set; played deeper shots and more patient; just with the serve I was unprepared because my first serve wasn't that good; a couple will have doublefaults, but basically the way I moved I think it is pretty good and it is improving in comparison to yesterday.


Q.  What do you think about Solves, only the last French in the draw?

THOMAS MUSTER:  Well, I think first of all, he started playing very late.  I think he finished his starters first, which is pretty good for him, and then I think he is a very good player; maybe he is starting now to play more.  He was in the finals of the challenger; he won a round here.  I think his ranking will improve, and it shows that he consistently went up in the rankings, so once he is playing more professional now, I think he has a chance to be in the top hundred; good serving, pretty good game
