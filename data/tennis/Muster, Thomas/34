Q.  Thomas, what was special for you about today's match. Where did you dominate how did you control the match?
 
THOMAS MUSTER:  Well, first of all, I think it was nice to play tennis.  And, get a chance to play the shots and to run and fight for balls and get a chance.  So, yesterday it was completely different situation and today I think Michael wasn't as aggressive as he usually plays.  He made a few unforced errors.  But, I served pretty good at tough moments. And, especially at the end now, I think I had good service games and I put him under pressure a lot; especially with my forehand.  And, that may be the key point. 
 

Q.  How is your physical health at the moment? 
 
THOMAS MUSTER:  I am quite happy after defaulting two times in the last two tournaments.  I played an exhibition last week and I finished my two matches here without much pain. And, so I am quite happy the way it is going.  Also, I changed to a new racket one and a half weeks ago.  That all sort of keeps working -- it is working out now.  And, I think it is very positive for me. 
 

Q.  Same make of racket?
 
THOMAS MUSTER:  It is Kneissl, but it is a longer racket.
