Q.  He took you in the first sets 7-6.  What did you do in the second third and fourth sets to turn things around? 
 
THOMAS MUSTER: I think I had many opportunities in the first set to win in the tiebreak.  Should have been mine the first set and I just-- I guess took me a while to get into my concept. I was playing more aggressive then.  I was moving the ball around better, less unforced errors off the backhand and I think he got tired a little bit and start missing on the forehand and so just tried to, you know, keep him in the backhand and then open the court and then make him run to his forehand. 
 

Q.  How is your confidence right now?
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Confidence level is pretty good.  It is always difficult when you go out there and play best of five and -- but I think it still gives you a better chance to get into the match and I think best of five match, the better players always going to win on that day. 
 

Q.  Did he do anything --  what did he do that gave you problems today?
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Well, he is running very well.  He gets a lot of balls back and you have to make points two, three times and especially at the beginning it was covering a lot of court and I think maybe that at the end, that is what was the advantage at the end basically that he had really run a lot and cover a lot of angle balls.
