Q.  Was it difficult?

THOMAS MUSTER:  It's always difficult.  I mean, after not winning a match for a while, it's good to overcome the first round.


Q.  Did you prepare particularly hard for this tournament?  Do you intend to have a good result in this tournament this year?

THOMAS MUSTER:  I was injured last week, so my preparation was only three days.  But I've been practicing a lot before, so that shouldn't do too much damage in terms of preparation.  At the beginning of the tournament, as I said, I don't have any big expectations for the tournament, but I believe in myself.
