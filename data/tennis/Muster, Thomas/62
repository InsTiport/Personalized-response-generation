Q.  Do you feel tired after a match like this?  

THOMAS MUSTER: No.  


Q.  Not at all?  

THOMAS MUSTER: No.  


Q.  What was the problem with your hand,  blisters, or --  

THOMAS MUSTER: No, I have a cut which is  about one centimeter and very deep and it is right  there where my racket ends, so I have to protect it,  otherwise it is going to open up all the hand.  And I  have no choice to do anything, no stitches or anything,  it is just -- just have to keep taping it.  


Q.  How did you do that?  

THOMAS MUSTER: It just happened because of  playing; just the skin broke up.  


Q.  What did you feel when he was ahead in the  first set; did you feel confident you were strong  enough?  

THOMAS MUSTER: It didn't matter, no, because  I had 15-40 in the first game and I mean, he is not  somebody who is serving that strong that you don't have  chances to break back, so I knew it will depend on my  concentration and my basic work to beat him.  


Q.  Surprising to see him in the quarters?  

THOMAS MUSTER: It is surprising the way he  played and -- I mean, he is obviously a very good  player, sometimes just comes out of nowhere and plays  well like he did at the Grand Slam Cup a few years ago  or, you know, sometimes he comes up with great results  and I think this week he has been playing very good  tennis by beating Novacek and Haarhuis, I mean, you  need to play good tennis even on clay, so, we will  see.  I don't know what to expect -- I don't know what  too much to expect
