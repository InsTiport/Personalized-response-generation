Q.  Is it a very special match against Gaudenzi  or not at all?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Not really.  It is not that I  haven't seen him before.   
 

Q.  Were you expecting such a match against  Wheaton today?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: I have seen him play on clay  and he has a strong serve and when somebody serves very  well, clay is not really a slow surface, it is very  hard sometimes when he comes in on volleys and to pass  all the time and he doesn't give you much rhythm like a  typical European clay court player, so it is kind of  strange to play.   
 

Q.  Did you enjoy it, this match?  
 
THOMAS MUSTER: Yeah, I enjoy every match.  I  like to stay out there and play and I think it was  good -- a good match at the end because there was a  little bit of tension in there and it was good.
