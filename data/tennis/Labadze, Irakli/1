THE MODERATOR: First question, please. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I thought three times I had him. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No, actually I was just playing. I don't remember nothing. I was just trying to play. I didn't say one word during the whole match. It's not usual for me. Just to the score. 5-4, 30-15, three mistakes in a row. Just was unacceptable mistakes for me so... Just little bit unlucky. Little bit shaky, you know. I mean, my backhand is not the best shot, you know, so I guess at the important point I got nervous. There you go, I lost the ball, I lost the match. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, we played under 16, European Championships. I was 15, he was 16. We had a tough match, too, there. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, I would say yes. We know each other since 12 years old so... 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Fortunately, me. I rather win this one and lose that one. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No. After Australian Open, I think after that he played -- I don't know. No, nobody can play all the matches so good, you know. So I don't know. This one, you know, is difficult. Like today's match is difficult when you know somebody like from a youngster. You know he can play sometimes; like me, I can play sometimes - once a year. So then you get nervous, you know. Close matches, (hard?) to miss. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No, I have no problem. Just the day I get pain, I just take the strong painkiller and all day I feel dizzy after. Otherwise, if I don't get a pain that day, then no problem. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No, no, nothing. I haven't had a pain since - I don't know - a week. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: From here I go home, recover from this match, and then I try to play again in Valencia. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I go Vienna first, yes. That's where I live right now. Then there's a tournament in Valencia, but that's already a clay court tournament. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Well, I don't even know if I play French Open because I was a little injured last year and I dropped a lot. So right now I'm 138. I don't know where I am. I don't know, I need to make semifinal Valencia, which is difficult first week of the clay. I don't think I'm gonna play Roland Garros. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Well, that's all depends before how I play. Because I play Barcelona, Munich, some tournaments main draw, you know. If I do well and I'm back to Top 100, then I will go for quallies. If not, I will try to play some challengers, get some matches, some confidence, and some points. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I don't know. Definitely have a lot of time to think about it in the plane tomorrow. So I don't know. I go -- my brother is actually coming for a week to visit me next week, so I think he is going to help me to forget that match. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No, I'm pretty happy with my game. But just definitely I'm going to think about my backhand, so how can I improve my backhand. Definitely I'm going to think about my physical shape, you know. I don't look like a tennis player (smiling). That's for sure. Sumo wrestler. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: What can he say? I mean, it was like funeral for me. He didn't say nothing. Just like, "no worries." That's it. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Why I don't play more often like that? 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Because I'm Georgian (smiling). No, I don't know. You know, I have a lot of up and downs. I don't know. I think lately I've been playing pretty good, you know. So last year I started well, and I been playing the whole year pretty consistent. And after the injury, I lost a lot of confidence. So I don't know. Actually, this is my first match I played well in. I played three sets, decent three sets. If I look back and look at Australia, I played only one set against Roddick and I was out the court already, 911, I almost died, so... I don't know. I try to play one match, next match, lose or win, there is nothing else I can do, you know. That's all I know. So I don't want to go to university, I like it here. So I just play day by day.
