IRAKLI LABADZE: I don't know. You know, last two matches, I've been playing in the night, so I had no problems with the sun. So today was like pretty new for me, the sun. I guess I got used to it slowly, slowly. My eyes got used to the sun, so it was better. Still was bothering me, but not as much anymore to make three double-faults again. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: It was elephant (laughter). No, a small butterfly. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes, yes. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: He helped me two years ago in the summer for like three, four weeks. That's it. He's working on the Russian television. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah. I've been losing everywhere first round. I lost maybe six, seven first rounds before this. In Memphis, last tournament, last time, I got injury for three weeks. I was not expecting really to even win a round here. I don't know. I don't know what's happened. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I twist my ankle. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Left. Doctor told me I tore the ligament. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I won. I played him twice. Once was three, four years ago at challenger, once Memphis last year. I won both times. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes. I'm pretty good, too. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No, I don't think so. I mean, chess is just good to think. It makes you think. You know, your brain is working. I think it's always good for any sport. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I really, really think it helps because when you play, you know, you losing, you quiet, you just try to think. I think this works. In tennis, you do the same thing. You are more calm. Because I was three weeks injury, and I was really playing maybe 10 games a day for three weeks every day. I come here, and I didn't even throw the racquet. Before I was going nuts on the court. I think it's helped me, the chess, really helped me. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I play on the computer. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: If there's nobody, I play computer. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I don't know. A lot of players play chess. I used to play Juniors with players. I don't know. I don't know who is playing chess here. I never play these players. When you come here, you have no time for chess. You practice. You go rest. When you just hang out in the room, then you play on the computer. When I'm at home, I always play with my father. We always used to play with the money, you know 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, there are different levels. On my level, I win or lose. I know my level, so I don't go higher anymore. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No. I am a very risky player. But the difference between two years ago and now is that two years ago I was not thinking, I was not trying. Maybe I was lazy or mentally not so strong. Now I just -- I'm fighting for every ball. When I see stupid to hit, why not to play one more time over the net, then I get a chance and I hit. I'm just doing it like this. I just try to keep more balls in the court. When I get a chance, hit, think a little bit. As you see, it's working pretty good, so I don't want to change it. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes, we do. We are in the second group now. We just moved from third to second. We playing right after Miami against Italy in Italy. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: That's wrong. That's very, very wrong. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: It's an independent country since '91. Before '91 was pretty much the same. '91, I think 15 or 16 countries got separated. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: A lot of times. Once I was in Washington three years ago, the taxi driver asked me, "Where are you from?" I said, "Georgia." He said, "You don't have the Georgia accent." I said, "Georgia, not American." 

IRAKLI LABADZE: No. 1 and No. 2 is like 700. There's pretty much no tennis except me. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, he'll play with me in Italy. It's difficult with the money there. Not so much opportunities like the people have in any other country, no? That's it. Otherwise we have a lot of talented players. Now since we have a new president, improving and everything coming new, hopefully in any sport we going to have like any other country. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Well, my father, he was a soccer player, football in Europe. He got injury, then he quit football. Then he start to play tennis, because his friends, they were playing tennis. He was 33 years old when he first got the racquet. He learned tennis in one year. He was playing really, really good in one year, in the amateur level, with friends. All the coach told him, "You learn so quick, you are so talented, your son should be really talented, so you have to bring the son to play tennis." Pretty much my father wanted me to play tennis since I was born. I open my eyes, I see my father with tennis racquet. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: He was always traveling with me until I was 18, 19. He was like living with me. I was living two years in Germany, three years in Tampa. He was always with me, all the tournaments. Now he just coming sometimes. Now I'm big man, no? 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes, Saddle Brook. Last two years I'm not there anymore. Last three years, actually. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I live now in Austria, Vienna, for two years already. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I speak English, German, Russian and Georgian, which is different language, too. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Russian and Georgian is like French and English. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: I would say my game is pretty much based on the serve because if I serve well, then even if I don't play baseline, I feel I'm still can win. And I feel I still can improve in the middle of the game. If I don't serve well, automatically my baseline game gets worse because I lose my confidence. Serving last four matches pretty good, so let's not talk about my serve. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yes, I played against Calleri once already. We had the same thing. I was losing 5-Love in the first set. I start exactly the same way, a lot of double-faults in the first set. I think he was playing very good in the first set. I knew first set he was going to play well. When I saw after first game that I playing terrible, I say, "Okay, I just have to hang on, because he cannot play like this. I hope I can play better." Then I start to play better in the second set. 1-All, breakpoint. Made unbelievable lucky shot. I want to play like this, but not let and then over the net. After this game, I broke him. I just try to stay in the game. I knew second set I will get a chance. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, it was 5-2, 30-Love. Yeah, I was -- I have to say I was shaky. 30-15, that slice I missed down the line, I was really, really nervous. It was, yeah, nerves. I got broken and I tried to stay cool, which normally I don't do it. Yeah, I just try to forgot the last game. It's worked. 

IRAKLI LABADZE: Yeah, because when he did return down the line, I thought this was going wide. I already wanted to scream. It was in.
