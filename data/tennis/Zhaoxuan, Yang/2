3-6, 6-3, 10-8
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.
Q. Firstly, congratulations on this win. What opportunities have brought you together?
YANG ZHAOXUAN: In Tianjin we were together and I asked her if she wants to take the lead.
Q. At the party last night it seems the husband of Duan Yingying is also here. Maybe you can talk about does your marriage help with your performance on the court and also I want to ask Yang Zhaoxuan to share with us your personal relationship.
DUAN YINGYING: Not really. After the wedding everything is the same and I think I'm more focused than before, because I have family now and I feel different when I play and I'm more aggressive. Mentality? Yes.
YANG ZHAOXUAN: I will try to keep up with Duan, to have some company, because when you play you're always traveling and it's hard for a girl to travel alone because sometimes you feel empty, and with someone helping you it's always good, both on the court and off the court.
Q. What is the balance you're trying to strike between singles and doubles? Is it, is there more chance for you to play more doubles in the future?
DUAN YINGYING: Because I'm trying to get high rankings in doubles, so I have to give up some singles tournaments and I was also sick for three months at the beginning of the year, so my singles ranking has declined a lot and I cannot play many singles tournaments and I have to play more doubles recently.
Q. In terms of the Olympics next year, you're very strong in doubles. Does that mean you're going to focus on doubles next season and try to get qualifications for Olympics?
DUAN YINGYING: Yes, I will. I will play doubles for the first half of next year and I will prepare for that.
YANG ZHAOXUAN: Same for me.
Q. What is your impression of the city of Zhuhai? How do you like the court, the hotel?
DUAN YINGYING: I think everything is good. I played a year ago in Zhuhai. Everything's great, the court, the service, and I'm happy to be back.
YANG ZHAOXUAN: I come to Zhuhai since the first year and then almost every year after. I love Zhuhai, the facility, hotel are very nice. Maybe that's because I'm coming back every year. I haven't spent much time in the seafood restaurant because most of the time I'm on the court and then in the hotel.
