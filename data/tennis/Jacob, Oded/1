THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You fought hard and worked your way back into the first set.  Was Monica just too steady today? 
 
TZIPORA OBZILER:  I guess she did because she won.  First set was a little bit tighter because I think the match, maybe the beginning, she was a little bit more tense, I was a little bit tense.  And things just maybe were looser a little bit in the second set.  So much more easier for her in the second set.  
 
Q.  The heat out there was extreme.  How did that affect you? 
 
TZIPORA OBZILER:  We come from a very warm country.  It's very warm and humid in Tel Aviv, too.  Of course the weather didn't help, but it's normal.  We had all week outside here with this weather, so I knew for what to expect.  It wasn't something that I didn't expect to have during the match.  
 
Q.  Captain Jacob, your thoughts about the match today. 
 
CAPTAIN ODED JACOB:  Well, first of all, I am very satisfied with the performance of our girls.  I think they played very good matches against  - we mustn't forget  - the top tier of women's tennis.  I think maybe Lindsay surprised me a little bit coming back from eight months injury, the way she played, especially the way she served.  She seemed like she was really confident and feeling the ball very well.  She had a few lapses of concentration, but generally she played very well.  I think Anna performed as I expected.  Tzippy's match, well, again, Tzippy is not accustomed to play on this level all year round.  She normally plays on a lower level, and she's not a full-time professional.  So coming in to this match, she didn't know exactly what kind of tempo to expect.  I think she adapted very well very quickly.  But when you don't play on this level all year round, it's very tough for you to maintain this kind of tempo for a long period.  But, again, you know, it's beyond our expectations to be coming out here and, you know, playing the best ladies in the world and giving them a big challenge.  I think we tried to keep them on the court as long as possible, and we did that.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about your winners today. 
 
TZIPORA OBZILER:  First, I'm glad I had a few winners today, that's for sure.  Again, Monica's winners, she's a top level player.  I mean, I knew she was gonna hit winners during the match.  When I got the chance, I had  -- I mean, I hit the ball, and I'm glad I had a few winners during the match.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the task your team has tomorrow.
 
CAPTAIN ODED JACOB:  Well, I'd rather be tied at 1-all today.  But, you know, tomorrow is another day.  All girls, all four girls, are going to feel much more comfortable tomorrow on the court as the tension of the first game is released and everybody feels much more comfortable.  Just have to go out there again, compete as hard as we can, try and keep these girls on court as long as possible and expect anything to happen.
