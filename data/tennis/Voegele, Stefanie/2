V. WILLIAMS/S. Voegele
  6-3, 6-2

 Q. Can I just ask what your feelings were? Was it tough going out on Centre Court?
 STEFANIE VOEGELE: No, it was not tough, but I was just happy that I could play on Centre. I tried to play aggressive, play my game, but just, yeah, my serve wasn't good enough against her.

 Q. A lot of games went to deuce, didn't they? To look at the score line it was a lot sort of closer. 
 STEFANIE VOEGELE: Yeah, it was sometimes a close game. I could do better sometimes, but yeah, just my serve was not good enough for her return. 

 Q. Was one of the hardest things getting the ball past her, because you played really well but she would get to shots to other players don't get to. 
 STEFANIE VOEGELE: No, I mean, from the baseline it was even. Yeah, I tried to play aggressive. She also -- for me the big difference was the serve. 

 Q. What were your thoughts when you saw the draw and you were drawn against the defending champion?
 STEFANIE VOEGELE: I was hoping to get an easier draw, but it was also a good experience. It's my first Wimbledon main draw and I got to play on the Centre at the biggest tennis event of the year, first time on Centre Court.
