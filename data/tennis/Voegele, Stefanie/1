 S. VOEGELE/A. Friedsam
      6‑7, 7‑5, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Quick question:   In the second set there was a game at 2‑1 where you made a few errors and went down 3‑1.   There was another one at 4‑3 and you went down 5‑3.   You stayed very mentally tough and came back quickly and won the second set.   In the third set she had a letdown in the beginning.   Would you characterize this match as a match of two players of equal level, but one was mentally tougher than the other and therefore she won?  
    STEFANIE VOEGELE:   That's probably in every tennis match the case, one player is mentally tougher and wins.   So tennis is about that.   
    But that's true I had like two games where I was making few mistakes, but I tried to stay in and play every point.   That's what I did, and it was very good for me.
