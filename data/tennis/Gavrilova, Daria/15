D. GAVRILOVA/D. Cibulkova
4-6, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You were very emotional, charged up.  Is your competitive fire a way to keep yourself going, sustain the intensity, mentally wear down your opponent?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: That's a long question (smiling).  You kind of answered your own question.
Yeah, it was a tough battle.  I had to fight for every point.  Domi even mentioned it in the speech, that she had to do the same thing.  But I was, yeah, the last few games, I really was aggressive and I was taking chances whenever I could.  It paid off in the end.
Q. What does it do for you when you yell C'mon and pump your fist?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Just the positive energy.  I've always done it, so...  It's natural.
Q. How does it feel to not only break through for your first win but to do it in a classic match?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, it's even more special to win it that way, against such a tough competitor, the semifinal, beating a top-10 player.  I think I've beaten some great players to win my first title.
Q. Seemed like in the first set you lost some concentration, had a couple double-faults.  How did you get that back?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Just believe.  I always believed in myself that I could still win.  I just managed to stay calm, managed to just be focused on the task rather than getting all emotional, going elsewhere.
Q. The fifth game of the second set, there was a rally with 30 shots, five deuces.  You broke her.  Seemed like that might have been the turning point.  What did that game mean to you?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I told myself when it was, like, third time deuce, I said that it might be the turning point, to fight for every point.
Q. When you came to this tournament, did you envision this?  Was this something that surprised you as you played through?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I come fighting for every match.  I was just trying to focus each day, each match.  Yeah, ended up winning, so it's pretty school.
Q. Obviously you have to play again on Monday in the US Open.  How are you physically after this match?  Worth it?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: It's so worth it, winning your first title.  Of course I gave my all.  But I'm looking forward to playing on Tuesday.  I will give my best on Tuesday, as well.
Q. Momentum-wise, confidence-wise going into the US Open, this has to be as good as you can hope for.
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, I guess my confidence is going to be -- I don't know.  Each match is different, so...  Right now, this tournament, I played some good tennis.  Next tournament, US Open, it's a new opportunity.  I'll just see what comes on the day.
