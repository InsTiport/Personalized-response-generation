J. KONTA/D. Gavrilova
6-1, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about your match against Konta.  What went wrong today?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I thought she started really well, unlike me.  I was a bit slow.  I spoke with my coaches after the match, and that's exactly what they said.  That's what I felt, as well.  I think even the five-minute warmup, I was not aggressive or -- I wasn't just myself a little bit today.
You know, I only felt like I played really well the last 10 minutes of the match where I got the crowd going, as well.
Yeah, just felt like I was under pressure the whole time.  Just didn't have time to get in the match.  The rallies were pretty short, but I felt like I served well.  That's the only positive.
Q. Was it the heat or something else?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Oh, no.  I actually didn't feel the heat at all.
I don't know.  I was probably not expecting her to -- no.  I was just not myself.  I was off.  I guess everyone has those days.
Q. Do you take pride in the fact that when you have an off-day you saved 16, 17 break points?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, it's pretty good.  Like I said, I felt like I was serving well.
I felt the only points I was winning was when I hit my first serve well.  Other than that, I didn't win too many rallies.
That's my strength, winning the long rallies, and I couldn't get into the match and couldn't get myself into any rallies today.
Q. How do you mentally get ready for the Australian Open in terms of your singles game?  What will you do?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I'm probably not gonna do much different.  I just felt like my preparation just before the match wasn't as good as the match before.  Like, even that five-minute warmup on court, I was kind of distracted and looking at the crowd and how many people are there, where, when I played Donna, I was switched on and started really well.
So coming into the Australian Open, I will focus on just starting the matches a bit better than what I did today.
Q. It's not going to be easy, because you'll be one of the local favorites and a lot of pressure in Melbourne.  How do you block that out?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I'm just gonna enjoy it.  I know that the crowd is going to be supporting me, so I will feed off the crowd and just have fun and try and play my best tennis.
I think that's all I can do, really.  Yeah, I know I am feeling a bit of pressure, you know, defending fourth round, but that's old news.  So we'll see how I can handle it.
Q. You just sort of mentally try and block out last year, or do you feed off it and think about how well you have done in the past in Melbourne?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I'm not really thinking about last year too much, but I know that it was pretty cool times and I had big crowds.  That's all I play for.  I love playing on big stages.
It's going to be pretty cool.  You know, as an Aussie, I'm going to get a pretty big court.  Hopefully a few people will show up.
