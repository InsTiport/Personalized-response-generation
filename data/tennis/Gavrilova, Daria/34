 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How does it feel to win your first Grand Slam?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, I didn't understand yet, but I'm so happy. But it will take a while when I will understand that I won my first Grand Slam.

 Q. Were you nervous? How were you feeling this morning?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, I slept so bad during the night. I woke up like 10 times, and I was thinking -- I think I played like in my dreams my match like 10 times.

 Q. Did you win each time?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Um, well, no. (Laughter.)

 Q. Have you faced her before?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah. Since we were young we were playing against each other many times, and the last time in the official match I lost in Italy on clay.

 Q. Does she always get that upset, and do you use that to your advantage?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, yeah. (Smiling.)
Q. Did you gain confidence from winning the gold medal in Singapore? That made you the No. 1 seed. 
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I was confident, but also I felt pressure because I was No. 1 seeded. 
 So everyone expected something good from me.

 Q. Did you feel that you played well today or so-so?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: No. That was a really bad match, actually. But we were so tired and I couldn't even move. My legs were so heavy. 

 Q. After yesterday's match?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, after yesterday's, because yesterday it was so tough.

 Q. Under those conditions, how did you find yourself able to win? What were you doing mentally, emotionally? What got the victory for you?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: I was just keep saying like -- and motivating myself, like, Let's go; come on, can you do it.

 Q. You believed yourself?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah.

 Q. You and Yulia, are you from the same place?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, we even train in France sometimes together in the same academy.

 Q. Mouratoglou, you mean?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah.

 Q. What about as kids, did you know each other very young?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I think I played my first match against her.

 Q. Really? How old were you?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Um, eight.

 Q. Are you good friends or... 
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, we're good friends.

 Q. This match means a lot to you, your family, but what does it mean to your country? How good do you feel that you won one for your country?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, there are too many good Russians, so they will not be surprise, I don't think.

 Q. How will you celebrate?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: I am traveling tomorrow. I am flying to California for a 25 event.

 Q. You haven't played a lot of professional events, or... 
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: No, I think I played only four events, professional events this year.

 Q. Will that change now?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah. Well, from now on I will start to play more professionals. But I will still play in juniors, I mean, just Grand Slams. 

 Q. Is it important to you to finish the year as the No. 1 junior?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, after winning a gold medal there, my goal was to finish No. 1.

 Q. What's your goal now?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: To improve my WTA ranking.

 Q. Where are you ranked now?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: Um, 670 or something like this.

 Q. How much better are you than 670, would you say?
 DARIA GAVRILOVA: 300. (Smiling.)
