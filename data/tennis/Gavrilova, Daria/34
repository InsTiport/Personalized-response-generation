  7‑5, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Makes all qualifying worthwhile when you get through the first round.   
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   Yeah, it's been good.   I've had few tough matches.   I think the qualifiers get an advantage because they have few matches under their belts.  
I think I played pretty well today.   It's been a good week so far.   
   
 Q.   Bit of a test for you concentration‑wise because you had the rain stoppages?   
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   Yeah.   It feels like a really long match even though ‑‑ I don't know how long was the actual match, but you still have to be focused and to do all the warmups.   You know, you can't get distracted; you can't talk to the people.  
So it's pretty hard, but...  
   
 Q.   Wildcard playoff win and now first round in a WTA tournament.   What's the rest of the year or the rest of the season looking like for you?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   Well, obviously it's a great start to the year.   I'm just not sure about my schedule yet.   Because of my ranking it's just everything is unconfirmed.  
   
 Q.   You see a really massive opportunity to make inroads with your ranking knowing you didn't play much at the start of the last year?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like there is a chance to make a lot of rankings inroads knowing you didn't play much at the start of last year?   
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   Yeah.   Obviously I'm looking forward to my ranking going up.   I just have to keep doing what I'm doing, and I think I've beenexecuting and doing everything right.   We've been working with Pratty on a lot of things, and I've been he showing it on court.   
   
 Q.   Where would you like to make your improvements in your game?   
DARIA GAVRILOVA:   I think I still can obviously work on a lot of things.   I can get my serve better still; I can get my forehand better; everything can get better.   
But the main thing is for me to stay aggressive and to look forward and coming into the net.
