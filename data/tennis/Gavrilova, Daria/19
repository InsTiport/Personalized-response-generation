D. GAVRILOVA/T. Bacsinszky
6-3, 5-7, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Back-to-back years into the fourth round.  How does it feel?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: It feels awesome.  I'm pretty tired right now.  It was a very tough match.  To be honest, I expected it.  Yeah, I feel relieved.
Q. Commentators were saying the conditions were tough out there.  You were hitting sort of uphill into the wind.  Did you find one end more difficult than the other?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: No, not really.  No, not at all.  Didn't even cross my mind.
It wasn't even that windy.
Q. How did you recover after the second set?  What were you telling yourself going into the third?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, I went to the bathroom.  I think I was losing my cool a little bit in the second set.  I told myself, Just try and be composed.  Don't do what you did last year.
Yeah, I told myself to be really focused and play a tough point every point.  I said, Okay, just give it all for the next 30 minutes, or however it had to take.
Q. How important was the crowd, particularly in the third set?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yes, I felt the support.  I was really exhausted to give them anything really.  Yeah, that feeling at 5-2 when I was up, the crowd going crazy, all loud.  Well, I didn't end up winning this game, but it felt great and it felt like, Okay, just a little more, just give it your best.
Q. You mentioned about not doing what you did last year.  What have you learnt from last year heading into the fourth round again?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, to be honest, I was really concerned about how I was going to feel on that center court.  I was a bit nervous.  I was telling my coaches, God, I feel like I'm playing first round all over again, like the same nerves.  Yeah, I was probably thinking too much of what happened last year.
I don't think it was actually a good thing for me.  But in the end I managed to not do what I did last year.
Q. You mentioned that you're exhausted.  What about physically, six-and-a-half hours in the first three matches.  That's a lot of hard work.
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yes.  I now realize how tough it is to get to a second week of a slam.  Yeah, I mean, like I said before, it's really tough for me to win easily.  I think I'm the type of player that just has to work for every point, so...
I guess I'm used to it.
Q. Your next opponent will be Karolina Pliskova.  How can you approach that match?  It will be very tough at this stage of the draw.
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yes, she's playing unbelievable.  I lost to her pretty easily twice, I think, maybe once.  But, yeah, she's definitely playing her best tennis right now.  I actually told to a reporter, before the draw came out, If it wasn't me, who do you think is going to win the tournament?  I picked her.
Yeah, I do respect her a lot.  I do absolutely have to play my best to beat her.
Q. How do you go about returning that serve?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, the good thing is I played some great servers this summer, so I think I'm a bit used to it.  I just have to react really.
Q. Your athleticism really seemed to stand out, got you out of trouble a couple times tonight.  How much of an ace up your sleeve is that going into a match like that with Pliskova?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Thanks (smiling).
Yeah, I do work a lot.  It's also natural, I think, the way I move on the court.  In the preseason I do a lot of running, explosive stuff.  I'm really happy that it's paying off.
I'm also confident that I can play for three hours if I have to.
