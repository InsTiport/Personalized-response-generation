THE MODERATOR: Daria has unfortunately had to withdraw with a left ab muscle injury.   
We'll take some questions.   
 Q.  Bit of a blow, especially after such a high weekend?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I'm a bit upset.  I was taped up in the finals and I think we just decided to not rush back playing here.   
If I did have a bit more time I would be fine, but it's just a bit sore.  It's a bit of a precaution as well.   
 Q.  Is it ongoing?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Against Svitolina I was already taped up.   
 Q.  Is it similar to the one you had last year during the French?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: It's the same.  It's the left side.  But because it's early days I should be fine for Australian Open.   
 Q.  Preparation, what does that involve now?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Just a bit of rehab and being smart with what I do on court.  Definitely going to be fine for Monday or Tuesday next week.
