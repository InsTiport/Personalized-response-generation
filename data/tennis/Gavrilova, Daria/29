THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. When I spoke to you a few days ago, you said you felt like how you were playing now, you could beat just about anyone.  Do you still have that still kind of confidence?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, that's if I play my best tennis.  I'm pretty confident, I had a good training week.  I think I'm ready to go.
Q. We had Sam in here just earlier.  She was saying you two had been getting along really well, doing some training together.  Do you see Sam as a bit of mentor or role model at this point?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, it was great having her around.  We did a lot of our pre-season together.  Yeah, we were both getting a bit competitive sometimes.
But obviously she's a legend to me.  I have so much respect for her.  In the beginning when I just first met her, I was very shy around her.  But now I'm more relaxed.
Yeah, I could even call her my friend.  Yeah, we get along very well.
Q. What is your expectation going into this tournament and this year on the back of last year?  Do you think things will be a little bit harder for you, you'll be more of the hunted?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, and I'm prepared for that obviously.  Everyone now has seen me.  Everyone knows about my game.  But it's the same with all the players inside top 100 or whatever.  We all know each other games.
But I think now, like you said, coaches and players are more aware.  They kind of know what to expect.  In a way, it will be more difficult, but it happens with everyone.
Q. You've been able to play the Grand Slams as an Australian.  This is the first Grand Slam where you have the passport in your hand.  Are you expecting it to be different now that everything is official?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Last year I felt like I'm at home and the crowd was amazing.  So obviously this year, I can now officially say, Yeah, I'm Australian.  If anyone asks me, I'll be like, Yeah, I'm Australian.
But in terms of playing tennis, it will be the same.
Q. Last year perhaps you didn't have your best results in the Grand Slams.  Have you made any changes to go further in the bigger tournaments?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Well, we'll see obviously.  I was getting very excited last year, very nervous.  I was overwhelmed with the whole situation.
But I think this year I'm a bit more relaxed.  I'm just going to get out there and play tennis.  Hopefully I'll not get all these crazy thoughts in my head.
Q. What about your first round?  What are your expectations there?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I've never played against Lucie.  She's always done well here.  The last I've looked on Internet, she has qualified two years in a row.  Actually, yeah, I mean, she's playing well here.  We'll see.
But, like I said, I never played against her.
Q. Do you look as perhaps the second round with Petra or focused on the first round?
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Only first round.
