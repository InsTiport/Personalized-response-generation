THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You said it was going to be a tough day and it was, wasn't it?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, I think mentally I wanted it too much, and I played scared.  I didn't go after my shots.  Just next time I need to overcome that, because clearly playing scared doesn't win you matches.   
I did a similar thing in Paris, and next time I just have to go after it and, yeah, overcome my fears, I guess.   
 Q.  Do you see someone about that?  Did you get some help with that?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I did, but not at the moment.   
 Q.  Do you feel it like coming overnight or the day before or is it just something...  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: No, I was ready.  I was hitting the ball great in the warmups.  I had the same routine.  But I don't know.  I just didn't go after my shots on court.  Wasn't serving well.  To be fair, I didn't hit one shot clean (smiling).  It wasn't good.   
 Q.  Do you think anything about that had to do with how she's playing?  She had that great win in the first round and seems to be in a pretty good groove herself.  Did you find her game a struggle to deal with?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, she plays different.  She was up for it.  She uses all different shots.  She's got a great feel.   
But I expected that.  Yeah, she was just -- she just took it, and I was trying to play safe.   
 Q.  When you say you were playing scared, is that using another word for nerves?  If that was the case, what...  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: No, I wasn't even feeling that nervous.  Like, I was excited.  But I just didn't go after my shots.  I was just trying to play safe, thinking that I can get away with it.  But you can't on that level.   
 Q.  What did the linesman go and say to the chair umpire?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: I actually have no idea.  Well, the second time she said that I swore, but I actually didn't.  I said to my coach that I need to play brave -- or I did say something.  I was talking nonstop.  But I didn't swear.  Under my breath maybe (smiling).  Once.  No one heard it.  That wasn't the time when she actually came out.   
 Q.  Do you take some positives into the hard court season given you made the third round in the last couple of slams?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah, actually I'm really motivated.  I was already looking at the hard court season and when I'm going to go and where.   
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the hard court season.  And, yeah, just making third round for the first time at the French and here, it's a good step forward.   
 Q.  You have issues of nerves.  If you think about the other part of your game, physically and technically, how's that going?  Are you happy with where the rest of your game is at going forward?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: There is a few things I can tidy up.  Let's not hide.  My serve can get a lot better.  And there is a few technical things today on court that showed up.  I was jumping on my forehand.  I didn't hold the ground on my backhand, either.  It was just everything that I work on just showed up.   
 Q.  Where do you go?  Do you go home?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: Yeah.  Probably going to go to Russia to see my family and my friends, and then I'm going home for two weeks and just reassess and have a good training block and start the U.S. swing.   
 Q.  One of those tournaments will be New Haven?  
DARIA GAVRILOVA: New Haven, yeah, defend the title.  Come on.
