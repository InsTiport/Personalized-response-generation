Q. How well do you think Andre is playing?

MAURICIO HADAD: I think he's playing great. He has a lot of confidence. He played --
wasn't playing well this summer until the Olympics. He won the Olympics. I think that gave
him what he needed to be the No. 1 player again. He's playing great, good tennis.
