Q.  Can you explain how you had some very good  results in the beginning of the year?  What is going on  with your game and how the season is going?  

GILBERT SCHALLER: Well, what was changing, I  am playing better now, that is the key.  I was  improving from last year to this year.  I made some  tactical changes and I was improving my forehand.  I  can make more pressure now with the forehand and that  was the key for my game because now I can play good  from both sides; from the baseline.  And I think that  was the most important thing for me during work.
