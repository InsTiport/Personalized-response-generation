 WTA: Questions for Elena.  
 
Q. Lindsay said she thought maybe the nerves and the situation kind of overwhelmed you.
Is that accurate? Did you feel extra nervous?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I was nervous just a little bit. But I think I was tired because I
have to play five difficult match. It was tough for me, a very long week. I was very tired
today. 
 
Q. Do you mean tired in your body or tired in your mind?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: In body and in my mind. 
 
Q. Is Lindsay playing better tennis than she played the last time you met in September?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, she's play well. But she also make some mistake, some
double-faults. But I think it's a different thing to play with the light in the evening,
especially for me, because I play all my match in the morning. It was the difference.  
 
Q. Were you very nervous?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, just a little bit. 
 
Q. Was there any way you could have found yourself into the match in the second set?
Could you not find your game at all?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, I didn't find my game. I was tired, but I try. I miss my serve,
my good serve, so I can't win the game with my serve. It's very difficult to play against
such a great player when you can't do something. 
 
Q. How much confidence will you have from this whole tournament?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, I think this give me a lot of power for the next week. I play
much better than I start the first match. I hope just to have a few days off and try to
play better in the next tournament, in Ericsson. 
 
Q. What was it like to walk out in that big stadium?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: What was?  
 
Q. What was it like to walk out in the big stadium?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I like to play in the big stadium, but I prefer to play in the
morning.
