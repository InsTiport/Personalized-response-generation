Q.  Looked like your serve got a little better by the second set.  Why did you elect to serve in the first game and after a few of those double-faults how did you improve the serve there?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, actually that was one of the most, you know, difficult match I have ever played in my life, after waiting like four and a half hours, thanks to Coria.  I mean, that was unbelievable fight.  But I did my warm-up, had my lunch.  Then I falling asleep.  Then I start it all over again.  You know, that was kind of difficult when I, you know, started to play.  I was completely out of my focus, and it was very difficult just to get into the match and just to play good.  I mean, it was up and down the whole match for both of us.  You know, I'm just very happy I could win this one.

Q.  You talked the other day about how much you had been working a bit with Richard with your serve.  Did you have a chance to work with him between Wimbledon and The Open?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Yeah, we had one week that I came to Amsterdam.  But unfortunately I fall on my left wrist and couldn't practice.  But, yeah, it's kind of difficult because he's a very busy person, you know.  And I wish I can come to Amsterdam when I had off season.  We decided to play with Michaela Krajicek, doubles together.  And he might help us because he also work with Michaela.  He gave me some good advices, and I just keep working myself.

Q.  Where is it now? 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Where is it (laughter)?  I feel like my first serve is getting, you know, better.  But second serve, it's still -- I mean, I still slice it too much.  I don't have -- there is not much I can do.  I'm always serving to the forehand side.  You know, it's kind of difficult because playing a Grand Slam, to change something, you know, to be focused on your second serve, it's very difficult because in the middle of the match you're just thinking how much you want to win this one, you know, just no matter what. 

Q.  Do you have any idea of the Russian solution for Fed Cup final next year?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  From what I heard, it's going to be the same team as we played semifinals.  I don't think Shamil did any changes, so we keep the same.  Me, Myskina, (indiscernible), Dinara.

Q.  Patty Schnyder committed 37 unforced errors.  Do you expect the same from Lindsay?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I wish.  No, you know, like I said, it was a difficult match to play after this four hours waiting.  You know, when you play against Patty Schnyder, you're very focused on what she likes to do, what she doesn't like to do.  I didn't play my best.  You know, I was playing to her backhand all the time, put a lot of pressure on her backhand side.  That not what I usually doing on the court.  I like to move my opponent a lot.  With Lindsay, it likes look like she's in a great shape.  It's just amazing how quick, and she can recover from her injury.  She just won Pilot Pen, playing unbelievable level here.  But at the same time, I feel like I have nothing to lose.  I know the crowd going ton or her side.  But, I mean, I enjoying to play here.  You know, I realize that I have to play much better than today. 

Q.  What do you think is going to be your biggest challenge during the next game?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, I think it's going to be all about how well I can serve because she has unbelievable strong serve and it's going to be difficult for me to return, even this is my favorite shot to do.  I'm going to be focused on my serve, you know, try to put lot of first serve in.  Just, you know, to play aggressive. 

Q.  She said she's never quite sure what she's going to get from your second serve.  Sometimes it will be 100 miles, sometimes 55. 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Yeah, who knows.  I don't know either. 

Q.  I was going to ask if you knew. 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I don't know either. 

Q.  The three previous times you played Patty, they all went to three sets.  Today seemed like you were much more in control.  What was the biggest difference out there?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, after last time we played, I was second, 4-1 up, lost in the Australian Open.  So this time I was trying to play till the last point.  And, like I said, I was -- usually I'm more focused on my game.  But today I was thinking a lot what she doesn't like to do on the court, and she really doesn't like to play her backhand.  Her forehand side, it's just one of the best shot, you know.  I didn't let her play.  So I think she was kind of -- she was kind of confused with this kind of game.  I changed her rhythm a lot, and she just couldn't make it. 

Q.  Do you look at Lindsay over her career, her consistency, all-court game, do you wish you could be like that?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No.  I mean, I'm just very happy, you know, with my game.  I don't want to be like someone else.  I think, you know, I like her game a lot.  I think she's one of the most talented player.  She's a very smart player.  She use a lot of, you know, strong things in her game.  It just unbelievable.  Like a year ago she was almost, you know, ready to retire, then she started play unbelievable tennis.  I play her so many times.  I remember my first time playing in New York in Madison Square Garden, first round.  When I saw the draw, I was almost like trying.  I said, "Ma, I want to go home."  I could beat her that time.  But every time you play against her, you feel like, you know, it's quite difficult to find this kind of heavy shots because I don't have a hitting partner who can hit as good as she does.
