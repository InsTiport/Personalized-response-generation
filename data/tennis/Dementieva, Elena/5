A. IVANOVIC/E. Dementieva
  7-6, 7-6

 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. You were able to hold serve throughout most of the match pretty easily, especially during the second set, but it was in the tiebreak when you weren't able to secure more than a few points. I was just wondering what was happening in the tiebreaks that made you lose?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, first of all, I feel I was a little tired today. I had a very tough week in Tokyo, and coming to this event I was not really 100%, so I had a really slow start in the beginning of the match. 
 I was down 5-2, was trying to fight and just, you know, find a way to play. But, yeah, I was feeling pretty slow today. I did lots of mistakes, and my reaction wasn't there, so I just gave such a big advantage in the beginning of the game. I was not able to come back. 

 Q. Do you think you still could qualify for the Doha final the end of this year? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I didn't understand the question. What was the question? 

 Q. Do you think that you still could qualify for Doha at the end of this year?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't know. I don't think about it. I don't know what's the situation for the moment. I don't know. 

 Q. I have checked the results you had got at the Grand Slams. You actually made six times semifinals at the Grand Slam, but you were close to winning the title at the end. What do you think about in the future? Now you are 29 years old now. What do you think about in the future? Maybe you still have chance to win the Grand Slam? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, I don't think so. 

 Q. Obviously Ana has had her issues obviously being a former No. 1 and had injury problems. What have you made of it? Obviously today she played pretty well. What do you think? Is it possible, could she get back to where she was?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I have no idea. 

 Q. No thoughts on her at all?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, I was not following her career. I'm sorry. 

 Q. In terms of your program, what are you going to do now? You're not quite in Doha. What's the schedule?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I will just go home tomorrow.

 Q. Are you going to pray any tournaments before?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't know yet.
