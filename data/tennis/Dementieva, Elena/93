Q.  Do you feel a little like you got cheated out of that match?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Uhm, you know, I think I was playing pretty good today.  Maybe, you know, just some easy mistakes that I made. Yeah, but I feel I was playing pretty good today, especially the first set. 
 

Q.  I'm referring to the injury time-out that Mary took, you know, 12-minute injury time-out after losing the first set.
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, yeah, I think, you can change the game around by winning unbelievable point or by changing the rhythm.  I mean, that's the fair point.  But by taking like 12 minutes time-out, I don't think it was a fair play, but she could do it, I mean, by the rules.  And she did it. If that's the way, you know -- if that's the only way she can beat me, I mean, it's up to her. 
 

Q.  What were you thinking during those 12 minutes?  You hit some serves and were walking around in the back of the court.
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, I've never had such a long break, you know.  Nobody -- I mean, I can't remember that anyone could take such a long break before, you know, like 12 minutes.  That was really a lot, you know. Yeah, I was trying just to keep warm, you know, just stay focused because, you know, that was pretty long. 
 

Q.  How angry were you in the second set when you realized she was moving very, very well?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I wasn't angry because I know that's the way she play, you know.  She use every, you know -- I don't know.  If she has 20 seconds, she gonna use 25 seconds between points.  I mean, she use all extra time that she has.  That's the way she play and, you know, I was ready for this. 
 

Q.  But the fact that she took those injury time-outs then was moving so well.
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Yeah, you know, I think it's didn't affect my game.  But do I think she had something, I don't think so.  But, you know, she could do it by the rules and she did it. 
 

Q.  Do you think the rules should be changed?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I don't think that it's a good thing to have such a long break.  I mean, three minutes, it's a good -- I mean, it's good enough, if you have an injury, just somebody to come to the court and, you know, just tape you.  I think it's -- I mean, it's enough. But I don't think it's fun for the players and, you know, for the crowd just to see her, you know, 12 minutes lying down and do some treatment. 
 

Q.  In the third set at 1-1, you're on your first serve and she was looking behind her and the serve was in, then she said she wasn't ready.  Then you double-faulted.  She ended up breaking you there.  Is that fair?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No, just like I said, that's the way she played.  That's the way she wins. I mean, that's kind of player she is.  I mean, she's trying to use everything, you know, just to take any advantage of, you know, some little distraction, everything. But I think, you know, she was playing pretty good, pretty solid game today.  And, you know, all the thing really didn't affect my game.  You know, it was all, you know, all my fault and, you know, I don't think that, you know, she did something, you know, incredible. 
 

Q.  Do you think she steps across the line of sportsmanship?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No, I really don't think so, you know.  Once again, she did everything by rule, you know.  If that's the way she play, it's up to her. 
 

Q.  You say about the rules, but could you ever imagine being in a situation where you think, "I'm losing this match, I'm going to take a time-out, ask for time."
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I don't need it, you know.  I'm here to play.  When I go on the court, you know, if I have something, I can tape it before my match.  When I'm on the court, you know, I'm just enjoying to play.  I really want to be just a better player, you know, just to beat someone, just play better, not to, you know, put any distraction or this kind of little things to distract the game of my opponent.  I just want to play good, you know.  That's what I'm looking for on the court. 
 

Q.  How hard is it for you to be patient during the 25 seconds she takes to adjust the ponytail and look at her nails?  What is going through your mind at that time?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, when you have to play against Mary, you have to be ready for this.  You know, you have to be patient, you know.  She's -- you know, she likes to take all this extra times and, you know, it was okay for me, really. 
 

Q.  Before you made that serve that you were questioned about, did you look across the court and note that she was ready to play, that she was in position to return?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I don't know why we're talking about this, really.  It's just only one point.  Yeah, she was ready to play.  Then she said, "I'm sorry."  It's not about one point, you know.  One point cannot change the whole match.  Even that I did this double-fault, it's didn't affect me. 
 

Q.  Right, it is only one point, but you lost the next four games as if you were still thinking about that.
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No, no.  I never think about point I just lost, you know.  No, it's not -- it's not the way it is.  I'm just trying to focus on the next point.  I don't remember what I've done before, no. 
 

Q.  After reaching the final here last year and upsetting Lindsay the other night, how disappointed are you with today's result?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, I feel like it was a great chance for me to be in the final again.  I played her before, you know.  I beat her other times.  I think it was a real chance for me to be in the final again.  I feel disappointing, yeah. But with the whole tournament, I think it was a very good tournament.  I was playing very solid here, especially last match against Lindsay, and today as well. So, yeah, I can take it as one of the, you know, best tournament of this year for me. 
 

Q.  Is it even more disappointing given what happened at the injury time-out?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  (Laughing).  No. 
 

Q.  Do you believe that you would have won the match had the injury time-out not happened?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I mean, who knows?  But I was, you know, pretty -- dominated in the first set, you know, playing very solid.  You know, she didn't have any chances. Yeah, but who knows.  I can't tell you right now. 
 

Q.  Is it something that's remained in your mind?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No. 
 

Q.  As you feel the match going on...
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No, no, no.  Maybe I was a little bit, yeah.  Maybe I was a little bit angry, you know, in the beginning of the second set, but then, I mean, I know if I want to win this match, I have to be focused, not to think about what she did.  That's what I was trying to do, you know. 
 

Q.  What was going through your mind when you went to shake hands with her?  Were you still annoyed with the situation?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  No.  I mean, what can you say?  I mean, it's too late for, you know, this negative thinking and, you know, it was just a game. 
 

Q.  Would you actually maybe file a protest with the WTA or talk to somebody about a rule change?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, I don't think they gonna change the rules only because of this match.  As you remember last year with Serena and Jennifer, you know, such a big mistake from the chair umpire, you know, we still using the same system.  We don't have like an electronic system, we don't use it. I mean, everyone can make a mistake, you know.  Just I think we're all human being and it doesn't really matter. 
 

Q.  So what did go wrong for you in this match?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I think, you know, I didn't take advantage of the first set, that I was playing so good, you know.  I could win the second game of the second set and lead 2-Love and then the thing could be different for me. So I just gave her a chance to play better in the second set, and she took the advantage of this. 
 

Q.  You said you have to be prepared for the slow play whenever you're going to play Mary.  What do you do, how do you prepare for that?  Is there something you tell yourself, if you know that's going to be the case every time you play her?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  You know, just before the match you just have to be, you know, focus and, you know you have to be patient on the court.  You just don't have to be ready, you know, straight after you finish your point.  You can, you know, just have little walk, you know, because she is not ready to serve until she is, you know, completely ready. So just, yeah, you know it's going to be a long match and you have to be patient. 
 

Q.  Have you ever spoken with any of your friends on the tour?  Is it something that ever comes up among players about --
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I mean, it's not a thing to discuss about.  I mean, what can you say?  It's not interesting, to talk about the way she play. 
 

Q.  No one has asked you about your second serve today at least.
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Oh, yeah, so it's all about this, you know, treatment on the court (laughing). 
 

Q.  How long did it take you to realize, I guess, that there really wasn't anything all that wrong with her?  How long into the second set did it take you, and did you try to change your game at all thinking that she's not going to be able to move, and find out that she can?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I mean, once again, it didn't affect me, you know.  After this break, you know, I was serving.  I won this game very easily, you know.  I was very close to win the second game on her serve, so that means, you know, that it didn't affect my game.  Just some little mistake that I started to do, maybe because she started to play, you know, deep and heavy. I mean, she was playing pretty good today, you know.  I think she improved since last time we play, so she has a very solid game for the moment.
