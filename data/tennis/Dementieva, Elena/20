 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your game today?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I think it was a very difficult day for all of us. You know, ten hours waiting to come on court was quite difficult. You know, I'm just glad that we were able to finish our match today. I have one day off tomorrow, you know, which gives me some time to get ready for the next round.   
  
  Q. What was your reaction to the draw when you saw it, knowing what was waiting for you in the second round?   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: And what was waiting for me in the second round?   
  
  Q. Well, Justine.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Like she's in the second round already without playing the first round?   
  
  Q. She was playing before you.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Oh, yeah. I didn't watch it.   
  
  Q. Doesn't matter.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, I think it's going to be a tough challenge because, you know, Justine, she's a very experienced player. I'm sure she was getting ready for this comeback.   
 So, yeah, I'm just expecting a tough match against her.   
  
  Q. Do you think they should have seeded her?   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, we don't have such rules. I mean, she's coming back after such a long break, so she's unseeded here.   
 I mean, she could face any player in this draw.   
  
  Q. Have you seen her progress in Brisbane?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes. I did see. I was watching her final against Kim in Brisbane. I think it was incredible match. They both were playing very well. So it was very impressive.   
  
  Q. How do you look forward to that match in two days? She had your number a couple of times. It's 9-2 in the stats, but a long time ago.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, once again, I expect a tough match against her. It looks like she was really -- you know, she did a great preparation before coming here. She was playing very well in Brisbane, and also I'm sure she was playing well today.   
 So, uhm, yeah, I mean, even coming back after such long break, you know, she's still a big champion. You know, she had a great experience, you know, winning so many Grand Slams. So I'm sure, I mean, it's all behind her.   
  
  Q. But you are playing well, too, now.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You're asking me or you're telling me?   
  
  Q. Telling you or asking you. Whatever.  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Telling me. Thank you (laughter.)   
  
  Q. What can you maybe draw from the past?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I mean, last time we play was long time ago. I'm sure she was, you know, working on her game and she improved. I'm sure she improve her game. So it will be a completely different match.   
 We play lots of times before, but I think after such a long break, it's going to be all new. It's going to be a different match for both of us.
