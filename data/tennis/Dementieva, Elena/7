 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Obviously a tough one to swallow.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, it's tough.   
  
  Q. It was such an epic match. Any consolation you can take out of being involved in the longest women's match played at the US Open?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, it was difficult to play. We were waiting for a long time before we went on the court. It's never easy to play that late. So we don't get used to it.   
 For me, it was probably one of the latest match I ever played in my life. It was really difficult to stay, you know, focused. We have ups and downs all the time, both of us, during the match.   
 Samantha was very solid during the end of the match, served very well. Yeah, just played a very solid match.   
  
  Q. Those type of matches always turn on just a couple of points. Where do you feel that match was lost for you?   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I was trying to fight till the end. Just feel disappointed the way I was playing the match points. I was not aggressive enough.   
 But was really difficult to push yourself forward all the time 'cause I was feeling like a little bit sleepy in the match. Yeah, it was not about playing a perfect game; it was all about win this match. I feel I had some opportunities that I couldn't use it, yeah.   
  
  Q. I presume you don't train at 1:30 in the morning. How was it to play at that time? Do you think it was fair?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, it was difficult for both of us. I don't make the schedule. That's the way they do it here, so... Have to accept it.
