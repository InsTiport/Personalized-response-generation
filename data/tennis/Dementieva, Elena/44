 Q. What do you do? Do you have to practice more instead of playing the match, or do you go back to the hotel without playing? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You know, it's really unfortunate we couldn't play today. I feel sorry for her, I mean, this is not the way you want to be in the final. 

 Q. Is it first stressing in the beginning, and then you forget it? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You have to have competition, and get ready for the final no matter what. So to feel better in the final. 

 Q. You have plenty of time to watch maybe the next match? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, for sure. I'm going to watch it. She's playing well in Paris, and Jankovic who is a former No. 1 player. 

 Q. So three finals in four tournaments. It's not too bad?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, it was not just the results, but the way I was playing in the beginning of the year was pretty good. 

 Q. With the quick start? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, for sure, it's really helped me in Australia. 
 I was, you know, because of the weather conditions to play a good tennis from the beginning from my first tournament on.
