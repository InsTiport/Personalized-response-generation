 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please, for Elena. 

 Q. I want to know how you feel in this competition? We see Wozniacki, but you are here and very near the semifinal. 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, I just feel disappointed the way I was playing today. I think I was a little slow on the court, didn't have a good reaction today. And Serena, she was playing too good for me today. 
 I think she's in a great shape for the moment. The way she was playing against Venus last night was unbelievable match. 
 Well, I just feel I have a very tough group. So probably tomorrow will be a decided match for all of us. You know, just trying to get ready for this last challenge, trying to improve my game, 'cause I really need to improve even my serve, you know, just stay focused for this last game. 

 Q. You will face Kuznetsova tomorrow. If you win the game, you can make it to the semifinal. What is your expectation of the next game?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Well, I expect a tough match, because it's going to be decided game for me and Svetlana. If Venus win today, it's going to be also for her. Well, I realize it's going to be tough challenge. She beat me last time we played in Stuttgart. I think, you know, it's going to be a tough match for me.
