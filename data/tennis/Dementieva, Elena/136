Q.  How different was it from all of those times you watched her play on television?  
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   It was really tough to play against Monica, and especially in the first set, I was always late for the ball.  You know, I played very bad, but I think it's not because I just play bad; because she didn't give me, to play my game.  I think it was a good try for the first time.  A great experience for me.  
  

Q.  How nervous were you? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No, I wasn't nervous at all.  
  

Q.  How would you compare her groundstrokes in terms of speed and disguise, compared to, you know, to other players?  How would you compare? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   You know, it's tough to say, because, you know, like I said before, I didn't play my game.  If I played like I played against Lindsay, maybe she couldn't play so fast like she did.  
  

Q.  What's the most important thing you learned today? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Nothing good.  (Laughs).  You know, it was very interesting for me to play against her, and I want to play again.  I think I need to try again and again before I can beat her.  
  

Q.  What would you have to do? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   You know, just play against her, because, you know, I have to try again.  Maybe, you know, I try to play  -- I try to move her, but next time I will try to play to the back or something new. 
  

Q.  Is it possible maybe you were intimidated by her because she was somebody you had admired in the past? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No, I don't think so.  I think she is a good player.  She is a great player.  That's why it was tough to play against her. 
  

Q.  The success that you've had in the last six months, does it change what you think that you are capable of as a player?  Do you see a new opportunity for next year? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes, I think it has been a great year for me.  It's very good final for the year, this tournament, and you know, I need the break.  I hope to play better next year.  I will try.  
  

Q.  Some players do play doubles a lot just to get better.  Did you consider to play doubles? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   You know, I will try next year, because I don't have a ranking, doubles ranking.  And I'm not very good doubles player, because my ball is  -- I still improve, but I will try next year. 
  

Q.  You've had a great year, this is kind of a year that you've broken out in the circuit.  How exciting has this been for you, the whole year?  How exciting are your results; you have done so well?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   It wasn't a surprise for me, because I work hard, and, you know, it just  -- I think it is the result of my work.  
  

Q.  If there's one thing that you are missing from your game, to take you from No. 16 to No.  5, what is it? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   One thing?  
  

Q.  Yeah. 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I think it's a lot of things.  
  

Q.  Okay.  Like what? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Like everything.  (Laughs). 
  

Q.  Did you find a big difference when you switched from Juniors to the Tour, or was it much easier than you expected? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No, it was very difficult, because, you know, whenever we play Juniors tournament, like under 16, under 18, it was for fun.  It was like a game.  In the WTA Tour, it is more than just a game.  It's your work, it's your life.  It's very difficult.  
  

Q.  Do you like life on the Tour? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes. 
  

Q.  Do you enjoy it? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes. 
  

Q.  What about it do you like, the travel? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I like travel.  I like play tennis.  I don't like press conference.  (Laughter). 
  

Q.  Why not? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Because my English is not so good and I feel not comfortable.  
  

Q.  Have you taken English lessons? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes, I will in Moscow.  I will study on my vacation.  (Laughter). 
  

Q.  Where are you going to start the Tour next year? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I will play exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and my first tournament will be in Canberra and then Australian Open.  
  

Q.  So not Sydney?
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No.  
  

Q.  Do you have any goals for next year what you'd like to do next year, maybe win a title? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Maybe a few titles, I don't know.  (Laughs). 
  

Q.  Is it difficult for you to deal with the off-court attention? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   You just asked me yesterday.  It was different.  No, I don't like it, I said to you yesterday.  
  

Q.  But is it difficult to deal with it? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yeah, it's difficult for me, yes.
