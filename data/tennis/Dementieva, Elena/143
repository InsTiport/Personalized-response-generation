MODERATOR: Questions for Elena. 

Q. How confident were you going into the match?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You know, I was very calm before the match because I played against
her already and I beat her, so I was a little bit exciting because I didn't have a
practice in this stadium. It's the biggest stadium, I never played. But I was nervous just
in the beginning. 

Q. Not after you won the first set? You seemed to tail off there. 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, but it was very windy. I think she played very well in the
second set.

Q. Is it particularly satisfying to you that you have now progressed farther in a Grand
Slam tournament than Anna Kournikova ever did? 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I think she was in semis, too, in Wimbledon.

Q. Well, you've done just as well, and unexpectedly so. Did you expect to be able to go
so far in this tournament when you came into it?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, I thought I can do it because I worked very hard in Moscow. I
want to be able to play very well Olympics game, and this tournament, too, of course.

Q. How have you gotten your game so much better this year? What particularly have you
been working on?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You know, I cannot say that I'm playing much better this year. I
really believe myself that I can do it. I had a big experience, so I played a lot of
tournaments this year. 

Q. When you look up on the board and you see Elena Dementieva, you see Venus, Serena,
Martina, Lindsay, with you in that company, what do you think?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You know, just amazing because two years ago I just watched them by
TV. I didn't think that I can play like I play now.

Q. Do you feel like, "I really do belong here"? Do you feel a little
overwhelmed by it all?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, I feel very good here.

Q. Who do you think you'll play in the semifinals?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It's very difficult to say. But, you know, I played against Lindsay
already four times. I know how to play against her. I didn't play against Serena. If she
will won, it will be very interesting match for me.

Q. What do you think when you see her play?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Serena? 

Q. Yes. 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: She play very aggressive game. It's very difficult just waiting for
the fault. You have to be more aggressive than her. 

Q. Talk about the third set. You got off to a pretty bad start there, but managed to
get yourself back in. 

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I mean, I was down 2-Love. It was tough to came back. But it was very
windy. She did a lot of mistake in the third set. 

Q. Did you feel at times today, especially in the third set, you couldn't play as
aggressively as you normally do because of the wind?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, yeah, I didn't play aggressive like I play, like I usually
play. But, you know, sometimes it's work just waiting for the faults.

Q. Do you feel a competition with Kournikova?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, I don't. 

Q. Can you explain why she is so popular here?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No. I don't know. How can I say about her? Ask her.

Q. Your English is so good. Have you been studying it for a long time?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No, I just start to learn.

Q. And you've already picked it up so well.

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Thank you.

Q. How many languages do you speak? French?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, I speak French.

Q. And?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: And a little bit English.

Q. You said the other day that you don't have any sponsors yet, yet you bought your own
Nike stuff. Have they approached you yet now that you've made the semifinals?

courts. When you walked out today into that huge stadium, what did you feel like?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I was a little bit exciting. I mean, I didn't have a practice before
the match because the mens play before us. But I like this stadium. I played in Indian
Wells. I think it's the same stadium, but this one just a little bit bigger.

Q. Do you think your life will change after this tournament, you'll become more popular
in Russia?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't think my life is going to change because maybe I will be a
