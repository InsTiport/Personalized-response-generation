 Q.  I wanted to ask for the next week, you are coming in Croatia for Fed Cup match.  How do you feel about that?  What do you think about that match? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Well, I think it's gonna be tough to play against Croatia, you know, in Croatia.  Uhm, I don't know who exactly is gonna play for Russia.  For the moment it's hard to say.  Probably me and Dinara as a singles player, but I don't know yet. 
 And, uhm, I think it's gonna be not an easy match to play, yeah.  Well, we're gonna play on clay courts.  We don't have enough time to recover after Wimbledon and be ready to play on clay but, you know, I think we all in the same condition.  We'll try to get ready for this match. 

 Q.  Ever been in Croatia before? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I was playing, yeah, in Split a couple years ago.  Just one time I was playing a tournament, small tournament. 

 Q.  Which tournament? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  In Split, yeah.
