Q.  How big is this win for your career?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  It was very important for me to be here because I played against her last year here in this tournament and I lost 6-1, the third.  So I was very close.  And I lost her again in the clay court. So I know it's much easy to play against her on the hard court, which is my favorite surface.  So I'm very happy. 

Q.  Do you feel like you've improved since Indian Wells?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  I cannot say that I play much better than I play last year here, but I'm very believe myself and I can do it.  That's the best change for me. 

Q.  With the Olympics coming so close after the US Open, is that in your mind, going to Sydney?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  Yes.  It always on my mind because it's big competition for me, maybe one time in my life.  So I want to be ready for this. 

Q.  What are you most looking forward to about going there?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA:  It's difficult to say.  I didn't finish this tournament.
