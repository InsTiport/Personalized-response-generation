E. DEMENTIEVA/E. Makarova
  7-5, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. So you how was your match? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It was, you know, very tough, especially in the beginning of the match, because I just can't get rhythm. Maybe it was not enough time for me to get used to the surface and get used to the weather condition, which was pretty hot.
 Yeah, I mean, I feel like I played better in the second set. The first set was really tough to play.

 Q. It's always tough getting up for a tournament immediately after you've won. 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I just wish I had an extra day, you know, just to have a good rest. You know, get ready as good as possible for this tournament. 
 But it was really tough to come and play just the next day. But I'm glad I won in two sets. You know, it felt much better in the end of the match. 

 Q. Is it more of a mental battle when you have to go through this?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah. Physically I was feeling fine, but mentally it's always tough, because I was playing like five days in a row if Auckland. Coming here and playing today, it was -- yeah, it was really tough. But I'm glad, you know, I was able to get through this match.

 Q. There have been quite a few withdrawals from the tournament today with various injuries and ailments. Are you concerned that you're going to have too many matches?
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No. I just think today is a very tough day. It's very hot, and lots of players are coming from Europe. It's never easy to get used to the weather condition here in Australia, and sometimes it's extremely hot on the courts. 
 So everything can happen. You know, it's -- you have to be very careful, you know, by practicing, you know, and playing the whole day by coming here. So I think it's never easy.
