 Q.  You played against a Russian player tonight.  There's four Russian tennis players in the tournament.  How do you explain the success of Russian tennis players? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It's difficult to say and transfer in general.  
We each have a different story and come from a different part of the country.  I think it's competition that makes us improve in our tennis.  And we're trying to improve our game, and it looks like we have lots of motivation, maybe that's why we have so many good players in the top of the game. 

 Q.  Do you think Former President Boris Yeltsin played a key role in this Russian success?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, sure, because of him, you know, the tennis became very popular in Russia.  
He was in love with tennis, and he's a very big fan of tennis.  Because of him -- we had a lot of, you know, things collapse in Moscow, all around Russia.  And because of his support, you know, people in Russia started to know a little bit more about this game.  

 Q.  Can you sum up the tournament?  
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Sorry?  

 Q.  Can you sum up your play in the tournament? 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: You know, I really like it here.  I think we should keep the championship here in Madrid.  It's very well organized and all the players are happy to be here.  Personally for me I couldn't play my best these days, but I was enjoying to be here, and I love the arena.  I love the center court, and the atmosphere on the court was great.
