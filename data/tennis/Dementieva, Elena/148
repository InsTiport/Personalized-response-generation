Q. Can you talk about the match and what it means to your career, beating Venus?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I'm very happy with the way I played today, and that made me believe
that I can play against such a strong team, such leading players; so I'm very happy for
myself and for my team.

Q. Elena, were you able to relax since the final outcome of the match had already been
determined, the U.S. winning? Were you able to relax and go for your shots a little bit
more?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, it made me feel more comfortable on the court, and probably
somehow, it influenced the way I played.

Q. What went through your mind when you won, after match point?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It's difficult to explain what I felt right after the game was over,
but I was overwhelmed. I was very happy that we didn't lose the game completely.

Q. Did your teammates give you any advice on playing Venus? And I'm sure you've seen
Venus play quite a bit.

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I got very good advice from Elena Likhovtseva. She told me that I
should not be afraid, and that I can hit the ball as hard as Venus does.

Q. Have you called your parents yet, or was it too late?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It's nighttime there.

Q. What do you think they'll say?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: They won't believe me (laughter.)

Q. With Elena's performance at the US Open against Conchita Martinez, a good showing,
and now against Venus, what does that hold for the future?

ELENA DEMENTIEVA: It made me feel -- I started to believe in myself that I can play
with leading players, and I think it meant a lot for my career. And I think I will keep up
the good work.
