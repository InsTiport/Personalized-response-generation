 WTA: Questions for Elena.  
 
Q. How does it feel to be in the semifinals?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I'm very exciting. I think it's good experience for me. It's the best
tournament in my life, so I'm very happy to be in the semis.  
 
Q. Did you play better today than you did when you beat Venus in the Fed Cup?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, I think so. I play much better.  
 
Q. In what areas? What part of your game was better?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I mean, my serve and my backhand today was very good.  
 
Q. You make less errors than before. Have you been working on your consistency?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes. I work very hard in Moscow every day. I'm not surprised to be in
the semis. It's a good result for my work.  
 
Q. You live in Moscow?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes. 
 
Q. And who is your coach?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Sergey Pashkov. He's in Moscow.

Q. Is she in the room today, your mother?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes.  
 
Q. How much publicity do you get at home in your newspapers in Russia when you play? Is
there much publicity about your matches?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't know. But I don't think it's too much because it's always
about Anna Kournikova.  
 
Q. Are you happy for it to be like that? Does it help you, do you think, not to have
quite so much spotlight on you?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, I think so. I like it. 
 
Q. What do you think about Anna Kournikova? How do you view her?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I think everyone knows here very well. No comment. 
 
Q. Do you know her well yourself?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No. 
 
Q. As a person, you don't?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No.  
 
Q. Have you played her?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: No. Maybe seven years ago when I just start to play because I was
starting the same club.  
 
Q. Was it the Fed Cup win which really gave you that big push forward possibly in your
confidence?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, I think so because now I believe in myself. I think that I can
beat such a great player like Venus or the Top-10 players. Yes, it's helped me much. 
 
Q. And what is your favorite surface to play on?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: This surface.  
 
Q. Will you play Fed Cup in April in Moscow?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I want to play, but I'm not sure if I will. 
 
Q. Because you are not sure to be in the team?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Because we have so many players, Anna Kournikova, Likhovtseva,
Panova. I'm always ready to play. 
 
Q. Do you know if Kournikova and Likhovtseva are going to play?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I'm not sure. Anna Kournikova said that she want to play.  
 
Q. You might play Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. Have you ever played with her,
practiced with her? What do you think about that?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: In the Fed Cup, I played against her. I lost 6-4, 6-Love. 
 
Q. What would be your plan against her?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't have no idea how to play against her, but I will try my best
game. 
 
Q. Have you set yourself any sort of targets, ranking targets, something like that for
this year? 
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Sorry? I don't understand.  
 
Q. Do you want to be at a certain point in the rankings this year?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I don't think about my ranking, so I just play. I want to play
better. The ranking, it's not important for me. 
 
Q. What are the parts of your game that you most want to improve at the moment?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Volleys, my volleys.

 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yeah, but I mean, why I'm here, I want to play tennis because I want
to be the best.

other sports?

Q. Your mother chose it for you?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, that's right.

it's tennis.

Q. Footwork. 
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Every day after each practice, it takes just one hour after each
practice.  
 
Q. You work on it for an hour a day?
 
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: I mean, after the practice.
