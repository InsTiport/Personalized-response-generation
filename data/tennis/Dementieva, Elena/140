Q.  You've played her now six times, you've lost five matches, and the last match you played with her at the Open the second set went to a tiebreaker.  What was different in this match?  
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes, we've played six times already and I lost five.  So, you know, last match was pretty close in the second set, and I think I just find the game, just find how to play against her.   Today, I started a bit earlier, and that's why I won, I think.  
  

Q.  Well, how do you play against her? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I just try to give my serve, and, you know, try to move her.  But I think she just  -- I think she was a little bit tired today, but anyway, I'm happy to beat her.  
  

Q.  What is it about New York?  What is it about you and New York, you always seem to do well here? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I love New York.  This is a wonderful city, and I'm happy to be here.  I like autumn, and autumn in New York, it's beautiful.  
  

Q.  It looked like you had a little trouble kind of getting used to her serve in the first set.  You were not getting her serve back, but then it improved as the match went along.  What did you do differently? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes, she serves very well and it is difficult to return.  But I think in the third set, she didn't serve her first serve too much, so I had a chance to break her in the second serve. 
  

Q.  You've now reached the semifinals of the Open, the finals at the Olympics, can you put this in perspective?  Is this as good as that, not quite as good? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   I think it is good, but I think my best result was in the Olympic Games.  Usually I forgot already, but the Olympics final is still in my mind.  
  

Q.  What kind of a year has this been for you, exciting? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes, it was a wonderful year, and this is a great final for this year.  
  

Q.  At the Open, you said that you didn't have an agent, you didn't have any endorsements, you didn't have a boyfriend; what's changed since then? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Agent and a boyfriend is the same thing.  (Laughter). 
  

Q.  Do you have an agent now? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes. 
  

Q.  Do you have endorsements? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   Yes. 
  

Q.  Do you have a boyfriend? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No.  
  

Q.  What were you thinking, you're down match point in the tiebreaker, what was going through your mind? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   You know, I just played against Hingis in Moscow, and it was a very tough match.  And it went -- in the third set, it was full, and returning (inaudible) -- her serve, I am starting to think I can beat her, I am winning; and I lost my match.  So, today, I didn't think at all about what can I do now.  I just played.  You know, trying to focus on the ball.  
  

Q.  Do you remember how you saved match point, what shot? 
 
ELENA DEMENTIEVA:   No.
