 S. KUZNETSOVA/E. Dementieva
  6-3, 6-2 
  
  
  
  Q. A disappointing loss, a tough loss when you had qualification in your own hands.   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: Yes, it's disappointing to finish the tournament in this way. I wanted to win and advance to the semifinals but she played well. She was very aggressive and returned a lot of balls and went for everything. I think that I was playing aggressively enough, but she ran a lot of balls down and hit with a lot of power.   
  
  Q. With Kuznetsova already out of the tournament, did it surprise you how she played?   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: She had no pressure and nothing to lose. Everyone wants to win the last match and finish the season on a positive note.   
 She was able to play with no pressure and play her own game.   
  
  Q. When you look at the final standings, the three of you finish equal, and yet the person that you defeated advances, how does that make you feel?   
 ELENA DEMENTIEVA: We had a very tough group, the Maroon Group. Of course, I respect all the players in the competition. They are the best eight players in the world. But it's hard to play Venus, Serena, and then Svetlana. There were no warmup matches here. We had a tough group. Obviously I would have liked to qualify, but I didn't.
