B. ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA/S. Stosur
  7‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   Thank you. 

Q.   I understand you haven't played Sam before?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   I don't remember I played her.   No, I think was the first matchup.

Q.   What did you expect of the match?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   Obviously she's a great player, so I expect it to be a tough match.   It was a tough match, especially the first set.   The conditions were also very difficult to play in.
But I was playing a good match.   I was playing‑‑ following the tactic what I got from my coach, and I'm happy, very happy with the performance I did today.

Q.   What sort of plans did you come in with?   Did you see anything in particular in her game that you felt you had the better of?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   First of all, I had to focus on my game, as usual.   I was thinking to go maybe more to the net and playing there and playing aggressive against her, because she's very powerful player.   When she push you back off the court, then you really don't have really a chance.   You have to step in, and that's what I did, especially in the second set. 
That was working very well.

Q.   Did you speak too Lucie a little all? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   Yeah, I was speaking with her a little bit.   She gave me some things, but my coach gave me a lot.   So the key was that I got the things from my coach.

Q.   The draw has opened up quite a bit.   You and Pironkova are in the quarters; both unseeded.   Is this an opportunity for you to go further perhaps?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   I think match by match.   I don't think that who is out and who is not.   Every player is good and everybody can play.   Especially tomorrow I'm playing against Pironkova.   She won it last year and really feels well here.
So let's see how it goes tomorrow.   It's going to be very tough match.   I lost to her two years ago, but it was on grass. 
Anyway, it's going to be a very tough one.   I'm really looking forward to that.   (Smiling.)

Q.   Obviously the match was very close until the tiebreaker, and then you just seemed to find a bit more.   Talk us there through that period. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   Yeah, I mean the key was I was leading 5‑3, and then 5‑4 and serving for the set.   I had 30‑Love and made very easy mistakes at the net.   I stayed focus there.   It was not easy to hang in there, but I did.
The tiebreak I played very well.   I stepped in and playing the volleys very well.   I was thinking about the tactic and focusing on the game that I have to play.   That was the key I won the first set, and I think also was the key of the whole match. 

Q.   I saw you play some big matches at Wimbledon and also the US Open.   Do you tend to like the bigger stage?   And why have I seen your name a lot more in the last six months?   Things going much more positive for you?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   Yeah, I enjoy myself much more than before.   I have my new coach, and he teach me very different things.   I understand the game a little bit different. 
I like to play on a big stage.   That's why I train.   That's why I do this sport, to play on the big matches and enjoy myself out there.   This is what I love to do.   Playing at Wimbledon and the US Open and Australian Open, this is a dream.   This is what I work for, and I'm very happy to be there. 

Q.   So who's your coach now? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA‑STRYCOVA:   His name is Jerome Adamec.   She's from France, but he lives in Spain.   His grandfather is actually Czech, he was Czech.   Yeah, so everything mixed.   (Smiling.)
