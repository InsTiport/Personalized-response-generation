  6‑2, 0‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You've done three matches, three sets always.   How do you feel physically?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Physically right now I feel a little bit tired.   Obviously I played singles and yesterday I was playing also doubles; today I have one more match of doubles again. 
So I feel a little bit sore because grass court is a little bit different movements.   But I have massage and I will be good tomorrow.

Q.   Playing singles and doubles, how much it affects your games and your matches? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, it doesn't affect my game at all.   I mean, it is tiring, but I'm happy that I have so many matches.   That means I'm winning.   I'm doing this nearly every tournament, so it's good that I have matches still going on. 
Like I said, I will have a good recovery and I will be ready tomorrow again. 

Q.   Well done.   It's your first appearance here for five years, I think. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, yes.

Q.   Has a lot changed in the time you've been away?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   For me, yes, a couple things change, but also here changed so much.
It's really nice to be here and to see the new site.   I'm very happy to be back again.

Q.   I think you tend to come once every five years:   You came in 2004, 2009, 2014.   Will you come back next year?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, I'm coming back next year.   I have some points to defend, so I will definitely coming next year. 
I love London.   I love England.   I love to be here.   I am definitely coming next year.

Q.   Do you feel comfortable on the grass?   You've had a lot of the time on it now. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, I do.   I always feel comfortable on grass.   I like the surface and I like to play on it because my game suits the surface.
I always looking forward for the grass season.   I'm happy to be on grass again.

Q.   You have a very good record at Wimbledon.   Qualified lots of times. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Is Wimbledon a big tournament for you? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   One of the biggest ones.   I mean, I always loved it, the atmosphere, the history behind it.   It's one of my favorite tournament of the year.
So I'm looking forward again, and I hope I will play good tennis there. 

Q.   Today I think the crowd was a little bit noisy at times. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah.

Q.   Was that a problem for you?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I mean, it is not a problem, but they are kids and they don't know when to be quiet.   It's not easy.   There were so many kids over there, and yesterday was even more. 
Sometimes it's a little bit annoying, but the referee did a great job and it was not that bad like yesterday.

Q.   Hopefully you'll be on the show court tomorrow. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   We'll see.   I like No. 1.

Q.   Can I ask you a question about World Cup.   I know the Czech Republic aren't there. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   We are not there, I know.   It's so bad.

Q.   Will be you watching?   Will you be interested? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, I will.   I like football.   I'm not really following it, but my team is Portugal, so I am following now Portugal.

Q.   Why Portugal?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I don't know.   I just like the players.

Q.   Ronaldo?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I like him, yes.   Not the way he's looking, but like he as an athlete. 

Q.   Interesting match in terms of scoreline obviously.   Did well in the first set and very frustrating second set, you might have thought. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, I stopped believing myself that I could go through and mentally I was really down.   I call my coach and I told him that.   I couldn't get up.   I was also serving really bad. 
I'm happy that in the third set I won the second game of my serve.   It was really important.   Today the second set was really mentally very weak.

Q.   What changed at the start of the third then? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, I had to get back to the game somehow.   I had to move better.   I called again my coach, and we were talking a little bit about it on the changeover.
I wanted to win that so much, so I was like, I have to go for it, to change something.   I was moving better and I believed again a little bit more. 

Q.   Did you have treatment?   You had a timeout, did you?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah, I had a treatment.   My nail is broken, so I had to tape it off again.

Q.   Will it be okay for tomorrow?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I will be ready for tomorrow.
