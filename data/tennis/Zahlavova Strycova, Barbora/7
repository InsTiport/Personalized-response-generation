B. ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA/K. Flipkens
  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   Another good win.   Into the semifinals. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Thank you.

Q.   Tell us how it was for you out there today. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I'm feeling very happy because I was playing perfect match today.   I was feeling great on the court and I was also playing very well, so I am pleased with my performance.

Q.   I'm surprised to hear you say that, because at the end of the first set you looked, I don't know, a little annoyed. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   No, I just felt a little bit the pressure on my serves because she was playing pretty good and she was putting all the time pressure. 
But I serve it well and I serve it out the first set.   It was very important, so it was a little bit nervy there.

Q.   Do you think being such a strong doubles player is helping you on grass?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I think it doesn't help me just on grass, it helps me on any surface.   Doubles always helps your serve, your return, you play well, which I like.   Especially on grass at the very important.
So playing doubles on any surface, it helps me, yes.

Q.   But it's very important to play volley though on grass.   I think maybe that has more impact than on other surfaces. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah, definitely it's very important to play volleys.   Especially today against Kirsten because she is very dangerous player and she is playing slices all the time, so you have to put pressure and going to the net and play the volleys.
So I did that, and I've very happy.   The volleys are not that easy, though, but I did it. 

Q.   Did you feel fresh this morning?   Obviously yesterday you said you had three long matches.   You recovered? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I was surprised, but I was feeling very well today.   Also during the warmup I felt pretty good.   I'm sore like in my back, but it's okay.
I look an ice bath yesterday, I had massage, and I feel good. 

Q.   Will you feel any pressure tomorrow in a semifinal? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I don't know.   I'm happy I'm in the semis.   I never played Casey.   It's going to be very challenging.   She's lefty, and especially on grass it's very difficult to play against lefties.
We'll see.   I mean, pressure, I'm looking forward for that. 

Q.   Who would be key?   I guess your first serve will be a big factor tomorrow. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, it's always on grass the surface the key.   I have to be, like I said, again aggressive and putting the pressure and going to the net.   This is the key to play on grass.
So I didn't talk about it with my coach yet, but he will tell me some tips and tactic.

Q.   Have you had a chance to look around Birmingham at all?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   No, I haven't.   I just saw hotel in the courts and the sushi bar. 
No, I didn't.   Unfortunately not. 

Q.   What was that move at the end of the match that you did? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   This is between me and my coach.   We did it two years ago.   That will be our move before the match, before any tournament. 
So I keep it for me.   It's just between me and him.   (Smiling.)

Q.   You and Kimiko played pretty well together here.   She made quarters.   She lost, but obviously a big week for her, too.   What do you think of her still playing this well at 43. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, if she loves this sport and loves to do it, why not?   She's great.   She's a great athlete.   So professional.   Sometimes I'm like, Wow, how can you do that still? 
But I'm just happy that I can play with her and she's next to me on court.   It's really nice, and I enjoy to play with her and I'm happy that she's still around. 

Q.   When you came to Birmingham, did you think that semifinals were possible? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   This is ‑‑ no.   Honestly, no, because I came here so late.   I came Sunday night because I was playing German League on clay court.   I had just one practice, like one hour, and then I went on to play a match.
So I didn't expect anything of being semifinal.   It's nice.   Sometimes it's like this.   (Smiling.)

Q.   You said German League?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah.

Q.   Tell us a bit about that.   Is that like club standard?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah, clubs playing between each other.   Like eight clubs and it takes six weeks and it's six matches.   And if you can, if we are not on a tournament, we play there. 
So we played on Sunday ‑‑ Friday and Sunday, and Sunday was the final.

Q.   Did you win?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   We won, yes.   Yay! 

Q.   And you're playing with your friends? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, yeah, Klara was playing, Koukalova, in my team, and we were playing against ‑‑ for example, I was playing Stephanie Voegele there. 
So, yeah.
