B. ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA/C. Wozniacki
  6‑1, 1‑1 (ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you feel today about the match? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, we played against each other like three days ago in Auckland, so I know it's going to be a tough match because she's such a great player and very tough to play.
But I went for the match like I did before, and unfortunately didn't finish it how it normally should.   It's really sad. 

Q.   How are you feeling about your form in general right now?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I feel pretty well.   Having a lot of matches behind my, and it's always good to have it because it's the beginning of the season going for Melbourne, it's good to play many matches.
I feel fine.

Q.   Goals for this year? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I have some, but I won't tell you.

Q.   Is that a superstition thing?
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, I am very superstitious.   I have some goals.   I have many.   But I like to keep them for me. 

Q.   You said that you're an emotional player on court. 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah.

Q.   How does that help you? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, being emotional doesn't help so much.   You have to know where to limit.   The emotions, I have to put them out, but in a way that helps me and it's not against me.   I'm trying to work on it with my coaches.   I feel I'm getting better. 

Q.   How do you fell about your next opponent, Sam Stosur? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I don't know we played each other.   I'm not sure.   She's great player obviously and she is home; home crowd behind her. 
I will just go there and enjoy myself and try to play as good as I can the day and we see how it goes.

Q.   One more thing:   Are you keeping track of the other Czech players at this tournament? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, I do. 

Q.   They're doing very well right now.   I'm always curious to ask Czech tennis, what do you think makes Czech people so good at tennis? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Maybe we have good coaches; maybe we work hard.   The school in Czech, from the beginning, when we were young, we hit a lot of balls and a lot of patterns. 
I don't know why.   We have good talent.   More women than I think men's right now, but it's good for such a small country like Czech.   I am happy that we are doing well. 

Q.   There is a new WTA tournament in Prague.   Are you excited to go? 
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I'm very excited.   We already had one before, but it's going to be a different place.   I'm always happy to play at home because it's always nice.   It's like 30 minutes from my hometown so I don't have to stay in a hotel.   I'm really looking forward to be there.
