  7/6, 7/6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel this kind of win was in you?   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I feel great here and I felt great on Birmingham.   I believed in myself coming into this match.   I thought I can do it.   That what happened.   
I'm really glad I could pull this through.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to winning for you today?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Well, the key was just the belief, the belief in myself, to not give her any easy points.   I think I did that right.   
I was serving very well.   I was following the tactic what my coach said.   I think that was the key.   
   
 Q.   You play a very different player in Wozniacki next.   Your thoughts on that matchup?   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I mean, she's a great player anyway.   This will be a challenge for me.   This is my first time in the second week of a Grand Slam so I will enjoy.   
I will do the same like I did the previous matches:   I will focus on myself, on my game, and we see how it goes.   
   
 Q.   You played against Wozniacki three times before.   What do you remember from those matches?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   We had really good matches.   It was close matches.   But we never played on grass.   
So I will try to play my game, which is important always on grass because I like to play volleys, I like to serve good.   So we see how it goes.   
But it's going to be very challenging.   
   
 Q.   She also had a decent run in Eastbourne and here.   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I was in Birmingham final, so...   
   
 Q.   How do you see her on grass?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah, I saw her match actually from Eastbourne, I think the quarters.   She's playing very well on grass.   I mean, she's in fourth round.   Me, too.   So we're both playing pretty good tennis I would say if we're in the second week of a Grand Slam.   
It's going to be tough and I will be ready for it.   
   
 Q.   How happy were you with your emotional control today?   You've said you can be a little grumpy on court.   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I mean, I told myself before the match, I mean, this is Wimbledon, Court No.1, I shouldn't be grumpy.   This is why I do this sport.   This is why I play, to play these matches.   
I think I did great today with mental.   It wasn't easy actually.   The last point she challenged the match point.   I thought I won the match.   I didn't hear that she challenged it.   I look at the referee.   The referee, She challenge the point.   
It's in.   It's really tough.   You kind of won the match, but you did not.   It's so far away still.   I was like, Oh, my gosh.   
I wasn't nervous at that point.   I knew what I'm going to do.   But my mental skills were working today.   
   
 Q.   But then you didn't have to hit another ball.   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah.   I mean, unfortunately.  
   
 Q.   Caroline was in here earlier and said it would be creepy if officials start to check if you're wearing colorful underwear.   Do you ever wear colorful underwear when you play tennis?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes.   We buy white underwear.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it should be left to the players to decide?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I mean, I don't know.   Do you check our underwears?   
   
 Q.   She said it would be creepy.   
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I mean, it's pretty weird.   But we should follow the rules also.   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think it's pretty weird?   Do you think officials should be bothering with this kind of thing?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   I think it's weird to checking our underwear, don't you think?   I think it's very weird to check under my skirt if I'm wearing white underwear.   
If we playing in white, we should wear white underwear.   But it's kind of weird officials coming and checking.   I think it's strange.   
THE MODERATOR:   Let's move on to another subject.   
   
 Q.   You won today.   There's three other Czech player right now.   What is up with Czech tennis?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Good, right?   We are great.   It seems like we feel good on grass.   I'm very happy.   We're such a small country.   We have really good players.   Smitkova is playing third set and Petra is playing.   It's great.   I'm very happy we are playing great here.   This is all I can just say.   
   
 Q.   Any explanation for it?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   We maybe work hard.   We train well.   I don't know.   This is what I can say.   I mean, if you train and work for it, if you believe, anything can happen, yeah.   
   
 Q.   A win over Li Na must give you a lot of confidence.   Is that something that will help you from now on, to believe a little bit more?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yeah, of course.   These matches, to win against a player such as Li Na, it will give me confidence.   It will give me confidence for the next matches.   
I'm not focusing for winning a tournament.   I want to focus on match by match.   The one is coming on Monday.   It's going to be important.   
But I feel confident and I feel really good.   
   
 Q.   Is grass your favorite surface?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Yes, it is.  
   
 Q.   Why?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   Because I play, I think, good game and it suits my game because I play chip and charge, I like to play volleys, I like to mix the game.   I play slice.   I think it really suit my game.   
   
 Q.   There's been a lot made about women's tennis, the Williams sisters, Sharapova.   Do you think it's time now for other players to break that mold and show there's quality?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   They are still playing great.   Maria, Serena.   They are still awesome.   
But, yeah, it would be nice to change it.   But it's not that easy.   Because, like I said, they are really playing still good tennis and we have to fight for it.  
   
 Q.   Did you watch the Williams sisters when you were growing up?  
BARBORA ZAHLAVOVA STRYCOVA:   No, I didn't watch them.   I was watching Steffi Graf.   She was my idol.
