Q.  What is your main goal for 1993? 

ALEXANDER VOLKOV:  My goal? 


Q.  Yes. 

ALEXANDER VOLKOV:  Is to keep playing tennis, be alive, healthy, rich and happy; try to play my best tennis as long as it is possible because for me it is difficult for me to keep very good shape, long time, and I try next year to just do my best. 


Q.  What is your problem?  Physically or mentally? 

ALEXANDER VOLKOV:  Physically now.
