  7/6, 7/6, 6/3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Could you clear up for us what happened at the end of the match?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Nothing special.   Not a big deal.   We just talk about the exchange during the court.   But nothing, that's it.   Nothing special.   Nothing important at the end of the day.  
   
 Q.   What was the exchange on court before the match finished where the chair umpire got involved?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Crowd was still talking next to me.   I stop before he was serving, then he asked the umpire what, and then I got involved.   
Nothing important.   At the end of the day, it's an important match for both.   A lot of tension over there, especially with first two tiebreak.   We both wanted to win, trying everything to win it, and that's it.   
Just explaining what was wrong during the match.   Nothing big deal.   
   
 Q.   Did you shake hands at the end?   Are you okay now with each other?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah.   There is no problem.   There is absolutely no problem.   We talk.   It's that simple.   
   
 Q.   Obviously going into the match Feliciano had played seven tiebreaks.   When you go into a match knowing he's serving well, how do you manage to handle that?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, when you play him ‑ especially on grass‑‑ especially this year he's playing so well; he's been making final of Queen's; winning the tournament before; playing well since the beginning‑ you know you're not going to have so many breakpoints, so many opportunities.   
I was nervous before, but I had my game plan.   I was ready.   I was focused on what I wanted to do:   playing simple, playing really aggressive, trying to do a lot of serve and volley, trying to show him that I'm going to try.   I'm going to accept that he's going to make aces.   I'm going to accept that he's going a play well.  
But I'm going to focus on what I do well:   serving well, being aggressive.   At the end of the match it's paying off.   I did amazing first tiebreak serving really well.   Little bit lucky in the second.   
But I was fighting.   Had the good passing shot on the set point.   Took my chance, and that was for me a great match in three sets.   
   
 Q.   Now you have Roger to face.   What are your thoughts on how he's playing at the moment?   Have you watched any of his matches?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, nothing.   I didn't watch at all.   
But, you know, when you play Roger at Wimbledon, when he's fit and confident and feeling well, it's one of the biggest challenge in tennis.   It's like playing Rafa in French Open.   Those guys are playing their best tennis since many years.   
When you go on court, you need to trust yourself, you need to go for it.   We are playing so many times.   Last time I won but lost all before, so, yeah, it's going to be interesting match.   
   
 Q.   The experience of that match in Monte‑Carlo, the circumstances of you winning it, a final as well, how much confidence will you take from that into the match tomorrow?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, it's going to give me a lot of confidence about myself, knowing that I can beat him, doesn't matter where, on big stage.   
But tomorrow it's going to be a different experience.   First time on grass.   First time Wimbledon.   Five‑set match.   Yeah, it's going to be tough.   
But we practice so many times on grass.   I know that I'm playing my best level.   It going to depends a little bit on me, the way I'm going to play, the way I'm going to be aggressive on the court.   I know that if I can do a good match, I'm going to have some chance.   
   
 Q.   What are the rituals and superstitions that you have before and during a match?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Not so much.   Nothing.   I try not to have some because I don't want to start in that way.   
I try just to have my routine, to get my tape ready, to warm up.   I have nothing special that I try to focus on.   
   
 Q.   Can you give us an assessment of what you've been doing differently this year regarding previous years at Wimbledon?   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, I think in general my level is higher than in the past.   My confidence on myself also.   This year, with losing first round French Open, I had more time to do a good preparation.   I came early, playing Queen's, playing few matches.   I had quite a lot of time on the grass.   
For me, I think it's important for my game.   
Yeah, in general in the match I trust myself.   I go for it.   I don't wait or I don't expect the other to miss.   I just took my chance.   I'm really confident with my serve.   I'm going, I'm being aggressive.   
Today I was playing really well, coming a lot to the net.   That's make the big difference, especially when you play a guy like LÃ³pez.   
   
 Q.   A question about the shirt that you're wearing.   Have you ever heard of Stan the Man Musial?   And what does that T‑shirt mean to you?   Are you the man?   Are you ready to beat Roger?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure about I heard about your player.   
On my T‑shirt, Yonex wanted to do things different.   I had a lot of nicknames in the past year, especially Stan the Man and so many different ones.   They trying to do a few different things.   
I think it's okay.   For me it's okay.   It's fun.   It's different.   Fans love it.   That's the most important.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're the man?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Not the man.   I'm Stan.   Trying to do my job and that's it.   At the end of the day that's the most important.   
   
 Q.   It's going to be your third day in a row to play tomorrow.   How are you feeling physically?   
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's going to be tough, for sure.   Even if I had the chance to win straight sets yesterday, straight sets today, losing a lot of energy.   Especially today it was a tense match.   
It's tough to stay mentally through the end on a five‑set match on grass, but I have to deal with that.   I have the afternoon, the night to relax, to get ready for tomorrow, and give everything tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   When Roger had a difficult year last year, some people were suggesting it might be difficult for him to overcome that or might be the end of an era.   Given what you said earlier, you would have thought that would be premature?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, that's in sport in general.   When a player doesn't play well, then it gets so many bad comment.   
But, you know, Roger had some back problem last year, so that's the main reason why he was struggling a little bit.   But this year he's feeling great.   He's playing better.   Yeah, it's nice to see him there.  
   
 Q.   In terms of the challenge you face, what happened last year doesn't make your job tomorrow any easier.   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Doesn't change at all.   You know, last year was last year.   This year it's a different story.   
Yeah, I'm going to see what's going to happen tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Will you join Roger to watch the Switzerland match?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen the previous matches together?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, no.   No, no.   I'm staying in my place with my coach, physio.   Sometimes Severin is coming, but I'm doing my things here.   
   
 Q.   If Switzerland is able to win against Argentina, given that you won today and Roger won today, what would this day mean for Switzerland?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Great day, for sure.   No, for sure a great day.   But it's going to be a tough match for sure tonight.   I'm going to try to watch it.   I hope they can play well and win it, but it's going to be difficult for them.
