S. WAWRINKA/Y. Nishioka
3-6, 6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you manage to come back?  What do you think made this big difference at the end?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, was really tough match, of course.  He served twice for the match.  He had breaker in the third.
I wasn't playing great.  I was not moving well at the beginning.  I was a little bit hesitating with my game.  I think in general in the third set I played better than the two first sets.  I got, I would say, maybe to break a little bit quick especially at 5-5.
But in general I was finding a little bit better my game.  I was playing a little bit more aggressive.  I was more calm, making more long rally.
Again, I'm really happy to get through for sure.  You have to be a little bit lucky when he served twice for the match, but I'm happy to fight well enough to give me a chance to play tomorrow night.
Q. What do you think made him tough to play against?
STAN WAWRINKA: He's a really good player, moving really well.  Lefty.  He used the ball that you give really well.  He can play really fast.  When you play faster, he likes it.
Yeah, he's a really dangerous player.
Q. We talked with Svetlana earlier, and she's in a later stage with her career.  You have been around with a lot of experience.  She talked about the fact that she knows now that two more hours on the court a day before the match isn't going to change her game or result a whole lot.  Are you starting to work towards balancing a schedule in that way, especially in an event like this where you are playing so many tough matches like today?  How important is that?
STAN WAWRINKA: For sure, you don't do the same schedule as when you're 22 years old.  You have so much tennis in your body that you play so many match, so many hours.
I also feel that more the age go, less tennis I need to play good.  You still need to work out, do the right thing, the tough practice to make you feel stronger and everything, but you need to do maybe in the right time.
For sure, you're not gonna do really tough practice before match or in tournaments, because that's not the right time.  You do it when you do your preparation, when you do off- tournament.  So it's just about that, making the right schedule for feeling good.
Q. You love to drive your backhand, and Roger has driven it a lot over the years, but not so much against Nadal.  Last couple matches he's been driving it well.  Are you surprised he hasn't driven it more over the years?
STAN WAWRINKA: I think he's been playing amazing, recently, for sure, by winning Australian Open, by playing good against...
Today, his backhand, also, I think when he changed racquet, it's helped him a lot for his topspin backhand to get more power.  I think he finding better power on that side since he changed racquets.
