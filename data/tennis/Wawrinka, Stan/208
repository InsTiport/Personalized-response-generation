FEDERER‑WAWRINKA/Bopanna‑Qureshi
  6‑2, 6‑7, 10‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Roger, obviously there is not many things that you haven't won, and Davis Cup is one of those.   Is that maybe a reason why you guys decided to play together?   Besides being friends. 
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, probably partially.   I mean, we didn't really talk about, you know, only for Davis Cup, because we have played here in the past and other events.
It's just nice to team up sometimes.   Last year was just hard for me because of my back.   You know, then you don't want to take any extra chances. 
This is a tournament you see many of the other top guys are playing together because there is a bit more time between matches anyways at times.
Yeah, so this is good for us just to do it again, because it has been I think over one‑and‑a‑half years now that we have played since Davis Cup in Holland.
So we are very happy to have won today, and give ourself another match in a couple of days.

Q.   Is it something that you maybe see yourself doing a little bit more this year?
ROGER FEDERER:   Yeah, I mean, if I'm feeling good.   You know, I played doubles in Brisbane.   That's also probably one of the reasons why I'm playing better today in the doubles. 
Again, let's not forget sort of once the season gets underway it all becomes very intense and more complicated playing doubles in the clay season all the way through the grass season.
So usually maybe I play in Halle, if that, and usually play here and maybe down the stretch a couple more times.
But it depends how it will go and how we both feel for the year.   Clear we will always stay in touch and see if we could or should do maybe a bit more.

Q.   Stan, how are you feeling about your tennis now after, say, four weeks of resting and digesting the Australian Open?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, I feel great.   I was home after Davis Cup for three‑and‑a‑half weeks, but since I'm here practicing.   I was practicing with Magnus.   I'm really happy.   I think my level is really good and physically I'm ready.
So I'm really looking forward for my match tomorrow and for the rest of the season, because it's just the beginning.
It was important for me to be back on the practice, to stay focused on practicing hard, and trying to improve my game. 

Q.   Stan, you had to pull out of a few events after Davis Cup.   Can you talk about how you feel after Australia and playing Davis Cup right away?   Must be very extreme for you. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, it was really tough, especially my legs wasn't feeling so well.   That's the reason why I pull out after Davis Cup.   But I think at the end was good that I didn't play anything one month to rest, take time for myself, for the family.   To be a little bit home after Australian Open was important.
But now I'm really am fit, and that's the most important. 

Q.   How long did you not touch your racquets?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Maybe 10 days, 15 days.   I don't remember exactly, but I was for three weeks‑and‑a‑half I didn't practice much except for last week. 

Q.   You talked about improving your game.   Obviously Edberg and Norman were out there.   Do you want to talk about some of the improvements or little edges, little edge that they can give you?   And also, did they talk doubles strategy at all today?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   For me? 

Q.   Both of you, actually. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, for me try to keep the same line as we decide with Magnus since we start last year.   Still about my game, trying to improve my forehand, my serve, trying to be more aggressive on the court.
It takes time to put everything together, and that's why we still have a lot to do. 
ROGER FEDERER:   For me, yeah, we did speak doubles a little bit, but it was just about, you know, being in the right mindset, knowing what we wanted to do. 
Doubles is not that much rhythm.   It's a lot about serving and returning and just having good energy.   We haven't seen them after the doubles yet, but I hope they are happy.

Q.   How is it playing on the new court?
ROGER FEDERER:   It was great.   I mean, I requested to stay on Stadium 2, to be honest, you know, just to see how it was going to be.   I'm happy we did, because it was like‑‑ I don't know if it was sold out, but it felt like very, very full.
You're not probably going to achieve that on center court for a doubles.   But that was a perfect setup, a feeling, and sure we can thank the tournament and Larry Ellison for building such a court so quickly. 
It's nice to see the game grow and seeing people coming out and enjoying it.   It's great.   I really had a great time out there with Stan today.

Q.   Stan, obviously things change quite a bit once you're a Grand Slam champion.   Have you thought a lot about sort of your approach to the season now and kind of the extra attention and expectation, how you're going to manage that?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure a lot of change.   But, again, the most important is what I'm doing after the match, on the practice court.   It's really important that I keep trying to improve, trying to practice hard. 
For sure I have much more to do outside, much more interview, press, everything to do, but that's part of the game.   That's not a problem for me.

Q.   In terms of the level of tennis you showed in Australia, do you think that's kind of something you can maintain consistently?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   You know, I'm not sure if I can in a Grand Slam again (smiling).   For sure it's going to be really, really difficult.   I know I did it already.   I know that I can reach that level, but it's going to be tough. 
I need to be ready every match to try to win every match.   We will see how the season will go. 

Q.   Stan, sorry if you were asked this before, but once the final is over and the next day you had the pictures taken along the river and all that in Melbourne, how long did it take for it to really sink in with you?   And when you went back to Switzerland, did you feel overwhelmed with the reaction and the airport crowds and things like that?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, I think the reaction was amazing.   For sure, I was surprised to have that many people, that many positive reaction.   But it was great.   It was great feeling, you know. 
It took me time to realize really what I did in Australian Open.   Still when I'm saying that I won a Grand Slam it's still strange for me, but that's why it was good to be home during three weeks.   It was good to be with the family, to be a little bit more time to take more time for myself.
