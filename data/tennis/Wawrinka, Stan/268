3-0 (ret)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You come from that tennis powerhouse Switzerland. You now have two guys in the top 10. Did you imagine that would happen?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No. I would not imagine, but I'm very happy for that. To be after Roger is very good. He's the No. 1, and for me it's a pleasure to now to be in the top 10, and be with him in the top 10. 

 Q. You always had the potential to do great things. Sometimes they say that maybe you have some luck or maybe lack of concentration, some bad injury. What do you think the reason is to wait a little bit longer to see you in the high level? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know. I don't know why, but I'm not like Roger or Djokovic. He's already No. 3 at 19, so I'm not like this guy. 
 I need more time to come, to practice, and to take the experience. 

 Q. What's your relationship with Roger? I know you played doubles here last year, you play Davis Cup together. You guys train together now and then?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, sometimes at the tournament. He's a good friend of me. Yeah, for me it's a pleasure to know Roger and to speak with Roger sometimes about tennis, about everything. 

 Q. Was that the easiest win of your career? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes. 

 Q. Did you know already that he has problems?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, no. No, I didn't know. 

 Q. Which of your wins this week have given you the most satisfaction? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe yesterday was a tough match against top 10 guy in the quarterfinal. To be the first time in the semifinal, it was a good win for me. 

 Q. Is the service return, is that the strongest part of your game? I noticed in one game against Roddick's serve here it was tremendous. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I was lucky. No, but I play -- it was my first time against Andy and I play, of course, great game, so I'm very pleased with that.

 Q. I notice throughout the week you had the most breaks of serve of any player. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, but sometimes you can have the best serve and still be broken.

 Q. Everybody dreams something, even in tennis. If you are to dream, biggest win of your life, which surface or which tournament do you think? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Maybe the French Open. I won in junior, but for me it's a dream. 

 Q. Yesterday Roger said that it's true that Stepanek play very well serve and volley, but it doesn't mean this is the way to play and to win at Roland Garros. What do you think about this? It's to be maybe mix it up a little bit more. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know. If you see the last three year you see Nadal playing, and I think he's not always doing serve and volley. But he won always at the French Open.

 Q. But the style. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: You can mix it up, but honestly I don't know and I don't care. 

 Q. For the future, what do you want to improve in your game? What parts of your game do you want to work on? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Maybe a little bit the return and the volley. 

 Q. What about your forehand?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, of course I can practice more the forehand, too. 

 Q. But which one? You miss in some situation, not every one. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, but I don't know if I need. To tell you the truth, I will say the volley to play more in indoor surface and hard court. 

 Q. Yesterday we saw a couple of volleyers winning. Radek even. We thought the volley was dead. Do you think this may encourage players to take more chances and come in a little more often on short balls? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, but I think this week here in Rome the clay is very fast.

 Q. It is. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: And it's better to play more aggressive, and it's more easy to come to the net.
