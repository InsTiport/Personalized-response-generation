  6‑3, 3‑6, 6‑0 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
   
 Q. You seemed to have him worried at the start of the final set. What happened then?  
STAN WAWRINKA: What happened? The beginning was important. Unfortunately he start to play well. I did few mistakes, first three games, and then he start to relax and play too fast.   
I had no more energy to come back at Love‑3. Start to play his best game when he play really fast and go for winners. Then it was really tough.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
   
 Q. You finished later than 1:00 in the morning last night. So how was the beginning of the match for you? It was so late last night.   
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, finishing yesterday so late, not only just because of the time, but also because of the incredible battle I had to do yesterday. It was tough the next day to play against Novak, who is very difficult to play in those conditions. And of course I felt the tiredness. It was extremely tough for me to fight.   
But in spite of this loss, and in spite of the third set, I'm very happy the way I pushed him. I'm happy I won that second set. I tried to find solutions. I tried to be aggressive, and I believe that was good.   
   
 Q. When you won the French Open you said it was a very special feeling because you feel close to France. So are you disappointed you lost here?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, it's the first time I'm in the semis here, and it was a good week for me here. Today the atmosphere was incredible. It's always very special for me to come and play in France. I have a special contact with the crowds here, and it's always a pleasure for me to play here.   
   
 Q. And physically how do you feel?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm okay, apart from feeling tired, which is normal. I am globally satisfied, because I had no particular physical problems until now, and I believe I will be able to be fit for the last tournament of the year.  
   
 Q. That second set was positive. It shows that when you are at your best, you can really compete with Novak. Is it good for future matches? Do you have regrets then?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Regrets? No. In that match there were some moments indeed where I could have pushed a bit further. Maybe in the beginning of the match, maybe during the first set, two or three points here and there. But if I look at the match as a whole, the way I felt, the way I played, and what I needed to do, I have to regrets. Because when I was on the court, I tried everything and I gave everything I had.   
It's never easy against Novak. So the positive thing is that I'm able to push him, I'm able to win a set, I'm able to find some solutions and to find the type of game that bothers him.   
So I hope I will do better next time, but I didn't succeed today.  
   
 Q. Do you feel that losing that second set he might be a bit unbalanced after that?   
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, in the second set you could see that when I push him, when I start playing heavy, when I start to make him run, he doesn't like it, because he has the feeling he's not controlling the point anymore. When I have a good quality of shots, when I play my game, I know he doesn't like it.   
Now, he's No. 1 in the world. He won almost everything this year. And in the third set he was able to get ahead and he won 6‑0 that set.   
But still, I believe there are positive things I can take away from this week, and I think it's a very good result. I took a set from him. Last time I played indoors against him it was two straight sets, and I lost badly. That shows I'm improving and I'm finding solutions. It's good for London.   
   
 Q. So you were talking about the Masters. Of course you just are out of the court now, but are you satisfied to go to London again and is it going to be different from last year?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, yes, it's a great satisfaction to go there. It's an honor. It's a dream. It's incredible. As a tennis player, being part of the Masters, being among the 10 best players in the world is great. It's going to be the third time I will be playing there in a row, and the excitement is still exactly the same. It's fantastic for me to be able to be part of that tournament.   
   
 Q. It was 12 past 1:00 in the morning last night when you finished your match, so at what time did you finally get to bed?  
STAN WAWRINKA: 3:45. I had to come to press, I had to get my treatments, I had to eat, etcetera. Then I went to bed. But that's normal when you finish that late. You need that time to do what you have to do, especially after a match that was really difficult physically. I need to do what I can to recuperate.   
We are used to that kind of schedule. We have to adapt to those late nights and we try to find solutions.
