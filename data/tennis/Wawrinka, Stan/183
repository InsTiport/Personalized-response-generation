THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Stan, you had everything under control, and all of a sudden you saw yourself a break down.   What happened in that third set?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, for sure I was a break up at 3‑0.   But it wasn't that simple.   It wasn't that I had everything under control.   I was playing good.   We had two tough first sets.   
Yeah, I did two stupid games I will say at 3‑0.   I had the wind with me, I did some bad mistake.   I was rushing a little bit.   
I don't know.   Was not the best day.   
   
 Q.   It was cooler, especially towards the end of the match.   Did it affect your game?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, I don't think so.   For me it was good conditions to play.   It was a little bit windy, but not too much like we had the past few days.   
It's a great court to play.   Nothing affect my game.   
   
 Q.   Obviously not the results you were looking for in Asia the past two weeks.   How would you rate your play overall and what do you think the problems have been?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Two first rounds.   It's never easy, for sure.   Two weeks.   Didn't win matches.   But you have to accept that and see what was the problem.   I don't think I lost my game.   I think I'm playing okay.   I just had two really bad match.   
But, yeah, I need to accept, go back home, try to focus on the rest of the year because there is so many to play, so many big challenge for me, that I want to be fresh and ready mentally for that.   
I will take the positive from losing early.   That give me more time to rest a little bit to get ready for Basel, Paris and London.   
You know, this year has been tough.   It's been an amazing year, but really tough also.   Last year, it was a special year.   I was playing good almost every tournament.   I was really focused on every tournament, making some good result.   
This year it's completely different.   It's a big rollercoaster.   I won a Grand Slam, a Masters 1000.   And I made some really shitty tournaments, losing first round.   
It's not easy to stay at the top.   You really have to find your way.   Still really happy with my year.   I need to see the positive that I still have so many challenges until the end of the year.
