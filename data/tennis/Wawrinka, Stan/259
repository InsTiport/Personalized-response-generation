 THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
  
  Q. You must have come in with lots of confidence. Can you talk about the match today.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was a good match for me - I think one of the best of the tournament. It was not easy to play him because he can play really aggressive. But I was moving very well and I'm very happy with my game.   
  
  Q. Yesterday you were probably the underdog. Today you were maybe the favorite. Did that change your mindset? Was that difficult to cope with?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, it was not too difficult today to be the favorite. Actually, is better to play a guy he's hundred in quarterfinal, so I was happy to play him.   
  
  Q. Are you feeling more like you belong in these matches at this stages of tournaments? Do you feel more comfortable?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, of course. After one year, I have a lot of confidence with my game and what I want to do.   
  
  Q. Yesterday, Roger was saying he always knew you could play this well, but maybe you didn't always think you could. What's changed in your mental approach?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I think is the experience, you know. What I say actually is the last two tournaments I play Djokovic and Nadal, I was playing great, but I didn't won. I lost in four tiebreaks. But my game was good. That's why I have more confidence of my game.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.  
  
  Q. You seemed to have an edge during the whole match today. There was no need to be scared?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I believe I played the best match of this tournament. I played solid and I moved well from the beginning. I was able to neutralize him.   
  
  Q. You knew there was a danger of being tense after beating Federer?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, I knew that, because sometimes after a big win, you might put pressure on yourself. But I was aware of that and I tried not to do that.   
  
  Q. You are quietly progressing, without making much noise. You are now among the last four players of this tournament.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's true that I do things quietly, but I am improving little by little. I always try to do my best. I see that in this tournament it is working out for me.   
 I still allow myself to make mistakes.   
  
  Q. What do you expect tomorrow? It's going to be a big match. It's going to be revenge after Indian Wells.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I'm very pleased to play against him again, this time on clay. I think it's going to be a very physical match. I know he likes to be very aggressive.   
  
  Q. Is it an advantage to play him on clay?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes and no, because I know he can play very well on clay. He proved it. It's going to be 50/50. Tomorrow will be a completely different match than the last one.   
  
  Q. Did you work with Paganini on your physical fitness?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, after the Australian Open I took approximately five weeks to work on my physical conditioning. I know I wouldn't have time now. So this was a sort of preparation for clay in February.   
 I was criticized when I did that. But I'm very happy now I made that choice.   
  
  Q. It could be a big week for you if you win tomorrow. Are you aware of that?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: This tournament is good for me. But I'm not yet in the final. I still have a very tough match tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You will have to serve well against him because he's a very good server.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, I have to. And also he returns very well. Therefore, I have to hold my serve.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised the way Djokovic beat Verdasco?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No. Except the set he lost against MontaÃ±Ã©s, Djokovic played very well during this tournament. He returns very well. He has a very good backhand. Thanks to that, a lefty doesn't bother him.   
  
  Q. After your victory yesterday you had many requests for interviews, et cetera. Are you aware this has maybe caused an earthquake in Switzerland?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's true I received a lot of requests for interviews. I didn't open my computer last night, so I don't know what is the reaction in Switzerland.   
  
  Q. Who criticized you about February?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, they didn't really criticize me, but there were many questions: why did I do that at that particular time, and about Davis Cup also.   
  
  Q. But you gave a good answer in Davis Cup.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, I played well my three matches.   
  
  Q. Aren't you bored to have to play the three matches all alone in Davis Cup?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's always disappointing to lose in Davis Cup. I will wait to see the draw in May to know who we are playing.   
  
  Q. But you are going to play in September?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes. We can talk about Davis Cup all the year-round, and it's only two ties.   
  
  Q. Will you think about your final in Rome?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Back then I didn't believe in my chances. When I came to the final, I already thought my tournament was successful and I didn't believe in my ability to beat him.   
  
  Q. Is it going to be different here?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: This is one year later, and everything is different. I have more confidence in myself, and I'll try my best to win.
