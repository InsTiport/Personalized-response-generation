S. WAWRINKA/V. Estrella Burgos
  6‑3, 6‑4, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   How would you describe the match today?   Was that easy for you?
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's never easy.   I wish it was, but it's never easy. 
It was a good match to win.   Had to play my best game.   I find a way how to be focus at the end of each set.   I was serving well again, playing generally okay.   Not my best tennis, but typical second round of a Grand Slam. 
The only important thing is to win and it's good to win in three sets. 

Q.   Offbeat question.   Having been on tour for a number of years, if you had to pick the best shot of any opponent, what would it be and why?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I will take Novak return. 

Q.   Why?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Because he's so good.   He make you play all the time.   He always find solution how to return each player.   Always putting yourself under pressure even when you're serving.   So, yeah.
