D. GOFFIN/S. Wawrinka   
6-3, 5-7, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously a lot of ups and downs in that match, a lot of breaks.  How do you explain the weird patterns in that match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, not too great day, not too great level.  I didn't have the rhythm yet.  Was a match without brain, let's put it that way.  (Smiling.)   
Have some tough time to focus, have some tough time to find what I wanted to play and stay calm.  Still try to fight.  Got lucky to come back twice.  Had the chance to finish the tiebreak.  I didn't, and quite simple.   
 Q.  Can you explain a little bit about the comebacks?  Second set looks like it was going to end early; came back.  Same thing in the third.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think he got a bit tired and nervous also.  He start to miss easy shots.  Gave me the chance to come back.  Can lose quickly, eh?   
Two time I come back.  I had the chance in the third set to finish it also at 5-5 to break him again.  I didn't.  I didn't.   
But in general, he deserved to win.  You know, it was the time of.  Should have finish before.   
 Q.  Are you surprised how well he's able to fight back?  Giving up two big leads in both sets, that could be devastating for someone, but...  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, but not really.  If you want to win matches, you need to stay focused, even if you had break up in the second or in the third.   
I wasn't surprised at all.
