R. FEDERER/S. Wawrinka
  4‑6, 7‑5, 7‑6

  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Both of you desired the victory, but it couldn't happen.   You came to the net too quickly?   What is your opinion of those match points?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I had to do some choice.   For sure that game at the end I was nervous.   It was not easy to play from the baseline.   He was normally just pushing his slice backhand return.   I was like, Okay, I'm going to try to take it, try not to wait for a mistake, try to go for it. 
I did it two time on second serve.   I did one on first serve.   I missed my serve.   I wanted to go backhand body because he was really going higher return.   He took it the forehand.   That's it.   I think I had one easy volley backhand that I put in the net. 
You know, match like that, you make some choice, especially when you're tired, when you're nervous.   Just wanted to go for it and not wait for mistake or whatever, because you know that could give you the match. 

Q.   Was the difference tonight nerves?   Was there anything in your game that you think let you down towards the end?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, tough match like that, I think there's only few points that makes the difference.   I was playing great tennis.   Really happy with the way I was playing. 
But I had some big opportunity in the third set.   I should have take it, especially serving for the match with two match point.   Maybe didn't serve well enough. 
But not much.   Not much.   You know, when you play Roger, it's never easy for me, for everybody.   He's been in that situation so many times.   For me it was second here in the semifinal.   That's it. 

Q.   Obviously it was a tense match near the end.   At some point late in the third you seemed upset with someone speaking before points.   Can you explain what happened there?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Not much.   Nothing special.   Tense match.   It's never easy. 

Q.   What is your schedule from here?   When do you think you'll be on the clay courts?   Will you be practicing some doubles heading into the final?
STAN WAWRINKA:   We'll see.   We'll see how I'm going to feel tomorrow with my body.   I played really late yesterday, three‑set match.   Even if wasn't really physical, it's always nervous match.   So physically you don't feel the same. 
I had a tough one today.   So we'll see.   For sure I'm going to take one day off, try to do some treatment, try to rest, maybe going tomorrow to Lille or maybe Monday with Roger and everybody. 

Q.   Is it tougher in that situation against Roger as opposed to anyone else in the semifinals of the World Tour Finals?   Is it particularly something just with him?
STAN WAWRINKA:   As I say, it's always difficult for me not only because he's the best player ever, he knows how to play.   He's playing really well since the end of the year, a few months more.   Because of his game, but also mentally, he's been there since so many years. 
But, yeah, today had lot of chance.   Didn't took them.   I was playing well.   I was playing good tennis.   Happy the way I was trying to push him, trying to be real aggressive, not let him come to the net too much, trying to be the first there. 
But sometimes you lost match like that. 

Q.   You've played in the last week Novak and Roger.   How do you see the final going?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Good question.   I don't know.   We'll see how physically Roger will be tomorrow for sure, because Novak is really strong.   Didn't spend so much energy. 
I think tonight was tough match physically and mentally for me, and Roger also.   So we'll see how he's going to be tomorrow. 
If you look just like that, you will put a little bit more Djokovic the favorite.   But it's going to be interesting.   We'll see. 

Q.   Would you tell us what Roger said to you after the game?   It looked like he was very sorry. 
STAN WAWRINKA:   I'm not sure he's sorry for me (laughter). 
Yeah, not much.   Not much.   Not much.   Just, you know, when you win a match like that, when I had so many opportunity, normally you cannot say so many thing.   I just told him, Congratulate, good luck tomorrow.   Classic.   Nothing special.   Sorry.
