7-6, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your buddy Roger isn't here.  How does it feel without him around to talk to and discuss things with?  How is it not to have Roger here to talk to and as a friend to discuss things?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No.  It's hard for the tournament, for the fans, for the tennis, for everybody.   
Roger is so important for the tennis, and it's unfortunate he's injury for the rest of the year.  It's not the best for the tournament, but now that the tournament started I'm focused on my game.   
 Q.  Does it matter to you at all just as a personal thing?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No.   
 Q.  Focusing on your match today, obviously facing a difficult first-round opponent, getting through in straight sets.  How happy are you with the result?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I'm really happy.  I think it was a great match, especially for first round.  You never expect to play your best game and full of confidence, but I think the level was quite high.   
Fernando is a tough player to play.  He can be really aggressive.  He don't give you so much rhythm, so it's not easy.  But I think in general I'm happy with what I did.  I was really focused on myself.  I was moving really well for first one.  I'm getting some confidence from that match.   
 Q.  Your fitness or condition coming in, do you feel confident that you can once again go far here?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Pretty, yes, but it's a Grand Slam.  You need focus match after match.  In general, I'm really confident with my preparation, with the way I'm playing in practice court, the way I'm moving.   
I think everything has been really well.  I had almost 10 days here in New York to do great preparation.  Again, now, I'm focused on the tournament, match after match.   
But the way I started today, I'm really happy with that.  Let's see what's gonna happen the next few days and weeks.   
 Q.  You have won both of these Grand Slam meetings.  Is it something about the mental edge in the big tournaments or is it best of five or do you elevate your game a little more, do you think?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah.  I think also last few years I have been way better tennis player in the court, especially on big events.   
Today, again, I knew I was ready physically to get there.  Tough condition at the beginning, but, yeah, I think in general I'm better than few years ago.  That's make the difference.   
 Q.  One of the traditions is when you hit the balls into the crowd after the match, how do you determine where you're going to hit them?  If you were playing in Ashe, would you ever try to hit the ball out?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't think you can.  (Smiling.)  But the good thing here is you can send a ball as hard as you can.  That's always good.   
No, it's depends.  I look out in the crowd.  I look where are the people who really are making some noise.  I look where are the Swiss fans and the young people.  It depends.  That's why I give a little bit to each side.   
 Q.  This season it looks like you're going with very bright colors that you are wearing.  Do you like your outfit here and compared to the other two Grand Slams where you already have the bright colors?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's a bright year so far for me, in Grand Slams especially.  No, it's okay.  I can also put some more black if I want.  First time I'm going with the pink shirt and short.  We'll see how it looks on the picture, and then I will decide if I go back to the black one.   
 Q.  A lot of errors in the tiebreaker.  You made fewer of them.  What was your assessment of that?  In the tiebreaker were you worried?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No.  I think I'm really happy with the tiebreaker.  Was important, especially first set, to take that set.  He had more opportunity during the set.  He had some break points, but I was trying to find little by little my game.   
Was important for the rest of the match to take the tiebreak.  I start to play way better after that.   
 Q.  The focus has been on Roger, Rafa, Novak, Andy, but you're right up there.  Expectations are high for you.  People come out to see your matches.  Do you feel that?  Do you feel that, say, compared to a few years ago?  How do you handle sort of the elevated expectations?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure it's different than few years ago.  Everything is different.  I have been winning some Grand Slam, my ranking is No. 3 in the world, I'm seeded 3 here.  Playing first round on Ashe everything is different.   
But also for myself.  My expectations for myself are more higher than before.  For me, the most important thing is to focus on what I can control, all the practice, all the schedule, giving everything every practice being ready for the tournament.   
Right now I know I'm ready for here, for the tournament.  And now I'm going to see how I'm going to deal with the pressure, with the match, and trying to play the best I can until as far as I can.
