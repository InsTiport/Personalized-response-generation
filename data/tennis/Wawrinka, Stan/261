  2-6, 7-5, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
  
  Q. Talk about playing Roger.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's always a particular match. It's a good friend of me. Is gonna be nice to play him on the center court here, the clay court. I play him three times already. I always lost. But it was indoor and hard court.   
 So it's gonna be fun to play tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Do you feel that clay will give you an advantage?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, I think I'm better on clay court. So maybe it's better for me.   
 But we'll see tomorrow how is gonna be.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. That was a rotten court to be on?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It certainly wasn't a big court for a Masters Series tournament.   
  
  Q. It was tight. He had 30-15.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Indeed, there was not much difference between us. I was able to raise my game.   
  
  Q. What about your match tomorrow against Roger?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He will have no reference points, whereas I am playing better and better. In general I have problems to adapt to the surface in this tournament, but this year I feel very good here.   
  
  Q. Is clay your favorite surface?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes.   
  
  Q. You played very good matches against Djokovic and Nadal. Did you learn things in those matches that you can use for this next match?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It certainly gave me confidence. Even if I'm disappointed I lost them, I know I was able to stay in there and fight until the end. It's good having those big matches in the beginning of the year because then you can see what you still have to work on.  
  
  Q. So you saw the mistakes you shouldn't make anymore?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, like not losing a tiebreaker. Against Djokovic, I was up 5-2 in the second set. I should have won that set. And against Nadal, he played very good in the two tiebreakers.   
 But now it's going to be different because it's on clay, and the game is different on clay. I must be solid, concentrated, and I must try my best.   
  
  Q. He had good results here before. What is your state of mind?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He had good results everywhere. What I have to do is make the right choices and have no regrets.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding the draw.)   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: You always look at the draw in the beginning of the tournament, but then you have to play it match by match before starting to think you're going to play a certain opponent.   
 On clay, you have to fight a lot. It's tougher mentally.   
  
  Q. Do you believe Federer can become No. 1 again after this tournament?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I hope not, because I'm playing against him (laughter).   
 But, of course, I believe he can become No. 1 again. Out of four Grand Slams, he won one. Although, Nadal is playing very good, as well.
