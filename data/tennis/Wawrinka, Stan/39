S. WAWRINKA/M. Fucsovics   
6-4, 6-3   
 Q.  A quick word on how hard it is to wait so long to play a match.  And also, you know, you had a tough one with him last week in Toronto.  Does it feel good to at least get through this one in two sets, a little less complicated than your last one with him?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure was quite complicated last few days with the weather, for the tournament, for the fans, for the player.  It's never easy.  We don't really know when we're playing at all.  But that's part of the game.  We cannot change anything.  So you need to be ready.   
Today was important for me to start by being well, warmed, and ready.  I'm really happy with the game, winning in two sets.  For sure it's completely different than last week.   
I think last week I gain a lot of confidence by winning two matches, losing to Rafa.  This week I'm feeling much better with my tennis.  So I'm happy to be in quarterfinal.  It's really good for me.  I need to enjoy and get ready for tonight, another match.   
 Q.  That next match there is a good chance it will be against your countryman, Roger.  What do you think about that potential matchup?  Obviously he's not won yet.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, will be really nice to play against him, you know.  I had a really tough year with my injury.  It was really tough.  So now I'm happy to be back.  I'm happy to be winning some matches.  Last week I played against Rafa, was a great match, even though I lost it.  For me, I was happy with the level.  So will be nice if I can play Roger this week.
