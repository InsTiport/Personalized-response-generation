 I'm feeling okay with my game and with the tournament, so I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. What did you make of the weather? Did it affect your game at all?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, I think it was okay actually. I'm feeling pretty okay with the hot, so for me it was really okay today. I was happy to play in three sets. It's always better when it's so hot, but for me it was good.
