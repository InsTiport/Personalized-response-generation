4-6, 6-2, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Talk through that one.  Obviously disappointing result.  Were you struggling in the third set as well a bit?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure it's disappointed match.  That's for sure.   
I think the level was quite up and down.  We were both fighting a little bit in the first set to find good level.  Was really humid, not easy to play some great tennis, but we had some long rally.   
Yeah, one bad game to start the second set and then it was tough for me.  I don't know.  I completely went down physically and mentally, and also my tennis was completely out.   
I had no more gas.   
 Q.  Do you think that having reached the final in Indian Wells and coming here played a factor in you running out of energy in today's match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, many reason over the last few weeks made that.  Today was tough to keep the level after one set.  For sure I'm disappointed and for sure I know many reason why I had no more gas in the second and third sets.   
But at the end of the day, you have to try with what you have that day, and today was not enough.  Just not a great day and great result.   
 Q.  How do you evaluate like the two big tournaments in March, one final and one fourth round?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I think for sure it can be only positive.  Making the final in Indian Wells is a big result for me.  But most important is my level in general.  I think I've been practicing really well.  My level is really high when I'm feeling fit physically and fresh mentally.   
That's what I have to take for the next few weeks.
