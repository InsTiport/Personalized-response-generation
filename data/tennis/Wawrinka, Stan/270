 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. In your view, what was the difference in the match between you two?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I was starting very well. The first set I was playing very well the first set. I was always before him; I was pushing him.   
 But I think it change his game and he was coming more in at the net. In the second and the third set he was serving very well, too.   
  
  Q. (From Italian) Do you think you could have done better, or are you satisfied with your performance?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, I of course a little bit disappoint because I lost today, but I lost against a very good player, the No. 3 in the world.   
 I didn't play a bad match. Of course, I can do a little better, so that's why I'm a little disappointed.   
  
  Q. Now that you're a top 10 player, do you think that Federer will have to play Davis Cup every year?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I hope he's going to play the Davis Cup, but I don't know if it's going to change something.   
 But, you know, this year is the Olympic Games, so the year is very difficult to play Davis Cup. Maybe next year we're going to see what happened.   
  
  Q. Do you feel this court was faster than most clay courts?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah. I think it's a little bit more fast than the other clay court, yes.   
  
  Q. Are you at all surprised that you're now in the top 10, you've made such of a big jump?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, of course I'm a little surprised, because in one week playing the final in Masters Series, and to be 44 and then top 10 after the week is a big jump for me.   
  
  Q. With all that he's won this year, do you see Novak as the toughest player to beat, or is it still Roger and Rafa?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, they're three players that are playing very well. But I hope Roger is going to stay No. 1 for the end of the year, of course.   
  
  Q. (From Italian) You will call Federer, or Federer will call you? You will talk to Federer?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, maybe. Maybe he's going to call me to say something, but I will see him in Hamburg tomorrow.   
  
  Q. But today?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not yet. I just finished the match and I didn't check all my message, so no.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what Novak does very well on the court. What makes him so tough?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah. I think he's doing everything well. He's serving very good and he's staying always on the game. Doesn't matter the score or what's happened in the game, but he's always staying and trying to do something.   
 Yeah, I think he just playing everything well.   
  
  Q. What was the problem you had the trainer for in the third set?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Nothing special. But I play 12 match in two weeks and it's a lot for me, so I prefer to call the physio when I have something in the back. But nothing special.
