S. WAWRINKA/D. Gimeno‑Traver
  6‑0, 3‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You came back strongly in the third set.   You weren't at all flustered by going one set all?   You weren't at all flustered?   Weren't knocked out of your rhythm by going one set all?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, I start well really first set.   It wasn't going that well, but I was positive, ready. 
Problem is I still have some up and down mentally.   I was negative in the second set a little bit stupidly, but then I'm really happy the way I start the third set. 
Was important to come back strong, to move well again, to play aggressive, to push him, and was important to get the break early.
I think then was okay.   I'm happy to win.   That's the most important.   First one here, it's never easy.   The condition was really slow today, really humid.   You need to get through.   That's it.   That's the most important, just winning matches.

Q.   Another city, a new city since the Australian Open.   What's been the reception that you've received over here from fans?   Has it been any different to a couple of the other places you have been at?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, it's been great, you know.   I have been here since one week.   I was practicing since Monday here.   A lot of fan, a lot of people from South America, they always come to watch the practice. 
It's normally a really good crowd.   They make a lot of noise.   They are really happy to be here.   The reception was great for me.
I didn't come last two year, so it was even bigger.

Q.   You are now a Grand Slam champion.   Do you have a feeling that you are the target?   Will it make the match a little bit difficult for you?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   For sure everyone wants to win matches.   And for me, doesn't change much, you know.   I'm No. 2 in the world.   I'm seeded 3 here.   I know that if I play my best tennis I can be a favorite of the tournament.   I know how well I can play.
But I'm focusing on matches, and I don't really care what other things or what others want to do.   I know that every match are difficult, and you need to be focused on what you're doing. 

Q.   I know it's a little difficult to think about major goal for the rest of the year because you are in the middle of this important tournament, but after your fantastic win in Australia, what are the things that really shake up your mind in terms of goals for the rest of the season?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, there is one goal that I have since many years.   It's the Davis Cup.   Now Roger is playing, so we know that we are a strong team to do something.   Well need to be careful, but we have a good chance to make a big result this year, and that's so far the most important.
But the rest of the tournament, it's tough to say, you know.   I need to focus on what I did before to win the Australian Open.   That means I need to focus with my coach, try to improve my game, try to be 100% every day on the court, try to always fight, always try to be at my best in every matches.
And if I do that, I know I'm going to have some great results this year.
