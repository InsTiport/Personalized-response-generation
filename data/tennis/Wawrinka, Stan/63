S. WAWRINKA/F. Fognini   
7-6, 6-0, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  In the first set tiebreak, I think it was about 4-2, when you couldn't finish the point in this match, and then Fognini got to the net and he almost broke his racquet because he missed the smash himself.  After that, he couldn't almost win anything.  Did you feel it could be a decisive moment?  After that, would you prefer Monfils or Gasquet in the next round?  Do you have a choice?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, for sure it was important point to get to 5-2.  But I think the first set was very good level.  He was playing well.  He was more aggressive than me.  Was dictating the match, the rhythm, and that's what I was struggling with my game a little bit.  I was maybe too defensive.  I didn't try really to put my game there and to be aggressive as I wanted.   
I start to play better and better as the set goes on, and I got a little bit lucky to broke him back twice when he was serving for the set, because he had some good opportunity to finish it.  But I was there, I was fighting, and I think after the first set I start to play really aggressive, really good, and I'm really happy with the game today.   
Monfils or Gasquet, I really don't mind.  I cannot choose so I will watch the match and see who's gonna win.   
 Q.  The conditions today were more humid.  Does it change a lot, heavy ball?  You can adapt to both situations?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it change a lot, for sure.  It's not the same condition at all when it's sunny.  Today it's really heavy, heavy condition, heavy ball, as well.  It doesn't jump as much.  The ball doesn't fly as much.  It's tough to make winner.   
For me, I don't mind.  I like both.  With my game, I can adapt anyway.  Even on those really heavy condition, I can make winner.  I can play heavy, fast, so it's okay for myself.   
 Q.  Fognini lost the second set quickly.  He can do that often and come back pretty well in the next set.  When he's going down fast, is it more thoughts in the back of your mind than your average player that the match could still become complicated?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure.  With him you never know what to expect.  I think he went down a little bit more with the serve.   
For many reason, I think I was playing better.  I was playing really aggressive.  I broke him, but he did two double faults but because before that I was really going for the winner on his second serve.  So that's when he start struggling a little bit, when he feel he doesn't control what he is doing on the court.  When he doesn't control the rhythm of the match, that's when it's tough for him to stay mentally tough.   
I think my game was way better in the second set.  I knew in the third set he's gonna try again, still push a little bit, but I was feeling so good on the court.  So I'm happy with my performance today.  Happy to get through that.   
 Q.  What is your assessment of your performances throughout the week?  How would you like to approach the second week?  
STAN WAWRINKA: It's been a perfect week so far.  I'm playing good, well, playing confidence with my game.  Winning three matches in three sets, against some tough players.  I'm really happy.  I couldn't do better than the first week so far.  But again, it's just the beginning of the tournament.   
So for me, I need to stay there.  Every match is going to be tough, anyway.  Doesn't matter if I play Gasquet or Monfils.  Gonna be a really good battle.  Hopefully I can keep playing well and go through some matches.   
 Q.  There has been a lot of controversy in Australia about the name of Margaret Court Arena after a bunch of comments she made and a few players calling for the name to be changed.  What would your thoughts be on that?  
STAN WAWRINKA: For sure I saw a little bit.  I didn't go completely into it to see who say what exactly.  I read few comments that for sure are completely out of what I think, that's for sure, but I didn't go in completely what's happening.   
So I need to read a little bit more, and then I can give you more answer.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  I don't know if you watched the images of Goffin's accident on the Lenglen court.  If you will be playing on Lenglen court, will you think about it?  
STAN WAWRINKA: In the locker room, we are all sad for David.  We hate seeing other players being injured.  But any player can twist his ankle.  This is a big court.  There is a lot of space.  It was unlucky, and he trampled across the cover, but I didn't think about it.  I twisted my ankle without trampling on the tarp.  It might happen.   
 Q.  I was under the impression that you didn't want to lose the first set.  You knew that the first set was crucial.  Were you surprised?  After winning the first set, I mean, did you anticipate the continuation of the match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't want to lose the first set.  I mean, I pulled out all the stops to win that match.  The level was quite good.  I wanted to send him a message, even though I were to lose the set I would be very good.  And he became tense.  At the end of the first set, he started to hesitate.  He knew that he played well but I was behind him, and I wouldn't give up anything.  Then I felt relaxed.   
I expected some ups and downs with Fognini, but I played well.  I didn't miss a lot.  My game was fast, and I felt great on the court today.   
 Q.  The match between Monfils and Gasquet is not yet over, but what are the keys to beat those players?  
STAN WAWRINKA: We'll see what's gonna happen.  We don't exactly know when they finish.  Are they going to play today, tomorrow?  Will the match be short?  I don't know.  I haven't seen them play.  But GaÃ«l feels great here.  Even though he hasn't practiced before, physically he's very good.   
Gasquet is also a good player.  So it will be a tough match, complex match.  I played against Gasquet, and it was a five-set match.  I was two sets up.  I have never played GaÃ«l here at the French Open, but I want to play my game.  I know exactly where I am.  I know what I'm capable of.  I know what my level is.   
So if I can implement or set up my game, I can beat any player.   
 Q.  Is it special to play a French player at a French Open?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yes, they are playing on home soil in front of the French crowd.  I have played lots of French players here at the French Open.  Simon, Jo, Gasquet repeatedly.  I have played very often against French players.  It's always very particular because they are playing on home soil.   
 Q.  Is it very difficult to compare the different years?  Do you think that you are in very good form, better than the previous years?  
STAN WAWRINKA: We will make a comparison at the end of the tournament.  My best year was when I lifted the trophy.  It is as simple as that.  We will wait until the end of the tournament, and we will see.   
 Q.  You have said that you know where you are.  Why do you say so?  Do you think that you've got your bearings?  
STAN WAWRINKA: This has to do with my feelings.  I feel good during the match, before the match, after the match.  I can manage pressure quite well.  I behave correctly with my team.  So these are some small details that are important to me, and I know that I play well, but I know that each match is different, and you have to start from the ground up when you play a match.
