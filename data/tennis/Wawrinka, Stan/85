4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was quite a rollercoaster for the first round.  Talk us through what made the difference.  Why did you win it?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, was tough one, for sure.  But really happy to get through in five sets.  Wasn't my best tennis today, but was fighting, trying to stay in the game, fighting a lot.   
I think he was playing well.  He didn't give me too much rhythm.  He made me play not my best tennis.   
I'm happy to get through, that's the most important.   
 Q.  Were you worried with the shot at the end that you might have killed him?  
STAN WAWRINKA: That was, for sure, a tough shot for him.  The thing is, in that moment, so important, there is some player, they fake you, I stop playing, then they just put the racquet.   
So for me I already miss some easy one.  For me the most important was to run straight in the middle of the court.  I'm sorry I touch him in the wrong place.  But I think it was okay at the end.   
 Q.  What did you say when you decided to jump over the net?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I just wanted to make sure he was okay.  I realized he was okay.  Back to focus on the match.   
 Q.  How much of a relief to get through?  You weren't playing your best tennis.  Can you build on that?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, most important is to get through that match, to win.  For sure it's a big relief, especially when you break down in the fifth, 4-3, 40-15.  So I'm really happy to get through.   
I also know where I am right now.  I think in general I'm playing well.  I'm physically ready.  Most important is to win.  The next one is a different match, different day.
