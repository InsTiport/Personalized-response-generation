J. MELZER/S. Wawrinka
  3‑6, 7‑6, 2‑6, 6‑4, 8‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Have you ever been in that sort of situation before?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   What situation? 

Q.   Like today. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, in Paris, French Open, one month ago.   We stop after 4‑2 in the fifth set and we come back the next day to finish the match. 

Q.   Did you sleep well last night?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, it was okay.   No problem to sleep. 

Q.   What do you feel about today?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   For sure I'm disappointed, but it's tennis, part of the tennis.   It's never easy to lose a match like that, especially in the fifth set. 
But I think was a good match.   I think we play some great tennis during five set.   For sure I'm really sad about the result.   But at the end he was playing a little bit better, especially yesterday in the fifth set. 

Q.   How did you feel about playing Melzer in the first round?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I knew it was going to be a tough match for sure.   He's a great player, especially on grass.   I think he's one of the only player that I'm not really happy to play, non‑seeded player. 
I had some chance during the match.   I didn't took it.   And, yeah. 

Q.   Was there a particular point of the match where you think you lost the match?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, not really.   I think when you play a five‑set match more than three hours, you have some up and down in both side, you have some chance in both side. 
I don't think one point can make the difference of the match. 

Q.   How would you assess your year so far coming up to this point?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, my year is not that bad.   I think my game is there.   For sure I'm really disappointed with the result here.   I was looking forward to play some good matches here. 
But my clay season was pretty good. 

Q.   What is your schedule now? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I'm going to go back home and play Gstaad tournament before the Olympics.   I'm going to come back on clay for one tournament.

Q.   What do you expect from Gstaad?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's always a pleasure to play there.   We only have two tournaments in Switzerland.   We don't have that many chances to play with people, family and friends, so I'm looking forward to that tournament.
