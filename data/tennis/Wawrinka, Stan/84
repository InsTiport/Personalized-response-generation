THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  After the first match, the tough first match, you must be very relieved to have an easier match in the second round.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I'm not relieved but happy with the match of today, happy with my level, my focus.  I was moving well, feeling good.  Was a little bit windy, but my level is there.  I'm happy to get through in three sets.   
 Q.  Were you a little worried after the first round how you would start in the second match?  Was it just like, Now it's a right-hander, another match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, I wasn't worried in general.  As I said, it was a tough first match.  I could have lost it.  But I fight until the end and I won it.   
I know my level is there.  I'm feeling good on the practice court.  I'm playing well, moving well.  So for me, I wasn't worried for today.  I was focused, trying to play a good match.  I was expecting a tough match.  He's a great, player, tough player.  But really happy with the result and the match today.   
 Q.  You're set for a match against Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round.  Is that something you're thinking about already?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No.   
 Q.  A couple days you posted a picture of yourself winning the 2014 title here on Twitter.  The way you look at that win, has that changed in any way over the past three years?  Is it worth more now, maybe, because it was the first one?  Did it change anything at all?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No.  It's just some amazing memories.  I remember everything about that two weeks, especially the final, playing late, finishing late, the trophy ceremony and everything.   
Is just some amazing memories to come back here, to remember that, to see the picture with the trophy.  For sure a lot has happened in two years, especially with everything I've achieved since I won that.  Winning two other Grand Slams.  It's something amazing.   
It was my first one here, so is always going to be something special to come back here.
