  S. WAWRINKA/M. Daniel  
6-3, 6-2, 7-5  
   
  Q. Can you tell us how do you feel on grass? It is a surface that you like?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's not my best surface, but I think this year it's more slowly, the court. I feel good. I practice one week here, so I'm very happy to play again a Grand Slam.   
 Yeah, of course I won in three sets today. It's very good for me.   
  
  Q. Talk a little bit about the match. Are you happy about your game?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, very happy. It was three sets, and for a first round it's never easy to win in three sets. I was playing good and serving very well. I'm very happy.  
  
  Q. You come from the same country as the best player in the world. Has he told you anything? Does he help you?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not specifically for the grass, but was we practice all the year together. We try to. He always have some advice for me.
