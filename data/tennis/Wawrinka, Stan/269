  S. WAWRINKA/J. Blake
6-7, 7-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What made the difference in the end in that match? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know, but the two first set was very, very tough. 6-7, 7-6 is always difficult, but I think I stay focus on my game and try to push him a lot from the baseline. 

 Q. Two semifinals in two weeks. You must be very impressed. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, of course I'm very happy. I play very good and I lost in Barcelona against Ferrer in semifinal, and now one week later I'm still in the tournament to play the second semifinal. Of course I'm very happy. 

 Q. You played Safin, Murray, Ferrero, and Blake. Four straight wins. That's a pretty tough draw as well. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, tough draw. But in the Masters Series you don't have easy draw to come to the semifinal, and I try to stay focus on my game every match. I'm very happy again to stay in the tournament. 

 Q. Can you imagine a final against Federer, a Swiss final here in Rome?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, because like I say always, I need to prepare for the next match. I play against Roddick or Robredo, so I know it's going to be very tough. 
 I prefer to stay in the next match and not thinking about maybe final or I don't know.
