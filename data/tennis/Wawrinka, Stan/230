S. WAWRINKA/G. Dimitrov
  3‑6, 6‑4, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Thank you.

Q.   You said yesterday that you were feeling great; today you looked great.   Can I just ask was it a mentally tough match today?   Seemed a bit tense out there at some points. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for me it was a mentally moment really because I start to be maybe a little bit of tired with the match I played.   I'm not used to that.   It's a good challenge for sure.
But when you start a little bit tired mentally it's not easy to focus on every point.   It's not that simple.   Today I was really trying to focus on myself and not on him.
I was trying to change my game a little bit.   At the beginning he was making the game and doing everything, and I tried to push him a little bit more to play more hard and to take the game.
That's when I start to serve a little bit better.   In the end, I'm really happy to won that match. 

Q.   What was your complaint in the middle of the third set, or second?   I cannot... 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It was a little bit with the crowd.   There were during the point still clapping.   But it was more about myself.   To get something else I need to get angry at someone, and I didn't want to break my racquet so I choose the umpire. 

Q.   When you were 54‑up in the second set you asked for some medical help.   Was it with your neck or shoulder. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's both.   I had some little problem since few days.   But, you know, I was sweating a lot and was still cold. 
Before the last two games I think I get a little bit cold on my neck.   That's why I just asked the physio to come.   I didn't want it take the treatment time, the three minutes.   I know it's not going to change in three minutes, so I just ask some pills. 

Q.   Have you been playing or practicing with him since you guys are with Magnus now? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No.   We didn't have time.   You know, I just talked with Magnus.   It's the first week in tournament with him, so this week we didn't have time to practice together.
I came late with the Portugal Open.   For sure we're going to practice the rest of the year.
