THE MODERATOR: English questions.
Q. Welcome back to Doha.  It's ten years after your first final here.  You didn't play for two months I guess, so how do you feel exactly right now with this new season?
STAN WAWRINKA: I feel good.  I'm very happy to be back.  I arrived on Wednesday here.  I have been practicing really well.  I had two great months practicing and some good preparation physically.  So I'm happy, I'm fit, I'm ready for the season and I'm looking forward to starting it.
Q. Can you talk a little about how you are feeling coming into - I am sorry, that was the first question already - but how you feeling coming into the new year and given that you finished 2018 in a strong way?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, as I say, I'm happy to start again.  I think I'm playing well.  I'm physically fit and ready for the season.  Looking forward to starting.  I did great preparation, great off season.  I was working hard.  And good to be ready for the year and, as I say, I'm happy to be fit and starting the year here.
Q. Playing Karen, your doubles partner, when you look at a draw like that, do you feel what the hell, or is it a challenge, or how do you look at it?
STAN WAWRINKA: For sure it's an interesting draw.  We played against each other last year.  He's a great player.  He played really well at the end of the year.  He is in top form.  He played already a few matches in Abu Dhabi so it will be interesting.  He is a good friend.  We play doubles together.  Tomorrow we play against each other.  It will be a tough match to start the year.  For me, most important is to be fit, to be ready.  I'm happy with what I'm doing on the practice court, so I know that the year is long and I look forward for it.
