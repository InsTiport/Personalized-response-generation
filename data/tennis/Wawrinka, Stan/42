S. WAWRINKA/G. Dimitrov
1-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. 6-1 down, 23 minutes, not very good form going into the tournament.  What were you thinking at that moment?
STAN WAWRINKA: Was for sure not the best moment of the match.  Was tough.  But to lose that 6-1, I still think at that moment that I wasn't playing that bad.  I was missing few things.  The set went quick.  I've been practicing so hard last few weeks on grass to get my level there, to be ready for big match, to know that I can count on my game.
I had to put myself together again, to try to fight, try to find solution.  I also knew before the match that it's tough for Grigor to play against me in the first round, especially he's also looking for confidence, he didn't win so many big match recently.
I was trying to stay with him, try to find my rhythm, try to make it tougher for him, try to make him think a bit more.
Q. Did you feel like you were ready for a result like that after Eastbourne?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, yes, because again, my practice last three weeks were really, really good.  My level in practice court, physically and tennis-wise, is a really high level.  So I was happy with that.
Mentally I went down way too quickly in Eastbourne.  Was really wrong match in many, many ways.  With a good talk with Magnus, we couldn't find what was really the problem, and try to change that.
Like today before the match, for sure I know it will be a tough match, especially against Grigor.  Really not the player I like to play.  If you look the result last few years against him on clay, on hard.
I didn't like came into the court thinking, I'm going to win.  But I came like, Okay, I'm going to try my best, for sure, fight as well as I can, try to make it happen.
Q. The Centre Court crowd really got behind you.  Have you ever received that level of support here at Wimbledon?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, no.  Was amazing, for sure.  Especially that last year was my last match of the season here.  Was tough last year, especially with the way I was feeling with my knee.
So to come back today, to play Grigor, to have that match support, a great atmosphere from the first second to the end of the match was something amazing to feel that in my career.
Q. Mentally what was the problem in Eastbourne and how did you change it?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, was not only mentally, was many little things.  When you're looking for your confidence, it's never easy to put everything together.
But the only way to play better, the only way to give you more chance to win another match, is to practice hard, to practice well, to accept, to be patient, and to always try to fight.
Q. Donna was saying after her win earlier today she hoped you could follow it up and make it a good day for both of you.  Did you get inspiration from her having a big win this morning, feel like it was a good omen?
STAN WAWRINKA: I think it was a good day for us at the office, that's for sure.  Was great match from her.  I watch it from home before coming back for my match.
For sure it was a big win for her.  She's playing well on grass.  It's been good for us today.
Q. How much did the match take out of you?  How confident are you in your fitness as the tournament progresses?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, for sure, I think mentally was the toughest part today.  That's where I'm the most tired, for sure.  Then it doesn't help for your body, that's for sure.  After the match, everything goes out a little bit.
I will see tomorrow how I feel.  Normally, and I hope I should be okay, completely fine for my next match in two days.  I've been practicing so hard to expect to be okay in two days.  That's for sure.  I know what I've done on the practice court, on the fitness on the court.  I should be fine.
Q. Is it easier to play someone like Grigor Dimitrov?  You get more motivated, more alert because you respect him more as a player, as a top player, than going out and playing a lesser-ranked player?
STAN WAWRINKA: No.  First is not easier, especially Grigor.  As I say, is one of the best player in the world, especially on grass.  Was tough draw to enter the tournament.
About motivation, no, not at all.  I know where I come from with my injury, I know all the work I've been doing.  It's because I'm still really motivated to play any player, any court.  For sure, it's the best other player to play on Centre Court, like today was amazing atmosphere.  In the same times, if I have to play on Court 15, 16, I don't mind.  I'm really happy to be here.
It is all simple:  if you go far in the tournament, you will play on the big courts.  That's what you're looking as a player.
Q. Did you know Roger was going to be wearing new clothing today?  Looking for a similar deal for yourself maybe?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, I didn't know.  Was looking good.  Was looking good.  In the same time, everybody is in white here, so is similar as everybody.
Q. You said you had to be patient.  Are you a patient person in general?
STAN WAWRINKA: Not really.  Depends with what.  I always accept that when you walk out, it can take time.  I don't expect the result to come directly after doing good week of practice, to say, Okay, now I did a good week, it's going to come, I'm going to win the next tournament.
I know how tough is it in tennis.  All my career has been like that.  Again, today I won a great match, but that's not just what I want.  I want more.  Maybe it's going to come this week, maybe not.  I will keep working how to get little by little more wins.
Q. What's the experience like of coming into the tournament as an unseeded player?  Does that play to your advantage, that you can go under the radar a little bit?
STAN WAWRINKA: It's different, for sure.  For sure, you can play a guy like Grigor in the first round.  That's directly a big match.
To be out of the radar, it's not neither what you want.  When I was No. 3 in the world, No. 4 in the world, I was happy.  I was playing well.  I was going fine, big tournaments.  That's what I want to do again.
But I will see how far I can go in the next few years, and I will give everything to be back at my top.
