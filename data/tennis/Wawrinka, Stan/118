5-7, 6-2, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What made the difference in sets 2 and 3?  How did you turn it around?  
STAN WAWRINKA: A few point change a lot for me.  First set I think we were both playing well, but I was a little bit nervous, quite a lot nervous.  I was looking for my confidence.   
That's not easy, especially when you have occasion to break and you don't do it.  I was not focusing enough on what I was doing.  A little bit too tight.  He took advantage of that.   
When I start to find a little bit better game, to break him, to be a little bit more relaxed mentally, then it's a big difference for my level.  I'm really happy with that win.   
 Q.  It got quite passionate.  It was passionate.  Did you enjoy that?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was -- it was great, for sure.  It's always better when you win it at the end.  But I think in general there were some really good rally, was some good atmosphere out there.   
I'm happy with the first match here.   
 Q.  Compared to this stage last year, how do you feel with your game?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I think in general I think I'm playing better than last year.  Last year I was looking for my game a little bit before the tournament.  I start to find it during the tournament and start to play really well at the end.   
But now I think I was looking a little bit for confidence.  Didn't win many matches last few months, so for sure that's the reason why I was nervous today also.   
But in general I'm practicing really well.  I know my level is there, so hopefully I can play better and better.
