  S. WAWRINKA/J. Ferrero  
6-4, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You have beaten two former No. 1s in the world and Murray in this tournament. What's going on with you?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, but they are not still No. 1. The No. 1 actually is Roger, so it's not the same to beat Ferrero when he was No. 1 or now.   
 But I'm very happy with my game. I think I play very, very good on clay court. I think I played my best tennis today, and I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. What do you think today was the most important thing to win Ferrero?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I think I played very aggressive from the baseline, and I think today my backhand was very good and very tough for him. I don't know if he's still injury a little bit, so it was more easy for me.  
  
  Q. Are you ready for a final with Roger?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No. I'm waiting to play Blake tomorrow. We see how we're going to play tomorrow, and then we see what happens.  
  
  Q. What about James?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He's a tough player. He's playing very good. Maybe the clay court is not his best surface, but like he play today was very, very good, so it's going to be tough for me.   
  
  Q. Tell me something about your relationship with Roger. I mean, how important was Roger for you?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Of course he's really important for me because. He's a Swiss player and he's the No. 1. It's always nice to speak with him. I'm a good friend with him, and I think -- I hope he's going to play the Davis Cup one day full time, and maybe we have a chance to do something.   
  
  Q. What do you do with yourself here in Rome? Do you have some spare time for you?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not this year, because I arrive Sunday from Barcelona and I play Monday night, and then Tuesday night the doubles. Every day I played the night, so it's difficult to visit after midnight.
