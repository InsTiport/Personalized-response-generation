S. WAWRINKA/B. Tomic
  6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR: Questions in English. 

Q. Did you think that second set was gone at 2‑5 in the tiebreak?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, no. But I wasn't at good position, that's for sure, serving at 5‑2. I play one good point, aggressive, and then he miss easy forehand and you're back. 
I was just trying to stay with him, because, you know, match like that, especially with him, you can have some up and down. That's what happen today. 

Q. You hadn't played him for four years. He's 18th in the world now. Do you see a vast improvement from when he played on grass four years ago?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure. He's a way better player now. He's more physical player, also. He's fighting way more. He has a better forehand, and I think he has a better plan when he's playing. 
Before he was trying his little game trying to make you play bad or lose the rhythm, but now he's really trying to play his game. He's trying to play more aggressive when he can, and he's doing way better. 
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

Q. It has nothing to do with the match. You have been coached by a Swedish coach. There are more Swedish coaches on the tour. Do you believe they have a specific method that is working out well for the players?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, ask the other players about it. I don't know. But all those Swedish coaches were previously very good players. They had a method for work and a good life hygiene. They had to work first on themselves to be able to reach the top, and maybe that helped them. And that experience is useful as coaches, and they can use all that experience with the player they are working with. 
As to the other players, I don't know. But as far as I'm concerned, it works very well with him. He helped me a lot during the past two years, as you can see, and we will see what happens next. But I'm very happy.

Q. The season is not over. You are in Paris, and you have the Masters. What are your ambitions for the end of the season? Do you believe your results in the past tournaments can change the whole season?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, whatever happens, the season will be very good. It was an exceptional season for me, that's clear, whatever happens now. 
As to assessing the whole year, the year is not over yet. And here and in the Masters I want to have very good results. I want to try to get something. I would like to finish this year well. 
I'm not looking back in the middle of the year to see what I have done. I prefer to wait until everything is over. 

Q. Given the end of the Masters last year, are you now going back to London with the will of finishing off something that remained unfinished?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, the Masters is the top eight players in the world. It's always very difficult. You need to play your best tennis if you want to reach the semifinal or even go further. It's not because I reached the semifinal that now I want to aim at the final. 
I know how it happens. There are three matches you have to play in order to qualify. Of course if I can play my best tennis, I know I can go far. I'm not able yet to really set myself on the final or something like that. 

Q. Last year you had played the Masters and the Davis Cup, Davis Cup on clay, but you had no choice, anyway. Now, Murray has doubts. Can you understand the doubts he has? He's not the same player as you are with Roger, of course. 
STAN WAWRINKA: Yes, I totally understand him. You know what type of player he is. He needs time to adjust to clay. He usually has physical problems in the first days or weeks he's playing on clay. 
But the Masters, he played the Masters several times already. So I really understand him. He has priority with this Davis Cup, and I understand it. He's wondering how he can be at his top shape for that Davis Cup on clay. I understand.
