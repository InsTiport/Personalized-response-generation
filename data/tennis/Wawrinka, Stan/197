  1‑6, 6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Unlucky.   How do you reflect on tonight?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Typical first round.   It's never easy to find always the game, especially here.   It's flying a little bit.   I think start really well.   Was a little bit nervous at the beginning, but I was playing good, simple, aggressive.
Had an easy first set, but he was still there and still fighting.   Yeah, after that, I think I did one bad game.   He break me in the beginning of the second set, and then he was playing really good.   He was finding his game and I was hesitating with my game and wasn't playing my best game.
But I was really positive trying to find a way to win.   I didn't.   I had some chance in the third set.   I should have played better when I had some opportunity.
But I was hesitating with my game and he went for it and deserved to win.

Q.   How impressed by him were you?   What did you think of his game?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   He's a good player.   We all know that.   We all see that, especially since the beginning of the year.   I'm not surprised because I know him.   I watch him play already this year, so I know he's a good player.
Today he was playing good.   He was going for it and he deserved to win.
