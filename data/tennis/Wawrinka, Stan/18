S. WAWRINKA/N. Djokovic   
6-4, 7-5, 2-1 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You are three-time major winner, Davis Cup, so many things. This is only the fourth round but it's not. This is a special fourth round because of your opponent and because of the things that you went through in order to be back at this place. Could you describe?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm super happy with the level to be here in front of you winning tonight. For sure it's very special to play the No. 1 player in the world.   
Sorry he had to retire to finish the game like that, but for me, most important is the way I'm playing, the way I'm moving. Tonight I think was really high level. That's the most important.   
 Q.  As the match wore on, what sense did you have of something being wrong with Novak?  
STAN WAWRINKA: For me, my sense, I was feeling good on the court. I was playing well. The more the match was going, better I was playing, I was hitting really hard the ball. I was feeling great on the court. That's the most important.   
For sure I could see some little thing that he was in trouble. But I was most likely, most of the time, focused on myself because I know how well he can fight. I know how well he can come back. Doesn't matter how he's feeling on the court, and that's what I was focusing on.   
 Q.  So was it a surprise when he stopped?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was. It's always a surprise, for sure, when you play a champion like him. I have been in the past many times there in the past, so you always expect to play against the best of Novak. I saw he wasn't feeling great, but again, it was a surprise, for sure.   
 Q.  You talked about what a fighter Novak is. Were you surprised by the reaction from the fans that booed him?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah. Always surprised when you play the No. 1 and you hear the fans booing him when he had to retire, that's for sure.   
Again, he's a good friend. I know him really well. He's amazing champion, and if he has to retire, it's not the best for a tennis player to have to leave the court like that.   
 Q.  You beat him in 2016 here in the final. Did you find as the match went on any similarities to that match that you won also? Regardless of the end.  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, nothing (smiling). Last time was the final; today was the fourth round. All I can think is about the atmosphere, about to be back in the night session. Here it's always something special, always a great atmosphere, and I was really happy to be back.   
 Q.  Speaking of booing, it's something that your next opponent, Medvedev, has been getting. I'm curious what you make of that sort of action he's getting? And what do you think it will be like to have the crowd on your side as much as you're going to most likely get in the next match? Because he seems to really be enjoying this dynamic he has and thriving off of it.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I saw a lot of drama happening this year at the US Open. But it's a lot of fun also to watch for everybody.   
I saw also he's been playing amazing tennis, making final after final, winning Cincinnati, winning here a lot. It's going to be interesting match to play against him. I'm looking forward for it. It's the quarterfinal. It's going to be, for sure, a great level. I'm excited to play.   
 Q.  Do you understand how a person can feed off of negative energy like that?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure. For sure I understand how you can get from any atmosphere. That's why you play. I understand the enjoyment of that, not only in positive but also in negative. You always look for something, and that's going to be interesting.   
 Q.  You now have a leading record against Novak in best-of-five matches. Curious what makes you such a great big-match player.  
STAN WAWRINKA: I love those Grand Slam, so I played him in two finals. So for sure I'm playing always my best tennis. That's where I am the most confident. Yeah, in those tournaments he's always been quite tough to play.   
 Q.  You said on the court that you had good sensations during your warmup, that you felt confident coming into the match. Is this something that has been building up during the tournament? Is it something maybe the past couple of weeks? When did you start building this confidence?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I have been practicing now since many months. Not just a week ago. Again, I know how I feel in Grand Slam. I know I get to my best level.   
Sometimes I struggle a little bit in the first few rounds, but if I get the win, if I can pass those matches, I know my confidence get better. I'm happy with the way I'm playing so far, and hopefully I can keep going.
