 S. WAWRINKA/A. Roddick
  6-3, 6-4, 6-4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Is this maybe the best match of your life?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: One of my best, for sure. To beat Roddick in three sets, it's really good for me. Yeah, I'm very happy with all my game. I was playing great and I felt I put a lot of pressure on him.  
  
  Q. How do you explain that you reached such a high level tonight?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I'm playing good since beginning of the year. I have a lot of confidence with winning in the first tournament of the year in Chennai.   
 My game, yeah, everything is right. I practice a lot the last two months, and everything is going well. So that's why. For sure the match against Monfils helps me a lot for today.  
  
  Q. At what point did you think you were going to win?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Never until the last ball. I was just focused to keep the level. You never know. He's a really great player, so you never know what's happen in the match.  
 You can see since the beginning of the tournament, a lot of player was serving for the match and lose the match. So I was really focus until the last ball.   
  
  Q. I noticed training this afternoon you spent a lot of time playing left-handed. Are you naturally ambidextrous, or is that just something you work on?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, not really. I'm practicing a little bit because I make a bet with a friend in the summer. I need to play a match against him with my left hand, so that's why I'm practicing every day.   
  
  Q. Seemed to hit it pretty sweet off the left.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I try to improve a little bit, but it's not easy. We'll see how it's going to be.  
  
  Q. Do you find that helps you, having that versatility?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, not at all. I'm playing one-hand backhand, so my left hand I don't use so much for my tennis. I just try to have fun, and that's it.  
  
  Q. In all the times you played Roger, would you be going into this next match in the most confident frame of mind?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think I play my best tennis ever, so for sure it's going to be different.  
 Everybody knows that Roger is the best player ever at the moment, and we know that when he's playing his best tennis it's always tough to beat him.  
 I will try to be focus on what I want to do.  
  
  Q. You and your coach seem to have a good time together. Tell us about the effect he's had on your game.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure since we start in July I improve my game. For sure we work really hard on the court, and he help me with all the experience.   
 He already was the coach of Roger, of Safin, so he know how to be in the top and he know how to win some Grand Slams.  
 So for sure that's help me a lot.   
  
  Q. Andy had a couple of big breakpoints against you in the six game of the third set, but you managed to fix that. How were you feeling?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, it's the end of the match, for so sure I was a little bit nervous. He was trying everything.   
 Like always, I was just trying to stay aggressive and not give him so many chance in the rally.
