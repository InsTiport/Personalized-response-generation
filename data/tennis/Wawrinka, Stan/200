S. WAWRINKA/D. Ferrer
  6‑1, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   If you have a choice to play Novak or Roger, who would you pick?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I don't have the choice. 

Q.   That we know. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I never choose who I'm going to play.   I'm just looking the match and see who's going to win and get ready for that. 

Q.   Were you surprised with the way you won the first set so easily?   Are you getting used to playing so well? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I'm not surprised with my game or the way I'm playing.   Today was a little bit slower.   It was a little bit windy at the beginning.   It was important to move well, be aggressive.   That was my plan. 
I start really well.   I know when I'm moving well and I can dictate the game, I'm always good against him.   I did a really good job, especially at the beginning. 

Q.   If you play Roger in the final on this court, what would that mean to you?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It would be great, for sure, to play a Swiss player, especially Roger.   But so far I prefer not to think about the final.   I just won the semifinal.   I don't want to talk about tomorrow because I don't know who I'm going to play. 
Like in Australia, I'm going to wait the winner.   I think Roger won the first set and we'll see after. 

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please. 

Q.   Can you play much better than this first set? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I'm not asking myself that question.   I'm just trying to win the match. 
Today I'm very satisfied with the way I played.   I'm very pleased with my game in the first set.   I'm also pleased with my game in the second set, although I was a bit more hesitant. 
He changed his tactics.   He became more aggressive with his forehand.   I tried to be tougher on myself.   I tried to play long rallies, still moving forward when I could. 

Q.   There was one all Swiss final.   If it happens tomorrow, is it going to be important for Swiss people?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I hope it will be a Swiss final.   I don't know.   Switzerland is lucky to have the greatest player of all time.   They are used to seeing him win titles every year. 
I've improved my ranking a lot.   I'm playing better, too.   This shows that Switzerland is a strong nation of tennis.   But I don't know if an all Swiss final is important to them or not. 

Q.   This year the Swiss team is favored to win the Davis Cup.   Do you believe Federer chose to play because of you or because of public opinion, the media?   Why did he choose to play Davis Cup? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, you have to ask him.   I believe it's him and nobody else.   Nobody makes decisions for him.   He does that very well.   His career shows it. 

Q.   But what do you think? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I don't want to talk about this.   He's a good friend of mine.   We are playing well.   We are in the semis of the Davis Cup this year.   That's all.   I don't ask myself why he chose to play.   Anyway, I don't care.
