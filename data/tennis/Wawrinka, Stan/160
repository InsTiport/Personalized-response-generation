  6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French. 

Q.   Are you 100% or is there something wrong with you?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I'm okay.   I didn't know where I was, but I was not on the court for sure.   But I'm okay. 

Q.   What bothers you the most, the score or the fact you didn't play well?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I don't care about the score, it's just the way it happened and the way I played that upsets me. 

Q.   Maybe you were paying for the lack of confidence you had recently? 
STAN WAWRINKA:   Probably.   But I don't have an answer to give you, otherwise I would be happy to give it to you. 
But I don't like losing like that.   The only thing I can do now is accept that I played badly and try to find solutions and try to work on what I need to work on to solve the problem. 

Q.   Is that kind of loss worrying for the rest of this clay court season?
STAN WAWRINKA:   No.   What bothers me more is the way I felt on the court.   I couldn't hit a single shot.   It was a bad one hour to spend. 
What worries me is I was just not there today. 

Q.   Can you describe the exact feeling when you were on the court. 
STAN WAWRINKA:   I can't find an explanation.   I just felt I was not comfortable and I didn't want to be there and I didn't want to play. 

Q.   Maybe your serve was not too bad today. 
STAN WAWRINKA:   You know, when things go wrong, this he go wrong, and there's nothing positive to take from that match. 

Q.   How do you feel now?   You want to do something totally different, forget about tennis?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Maybe (smiling).   But I have to think about what I want to do. 

Q.   Was it similar to the match against Simon?
STAN WAWRINKA:   No. 

Q.   You were happy to be in Monte‑Carlo, saying you were starting to feel better, so what happened?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I don't know. 

Q.   Magnus was not with you at this tournament.   Do you believe this was a factor?
STAN WAWRINKA:   We didn't talk.   After Miami we had set up a training regime.   That's where we were. 

Q.   When you feel like today, do you realize that as soon as you wake up in the morning or once you're on the court? 
STAN WAWRINKA:   Not when I wake up.   My doubles match was okay. 

Q.   Does the doubles match comfort you?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, I was playing someone who was more than a hundred years old (laughter). 
More seriously, it was nice playing with a friend. 

Q.   When you're like this, you just don't even want to see your racquet anymore?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I just don't know.   I must think about what I'm going to do.   There are several choices that are possible. 

Q.   Something totally different.   Hingis has decided to play Fed Cup.   It was a long time since she's done that, 1998.   What do you think about it?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I think it's great for Switzerland.   We have a good team.   She plays extremely well in doubles.   She wants to play the Olympics.   It's normal she wants to play Fed Cup. 

Q.   Talking about the Olympics, Hingis asked Roger to play with her, then she asked you.   What is the situation?
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's complicated.   I think we need to meet and discuss it. 

Q.   But can you explain? 
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, Hingis asked Roger first.   Roger took some time to answer, so she asked me.   I didn't want to be in the middle since she asked Roger first.   I don't want to say yes now.   I want to wait to say what Roger says.   I want to do nothing behind his back. 

Q.   Are you going to go home tonight? 
STAN WAWRINKA:   I have a doubles match tomorrow. 

Q.   Are you hoping you can win the title in doubles here?
STAN WAWRINKA:   I'll just take it match after match.   If we play well, I know we can beat anyone.   Anyway, we're having a good time.
