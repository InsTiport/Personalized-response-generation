  6‑3, 4‑6, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   The obvious question:   Playing Roger tomorrow, you beat him in Monte‑Carlo, he's playing better since then, do you have the belief to beat him?   
STAN WAWRINKA:   I believe I can beat him.   That's not the question, for sure.   
But, yeah, I've been seeing him playing last few months.   He's playing great.   He's playing amazing tennis, especially indoor.   He love that tournament.   He love the place here.   
It's going to be a tough match for me, for sure.   But I will have to play my best game if I have a chance to beat him.   I know I can do it.   I know it's going to be very difficult.   
I have seen him play the first three match.   It's always the same.   Indoor, if you don't stay with him at the beginning, then it start to be really tough.   He goes quick, putting so much pressure, serving well.   The beginning of the match will be really important for me.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess your performance in this match?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Really happy with the win, for sure.   If you check the level, it's been some up and down, mentally also.   But it's not important for me.   For me, it's great to see I'm in the Masters with the top eight.   I beat the guy who won the US Open without playing my best game, but I'm fighting all the time to find the best solution.   
But it's been tough week for everybody.   You can see the score.   The score was so bad for a lot of player.   It's not easy to play some great tennis.   It was some great tennis from few players.   
But today for me is winning the match in three sets without playing the best tennis ever, making the semifinal again in the Masters.   It's something big for me.   It's not happen every year.   It's the second year in a row.   I'm really proud with that, really happy.
