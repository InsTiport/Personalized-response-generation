M. FISH/S. Wawrinka
  6-3, 6-7, 6-0

   THE MODERATOR: Questions in English. 

 Q. What happened at the beginning of the third set?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think he starts really well, really aggressive. First game he made three or four winner with the forehand that he didn't make it in the second. He broke me. Then I still get chance to come back. Was fighting, playing better. Then he was up a break and was over.

 Q. Were you tired? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No. It was just he was playing better. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. That match had many ups and downs. There was a bit of everything. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, it was a bad day today for me. I was not feeling the ball very well. Even if I won the second set, I didn't feel comfortable. 
 I tried to fight the best I could. I was able to win that second set all the same. But I lost many opportunities to close it out. I was two breaks ahead and I had to serve twice for it. Bad day. 

 Q. Is your goal now to be able to beat players like Fish? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, I didn't do badly. I lost in the quarterfinals here. I felt I played someone I could beat, and I didn't. I went on the court and the conditions were not good for me, and he won it. But I didn't play a bad tournament. He just played better than me today. 

 Q. Two weeks ago you were in Gstaad in the altitude and on clay. So you didn't manage the transition so badly. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, indeed. I feel my game is good right now and I must continue to work on it. 

 Q. Tomorrow you have to play doubles with Tsonga. You're both from the canton of de Vaud. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, we get along very well. We know we can do well in doubles. But we have to play late this evening, and he still has a singles match before that, so we'll see. 

 Q. Do you talk to each other about your singles?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: We've always been talking together. When we are in a tournament, we like to talk about the other players. We talk also about other things than tennis. 

 Q. Do you see each other in Switzerland?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not really because we have different schedules and he generally is not there when I am in Switzerland. GaÃ«l is there more often. 

 Q. In the second set you had many opportunities to close it out. Although you missed those, you seemed not to worry too much. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, indeed. In spite of those missed opportunities, I knew I was still ahead and I knew I wasn't playing well, so I was already happy to be at that stage. 
 My serve was very bad today. I believe that's the reason I lost. He kept fighting. He started off the third set extremely well. That helped him. 

 Q. When exactly did you realize you were not having a good day? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, it often happens that way. You step on the court and you realize you're not able to do what you want to do. Sometimes it gets better as the match progresses. But it was not the case today. 
 I must say he didn't give me the opportunity of playing better. He was playing with a lot of confidence. 

 Q. And can you explain why you were not well today?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know. We all have bad days. Also he played extremely well, put a lot of pressure on me. He was the better player on the court today. 

 Q. You have no physical problems?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, not at all.
