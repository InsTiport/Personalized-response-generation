J. MONACO/S. Wawrinka   
6-7, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  After the first set, did something change?  What happened?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I had two times a break in the second.  Didn't serve well.  Few points went really quick, went a little bit for too much in the wrong moment.  Make a big difference.   
Was not a great level today.  I was trying to fight, trying to find solution, but at the end I didn't find a good balance between playing some long rally and being aggressive.  He just played a bit better, and I didn't took my chance.   
 Q.  How would you judge your clay court form with such a big title to defend coming up?  
STAN WAWRINKA: The results are poor.  Not great, that's for sure.  That's a fact.  The level what I do outside the matches are still good, still strong.   
So I know it can quickly change, but I'm trying to push for that.  I'm trying to find the way how to make some better result, but so far, yeah, for sure the results are not good at all.   
 Q.  You said yesterday you thought you were playing better than this time last year.  The fact that that hasn't translated into results, that must be a little frustrating.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure.  For sure.  Like I said, the fact is I'm not winning enough matches.  I'm not getting the results I'm looking for.  But as I say, as long as -- I'm trying to change that, I'm trying to practicing well, I'm doing the right things.   
But so far I don't have the results I want and I was hoping for.  There is only way to keep working out and see when those results will come.   
 Q.  Your expectation on Roland Garros?  You are positive?  You are confident?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Right now I'm really disappointed with the result here, that's for sure.  It wasn't a good level.   
I have Geneva to play.  That's my focus so far.  I'm going to go there and trying to be ready for my first match and trying to do the best result I can, try and get some confidence and win there and see how I'm going to arrive in Paris.   
 Q.  Let me ask you about your opponent today.  He's been top 10.  I mean, how high was his level today?  He's obviously ranked lower than his potential.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, he was playing really well today, that's for sure.  He was also injury.  He had some big trouble with injury.  He was quite unlucky with that.  But for sure today he was playing well.   
 Q.  Are you still intending to play Geneva next week, or are you going to head to Roland Garros to practice?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, for sure I'm planning to play Geneva.  Right now I don't think it's the practice missing.  It's just match confidence.  It can be only positive to play more matches in Geneva than to go early to practice again one more week.  So for sure I'm going to play Geneva.   
 Q.  But by and large, the top players don't like to play a week before a major, do they?  Why do you choose to play Geneva?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I used to never play the week before Grand Slam, but when they came with Geneva Open, for me it was important for me to try as much as I can in Switzerland, so I did that last year.  I didn't have the results I want in Geneva, but I had better results in Paris.  So I think it wasn't a bad idea in the end to play Geneva.   
It's maximum of four matches, Saturday final if you play the final.  As I say right now, I have been practicing a lot so what I need is matches.  So condition are quite similar from Paris.  It's really close to travel to Paris after the tournament.   
So for me I think it can be only positive this year for that.  For sure, if you play a lot of matches in Madrid, a lot of matches in Rome, then it can be dangerous to play one more tournament before Paris, but right now I lost first round in Madrid, second round here.  It's not like I have been playing a lot of matches.
