S. WAWRINKA/E. Gulbis   
3-6, 3-1 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously not the way you want to go through, but you must be pleased to get into the second round.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure that's not the way you want to get through a match.  It's sad for him because he was playing well.  It's the beginning of the season.  Hopefully it's not too bad, that's for sure.   
For me, the first set, he was playing well.  I was a little bit looking for my game, little bit looking to play my tennis.  He didn't give me so much time.  Again, now I have the opportunity to play another match after tomorrow.
