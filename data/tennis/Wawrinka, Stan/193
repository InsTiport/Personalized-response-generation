S. WAWRINKA/S. Querrey
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That was must have felt good?   50 minutes?
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, no.   Yeah, it feels really good.   I'm really happy with the match, the performance and the way I'm playing, you know. 
I'm serving really big.   I did what I'm doing on the practice court.   That's means I'm playing well.   That's the most important.
I need to keep doing that, keep working out on the practice to be ready for all the matches.

Q.   He's a big guy, got a good serve.   He had to be very dangerous. 
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, yeah.   I play him a few times already.   Lost last time in Beijing last year.   You never know.   He's a tough player, but today I did a really good job.   I'm happy with myself. 
I'm really positive on the court.   I'm fighting, and I'm trying.   That's the most important.

Q.   What do you change in the shift from clay to grass?   What do you change?
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's a faster surface, so you don't have that much time.   You need to be ready to play more aggressive.   You need to trust your game.   You need to go for it. 
Normally I know that I can play really well.   It's just like never easy the first few matches because the grass is faster, and it can be dangerous if you play a tough player.
But, yeah, so far I'm doing good job.   I'm practicing well with my coach every day, trying to still improve.   I still have time for Wimbledon.   We'll see.

Q.   It must be quite a change for the body, as well.   What kinds of things do you find hurt when you make the change?
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, you have to be lower on your feet, and sometimes the knee or the back can be difficult.
But this year it was okay.   I had time to adapt myself.   I did some good job physically.   I'm ready for that.

Q.   Any tournament you play now, there's more attention on you.   But going into Wimbledon is a little bit different than going into... 
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure.   It's a Grand Slam, but I'm completely focused on myself, on what I'm doing, the way I want to deal with that and the way I'm going on court.   I'm taking everything easy. 
You know, for sure I'm No. 3 in the world.   For sure attention is more than last year.   But doesn't matter.   I need to deal with that.   I need to focus, to stay with my team and be ready for the first match.
That's it.   That's the only thing that is important.

Q.   What factors into your decision whether to play here or Halle or other weeks where you have a choice of tournaments? 
STAN WAWRINKA:   If I look at the grass court season, for sure for everybody, most important, it's Wimbledon.   Then I wanted to have some matches.   I choose here because it's more or less the same grass.   It's one of the best organizations.   They received the award.   It's because they are doing a really good job. 
That's mean I can stay one month in London.   I can stay in the house already to where I'm going to stay during in Wimbledon.
There is a few little things that I decide before to come here, but for me, the most important was because the grass is more or less the same.   It's perfect condition.   Even if you lose, you can still practice.   You can be there and getting ready for Wimbledon.
