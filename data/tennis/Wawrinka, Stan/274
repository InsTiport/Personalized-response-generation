 THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 Q.  You played him a few times already this year? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, two times, French and Australian Open.  I lost two times. 

 Q.  You took one set off of him in Australia, right? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, and three sets at the French. 

 Q.  Did you learn anything from those matches? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, yes, I learned something because, you know, I see how he is playing sometimes and you can learn something.  But every day is different, and you don't need to focus on the last match.  You just think about the next day and stay focused on the game. 

 Q.  Coming off of last week, off the win last week, now you're through to the third round here, how good do you feel about the tennis you're playing right now? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  I'm very happy to win all these match.  Yes, I think I play a good tennis.  I am very solid.  I just try to be focused on my game, not to see the opponent, just try to fight every point, yeah, to stay focused just on my game and see what's happen. 

 Q.  How do you manage to stay so focused on your game?  I mean, do you do other things off the court, or do you just go back to the hotel at night? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, I just stay for my match and then I go to the hotel.  But I think most all the good player do that, just focus on the match, (indiscernible), then go back to the hotel, don't think about the -- don't stay just for see all the player and to... 

 Q.  How will you prepare for tomorrow's match? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  How, I don't know.  I just finished the last match, so I need to talk with my coach to see how I played today just to speak and see what's happen.  And then speak about tomorrow, the match.  I play two times already Gonz√°lez, so we gonna see.  And then go back to the hotel and just relax. 

 Q.  Were you surprised with what happened with Federer today? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, yes.  He's not losing every time, so is surprise when it's happen. 
 But I think Murray was playing very well, and I think Roger is a little down after the last week.  I don't know. 

 Q.  Did you watch any of that match? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, on the TV I watch. 

 Q.  When you have a chance, do you watch most of his matches? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yes, yes.  Every time I can, I watch the match of Roger. 

 Q.  Do you think coaches should be allowed on the court during matches to provide coaching assistance like the WTA is going to allow some coaches to do? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  I don't know.  No, I think how is going, it's okay for us.  We don't need a coach on the court, but I don't know.
