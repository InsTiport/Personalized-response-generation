S. WAWRINKA/M. Russell
  6-3, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. You played solid. Can you talk about your match. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I played a good match. I had one or two breakpoints to save. I was able to do that. I played aggressive. I'm happy with that match. 

 Q. This is a good surface for you?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, I like playing on hard courts and I like when it's fast. Here, if it's warm, it's faster. But when there are clouds, it gets humid and it's a bit slower. But it's my favorite surface. 

 Q. Do you have precise goals?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: My goals are rarely precise. What I want to do is win as many matches as I can. I came here early and I am happy I have no injuries. I feel good. I'm also playing the doubles because what I want is to get as many matches as I can. 

 Q. Do you believe you have more chances on this surface? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's true this surface suits me perfectly, although I am able to play well on any surface. But I like this tournament. 

 Q. Today your opponent wasn't a big server. Do you have to prepare yourself specifically for tomorrow? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, I'm playing doubles this afternoon, so this will help me. But I am used to adapting to any type of game. What I will need tomorrow is to serve well because otherwise I will give him opportunities I wouldn't like him to have. 
 I saw him play yesterday a little. I know he plays well. I've played once against him and I won, but he improved since then and it's not going to be easy. 

 Q. Your Grand Slam results are better than his. Can you explain that? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, I prefer playing matches in the best-of-five because in those matches you are sort of allowed to make some mistakes and also my physical conditioning is good and I'm able to last a long time. 
 Also in Masters 1000 tournaments you have to play stronger players early in the tournament. That's makes a difference. 

 Q. You're not playing Murray tomorrow as might have been expected. Is this, in fact, a dangerous situation, because in the case of Murray, he was the favorite? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Indeed, my opponent tomorrow is dangerous because the level he's been playing, he can beat any player, and he proved it yesterday. I will have to play a big match if I want to win. 

 Q. Did you look further in the draw?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, of course. It would be useless. I know tennis.
