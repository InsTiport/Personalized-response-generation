H. GASTON/S. Wawrinka
2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. You started really well today.  After the first set it changed a little bit.  How did you see it?  What were the reasons?  Was it yourself?  Was it your opponent?  Was it the rain or the conditions?
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, I think was more myself.  My opponent play well all the match.  He went for it I think.  I wasn't as aggressive as I start the first set.  I think I had many opportunities to come back in the second, to take the lead, and I was not tough with myself enough to play my game, to keep the line, and to be aggressive over and over and again and again.
Yeah, I had many opportunities that I didn't took.
