 S. WAWRINKA/M. Vassallo Arguello
  6-3, 6-2, 6-2 
   
  Q. Obviously there's a chance you will play Andy Murray. I know you have already mentioned his name.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Honestly I'm focused on the next match, so no chance I will say something about Sunday.  
  
  Q. Can I just ask you how you think he compares to Roger Federer in general terms? They're the two highest ranked players left in the draw.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, this year he improved a lot. The last 12 months he's playing very well. He made the final in the US Open, he won a lot of tournaments. So of course he's just after Roger the favorite of the tournament.  
  
  Q. He seems to have a 6-2 record over Roger. What do you think Roger seems to find a problem with him?   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know. He's playing good when they play together.   
  
  Q. Do you think Murray is getting closer to Roger with every year?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Maybe, but he's young, so that's why he improved a lot the last 12 months. We need to see the next year how he's going to play. You know, Roger is here since five, six years. He's already won 14 Grand Slams, so you cannot compare.   
  
  Q. Which do you think is the tougher opponent personally when you play against them?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Who?   
  
  Q. If you play against Murray or Federer? When you play against them, who do you find more difficult?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Roger.  
  
  Q. Why?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Because he's playing different. He's playing better maybe.   
  
  Q. What do you think Murray has to add to his game to get to that level?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know.
