N. DJOKOVIC/S. Wawrinka
  4-6, 6-1, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What do you think was the difference between you today? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Maybe I think it was the third set. When I break up, I have a chance to do the 3-0, but I miss it. Too much and too fast. He was staying on the game, and that's make the difference. 

 Q. Do you feel you still need to play more matches like this to have the confidence and experience?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, I think so. For me, yeah, it's what I need, to play more matches. 
 A few weeks I lost, but it was in the 18, now is semifinals. So I hope is going to be better next week. 

 Q. Overall do you feel you've taken a big step forward?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, for the confidence, of course. To start the clay court season with a semifinal here is very good for me for the next tournament. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. Are you still frustrated about the point you missed for 3-0?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Oh, yes, I am very frustrated and disappointed. I was up 2-Love and I had this opportunity to go up 3-Love. I lost that game and the game at 2-All. These two games made me lose the match. 

 Q. What is so tough against Djokovic?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He's a very good player. He's been in the top three for two or three years already. He knows how to do everything. He knows how to volley and to move. He's very tough physically, too. 
 Today I had the impression, though, I had everything to be able to beat him. But in the third set, when I had opportunities, I rushed too much, and he was the one who came out the winner. 

 Q. You had a letdown in the second set. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It was mainly a mental factor. I think I gave away the first two games of the set. On his serve, it was deuce, and I made two or three mistakes that made it easy for him. I was not able to go to the net. 

 Q. The score is pretty similar to the match in Rome, but this match was totally different?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes. It was a completely different match in Rome. He was able to raise his game and I couldn't do anything against him. 

 Q. Do you believe Murray has a chance against Nadal?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Many players have a chance against Nadal. But for the time being, they are not succeeding on clay, but the time will come.
