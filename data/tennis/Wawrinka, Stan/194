  6‑2, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tricky out there?   It looked very slippery.   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, more than the other days that I play.   It bounce a little bit slower and a little bit slippery.   But, yeah, was not my best match.  
Didn't serve the way I wanted and didn't move well.   But I think Grigor was playing well, being really aggressive, serving big and mixing a lot.  
   
 Q.   Has it been a while since you have broken a racquet?   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Ah, I don't know.   Don't know the last time.  
   
 Q.   Physically how much force does it take to break a racquet like that?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Nothing.   Nothing.   It's okay.   I'm used to it.   It's fine.  
   
 Q.   It's not hard at all?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, you should try.   For me, it was okay.   
   
 Q.   Where do you think your grass court game is at the moment?   How many levels up more do you feel you need to go?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   I think so far it's been a positive week except today.   I was playing well.   I'm really happy with the practice session that I did every day.   I had a lot of time on the grass, so it's been really good for the preparation for Wimbledon.  
I can still improve, for sure.   I have time for Wimby to get ready.   I need to do more hours on the practice court, more exercise with Magnus.  
In general, I feel okay.   I'm sure I'm going to be ready for Wimbledon, and I'm sure if I can start well the tournament I will have some chance to do it really well.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure you're aware that Wimbledon don't do the seedings straight off the rankings.   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And the chances are that you will drop from No. 3 to No. 5.   What are your thoughts upon that?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's been like that since many years.   You know, Wimbledon, they do what they want.   That's why to change the seeding, then we don't have choice.   So for me it's fine.  
I knew that with my past two years on grass didn't have any results, so for sure my ranking will drop a little bit for the seedings.   I'm going to be 5 or 6.   I think 6 maybe even.  
So we'll see.   At the end of the day, it doesn't change much.   You have to play well.   You have to start well the tournament if you want to go far, and that's simple.  
   
 Q.   Have you got any more games or matches or exhibitions planned?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, except good practice.   No, no, I'm going to be one week here, try to practice well, try to rest, try to be ready mentally, physically, and the tennis also.  
It's going to be good.   I think it's been a good schedule to come here, play matches already one week that I have been on the grass.   I still have one week to finish my practice, and it's going to be fine.  
   
 Q.   You spent a lot of time in Grigor's company this week, played doubles with him.   Ever since he won the juniors, people have been comparing him to Roger and saying he plays very similar to Roger.   What do you think about Grigor's game?   What do you think he can achieve in this sport?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   No, for sure, even if he's starting to change a little bit, his game is similar to Roger, you know, have a one‑handed backhand, big forehand especially, don't miss that much.   He can serve well.   Can mix with his slice and volley well.   
He's been having a great year already.   You know, he's No. 12 or 13.   I don't know exactly.   Winning two titles.   
I'm sure he can achieve big things in tennis.   We'll see, you know.   The problem also is now we still have Novak and Rafa winning everything, but in few years you have to see how the ranking will change, who's going to be there, if Raonic will be there, Dimitrov will be there, Nishikori also.   It's going to be interesting to see who's going to take the lead.  
   
 Q.   If you had to bet on one of them beating the big guy, who would it be?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   I'm not allowed to bet, so...(laughter).   
It's tough to say.   I think this year was already really interesting with Raonic and Nishikori, Grigor.   I think it's really good generation and they are going to be there for many years.  
I'm just going to watch and see.   
   
 Q.   A very Swiss answer.   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yes (smiling).
