7-5, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A better match for you than yesterday?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, a little bit better, I think.  I was feeling a little bit better the balls.  I adapt a few things with my racquet, also with the tension.   
I think it wasn't amazing but it's a good win.  Happy to get through to playing in the quarter tomorrow, winning in two sets tonight.  There's a lot to improve, but in general I'm happy to win.   
 Q.  Did you feel more accustomed to the conditions or was it tough, as well?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, it's not easy condition, but I think every player would say it's a little bit flying, a little bit fast here.   
But for sure it was better.  First match is always the toughest one.  Now I saw what was happening yesterday, so I think it was a little bit better in general.  And, yeah, it's good to play tomorrow the quarterfinal.   
 Q.  You told us you're not with anybody here, so did you talk to Magnus or text him about yesterday's match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: About today's match or yesterday?   
No, no, except some text to say congrats and good luck.  Nothing.  I talked to myself with my brain (smiling).   
 Q.  It's working.  You haven't played Philipp I think since 2008 or something.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah.   
 Q.  So just talk about that.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's going to be interesting match.  I think last time we play in 2008 we played two times, French and Madrid indoors, 7-6 in the third, also, I think.   
He's been there, top 30, since many, many years, always tough player, always beating some good player during the year.   
You need to play solid and good match to beat him.  He's not going to give you the match.  Generally he's playing his level every time.   
It's going to be everything on my side.  I will have to serve well, playing my game, playing aggressive, and for sure trying to go for it.   
 Q.  Some players kind of enjoy every once in a while having a week by yourself.  What have you been doing between the matches?  You have been playing late so you have a full day before.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, you know, I also arrive late from Marseilles, so most important thing for me was to adapt on the conditions.  I practiced quite a lot, a little bit more than normally to get used to the conditions.   
I was doing treatment.  I was just recovering.  Also resting because coming from indoor/outdoor.  It's not that I had so much time, especially that I had a long match yesterday, finishing late.  So tried to take an easy day today.
