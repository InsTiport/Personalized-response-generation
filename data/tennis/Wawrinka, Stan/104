  7‑6, 6‑1, 7‑6, 6‑4

  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. One of the younger players that everyone is looking at, how do you think he handled the situation?
STAN WAWRINKA: He's young. Playing really well, for sure. Practiced with him in Madrid. He has a great potential, for sure. 
He has a good game. Really talented. Strong serve. Good backhand. Yeah, for sure is the future of the tennis. But we have to see how he's going to improve the next few years. He's still also younger than the other players. 
It's going to be interesting to see. 

Q. You play Juan Martin next. He's a guy that a lot of people are rooting for. How difficult is it for you to go on court and try to beat him?
STAN WAWRINKA: It's another match. For me it's going to be interesting to play against him. It's been many years that I didn't play against him. Didn't practice neither. 
For sure I think we all happy that he's back on the tour, hopefully without any injury, that he can play for long now. 
He always been a great champion, a great player to watch also. It's going to be, for sure, a tough match. I saw him play a little bit on grass in Stuttgart, I think. He's playing well. So it's going to be interesting to see what's going to happen. 

Q. What do you remember most about him before his injury?
STAN WAWRINKA: I remember him winning the US Open, for sure, against Roger. An incredible match. I remember his match against Roger in semifinal in French Open as well. I think was the same year or year before. And a few match I play against him. Some tough match, for sure. 
He was a really, really tough player to play. 

Q. What made him so tough?
STAN WAWRINKA: Big serve, big forehand. I don't know how is his backhand now. But returning everything. Moving well. When you see how tall he is, tough to push him, so powerful.

Q. You're seeded No.4. Do you have expectations yourself to go that far?
STAN WAWRINKA: For me, it's always the same in Grand Slam, even more here: I'm focused match after match. I know if I can start to win few matches, I can be dangerous to go far. 
But before that, if you look, it's grass. You need to get used to the condition. I'm playing del Potro in the second round. I think it's a really tough match. I will be happy if I can come back here and win that match. 

Q. How do you feel about your form now compared with a year ago when you came in after Roland Garros?
STAN WAWRINKA: My form is good. I'm practicing well, playing well. I have a lot of time on grass. Now I just want to win some matches. 

Q. Have you followed at all the story of Marcus Willis?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yes. 

Q. What is your reaction to that?
STAN WAWRINKA: It's a great story for tennis, for him. It's always something special when a guy 700 in the world play the prequalification tournament and qualify. I watch him yesterday a little bit playing on the TV. Was quite fun. 
It's a great story. It's going to be nice to see him play against Roger. 

Q. Several players have been talking about the towels and how popular they are, how they're asked by friends to bring them home. Do you like the towels? Do you find friends asking?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think the towel, it's something special in every Grand Slam. You always find family who ask for that. 
I've been always trying to keep one for myself in each Grand Slam that I played, to have that as a memory. Yeah, it's always something special for the friends if you can bring a towel that was on the court in a Grand Slam. For sure, it's always good memories for them. 

Q. Do you think when a player is 18, like the player you played today, people are saying, He's going to be in the top 10 one day, does that strike you as harmful in some way or difficult?
STAN WAWRINKA: I think it depends of the player, for sure. But if you look now, also you had the big four here since more than 10 years now. So for sure everybody's looking for the new generation. That's what happening. If you look, the guy is already 60 in the world. It's quite impressive to be there already. 
He has a big potential, a big chance to be higher in the next few years, for sure.
