THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about the atmosphere out there on the court.   The fans were vocal and loud.   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No, it's great.   I think it's amazing atmosphere to play night session at the Margaret Court.   
Had the Chance two years ago to play against Marcos Baghdatis.   Was a crazy night.   Tonight again was a lot of people, lot of fans over there.   It's always great.   Especially here I think it's different.   
The fans are really into it.   They're really enjoying the match.   They're really loud.   I think it's always fun to play.   
   
 Q.   You love to play in South America.   How would you compare these crowds?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, more the same.   Today I played against Falla so was a lot of South America people and was a crazy atmosphere, yes.   
In Buenos Aires, it's quite good crowd, good people over there.   It's the same.   They love sports.   They love tennis.   They come to watch, to enjoy, to support the player, but more to enjoy the tennis and to enjoy the game.   
Here was the same.   At the end of the day they start to be a little bit maybe tired and they're doing few beers and they're louder than at the beginning of the day.   I think it's great.   
For me, I enjoy to play in front of that crowd.   
   
 Q.   Were you expecting your opponent to play as well as he did?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure.   We all know how difficult is it to play against him.   He can play really good.   Sometimes have the feeling that's better, I'm playing better he's playing, because if you play fast, he can play better because he don't have to think too much.   That's what happen in the third and fourth sets.   
But, yeah, I was expecting a tough match.   I had tough match today.   I was focused on myself, trying to be more relaxed, trying to be more positive with myself.   At the end the more important is to win it.   I'm quite happy to that.   I'm now looking forward to the next one.   
   
 Q.   He's a dangerous player if you let him in.   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, he's really dangerous.   Sometimes he's in the zone and he's playing good, returning everything.   You need to find the balance between let him play and play aggressive.   If you play only aggressive, he'll enjoy because he can run and play fast.   
But when you mix the speed of the game, when I change the rhythm, that's when he doesn't like really.   It's not always easy to do it during five sets, but that's what in general I did well today.   
   
 Q.   You were trying to break his rhythm?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah.   Even slice from the baseline.   Even mixing the speed of my game with my forehand a little bit higher, you know, trying to change a little bit.   
But, yeah, when he's playing good, he's tough to play.   You need to stay focused and tough with yourself.   
   
 Q.   When you qualified for the World Tour Finals, did it change your confidence, that you would be one of the great stars in the game?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for me was a great achievement for me to qualify for London.   It's something that all the players dream about it, you know, to be there.   Only the top eight can play that tournament.   Was something really special.   
After the year I had last year, was great.   Was just amazing year.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people think you could be a real threat to this tournament.   What do you think?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Good.   Good that they think that.   But it's a long way to be there I think.   I'm sure that I have the game and I can beat a lot of player.  
But I have to focus in every matches and I need to be ready for the next one.   If I do well, maybe this tournament I will have a chance to beat one of the top guy, maybe not.   
But I'm focused and trying to improve every day and trying to have a great year.   
   
 Q.   If you win this tournament, are you going to go skydiving or not?   Are you much into extreme sports?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I'm not going to win the tournament, so we're not there yet.   
I can skydiving without winning the tournament.   It's not a problem for me.
