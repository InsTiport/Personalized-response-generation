An interview with:   
STAN WAWRINKA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Where can I get that T-shirt?  
STAN WAWRINKA: In the store here next, you can buy it (smiling).   
 Q.  A tougher match tonight than you expected it to be?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Always expect tough match.  I think it wasn't an easy match.  The condition was different.  Really cooler, windy.  Didn't play amazing match, but happy to get through in three sets.   
 Q.  In the end, the 5-1 lead...  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, one break in that match.  The match was up and down.  Got broken in the first.  Got broken in the second.  But my serve wasn't really there tonight.   
But doesn't matter.  I'm happy to get through.   
 Q.  What are your expectations for the next round?  Do you think you can step a level up again?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, hopefully.  But so far I think it's been good.  Didn't lost a set.  Still won three matches.  Didn't play my best tennis, but I'm still there.  It's been a great tournament so far.  I'm happy where I am right now.  I know my level is there.  So just waiting to get there in the match.   
 Q.  What do you think about Donald Young's chances?  
STAN WAWRINKA: It's going to be exciting match for sure.  I watch a little bit his match today.  He came back again.  After the first round he came back two sets to zero down.   
He's a tough player.  He improved a lot.  Especially his attitude on the court, he's fighting way more.  He's always trying.  He has a nice game to watch.  He try to get the crowd with him.  So it's going to be, for sure, a great match to play against him.   
I lost a few years ago against him in five sets.  I was playing well.  I'm waiting for a tough one.   
 Q.  The American crowd rooting for him, does that have a major effect on you?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't think so.  Normally I don't have any problem with that.  Hopefully I can play well enough to win the match.  That's the most important.   
But I'm happy to play an American.  It's always great for sure.  They going to have a lot of people there watching the match, and that's the most important.
