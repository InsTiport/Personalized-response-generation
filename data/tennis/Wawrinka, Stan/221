 S. WAWRINKA/D. Ferrer
  6‑7, 6‑4, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to win today against Ferrer?   And how did you reset your mind after the match loss against Nadal?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for me was really to focus on myself.   I saw at the beginning that he's not really at his best.   He's a little bit tired, especially mentally.   Every long rally, I had the control of it.   
For me, the most important it was to fight with myself to keep the ball in, to try to stay with him, to show him that I'm gonna play some long rally, that I'm going to try to be aggressive, but not rushing too much.   
That's what I did better at the end.   That's make a big difference today.   
   
 Q.   In a world of hypotheticals, let's assume Rafael Nadal wins tonight.   How great of an end to a season would it be to be in the semifinals of the World Tour Finals?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Amazing.   But even if Berdych wins against Rafa, it's amazing week for me already.   I had to win against Tomas Berdych, No.5, David Ferrer, I lost a tough one against Nadal.   At the ATP World Tour Finals, it was quite good level for me.   That's the most important.   
I can be only really happy with the tournament.   Doesn't matter what's happen tonight.   
   
 Q.   This is your first time here.   Did you understand the tiebreaker system for the round robin before you got here?   Do you understand it now?   Do you like it?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's always a lot of discussion.   But, yes, I understand because I watch so many times the tournament in the past years.   I think one year, Andy Murray just didn't make it because of games or something like that.   
It's always strange, but that's part of the tournament.   That's what makes it different.   I quite like it, yes.   
   
 Q.   Can you describe your thought process after losing the first set, how you got yourself back into the match?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Like always, I had the chance to win the first set, for sure.   I start to be a little bit nervous, start to miss few shots.   Against Ferrer, you cannot do that.   He's always there, always try to fight.   
The beginning of the second was important one.   I save breakpoint.   But I was just trying, again, to really fight with myself, not giving the match, just show him that I'm gonna be there and I'm gonna improve my game if I can, I'm gonna fight on every ball.   That if he wants to beat me, he has to really find the way to beat me.   
   
 Q.   If you do make it through, you'd play Novak.   Obviously you've had the great matches with him this year.   How exciting would it be to play him again?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, we'll see.   I lost against him quite easy last week in Paris.   He was playing really good.   
To be honest, I don't want to think too much about that.   Right now I want to enjoy a little bit my match, my week already.   I'm not in semifinal yet, so I have to wait a little bit and I will try to focus.   If Rafa beats Berdych, I will try to focus tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   If you had to divide up your success this season, how much of your success is physical, mental or technical?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I don't like to give percentage.   I think tennis, it's more than one thing.   It's like a puzzle.   You have to put all the piece together.   That's what happen for me this year.   
When you win, you get more confident, so you feel better on the court.   When I feel good physically, I can play better tennis, so technically I'm much better.   
It's a lot of small things that make huge difference.   But for sure I think this year the most important was my self‑confidence on the court.   Now when I come on the court, even against Berdych, against Rafa, against Ferrer today, I know that I can beat them.   That's already a big step ahead.  
   
 Q.   How difficult is it to cope with the situation of a tight calendar on the ATP World Tour?   And what about the situation of one week off between Paris Bercy and this tournament and the final of Davis Cup, for example?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, I think it's not the best schedule to have back‑to‑back Paris Bercy and here.   I think it's strange.   It's not good for Paris.   It's not good for here.   It's not good for the player.   
But they gonna change it, so I'm really happy that they come back to the old system.   I think it's better for everybody.   
   
 Q.   David said your serve made the difference.   Seems when you needed it, you were there and you were aggressive.   Do you agree?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yes and no.   I serve really well the first set until the game at 5‑3.   Yes and no.   At the end I know my serve can be big, I can make free points with that.   That's part of my game.   That's it, you know.   
He's returning really well, so it's not easy to get free points.   But I think I change a little bit.   I start to serve more to his body on the second and third set.   That give me more easy ball to attack him after.   
   
 Q.   This tournament has a completely different format from an average event.   Can you tell us about the process, how different it is?   Your coach played this tournament in 2000.   What have you prepared differently?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Nothing much differently for the preparation, you know.   I always try to get ready for every match, to win every match.   That's the base.   
But then for me it's my first time here.   But I had the feeling when I arrive here, for me, because I didn't play here, it was a little bit like Davis Cup.   You have important match against big player, but if you lose the first one, you're not out of the competition.   
So that's how a little bit I took the three matches here.   I had the chance that I start really well winning the first matches.   I think when you arrive here and you win the first matches, it's a big difference.
