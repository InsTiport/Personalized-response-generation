S. WAWRINKA/S. Querrey
  7‑6, 7‑5, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What was the difference from your point of view?   What gave you the victory?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   First, I think I was playing very good.   That make a little bit the difference. 
But, no, the condition was tough.   The court was really fast.   It was quite windy there.   It was not easy to control the ball. 
But I think the difference is that I was always playing with my line.   I was always try to make some things with the ball, try to stay aggressive, try to make him play every ball, every shot, and try to push him to make the mistake. 
You know, when you won a close set like 7‑6, 7‑5, then 6‑4, only smallest point make the difference.   And today I took the important point. 

Q.   Were you aware that was the last American in the tournament?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   You know, it's not my first problem.   I play at US Open and it was always the last American.   It's not the first time I play when it's the last American in a Grand Slam. 

Q.   Getting to become a habit?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   If I won, it's the most important.
