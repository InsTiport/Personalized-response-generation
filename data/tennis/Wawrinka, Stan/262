   THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions, please. 

 Q. Captain, the alignment that you've got, the schedule that you've got, do you see any advantage to going with Wawrinka first? 
 CAPTAIN LUTHI: It's always the same question after the draw. I think we will see tomorrow evening already the score and then we know if it was an advantage or not. 
 I think it's not bad, but Stan still has to win the first match, then it's really an advantage for us. 

 Q. What do you think of Birmingham so far? 
 MARCO CHIUDINELLI: What do we think of Birmingham? We're staying in Hoover. Very nice out there, very relaxing. We haven't seen much of Birmingham, unfortunately, because the first few days we've been jetlagged a bit. We just practiced, then went to sleep all the time. 
 Since Tuesday, we try to focus on the encounter on the weekend. We basically stayed in every night in our hotel, yeah. Unfortunately we haven't seen anything, just the stadium and the hotel. Stadium's very nice, though. We hope we'll have a big crowd. 

 Q. How does it feel playing the first round away rather than at home? How much harder is it? 
 MARCO CHIUDINELLI: Maybe Stan can answer the question because I have never played away so far. I will only find out tomorrow (laughter). 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, you know, it's not easy. But I think we have less journalists because it's far away from Switzerland. 
 But, no, actually I think it's not gonna change something, you know. The people are quite more for the USA. But it's the same. We don't care to play away.
