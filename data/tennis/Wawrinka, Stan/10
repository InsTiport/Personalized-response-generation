S. WAWRINKA/J. Isner
6-4, 4-1 (ret.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Maybe not the most satisfying way to advance, but what does it mean to you to get back to the second week here?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure, you never want your opponent to pull out and to get injury. Then when it happen, you need to look from my side. I think I was playing well again today. I was really happy the way I was moving, the way I was playing. That's very positive.
It's great to be back in the second week, that's for sure. Feeling way better. Positive to have a good practice tomorrow and to be ready for the next one.
Q. At what point could you tell something was wrong with John?
STAN WAWRINKA: I think middle of the first set when I start to always come back to his forehand, especially with my forehand. I realized he was struggling a little bit to push on that side.
But again, you never know what it can be. You never know what will happen. Especially him, the way he's serving, he can always stay in the match. I was always surprised when he pulled out.
