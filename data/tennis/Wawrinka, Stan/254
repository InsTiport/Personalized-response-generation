  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What's your sensation to come back as the finalist? 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's a good sensation. I start well the clay court season, and I'm very happy to be back at a great tournament I played last year. 
 I'm very happy to come back to try to play like last year. 

 Q. You have extra confidence now after, well, not last week, but Monte-Carlo on the clay?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not extra confidence, but I'm very happy with my game. I know I play very well. I start good this week today with a good win against Kunitsyn, so I'm happy with my game and with the clay court season.

 Q. You played very well at times. There were a couple of concentration lapses. Did you struggle at all with your concentration at times?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Today? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, I think it was enough today to play. To win 6-3, 6-4, I was up and it was my game. I was trying to do some -- yeah, to play well all the time it's always difficult to be focus every game when you won in two sets, so I'm very happy to play more than one hour in two sets.
