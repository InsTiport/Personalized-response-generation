 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you put into words just how you feel right now.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I'm very, very sad, of course. Was a tough match, and to lose today is very, very bad for me.   
  
  Q. How much effort did you put into that today?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I try everything, but it was not enough. Almost, but not enough.   
 Of course, I try everything I can today to win the match.   
  
  Q. Do you think in years to come you'll regard it as a very special memory because of the atmosphere under the roof, playing Andy?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure it was very, very special. It was a very nice atmosphere with the Centre Court and all the crowd for Andy Murray.   
 But I enjoy a lot the match. But for sure I'm very sad after the match.  
  
  Q. Did you think you were going to be the stronger player in the fifth set?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, but the second game he break me. I was 40-Love, and he break me, and I think then it was more easy for him to play well and to stay on the game.   
 For sure I was playing very good. I was in the match, and I was hoping to do better in the fifth set.   
  
  Q. How were the conditions out there? Could you notice any difference between Wimbledon in daylight and Wimbledon at nighttime under the roof?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Was very, very nice to play with the roof closed. I enjoy a lot to play tonight.   
  
  Q. What about the grass itself? Was there any difference in the way it played?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, I think it was almost the same.  
  
  Q. Why is your nose so red?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: With the towel, new towel. Irritating.   
  
  Q. You were getting treatment from the physio early on. What was that for?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Well, something I have already in the first two match, but nothing special.   
  
  Q. It didn't affect the way you played?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not really, no.   
  
  Q. Have you ever played in an atmosphere like that before?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, maybe in Davis Cup it's always nice match. This year in January we play -- in March we play in United States in Davis Cup. It was very nice.   
  
  Q. Does Andy Murray have what it takes to win Wimbledon, do you think?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: For sure he's playing very good, especially on grass. He improve a lot the last 12 month.   
 But, yeah, today I was close, but he won the match. I think for the rest of the tournament he's ready, but you don't need to forgot the other player.   
 You know, Roger is still there, and I think it can be a very nice final.
