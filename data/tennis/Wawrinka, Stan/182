THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   So this win is a good thing for you, or you were not worried about the bad series of losses?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, as I said in Basel, I'm trying to find my confidence.   I have some victories, but I know that my level of game is here.   What I still miss is winning matches.   
But here it's just the first round.   Of course that player was playing well.   He won a match already, so I did well.   I started this tournament off pretty well, which I usually don't do, because usually I need time to adapt.  
But today I played well from the start.  
   
 Q.   What happened after the US Open?   You played too much before?   Did you expect this would happen, or you didn't?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, it's not only after the US Open.   It's the whole year that way, unfortunately.   Well, I wouldn't change anything.   
I'm so happy.   I didn't hope I would be able to be ranked so high, but I had ups and downs.   In the summer I didn't play very well.   I had bad moments, although I did well in the US Open.   
Apart from Wimbledon and the US Open it was difficult for me to have good results this year after Monte‑Carlo.  
But I wouldn't change anything.   I know I have a good level of game.   I know things can change quickly.   I can lose first round, and I can also go very far in a tournament.  
So the important thing is really to concentrate on improving my level.  
   
 Q.   Is it tough to know that you can have ups and downs, or are you just used to it and you know it's going to come back?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, of course you hope you wouldn't have those ups and downs, because losing so early in tournaments for three months had never happened to me before, especially in Basel.   
I was practicing well, and losing that match that way was upsetting.   But what I always did well in my career is that I never panicked.   I never totally changed the schedule just because I was losing two matches in a row.   
I always kept doing the same things and not changing everything, so I know after a while it pays off.  
   
 Q.   The end of this season is pretty busy, so what is your state of mind here in this tournament in Paris?   You just want to find your confidence and the rhythm?   Or because you have a lot to do this week, next week, and then the Davis Cup final?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   As I said, I'm here to go as far as I can.   I know I can do it.   I can go far.   But I need to play well from the start.   I feel good, generally speaking.   
Of course, I can't have as a goal a final or a semifinal right now, but I am here this week to do everything I can and go as far as I can.   
And also, I will have a week before the Masters.   That changes everything.   I will be able to rest.   If I lose early here, I can rest.   I can practice early for the next thing.  
So of course it is busy, but I don't feel too much pressure, as was the case last year.   
   
 Q.   Jo, for example, is thinking only about the Davis Cup.   GaÃ«l, too.   They are careful.   They don't want to get injured.   How do you react to this, to the Davis Cup coming up?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Well, I know since the semifinal of Davis Cup they have been talking about this all the time.   
But it's difficult to talk about the Davis Cup right now because anything can happen.   Just two days before you can get injured or something can happen.   
For the time being I'm here.   I have some goals for the end of the season.   I want to do well in the Masters, too.   I want to play this tournament well, and really I have a chance to go to the Masters.   I want really to enjoy it and do my best.   
So I'm not going to get stressed because of the Davis Cup.   We have time.   There are beautiful things I can do before that.   It's the second year I will be qualified for the Masters.   It's not like if I had played there for ten years, so it's incredible for me to be there.
