      6‑3, 6‑2, 6‑7, 7‑6 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Did he change something in that third set?   Did his game pick up in that third set?  
    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, a little bit I think, but that's Marcos.   One moment he find his game and he's not missing anymore.   He was serving a little bit better, and I was struggling to start the point really aggressive.  
    So he was taking advantage of that.   That's how the match start to be more difficult for me.  
   
 Q.   So how were you able to close him out in the fourth then?  
    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I'm really happy.   It was a tough fourth set.   We were both playing good.   It was physically really difficult about the heat and humidity today.  
    No, I was really, really happy to finish out in four sets.  
   
 Q.   Looking ahead to Tomas in your next match, how do you look at that matchup?  
    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, he's a great player, really strong player, powerful player.  
    It's always tough to play against him.   Usually we had some great battle together.   I need to adapt a little bit my game, because he's so powerful, so I need to change a little bit.  
    Yeah, you know, he's not really happy to play against me.   He doesn't like my game.   We practice a few times together.   I know if I'm if fit and if I play well, I have some chance.
