S. WAWRINKA/J. Tsonga
  6‑2, 6‑7, 6‑4

Q. Obviously really tough match.   Three match points.   How did you pull it off?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, it was a really tough battle.   I was playing some good tennis during two set and a half, then I started to miss a little bit.   I start to think a little bit and I was thinking a little bit about the victory. 
The tiebreak was really tough because I had some opportunity to play really well, but at the end I was just trying to push myself mentally to stay in the match and to try to push him physically that maybe he would give my some opportunity to break him. 
Yeah, I'm really happy to get through.

Q.   How do you feel about your next match?   How do you feel about the chances? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, interesting match.   Be fresh for tomorrow for sure.   But most important for me is that I'm feeling good physically tomorrow.   I have some little problems, so I will see tonight.   I will be ready for tomorrow.
