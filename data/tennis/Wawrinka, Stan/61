S. WAWRINKA/A. Dolgopolov
6-4, 7-6, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. How do you assess that performance?
STAN WAWRINKA: I think was a really good match.  I'm really happy with my game today.  My match in general I think was a strong game.
I think in general he was playing well.  I knew what to expect against him.  I need to be focused on myself.  I think in general the level was really high, so I'm happy with everything.
Q. It seems always at this stage of tournaments no one is talking about you.  People are talking about Nadal, Djokovic, Murray, et cetera.  Do you like that?  Do you prefer that?
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't mind (smiling).  For me, doesn't matter if we talk about me or not.  I'm No. 3 in the world.  I won three Grand Slams last three years.  I know what my level is, I know what I can do.  I'm focusing on what I have to do to stay as long as possible here, and the rest I really don't mind.
Q. Do you feel like through the clay court season you were up and down a little bit?  Did you always feel like when you got here your game was in good shape, anyway?
STAN WAWRINKA: I was practicing well and playing well in practice.  I didn't get the result I wanted to in first three tournaments, but I start to win some matches in Geneva.  Winning the title for sure gave me a lot of confidence.
I think here I'm playing great tennis, so we'll see.  It's only been two matches, so it's a long way to go if you want to stay here until the end.  So that's what I'm focusing on, trying to do the right thing match after match, and we'll see what's gonna happen.
Q. Next you will face Fognini.  What do you expect from him?
STAN WAWRINKA: Again, a tough match.  He's a really strong player.  He's playing well, especially on clay.
Again, he's kind of player like Dolgopolov, and predictable a little bit.  Depends on the day he's on, but I know he's strong player.  I saw him play all the clay season.  He was playing well.  He's focused.  He's there.  It's gonna be a dangerous match.
Q. Do you like to play these kind of players that can be unpredictable?  Sometimes it's all or sometimes it's nothing.
STAN WAWRINKA: Not really (smiling).  I don't know any player who likes to play that kind of player.  Again, you know, you don't choose who you gonna play.  So I'm focusing on what I'm doing.  So far it's been well.  My confidence is there.  I'm playing great tennis.  I think today was a really strong match, and I'm happy to be there.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. From time to time in the past, you did get off to a bad start in the previous French Open tournaments.
STAN WAWRINKA: Very happy with the match.  It was a high level for a second round.  I'm very happy with the way I played.  So far, so good.
So even though you win a match in three sets in the first rounds, it doesn't mean that you will reach a final.  So I just want to focus on my game.
Q. You had an issue with the referee.  What was it all about?
STAN WAWRINKA: It was not important.  It doesn't matter (smiling).
Q. You have won two matches.  You have won two sets, 7-6, 7-5.  You can ramp up the level when it matters?
STAN WAWRINKA: It's part of confidence.  This is what I'm looking for.  I won matches.  I won a title.  I won complicated matches in Geneva.  I won the final.  When you win matches your confidence is up, and I fed on what I did in Geneva.  I lifted the trophy there.
I know exactly what I have to do during important moments.  I want to remain focused on my game to do the right things.  And when I stick to my game plan, I can even be better in crucial moments.
Q. What about this transition from Suzanne Lenglen and center court?  Is it tough or not?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, no problem.  I have played on both courts already.  The courts are different this year relative to the previous years.  Not much difference between Lenglen court and center court.
The courts are similar.  They are fast, but no problem, no issue with that.
Q. Back to a question that was put to you in English.  You won the title in 2015, but you are not grabbing the headlines relative to Nadal and Djokovic.
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm not worried about it.  That's quite normal.  I'm used to that situation.
I don't want people to talk about me.  What matters to me is to make a deep run in this tournament.  If I can reach the final, people will talk about me.  So I just want to move forward to notch up victories.  Whether I'm part of the favorites it doesn't matter at all.
I know exactly what I have to do in order to win a Grand Slam.  I have already won three Grand Slam titles, so I just want to remain focused on what I do.
Q. In the crucial moments you talked about confidence.  In the second set in the first round, in the tiebreaker, it was 5-5, 6-6, and you wanted to make a difference, so confidence is important.  Do I exaggerate?
STAN WAWRINKA: If I could win 6-1, 6-1, 6-1, I would do it at every match.
But this match was different to that of the first round.  The level was quite high.  Against Dolgopolov I played well.  But from time to time, you are broken.  The player puts pressure upon your shoulders.  He delivers winners, but that's part of the game.  But if you have a look at the match in general, it's a solid match, a very robust performance.  Very happy with what I have done.
