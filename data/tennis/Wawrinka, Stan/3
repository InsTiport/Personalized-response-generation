  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It's been a different preparation for all players, but how do you assess your game ahead of the Australian Open?
 STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I'm feeling okay.  I'm feeling ready to start the tournament.  I didn't have the best preparation, but since I arrive here I've been practicing well, I've been getting back on shape little by little.  So I'm excited to start the tournament.
