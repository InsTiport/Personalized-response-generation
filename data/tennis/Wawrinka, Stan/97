4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. After the third set tiebreaker which didn't go your way, you seemed a bit frustrated.  What was your mentality going into the fourth set?
STAN WAWRINKA: Trying to make him work more.  Trying to do less unforced errors.  Trying to find my game.
I was frustrated, for sure, to be down two sets to one because I wasn't playing my best tennis.  But still had a chance.  So I was trying to find the right way, how to keep fighting, how to stay in the match, and how to make it break.
Q. Can you talk us through the two tiebreaks.  They seemed to be the crucial parts during the match.  Keep fighting against match points, set points down.  How was that?
STAN WAWRINKA: How was it (smiling)?
If you're two sets down, you have a tiebreak going to 8-All, it's important because if you lose it, you lose the match, that's for sure.
In general, I think the second tiebreak was a little bit better from both sides.  He was coming a lot to the net to try to finish the point.  I had to play better, be a little bit more aggressive, more tough with myself.  And I took it.  I was, for sure, happy to took it.
But I had the feeling in the fourth set that I was starting to play a little bit better.  He was starting to be down a little bit, but still playing really well in those important points, still being there, still being tough.
It wasn't easy to stay calm with myself.  But in general I think that was the key for the match.  Was tough condition, windy against a talented player who is playing really well, who was pushing me a lot.  He was coming with the right shot in the right moment.
Yeah, the court was a little bit faster than normally, than the other big court.  So I'm happy to get through.  It's an important win for me.
Q. How does that match compare to other matches you played at the US Open?  Is it one of your most memorable that you've ever had?
STAN WAWRINKA: It's always good to win by saving match point.  It's always something special, that's for sure.  It was a great atmosphere again today on that court, tough condition.  There's many thing I can look at my game because it wasn't the best game.
But I think he also deserve the credit to make me play not my best because he was playing well.  He was changing a lot.  He's really talented.  So was tough battle and I'm happy to get through.
Q. Your ankle, how much of a factor was that?  Did it bother you during the match?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's not the first time that I twist my ankle in match.  Was painful in the moments, but after the pain went out, I just wanted to check and change the tape because that was the most important.  It's because of the tape that I don't completely kill the ankle.
I didn't feel any pain during all the match after, so that was okay.
