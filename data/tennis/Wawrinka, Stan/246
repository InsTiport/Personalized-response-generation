M. YOUZHNY/S. Wawrinka
  3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What did you learn out there on court today?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: A lot of things, but just after the match it's always difficult. But I think today Mikhail was playing very good. I tried my best. I tried to fight on all the match, but was too much.

 Q. You got to this stage, and it was a rough road, Chela, Murray, Querrey. This was not an easy road for you. To get to your first Grand Slam quarterfinal - I know the match is only over by an hour, hour and a half - but are you able to look back and say you made tremendous strides in this tournament and feel some sense of contentment?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure, for sure. If I go back, I'm very pleased the tournament.
 That's true, but like I said, just an hour after losing in five-set match against Mikhail Youzhny in five-set match, it's always difficult to find all the positive things.

 Q. I know it's hard to say, as you just said. Is there a sense though that you played some tremendous tennis in this tournament and there's some contentment there?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure. I know especially against Andy Murray was I think my best match, and I was playing really, really strong. For the rest of the season and for sure next year, it's gonna be, I hope, more tournaments with that level.

 Q. How is your injury?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Ah, I will see later with the doctor. I hope it's not too bad, but I think it's gonna be fine.

 Q. And the conditions out there? I mean, the wind just doesn't seem to be letting up here in Flushing. Was it as bad down there as it looked from the stands?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was really tough, but I think it's same for the both player. You need to play. When you go on court, doesn't matter the condition. You just need to win the match and try your best. 
 But for sure was really difficult today.

 Q. Do you have any immediate thoughts about your shot selection in the fifth set? Seems like there was that moment at 30-All, I think you were down 4-2, and you tried a dropshot; you missed it, but you ended up holding serve there. But, you know, there were a couple things after you smashed the racquet. You seemed to go for big first serves and had to subsequently hit second serves for missing them. 
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't remember everything, but... 

 Q. Any reaction? If you just look back at it abstractly the fifth set, anything you'd like to say?
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Not really. I think I give everything today, and I try -- I try, for sure. I made some big mistake, but after four hours you're really tired. I was tired. 
 So it's not always easy to think and to play the right dropshots or to play the good point and not to break the racquet.
 But, yeah, after the match, I just know that I try everything. I think he was just a little bit better today.
