S. WAWRINKA/J. Chardy   
6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  A good win. It took you a little time in the second set. What do you have to say?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm really happy with the first match, first match of the season, after a few months without playing matches. I think the level was good. I was really focused, moving well also.   
Yeah, so I'm happy with the match, really happy.   
 Q.  You were greeted by the customary cat in Doha.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Sorry?   
 Q.  You were greeted by the cat.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Something happened in the match, but it didn't took too long.   
 Q.  And what was the thing? You were trying to give the ball to the cat?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I was trying to make him leave the court nicely.   
 Q.  Seven out of seven against Jeremy. Would you agree that he's one of your favorite opponents on the ATP tour?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Not one of my favorite, but it's probably one against who I have the best record.   
But he's always difficult player to play. You know, I'm happy to have won all those match, but it's always been difficult. You always have to find a way. He's serving well.   
But, again, I think today I played well. I was moving well, I was serving well, and finding the right things to do.   
 Q.  And do you follow the action at the ATP Cup currently? And do you think it's a bit unlucky that Switzerland isn't involved in the tournament this year?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure. Always for tennis. They had some great match. Today was Kyrgios against Tsitsipas. I watch a bit. It was a great match yesterday. And Novak is playing well.   
And, yeah, there is some good match from the first tournament of the year, so it's always nice to see that.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind when Chardy was having a little bit of advantage over you in the second set?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think it was just a break, one break. I was trying to be back, trying to make him play more, to be a bit more aggressive, to move well. And I think I start to play much better, much more aggressive.   
And, yeah, played well in general.   
 Q.  The first match of any season may be a little tentative. How do you feel now? It's back of your mind you can focus on the rest of the season, focus on the rest of the matches?  
STAN WAWRINKA: No, I think I'm focusing the same way every matches. For sure the first match is always a bit different.   
But, again, as I say, I've been practicing well. I arrive early here to be ready for the first match. Today I play well, so now I'm happy to play doubles tomorrow again and then the next match in singles.   
 Q.  Another year, first day of the new season. You've been on the tour for probably 17, 18 years now. How do you feel the game is evolving or has changed since you started the tour?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I think it's been improving physically. Also, the game in general, every player improving.   
I'm happy to be still playing. I'm happy to be still playing at good level. So I'm happy to be here for another year and hopefully a good one for me.   
 Q.  I'm just wondering whether you are in touch with people in Australia from the fraternity and elsewhere and if you know of the bush fire situation and what are your thoughts on that?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it's really sad. I've been looking what's happening like everybody. It's really sad to see what's happening there. It's a big disaster for the country, for everybody there.   
So hopefully it's going to go better soon.
