THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What's your mindset going into this tournament after winning the most recent Grand Slam?
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm happy to be back, like every player probably.  I think I'm work well in the off-season.  Started well in Brisbane.  I think my level is there.  I'm ready to start the tournament.  Excited to start the first Grand Slam of the year, first one against Klizan, a tough player that I played only a few years ago, but is a really dangerous player.
It's going to be interesting to see the first match.
Q. What is the most dangerous aspect when you play against a lefty?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, depends who you play.  For sure, if you play Rafa, if you play Klizan...
I think for me, I don't have really problem because he is a lefty player.  I'm quite confident with my backhand, so it depends all about me, the way I'm going to start, the way I'm going to play.
Q. Last year you started the season in India.  Now you move starting the season in Australia.  Is there a special reason to do that?
STAN WAWRINKA: No.  I've been playing India for nine years in a row.  I always enjoy there.  I always liked it there.
But I heard a lot of good things about Brisbane.  Roger played also.  He always told me was a great tournament.  I wanted to change a little bit to see some new city, some new tournament.  It's also good mentally.  So I took the decision to start here in Australia.
I think was a great week.  I really enjoy there, the city, the people at the tournament, the fans.  Was a lot of fans.  Think was a perfect start of the year.
Q. You said you wanted to change a bit.  Did you also change something in the preparation?  What was the special focus in this off-season for you?
STAN WAWRINKA: Didn't really change anything big.  I had good time.  I'm happy the way I did my off-season.  Was some good quality fitness-wise and tennis.  Keep improving, keep trying to find what I can improve in my game, keep pushing myself.
I'm really happy with the level I'm playing right now.  I know that if I can keep pushing during the year, keep doing the right thing, the big result will come.
Q. I saw you and Roger are already out of Davis Cup in the U.S.  Is that an easy decision for you, having to go to a different continent?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, schedule-wise it's really tough after one month in Australia to go back to States, to come back to play in Europe, then go back to States after.  It is never easy to not play Davis Cup, but with that schedule, was really tough for me to be available for the team.
Q. The local reaction to the draw, forecasting past round one?
STAN WAWRINKA: Not really, because it can be in the fourth round.  I'm not there yet.  He's not there yet neither.  For me it's all about focus, what we do the first round.  If I won the first round, then it's going to be the second round.
We all know how the draw is.  We all look the draw, full draw, we all see what can be the draw for after.  But at the end the focus, it's in the first match because if you don't pass it, you never get to that match.
Q. Last year you had Richard Krajicek for the grass court season.  Do you plan to have another coach?
STAN WAWRINKA: For the season or for the grass?
Q. The grass court season.
STAN WAWRINKA: Grass is really far away from where I am right now, so...  Not really, no.  I focus on everything we have before starting the first Grand Slam now.  That's the main focus.
