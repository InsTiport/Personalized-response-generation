  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   In light of Novak Djokovic coming here as defending champion, I'd like to ask you something about him.   We all saw he's not unbeatable this season.   You won against him in Melbourne.   He had ups and downs.   He also won a slam.   Still he's No.1 in the world.   Could you please tell me from a player's perspective what are the key components for him being so dominant, the No.1 in the world? 
    STAN WAWRINKA:   It's been few years that he's really, really, really strong, winning Grand Slam every year.   He's so consistent.   He's tough to beat.   He's winning Masters 1000s.   He's winning Grand Slams.   This year he had one. 
    We saw last year at the end of the year, it was amazing, he didn't lose from US Open to Australian Open.   His game is really strong.   That's why they're there, him, Roger, Rafa.   That's why they're stronger than us.   They're just playing better tennis. 

Q.   Does it mean that he hits the ball better than you?   I can't believe that's true, but...   The other thing is, regarding the schedule, what is the best schedule for a top tennis player?   Do you have to win the matches at the beginning of the year, in the middle, or at the end when other players are tired? 
    STAN WAWRINKA:   He's doing a few things better than us, that's for sure.   He has his game.   We all have a different game.   He's doing better than us this year again.   That's simple. 
    For schedule‑wise, I think we all different.   We all trying to find what is the best for us.   There is not one solution.   There is many because we are all different.   We all play a different game. 
    I don't know.   I'm looking for myself to make the best schedule possible for me, not to get injury, and to play well all the year.   It's that simple. 

Q.   How do you feel about your own game at the moment?   Last week disappointing loss in Japan.   Do you feel you're where you want to be heading into a very important part of the season for you, ending of course with the Davis Cup final?
    STAN WAWRINKA:   Really, really tough one last week.   Was really bad match for me and bad tournament.   But that's happen sometimes.   I'm trying to get at my best, trying to practice a lot to get my level there. 
    I'm feeling okay in general.   I need few matches to get some confidence.   I'm sure I'm going to have still some great result because there is so much to play still.   There is here, Basel, Paris, London, and Davis Cup final.   I just need to be ready for that. 

Q.   You looked happy when you came in here.   You've been smiling.   I guess you're happy about what's been going on for you this year.   I would call it a breakthrough.   What has been the happiest for you this year?
    STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure, I couldn't ask for more this year.   Winning Grand Slam, Masters 1000, being in the top five since January, making the final in Davis Cup.   Everything has been amazing. 
    For sure, if I have to pick one thing, it's the two big titles, in the Australian Open and Monte‑Carlo.   That was something really special for me. 

Q.   The Davis Cup schedule is really tight.   It's spread out in the season.   It's been a tight season already.   How do you fit Davis Cup into an already tight schedule?
    STAN WAWRINKA:   It's never easy.   But this year was okay.   I think we were lucky to play two ties at home.   Roger was there also.   We played first game in Serbia without Djokovic.   Was better for us. 
    This year has been amazing year.   We know we still have one tie to play, the final.   It's going to be in France on clay.   It's not going to be easy.   But we're going to try to do the right schedule to be ready for that weekend. 

Q.   For the Chinese audience, you are a hero.   What would you like to say to the Chinese audience in Shanghai?
    STAN WAWRINKA:   For me it's always a pleasure to come back here.   I really enjoy.   I had some great matches in the past few years here, always some good atmosphere on the center court here.   I hope I can really do a good tournament here this week. 

Q.   I don't think you've been past the quarterfinals here.   That was your best result here.   Why perhaps have you found it so hard in Shanghai?   Do you think with some of your form this year, you're really going to have a good shot at it? 
    STAN WAWRINKA:   I think in general I always played good here.   Last year I lost to Rafa.   I think the year before it was to Roger.   It was a good tournament last year, beating Raonic and Anderson. 
    This year I play good.   We'll see.   As I say, I need to get my first match win.   I need to be ready for a big battle, to play Simon, Garcia‑LÃ³pez.   Always some tricky matches. 
    It really depends of me, if I can reach my best game.   If I can play some good match, for sure I can go through and win some matches. 
    We'll see.   I'm more focused on the first one.
