 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Looks like it wrapped up right about midnight your time.  How do you feel your level of play was relative to your first match?  Are you pleased with how things turned out for you this evening?
 STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I think I start a little bit hesitating with my game.  First time I play against Tommy.  He's a great young player, and I didn't know exactly what to expect.  We never practice together.
 So I was a little bit looking too much what he was doing.  I think in general my fighting spirit was good.  I was trying to stay as much as possible on the match, and I'm happy with the victory.  For me it's that kind of match that I need right now in the last tournament of the year to build something for next year.
 Q. You have to turn right around and play Andrey Rublev tomorrow evening.  How will you approach that match?
 STAN WAWRINKA:   It's going to be interesting match.  Last time we play he beat me in Cincinnati.  He's playing so well this year.  He's winning so many matches, so many tournaments.  He's full confidence.  He's one of the best players this year.
 So it's going to be interesting to see my level against him.  It's going to be tough match, that's for sure.
