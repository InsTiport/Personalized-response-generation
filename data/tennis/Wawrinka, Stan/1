 7-5, 6-1, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk us through your match today and how you were feeling out there on the court.
 STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, tough match of course, five set, four hours.  Always a difficult battle against my opponent that we play few times in the past, always really tough match.  Today was the same.  Not the best level for me, but again, I was fighting, I had some chance to finish the match, I didn't finish, I hesitate a little bit when I had the match point and I lost it.
 Q. Can you talk us through a little bit of the final set tiebreaker.  You had some chances there, you were up 5-1, 6-1, three match points.  What happened in those last few points for you?
 STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I was playing well since the game at 5-6, serving back big shots really well, I was super focused the tiebreak at the end.
 Yeah, from 6-1 I start to hesitate a little bit the way I was playing.  I wanted to put the ball maybe too much in and I'm not going completely for my shot and that's when I start to miss a little bit and it helped him to come back in the match.  He was fighting well, he's a tough player, he's a good player and he deserved to win.
