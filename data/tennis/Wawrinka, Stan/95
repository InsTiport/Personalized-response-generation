S. WAWRINKA/J. Del Potro
7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I wonder what motivates you?  You won two slams, you are very rich, you'll never catch Federer, Nadal, Djokovic number of trophies, but anyone knows on a good day you beat them.  So frankly, I think that one more slam will not change much.  What makes you work?  What makes you...
STAN WAWRINKA: So what should I do?  (Smiling.)  I'm 31 years old.  What do you want me to do?  Just go to the beach?  Not do anything?  I don't know.  Did you ask that question to Rafa also or to Novak or to Andy?
I think I love my sport.  I enjoy to play tennis.  It's my passion.  I start when I was really young.  I have the chance to play in front of amazing crowd playing amazing match like tonight.  If you just look the match tonight you have the answer.  It's amazing feeling to be out there.
Q. What was the reason of the medical timeout?  Knee or...
STAN WAWRINKA: No, it was my adductor.  Was tightness, tension after a few points on my adductor, and I just wanted to check.  That was nothing else.
Q. Next match against Nishikori.  What kind of a match do you expect?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, it's going to be interesting for sure.  We played many times against each other.  He beat me a few years ago here quarterfinal five sets.  He beat me in Toronto; I beat him in Australia.  I saw him play today.  He was playing really well.
It's going to be tough match, for sure.  We will see also how I'm going to feel physically in two days to get ready for that.
But, yeah, I'm ready for a match against Kei.
Q. Did you see his match?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, a little bit, little bit.  He was playing well.
Q. What did you feel was the turning point tonight?  It was close and you seemed to take control.
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was important to stay there, to stay tough.  I knew before the match that against Juan Martin it's a tough challenge.  He's playing well.  He's strong mentally.  He doesn't give you much.
You know it's going to be painful physically and mentally to stay there, so I had to adapt a little bit my game.  It's not a player that I can really play always the way I want because he's so aggressive.
It was important to stay tough there.  I knew it will be difficult.  But I'm happy with the way I was fighting, with myself.  I'm happy with the way I find solution in the third set to take advantage.  I saw also that he was starting to go a little bit down.  I took advantage of that.
Q. You mentioned that it was amazing.  How was the crowd tonight?  They seemed to really get behind Del Potro.  Do you feel that there were Swiss fans for you, as well?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, it was amazing crowd, for sure.  For sure there was a lot of support for Juan Martin.  It's normal.  I expect that.  He's amazing champion.  He won here.  He got so unlucky with all the injury he had, and the way he's playing right now already, it's amazing.  Everybody is happy to see him back at that level.
