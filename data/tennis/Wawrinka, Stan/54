7-6, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A difficult loss today, but looking at the statistics of the match, still seemed like there were a lot of things that went well for you.  What would you say was working today?  Where were your opportunities?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, when you play Feli on grass, you know that it's gonna be a tough match anyway.  He's playing with confidence from last week, making the final.  We played each other a few times in the past.
Yeah, today was tough match.  Really sad to have lost it.  I think in general for first match on grass, the game wasn't that bad.  I was serving quite well.
But again, there is still a lot of work to do physically and on my tennis, on my game, to be in a better place on grass.
Q. Do you think it will change something for Wimbledon because you only played one match here and maybe you're not going into Wimbledon with many matches?
STAN WAWRINKA: For sure I would have loved to play more matches here.  That's a fact.  But I think it's also different.  It's gonna be Grand Slam.  I have now almost two weeks on the grass, more than the five days I already done, so I'm going to spend a lot of time on the practice court to be ready for the next one.
Q. You're not going to ask for a wildcard for...
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't think so.
Q. What's the impact Paul's made to your team this week?  What sort of tactics were you trying to employ today?  I saw you quite aggressive on some key points.
STAN WAWRINKA: I think we had some good talk all together, all the team.  I think we are already happy that he joined the team.  We just started only few days now.  He arrived Monday.  Only two days basically.
I think what's gonna be nice to see now the schedule we are gonna do on the practice court, and that's where we're really going to start to work all together.
Q. Is it a reason it was Paul you turned to?  Somebody gave you advice?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, I have known Paul since many, many years.  I spent some time with him when he was with Roger also, here in London.  The Olympics, especially.  So I knew him, and I'm sure he can help us to make me improve.
Q. You have been on the tour a long time.  Your game is at a mature state.  What do you think Paul can bring?  What do you need right now from him?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, I don't know what he can bring me.  That's gonna be the good surprise in the next few weeks, hopefully.
I have been on the tour for many, many years, for sure.  I have been working really, really well with Magnus, and we are really happy with the result we are doing and the work we are doing.
We just like to always try everything to improve.  I think he can give some advice, I think, with a different view.  He has experience from other players, also from top players, so he can probably help me to -- at the end of the day, at that level and that age, a small detail can make a big difference, and we are not looking to change big things.  We are just looking to keep improving and keep seeing the big picture for long term.
Q. A few days ago you said that thinking of Wimbledon is something very far from you now, and grass is your less successful surface.  Do you think you approach the grass season in a different way than the other seasons, like mentally?
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, I think we all approach the grass season in different way, because it's a shorter season during the year.
But again, the rest for me is the same.  I'm coming here to try to play my best tennis, coming here every year to improve.  I have the feeling that I'm improving, and I'm sure I can get some good results this year or in the next few years.  That's my goal, for sure.
Q. How are you feeling physically?  You had a big three-week spell on the clay.  Then you got a week off.  Are you feeling physically 100%?
STAN WAWRINKA: I was feeling good after Paris.  Tired.  Especially mentally, also.  But since two days I had some knee pain because of the change of the surface.  When you arrive on grass, you need to be careful.  I need to be careful to make sure it doesn't bother me too long.
Q. Which knee was it?
STAN WAWRINKA: Left.
Q. Have you ever had that in before previous years?
STAN WAWRINKA: I had that at the beginning of the year and end of last year, also.
Q. So you're not too worried about it?
STAN WAWRINKA: We never know.  At my age and after many years on the tour, you always need to be careful when you have a problem in your body.
But again, when you change surface like that from clay, after a long season on clay, you arrive on the grass, for sure we all going to have some small problem.
The most important is to take care of it, to make sure that it doesn't stay too long.
