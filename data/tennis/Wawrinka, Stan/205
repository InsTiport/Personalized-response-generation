 S. WAWRINKA/M. Cilic
  6‑0, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   For a start, it's a performance of choice?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, I practiced perfectly before.   I expected a more difficult or more complicated first round against him.   But I was able, as I said, to practice well before.   I felt good on the court.   
I know that physically if I feel good, then I am able to put a lot of pressure on the opponent.   
   
 Q.   Do you believe nowadays it's easier to go from hard courts to clay?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It depends for whom.   This is the first tournament on clay for many players, but for me it's easier because I grew up on that surface.   I can find my game easily.   
This doesn't guarantee any victory, but I know I don't need much time to adapt.   
   
 Q.   You were saying before that this tournament would allow you to test your game and see where you stand.   After the match, are you changing your goals for this tournament?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   No.   I just said that I knew if I was able to win the first round, then I could be dangerous for other players and do damage.   But, as I said, this is the first tournament on clay.   
Cilic was not feeling comfortable.   He was holding back on his shots.   He was not able to find a solution.   So this match is no guarantee of winning against Almagro.   He's an extremely good player on clay.   He had very good results lately.   But I know if I play well I can be a problem for many players.   
   
 Q.   After your victory in the Australian Open, your results were a bit up and down.   Was this the aftermath of the emotions in Melbourne?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I only played two tournaments, so it's a bit difficult to say if my results are up and down and if it's because of emotions.   
Many things did change in my career.   But losing to Dolgopolov, for example, is not anything to be ashamed of.   He's a very good player.   Now the clay court season is just starting and I'm always very pumped up for that particular moment of the year.   
I'm aware of my strengths, and I know that I must practice a lot and prepare well.   
   
 Q.   After this perfect match, do you think you can become the player Rafa and Djokovic are going to dread?   Will you be ready for the French Open?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, I know my qualities and my strengths.   I know that if I play well, I can beat many players.   But for the time being, I am not seeing that far ahead.   
After this match, I certainly cannot say that my clay court season is launched and that I'm going to beat Nadal.   What I have to do is give myself the means to improve.   
But I'm not putting myself under pressure to absolutely reach the semifinals here.   I know my position has changed and I'm seen as a favorite, but in my mind I am still the same as before and I am still a challenger.   I'm still preparing hard.   
   
 Q.   Which surface would you choose to play the best match of your life on?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I would choose the final of the Australian Open because that's where I won the title.   
   
 Q.   I mean what surface?   
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's tough for me to give you an answer because I grew up on clay.   As far as my results are concerned, I won the title on a hard court.   
   
 Q.   Tennis is a very mental game.   When you're able to win a match quickly, or to beat Djokovic the way you did, does that send a message to the other players?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's not important to me because I don't care about what the other players think.   I could win this match today in 45 minutes and I could lose tomorrow to Almagro.   
Nowadays when Novak is confident ‑ and Nadal, too ‑ they both are above the others.   The goal is not to win as fast as possible.   The goal is to find a solution to be able to win.   You can have a good victory winning in three sets.   
   
 Q.   What can you say about Davis Cup, Italy against Switzerland?  
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's going to be a good tie.   The semifinal in the Davis Cup is important for Switzerland.   There are going to be many people watching.   We are supposed to be the favorites, but we need to be fit six months from now, especially after the US Open.   
I believe a fast surface would be better, especially coming from the US Open.   Now indoors or outdoors wouldn't change anything anyway.
