THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   A pretty solid match.   Talk about how it went.   
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, was tough one.   Really happy with the victory, especially in three sets.   
I wasn't moving great.   I was a little bit soft in general.   But I'm happy to get through.   It's an important victory for me.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about going for the clay/grass double.   Never been in this position before.   How has the transition been?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   It's been good so far.   I always enjoy to play on grass.   One more week this year, so it's really helpful for me.   Had two weeks before coming here.   
It's been great, for sure.   It's faster.   You cannot slide.   You have to stay on the line a little bit more.   You can be more aggressive.   So far I'm enjoying playing on grass.   
   
 Q.   Obviously we've had Roger on top for so long.   Now you as well.   Why do you think there haven't been younger players from Switzerland coming up behind you?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   I don't know the answer.   If I do, we would have some different player.   
Switzerland has always been really lucky with so many big champion from every generation.   So it's been amazing for Swiss and Swiss tennis to have so many great players.  
   
 Q.   Is it something that you as players have noticed?  
STAN WAWRINKA:   Yeah, for sure, we notice.   We look who is going to come, who is coming after.   But so far it's not easy to find.
