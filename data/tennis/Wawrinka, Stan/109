6-2, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough conditions, tough match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, tough match.  For sure conditions are difficult for everybody since few days with the rain.  That's the same for everybody, but, yeah, for sure it's a tough match.   
Grass court, it's always a challenging surface for my game, for myself already.  I need quite a lot of practice to play my best game.  And I tried today with what I had, but I need more time I think to get my level there.   
 Q.  You were only a couple of points away from reaching the semis at Wimbledon last year.  Are you confident of getting to that level this time?  
STAN WAWRINKA: It's difficult to imagine going to semifinal.  But I know I can do it.  Again, as I say, it's been few years now that I find a way how to play my best tennis on the grass.  Every year it's been better and better.   
Last year Gasquet was playing great.  Lost in five sets.  Tough one to lose, but I did a great Wimbledon.  I think -- yeah, I think I'm positive to hopefully play well again this year, for sure.   
I wanted to play better here already, but I had only one day of practice I think was the Friday, and I know that with my game I always need more practice, more time on the grass to feel it a little bit better.   
Today Fernando was playing well, was playing aggressive.  When the grass is quite fast, you need to be the aggressive player.  He was better than me today.   
I still have doubles here.  Also, I can take in the same time all those days to practice well, to do a good schedule before Wimbledon.  I'm sure I will be ready.   
 Q.  What's your plans you have before Wimbledon?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I'm going to be first play doubles here.  Doesn't matter.  I'm staying here all the three weeks to practice here with my team.   
Magnus is going to come also.  So we are trying like last year to have some good days of practice.
