S. WAWRINKA/A. Seppi
4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What was the key to surviving?
STAN WAWRINKA: Fight, keep pushing, be a bit more aggressive when I could. Happy to get through in five sets. Always tough. Can go either way. But happy to find the way to get through this one.
Q. Your next match against John Isner. You played him four times. On tour a long time together. What do you do to prepare for that? You've played him once in the last eight years.
STAN WAWRINKA: Probably.
Tough match. We all know he is a very dangerous player, serving big. You don't get a lot of opportunity. You need to stay strong, be aggressive, try to make him play as much as possible. That's it. Stay positive all the match.
