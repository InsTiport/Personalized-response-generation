S. WAWRINKA/S. Stakhovsky
5-7, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You ran that close, didn't you?  A bit too close for comfort?
STAN WAWRINKA: No, no.  It's good for confidence but tough match first match.  I wasn't playing well at all.  I was playing not too great today.  I was struggling with the condition, with my game.  Quite fast condition.  Flying.
I was hesitating, always being behind, staying aggressive.  And it's tough to play especially against him who doesn't give you too much rhythm.
But it's a good win, great win for me.  Not playing well, still winning, still fighting, still finding a way, playing a little bit better at the end, trying to be the aggressive player on the court.
It's good to have a chance to play better tomorrow.
Q. How different was it to Marseilles?
STAN WAWRINKA: Oh, completely, completely the opposite, that's for sure.  I was expecting completely different.
But, yeah, I practiced two days here, yesterday in the shade, afternoon.  Even the night it's even different from the day.  It was flying more than what I expect.
Q. Did you expect it to be this tough?
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah.  You know, I play him in Marseilles.  I saved match point to beat him.  I expected a tough match, but I wasn't expecting to play that bad.
Q. Any thoughts on your next match?
STAN WAWRINKA: I will see now.  First we will see when I'm playing.  I will try to do some treatment, get ready for tomorrow.
But again, hopefully I can start to play a bit better because in practice was good.  In practice I was playing well.
So, you know, also need to win those matches to get the confidence back.  Hopefully tomorrow is going to be a good day.
Q. Do you know anything about your next opponent?  He's ranked 188, and he's having quite the tournament.  He's had two wins in quallies and one today.
STAN WAWRINKA: Honestly, no, I don't know much.  It's one of those players that I don't really know.
Normally I check.  I'm going to check tonight and tomorrow.  For sure I'm going to find how is he playing, what he's doing.
But before the match I was focusing on this match against Sergiy tonight.
Q. You mentioned treatment.  Could you elaborate on that.
STAN WAWRINKA: No, just classic massage, what you need to be ready for tomorrow.
