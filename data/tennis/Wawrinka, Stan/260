 S. WAWRINKA/R. Federer
  6-4, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What was the difference today?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Win (smiling).   
 Yeah, I do a great match, but is always difficult to play against a good friend. You're always different on court.   
 But today I think I was playing better. You know, it was his only first tournament. He came only two day before the tournament, so it's not easy to play great on clay court, to came only two days to practice. So I think it was the difference.   
  
  Q. What made you believe that you could beat him?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I need to believe in my game, you know. I knew I can play very well on clay court, and hard court, too.   
 You know, I think the last two tournaments, in Indian Wells and Miami, was good for me, even if I lost against Djokovic and Nadal. But it was always tough match, always 7-6, 7-6. But is good to stay work with the game. With those match, I knew I can play very well against the best player.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
  
  Q. You seemed to be up in the score during the whole match.   
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's had many opportunities and I won in two sets. Both of us were very tentative today and there were ups and downs in the match. I believe he hadn't found his rhythm on clay and he made many errors. I was very happy because I think I played my best match physically.   
  
  Q. You mean you had very good footwork?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Yes, because he always tries to break your rhythm and to mix it up a lot. I was there aggressive with my footwork and I was coming early on the ball.   
  
  Q. Is it one of your most beautiful victories?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It is maybe not the most spectacular tennis, but it's my most beautiful victory, yes.   
  
  Q. What did he say to you in the end?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He said, Good luck for the rest of the tournament.   
  
  Q. And what is your most spectacular win?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I don't know.   
  
  Q. Do you know Beck?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I know him a little bit. I haven't seen him here, but I know he's talented and he hits hard. He's a left-hander. I must be solid against him.   
  
  Q. Federer said that your game was better adapted to clay than his. What do you think?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It is on clay that I feel the strongest. I always feel happy when I come back on clay, although I can play well on other surfaces.   
  
  Q. What do you think about the conditions and the rain?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It's always tough because you never know at what time you're going to play. You always try to keep ready.   
  
  Q. In the end, was it tough mentally? Did you think about the fact you were winning against Federer?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It was tough, yes. But I tried not to rush and not to do stupid shots. I tried to play the way I played during the whole match.  
  
  Q. So you didn't think, It is Roger?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: Many things went through my mind. It is always a difficult tournament.   
  
  Q. Are you happy about this victory or do you think Federer can now be beaten?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: He can be beaten. But what is tough is to play against a friend. We have so many good memories when we won that gold medal. Anyway, I am very happy because tomorrow I'll be in the quarterfinals, and it is not because I beat Roger today that tomorrow's match will be easy.   
  
  Q. Do you want to do well in the French Open?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I am now concentrating on tomorrow's match. I know my opponent won against Gilles Simon, and it might be a tricky match. I can't be too happy today because I have to stay in the tournament.   
  
  Q. Are you happy you are in the quarters?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: No, I'm happy I beat Roger. I played two big matches, and I lost many opportunities, and I didn't win them. Today I was able to win.   
  
  Q. What about yesterday's match?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It was also a very special match. But, as I said, it's not because I won today against Roger that tomorrow I will win easily.   
  
  Q. What do you think the press is going to write tomorrow, is it going to be your victory or Federer's loss?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: I know they are negative (smiling).   
  
  Q. You had the opportunity of breaking him in the first game, but you missed an easy shot. Did you have doubts at that stage?  
 STANISLAS WAWRINKA: It was not easy because I had played a good game and missed that easy shot at the net. But I knew I would have other opportunities during the match.
