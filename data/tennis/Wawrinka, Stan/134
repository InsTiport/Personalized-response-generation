An interview with:   
STAN WAWRINKA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you sum up your year for us now please.  
STAN WAWRINKA: The year is amazing again.  I didn't expect to play that well, to be here tonight, honestly, being No. 4, winning one Grand Slam, semifinal again.  I couldn't expect more.   
I won two title for the first time in my career, one French Open title beating No. 1 player.  Did two semifinal, US Open, Australian Open.  Quarter Wimbledon.  I was quite consistent at the high level.  I beat so many top guys.   
The year, it was amazing year for sure for me.   
 Q.  You've beaten pretty much all the top players on hard courts and other surfaces, but not Roger away from clay.  What is it about his game that presents so many problems?  And were you tired at all from yesterday?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I never beat him on hard court, only on clay court.  There is many reason.  In the past maybe few matches that I could have beat him, but I was maybe a little bit too nervous.   
Last year I had the opportunity to take the match, but I didn't.  Don't know why.  In general, his game is tough for me, for my game.  I will say he has the perfect game against my game.  He's mixing a lot, he's serving well, he's putting a lot of pressure, playing so fast.   
If you look today, it's not that I play really bad.  I'm not tough enough mentally with myself, I'm not completely there.  But one, two point change the first set completely.   
I was break up.  I did two mistake going too quick on his forehand, passing, passing, the set is over.   
Not only he has the game that is the worst for me, if I look against the top guys, but also until two years I was 20 in the world, he was No. 1, beating everybody.  So it's a little bit normal.   
 Q.  Did you have a specific strategy today before the match, a possible different solution if the strategy didn't work?  And why did you insist attacking on the forehand of Roger many times?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, I have strategy to play against him.  I'm trying to be aggressive.  I'm trying to play my game.  Today was playing really fast, did a lot of serve and volley every time he could.  Again, it went really quick.   
I think, as I say, I wasn't tough enough mentally with myself, not completely enough to try to push him more.  Then it went fast.   
 Q.  And attacking the forehand many times?  
STAN WAWRINKA: I don't know.  Just came like that (smiling).   
 Q.  Obviously last year you were dashing off to the Davis Cup final.  What are your thoughts on this year's final?  Do you feel clay evens up the match a bit?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, for sure.  We'll see.  It's going to be interesting final for sure.  England are favorite for me, I think, with Murray on the team, with amazing doubles team there.  So it's going to be interesting to see what's going to happen.  Also how the Belgians will be ready with Goffin, how he's going to be there, how he is going to be ready or not, if he's going to play his best tennis or not.  He can be really dangerous, so we'll see.   
 Q.  What is your biggest target for next year?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Next year is really far for me right now.  Honestly, so far, I just lost the last match.  Again, disappointed with today.   
But great tournament, especially when I see the way I started here.  I still beat some top guys, Murray, Ferrer, losing to Roger in semifinals.   
It was a tough year, amazing year.  I'm quite tired.  I'm happy to take some rest.  I will not think yet about next year.
