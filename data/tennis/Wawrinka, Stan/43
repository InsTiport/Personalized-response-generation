S. WAWRINKA/N. Kyrgios   
1-6, 7-5, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough first set, obviously, there losing it 6-1.  But I guess how did you keep your head and how did you feel that your game prevailed?  Because Nick, obviously, having some issues with his body, but you seemed to stay the course with your tennis.  
STAN WAWRINKA: Yeah, it was a tough match as expected.  It's never easy to play against him.  He doesn't give you a lot of freedom.  He can serve big.  Games can go really quickly on his side like he did.  For sure he's struggling physically since in three weeks I saw.  So it's never easy.  He doesn't give you much freedom.   
For me, it was important to stay focused on myself, on my game.  I'm looking for match, trying to get some confidence from winning matches.  And for sure, especially against a player like that, it's not easy because he's serving big.  He doesn't give you a lot of opportunity, and that's it.   
I think after the first set I start moving better, being more aggressive on my serve, having those little step inside the courts a bit better to get more points for myself, and that make difference with me for my game.   
 Q.  First of all, you have no doubt that the physical issues he was encountering were genuine; and, secondly, did it appear to you as if Nick seemed to lose interest at some point in that match?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, for me, I was focused on myself at the end.  I'm looking for confidence.  I'm looking for matches.   
I'm grateful I got the wildcard to play directly in the main draw.  I knew it was going to be a tough match.  Winning 1-6, 7-5, 7-5, it's great for me.  Any victory is good to get more confidence.   
I'm happy with the way I'm practicing.  I'm really happy with the level and the way I'm moving on the practice court, and I need to find how to put it in the match.   
 Q.  How can you describe the last game when he served?  You managed to break him and win the match, but did he play a different way and how do you think that game sort unfolded?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Sorry?   
 Q.  How did that game go?  How did it come about when you got the break?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, I think all the first set he was serving really big first and second, the aces he put, but he was really going for it.   
Last game, I got a little bit more opportunity when he was a little bit down with the speed.  Gave me some second serve, and I got some a little bit more time to play the point.   
 Q.  With the serve clock, do you think there's going to be some players that don't care at all and others that are going to have trouble with it or is there enough time for everyone?  
STAN WAWRINKA: Well, I think it's really good to have this serve clock.  I think I already play with it in Washington.  I think it's great for everybody, the same for everybody.   
You have enough time because the clock starts after the umpire say the score.  So it's already give you for a few more seconds.  He can always also adapt if he see it's been a tough match and three hours and everything.   
In general, I think it's great for the player, for the crowd, for the TV.
