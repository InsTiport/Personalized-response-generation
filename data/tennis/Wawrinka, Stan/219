R. NADAL/S. Wawrinka
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You must feel like you earned a set off him by now surely. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   It's a strange feeling right now.   I need to be careful with what I'm going to say because at the end of the day I need to take the positive from the match. 
But I'm for sure really disappoint.   I had so many occasion.   I had the feeling that I couldn't change the match, I couldn't change the score.   I was playing the right tennis, but maybe did few mistake in the important point. 
But at the end of the day it's Rafa in front.   He's the No.1 player.   It's so tough to play him.   That's why he's so good, because even when you play good tennis, your best tennis, he's still there, still trying to find a way to win it. 

Q.   Could you explain what was the main reason of your complaints to the referee in the second set. 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I am sure you know. 
No, it's nothing personal against Rafa or against Toni.   We all know, players and umpire, that Toni is always trying to help Rafa.   That's normal.   That's part of the game.   But when it's too much, it's too much. 
Today I didn't agree with the umpire that he didn't tell him something or he didn't give him second warning just because it was Rafa.   We all see.   I was there.   Before every point, he was trying to coach him.   That just what happened. 
Again, it's nothing against Rafa or Toni.   That's in the rules.   Normally the umpire should have done something. 

Q.   We show you even coming to the net like Henman.   Do you think with the actual tennis it's possible to come to the net and surprise Rafa all the time or it's just few times?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   I am all the time.   I just think against him indoor I need to play aggressive.   I think I took my chance.   I try to come or to play as much as I can aggressive, to come few times to the net.   I think I won so many points, especially with the serve and volley, something like that. 
To accept to lose some point, you need to accept to take some passing.   But I think today was the right thing to do.   Even if I think I lost the match, I think I play a great match. 

Q.   You talked about losing the important points.   Is Rafa the toughest to play in those moments?   Is it the history that you've had against him that makes him so difficult or is it the intensity that he brings? 
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Well, as I said so many times, right now he's No.1 player in the world.   He's playing better tennis than me.   Since so many years, he won so many Grand Slam, so many important tournament. 
When it gets important in the match, for him it's just normal.   He's just still playing his best tennis or he's playing even better. 
For me today I think was really close, but I think I played the right tennis.   Even if I miss some shot on breakpoint or important point, like 5‑4 in the second set tiebreaker, I think was the right decision to go.   I decide to do something all the match, and I was trying to do it.   That's the main thing. 
Then, yeah, I don't know what else to say.   For sure so far I didn't won any sets against him.   But I need to still look on the positive side, you know.   I think today was my best match against him.   I think I'm still improving. 
I think this year was still amazing year for me.   I won so many close matches against maybe not Rafa, but the other players, so I need to accept sometimes to lose some matches like that.   I need to find a way how to change it, where I can improve. 

Q.   We don't know what's happening this evening, but it could well be that you play Ferrer on Friday as a direct elimination.   Can you take anything from today that makes you feel more confident against Ferrer than you have been before?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, I think there's a big chance‑‑ actually I'm pretty sure that I'm going to play, if I beat Ferrer, I'm going to play to make the semifinals.   It's all about me for the next one. 
But, yeah, from today, from two days ago, from all the year, I'm really positive and really happy with my level.   Again, I show today that I'm playing my best tennis, that I can really, really fight, really get closer from the No.1 player, and I can beat Tomas on that surface. 
I'm really confidence with myself.   I just know against a player like Ferrer, it's not only about myself, it's about the condition, about the day, and how you feel it. 

Q.   Rafa said he had to play aggressive at the end of the match against him.   Do you feel more pressure because you can feel he was being aggressive?   Do you feel you had to go more for your shots?
STANISLAS WAWRINKA:   Yeah, but I know that is what happen when I play Rafa.   When you get important, he try to take his forehand, try to take his advantage quickly in the point.   That's why he's so good because he's changing his game during the match.   That's why he's so tough.   That's the reason why I lose against him.   It's because he can always find a way how to win it.
