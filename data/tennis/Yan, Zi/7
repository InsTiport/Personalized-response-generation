 Q.  Have you ever had a performance like today before? 
 ZI YAN:  What? 

 Q.  Have you ever had a performance like today before?  Have you ever played this well and beaten? 
 ZI YAN:  No.  Today I am very relaxed to play, so every shot is very good.  Every shot is hit very relaxed, so the ball is going maybe a little bit fast. 

 Q.  Why are you so relaxed? 
 ZI YAN:  Because she is the top player.  So, I don't think I can win.  So I just going to the court and enjoy the match (smiling).

 Q.  And your ranking is fairly high, right?  Your ranking? 
 ZI YAN:  It's low (laughing).
