 Q. When did you find out that you were going to play Elena instead of Serena? 
 
 DOMINIQUE VAN ROOST: Exactly when I came back from my lunch at 12:30. I saw the coach
of Mary Pierce, and he said to me, "You're not playing against Serena," and I
started laughing. I said, "It's a bad joke," because I never expected her. I saw
her yesterday evening during the practice, so I didn't believe. I had to call the WTA to
find out actually I was not playing her, quite late, today.  
 
Q. Do you think that affected the way Elena played, not being prepared?
 
 DOMINIQUE VAN ROOST: I think you should ask her because I don't know how she was
prepared or how she reacted. 
 
Q. How do you think that affected you mentally in preparation for the match?
 
 DOMINIQUE VAN ROOST: Well, at that point, I thought: Now I have a good chance, a very
good chance to play a quarterfinal, better chance than if I had -- if I was going to play
Serena. But it's tough, because you don't know until the last minute, and you find out you
play somebody else; so, it's a different opportunity for you. You know that this match you
have to win it because it's somebody from my level, for the ranking. It was a completely
different situation in the afternoon, not that I was the outsider anymore; I was the one
who was supposed to win, of course. But, I mean, I felt good. I said that I have nothing
to lose. Even if I have to win this match, it's the best 16 players in the world competing
in this tournament. So I just went for it and I played very aggressive and I played very
well.
