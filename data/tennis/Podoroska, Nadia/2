 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I'm going to ask you a question that has absolutely nothing to do with your match.  I hope it's not a problem for you.  I think I know the answer you're going to give me.  The question is, can Diego Schwartzman beat Rafael Nadal again on clay?  Not do you think, but can he do it?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Yeah, of course he can.  Of course.  It is going to be more difficult to five sets, I think.  But, yeah, of course he can.
 Q. It is nice to see you smiling.  When you look at your two weeks at Roland Garros, what has made you smile the most?  What are you most proud of?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   I think it's that I'm enjoying my life, no?  I am enjoying what I am living.  A few weeks.  I'm happy.  Even the result today wasn't good for me, but I'm happy, too, yeah.
 Q. You have told us about the amazing journey you have been on for the last few years.  Do you think the way that you have played at Roland Garros could change your life?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   I don't think so.  No, of course is going to change my ranking, the tournaments that I'm going to play since now.  But not my life.
 I'm going to be the same person.  I'm going to try to improve my game, like I'm doing all the few years ago, no?
