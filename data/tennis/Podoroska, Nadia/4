 2-6, 6-2, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you just talk through today's match?  What was the key to getting that win?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Well, for me the key was just trying to be the more focused I can.  Today was very windy.  I didn't feel so good at court.  Start doing too many mistakes.
 But the key for me was trying to be positive and not think too much on that.
 Q. You dropped the first set and then were able to come back.  After losing the first set, what changes and adjustments did you make?  And then in the third set when it was still very tight, what were you telling yourself?  Because at that point there is a lot on the line.
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Yeah, well, at the end of the first set I start to moving better than at the beginning.  I think I was a little bit nervous.  I start to hit more my forehand, and then in the second set I think because of that she start to do more mistakes.
 Fortunately I could break her serve.  Then I start to feel a little bit better (smiling).
 Q. A few days ago you said you were kind of used to playing in front of few spectators.  So then I was wondering in this tournament this year, many top players are complaining about this condition.  Somebody said it's too cold, too windy, ball is too heavy.  Do you think it doesn't matter to me because you have enough experience of playing in these kind of tough situation, especially on the clay?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Yeah, for me it's are the same conditions for both players, so I try to not think on that.  I fortunately play too many matches in these conditions, so it's a little bit, I feel, comfortable (smiling).
 Q. So you don't care?  You are kind of used to playing this kind of windy conditions, heavy balls, rainy conditions?  You have many experience on playing under these kind of circumstances?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Not really.  I play too many matches here, and the conditions were quite same.  Before this tournament, I play like normal tournament.  Not with this condition, but in this tournament I try to adapt my game to these conditions.
 Q. What does it mean to you to make a quarterfinal at Roland Garros?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Well, for me it's like a dream.  Like I said the other days, I always dream being here, playing these kind of tournament, and for being my first time here is I am very happy.
 Q. Do you remember the first time that you maybe saw Roland Garros on TV?  Do you remember what match you were watching or what players you remember watching play here the first time you realized what Roland Garros was?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   I'm not sure if it was the first time that I saw Roland Garros, but I remember the final between Coria and Gaudio.  It was a very special final for all the Argentinians.  I remember that match.
 Q. Just looking ahead, obviously you still have more to go.  How are you doing physically?  Are you very, very tired from seven matches, or are you feeling fresh?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   No, no, I'm feeling fresh.  Fortunately I didn't play so long matches, and I am feeling very, very well.
 Q. I'm sorry to say that I don't know much about your background, your history of tennis.  Can you talk a little bit about how you started playing tennis?
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Yes, I started to play tennis when I was five years old.  I started because I want to.  No one in my family played before, but I think in Argentina we felt (speaking Spanish), I don't know how in English how you call that.  Too many Argentinian players were like in the top 100, tennis was a very famous sport, and I start because of that.  I say to my mom, I want to play tennis, and that's why I start (smiling).
 THE MODERATOR:   Can you say anything in English about your next match, Svitolina.
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Well, she's a great player.  She has a lot of experience.  But I will try to play my game like I'm doing during this match, so, yeah, I want to be there (smiling).
