 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Talk us through your match today and how you were feeling on the court.
 NADIA PODOROSKA:   Well, yeah, it was a tough day for me.  I lost first in singles and then in doubles.  I couldn't play my best tennis, my best game.  At the end of the doubles I started to feel a little bit better, but anyway, we lost.  We couldn't win the match, and yeah, it was a tough day.
