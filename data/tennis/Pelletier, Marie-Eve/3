6-0, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. What happened out there today?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: I played wonderful. I played a great match. I'm really happy with how it went (laughter). 
 No, it was very tough today. I think she played very well. I obviously didn't play my best game. I mostly didn't serve very good. Put me right away on the defense all the time because she was serving great. 
 Yeah, so she was just too good. 

 Q. Was being at home a factor, pressure, anything like that? 
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: No, I wasn't really nervous playing at home. I was actually pretty excited. I just think she's a tough player. You know, I don't play that many. I play some. But, you know, she's a high level. So if I don't play my best tennis, it's just hard to compete with her. 

 Q. How was it dealing with having your match canceled last night and having to play today?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: Yeah, it's not easy. For sure I went to bed quite late last night and got up early to get ready. But, I mean, it was the same for her. It's not an excuse or anything. 

 Q. Is it easier to feed off this crowd here in an evening match than a day match?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: Yeah. I just like the atmosphere. When you play at night, there's a certain something. It's not only a tennis match; it's a show. There's something more going on. It's not only tennis. 
 There's definitely a special atmosphere when you play at night. 

 Q. How does Aleksandra's win a couple weeks ago at Stanford give a boost to the Canadian players?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: Yeah. I think, for sure. Seeing Alex doing so well at this level make us think it's not so far. 

 Q. Where do you feel you are in you are career now?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: I think I'm in the middle of my career and I think, I don't know, I'm just still learning a lot about myself. Actually sometimes the experience is really helping me on a lot of things. I'm just really enjoying what I'm doing. Yeah, I still have a lot of things to accomplish and I want to accomplish them. So that's my motivation. 

 Q. You said Mexico next?
 MARIE-EVE PELLETIER: Yes, then Bronx. Hundred thousand in Mexico, then a challenger in Bronx, then the US Open.
