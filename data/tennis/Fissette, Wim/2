THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I think that Naomi looks really fit, even though she injured.  I want to ask you about her new trainer, fitness trainer, Yutaka.  So my understanding is he's kind of trainer who like to be close to not only with player but also coaches and athletic trainers.  What kind of element do you think he adds to Naomi's team and how close do you work with him regarding Naomi's progress of tennis?
WIM FISSETTE:   Yeah, first of all, I agree that Naomi is very fit even she's struggling a little bit with the injury.
But, I mean, one of our goals during the lockdown also and there were no tournaments, that something we said, like, we have the time, we have to make sure the player is in a better shape than before, that's necessary.  We have so much time, so we need to use this time also to solve some issues in the past, yeah.
So we were looking for a new fitness coach.  We all felt that Yutaka was the right person.  First of all, the knowledge he has.  Second, the experience working with Maria Sharapova and other top players in the past.  And the combination is great, because Yutaka also is, like, a former tennis player, not at the highest level but that's not necessary.  He understands the game very well and understands what's necessary.
For me to work on Naomi's game, it's really important to work very close to fitness coach, so we are really going in the same direction.  I really feel that since the start that we start working together, it was about 12 weeks ago, that we have been working really well.  Naomi has been very committed.
Outside of his work, he also brings a lot of discipline.  He's Japanese, so very structured, very well-disciplined, and Naomi enjoys the work.  So I'm very pleased with that.
Q. We have seen Naomi wearing a different mask every match, and she says she has seven masks, hoping to play seven matches.  How much do you think that is fueling her this tournament?  Because she did speak about the fact that the more she wins, the bigger her platform, the more she can keep sending her messages.  So how much do you think that is fueling her?
WIM FISSETTE:   It's definitely helping her and giving her even more energy.  I mean, she always has the motivation.  Of course she wants to go really far in this Grand Slam, and she wants to -- obviously she wants to win it.
But this is like an extra motivation, as you know.  It's a very important topic for her.  She did unbelievable big thing during the Cincinnati tournament, as you know.  We support her there, because we know, like, how important it is.
Again, it's very important to have big personalities like Naomi to make a change hopefully one day.  I think it's a great thing that she does.  For sure with wearing the masks, she wants to be role model, but also she knows that it has to go together with the role model on court.  So it's a good combination.  Role model off court; also great attitude on court.  That goes together.
So far it's working really well.  So I'm very proud of her.
Q. Curious what your sense is of not just Naomi but also other players and how they respond to there not being a crowd there.  We have seen a number of players who are ranked a little lower breaking through.  As we get to the later rounds and these players, some players are players who don't have experience on this big court in a way that Naomi does with 20,000 fans there, is it something of an equalizer or is it doesn't just matter, any player at that level just sort of puts out the atmosphere?
WIM FISSETTE:   I definitely think it's different.  If you never played on Ashe with full crowd and then have that moment that you go on court and you play someone like Naomi or you play someone like Serena, it's huge.  So not all the players react the same way to it.
And it could have influence, especially on the beginning of the match.  Could have negative effect, you're a bit overwhelmed.  But also, like, you can also feel the energy.  So it could have a very positive effect, like Wow, I have reached my goal, I'm here on Ashe, this is where I want to be.  Look at all the crowd.  I'm going to enjoy this moment.  I'm going to take the energy from the crowd.
So every person reacts a bit different and different on the situation.  But overall I feel like the attitude of the players is, like, they are as committed as they normally are.  You know, it's a Grand Slam.  It's no different in that way, it's not different than the normal Grand Slams with crowds.  You know, players want to win.  They want to win a Grand Slam.  They want to beat top players here.
So I don't feel the lack of, the fact that there is no crowd makes a big difference.  But I do feel that for the player, it's very tough just to have no access to the world, like to be in the little hotel room now for about three to four weeks already.  That's mentally tough.
And I do feel like this last week, the mental toughness is going to be a very important part, because it's, you know, just that little hotel room and then going to the court, it's mentally very heavy.
Yeah, that's for sure much more difficult than playing without a crowd.
