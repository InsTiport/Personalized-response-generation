Q.  Did you feel that you were always surrounded by breakpoints?  You served a 15-minute game, there were a couple of 9-minute games that kept going on and on.  Was that frustrating for you?

ALBERT COSTA:  No, it was not frustrating.  It was tough to play out there.  If you don't  -- and he was returning good.  He's a good player.  So it was tough for me.  I was trying to keep my serve all the time, but he was playing also very good, so that's...  I had some breakpoints also, so...

Q.  He said he doesn't like to play on clay, but what makes him so tough?

ALBERT COSTA:  Who? 

Q.  Nalbandian. 

ALBERT COSTA:  He says that he doesn't like to play on clay? 

Q.  No, he says he prefers grass and hard courts and indoors. 

ALBERT COSTA:  That's good (laughter).  That's good for him, very good for him.  I think he's very good player everywhere, so...

Q.  What's the toughest part of his game?

ALBERT COSTA:  Well, he's so constant.  He's returning very good.  Backhand, one of the best of the world, for sure.  It's tough to make him winners.  His mobility, he's very fast on the court. 

Q.  You said I think yesterday that you had regained your motivation.  Is this a good tournament for you, you think? 

ALBERT COSTA:  Well, for me, for me it's a good tournament.  I was not winning matches, and now I played semis in a Masters Series so I'm happy.  I'm happy, and I'm going to try to keep going and playing Hamburg 100 percent.  I feel fit, I feel okay, so now I just need to try to win more matches to be in Roland Garros with more confidence as possible.
