D. FERRER/L. Dlouhy
  6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Here are the champions. We'll take questions for the team. 

 Q. A question for the team. Last year you won without Rafa. What is the difference when Rafa is on the team or not on the team? And, Rafa, I don't want to say something more about Madrid, but it's very strange that a tournament in Spain makes problems for yourself. Can you do something about it? Do you think it's normal? 
 RAFAEL NADAL: (Through translation.) I've had no problem whatsoever with Madrid. Some of my greatest satisfactions have been winning in indoor tournaments. It's a pleasure for me to play in Madrid. 
 Last year wasn't a problem with the tournament of the Madrid, but rather a problem I got there with a problem with my knee. 

 Q. Albert, where do you think the Spanish team from last year and this year is going to sit in the history of Davis Cup when people look back at it? 
 CAPTAIN COSTA: Well, I think it's gonna be in a very high position because to win two times, I don't know how many countries they did it. You know how many countries? 

 Q. Four. 
 CAPTAIN COSTA: Well, we are in this four pole position, so I think we are in a very good position.
