Q. When did they call you? Where did they get you?

ALBERT COSTA: Well, they called me yesterday in the afternoon when the match of Agassi
finish. I was at home with the family. I was resting. I was being there, staying there,
enjoying and practicing, but not too much, only physical.

Q. How long did it take for you to decide to fly over here?

ALBERT COSTA: When they asked me, I said, "Yes, I'm coming."

Q. Were you in Barcelona?

ALBERT COSTA: Yeah.

Q. Is it going to be easy playing Corretja tomorrow?

ALBERT COSTA: Yes.

Q. He has to win to qualify. What is your motivation?

ALBERT COSTA: Well, for me, I have 90 points. For me, that's good. I have a lot of
money, I think for me. I don't know, I have motivations. I am a professional of this. You
know, you have to win every match and to try, and that's it. I'm feeling okay. I mean, I'm
in the World Championship. I have my chances, no? I want to play good here and to make a
good result.

Q. Do you think they will forgive you in Spain if you beat Corretja tomorrow?

ALBERT COSTA: I don't know. I think they have to understand. I am a professional. For
me is a big surprise, a big chance for me to play here with all the better players in the
world. If I beat one of them, if I beat Corretja, you never know. I have to be a
professional, try to win this match. For me it's important also.

Q. Do you have any explanation for why you do so badly indoors?

ALBERT COSTA: Well, I think I'm not doing so badly. I'm trying to learn. I think when I
won the first match, I'm going to win a lot more.
