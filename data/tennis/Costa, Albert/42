Q.  Couldn't have been a tighter match.  What feelings did you have when you walked to the net and it was over?  What were the comments?  
 
ALBERT COSTA:  When?  
 

Q.  After match point. 
 
ALBERT COSTA:  No, no.  We didn't talk.  I say, "Good luck for tomorrow."  That's it.  He played an unbelievable match.  I played also.  But that's tennis.  These things can happen.  
 

Q.  Even though you lost, did you feel that the crowd never was more into a match?  I think they gave almost standing ovation in the end.  Does it mean anything to you that you had a terrific match?
 
ALBERT COSTA:  Yeah.  I think that the people was enjoying the match.  It was a three-hour match.  We played like bull outside.  I think that's good for the people, better than see other kind of playing.
