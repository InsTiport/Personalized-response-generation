Q.  The way Kuerten is playing, how would you give Kafelnikov a shot against him?

ALBERT COSTA:  Every match is a different match.  I think Kuerten is playing very good.  Kafelnikov is also a dangerous player.  I think Kafelnikov have some chances.  I don't know.  For me the favorite is Kuerten.  But still I think Kafelnikov is a great player also.  Every match is different.
