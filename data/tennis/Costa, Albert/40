 Q. Albert, you must be pretty pleased with that performance, 6-3, 6-2, pretty
convincing? 
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Well, is pretty convincing that it was very tough in the match and it's
-- the result is clear. No 6-3, 6-2, but I had to play very good and take my chances, you
know, because he was fighting a lot and for me was not so easy. 
 
Q. So you're into your second quarterfinal in the Masters Series, one in Monte Carlo a
few weeks ago, you're obviously pleased with the way you're playing on clay this season?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Yes, I'm pleased the way I'm playing right here in Rome because I feel
very confident and I'm trying to keep my level high. And I know that tomorrow I have very
tough match against Kuerten, because the way he plays. But tomorrow I have no pressure, I
have to try to play my best tennis and that's it. 
 
Q. Do you feel the pressure will be on him, being defending champion, and perhaps not
as much pressure on yourself?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: It's always a little pressure when you have to defend a title, but I
think he is a great player and for the moment I think he is not feeling pressure. 
 
Q. Have you played him before on clay?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Yeah, I think I played three times and I beat him just once. He beat me
twice and I won just one time. 
 
Q. He has advantage; he will not play today. Do you think it's advantage for Kuerten?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Yes, I think Gustavo today didn't play, but I played two very good sets.
So Gustavo didn't play today, but I play two great sets, and it was not so hot. So I make
a good jump today and for tomorrow I'm going to be very fit.
