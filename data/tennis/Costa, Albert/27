Q.  We always talk about the heat here in Australia.  How did that compare as a welcome to day one Australian Open in terms of the conditions?

ALBERT COSTA:  Yeah, it's a good welcome for the skin.  So it was really tough.  It was really  -- also very windy, so the conditions wasn't that good.  But, you know, to win that match is important for me.  First rounds are always very difficult - very, very difficult.
