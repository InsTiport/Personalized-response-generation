 MIKI SINGH: First question are Albert. 
 
Q. At one point Pete had 18 consecutive points on his service. Has that ever happened
to you before?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: I don't think so. 
 
Q. What was that like?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Well, I think he was serving really good. I was trying all the time, but
when he serves well, you cannot do anything. 
 
Q. What happened when you did get that one break?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: When he make me a break? 
 
Q. No. When you finally broke him.
 
 ALBERT COSTA: It was so late, 5-1, 5-2. I think it was so late. But I was trying all
the time to broke him, but when he serve well you -- if you only can touch the ball. 
 
Q. His serve is not the fastest on the Tour it's like 121, 122. What does it do that's
so hard to --
 
 ALBERT COSTA: It's not the fastest, but it's the best one, no. It's not the fastest,
but it's always -- he has a lot of confidence with his serve. And he is serving all the
time in the big points, they make big serves. 
 
Q. When you say it's the best one. In what way? Is it his placement, and what else? 
 
 ALBERT COSTA: It's because his service -- normally he never make a mistake with his
serve. He has all -- he has fast serves and then big serves, and you never know how he's
going to serve. And that's the most important thing. You are expecting all the time, you
never know. And other people are serving so fast and so hard, but the you can -- sometime
you know. 
 
Q. Did you have confidence going into this match that you might be able to beat him?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Confidence? I knew I had to play the match. I think I knew the match is
going to be very difficult for me, but I have to play the match and try to do my best. And
that's it. I cannot -- of course, I'm thinking it's very difficult, but I have to play the
match and I have to try to beat him. 
 
Q. (Inaudible.)
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Yeah. 
 
Q. Did you play better that day or did he play better today?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: Both things. 
 
Q. Albert, how well is he playing right now?
 
 ALBERT COSTA: I think now he's playing really good. He's serving very good and he's
returning good. Now he's playing really, really good for me. He is No. 1, no.
