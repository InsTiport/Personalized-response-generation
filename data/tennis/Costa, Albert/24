Q.  It looked like a pretty tricky match on paper, Nikolay having won in Estoril.  It was not that tricky in the end? 
 
ALBERT COSTA:  Well, I think today it was so difficult to play outside because it's unbelievable windy.  I had a lot of respect, because he was  -- he just won a tournament two days ago, so he should be playing very good.  So I was standing in the court and with a lot of respect, but knowing also that I was the favorite.  So I think today I did okay match because the conditions are so difficult, and I start calm on the court and trying to play every point in the right way.  
 
Q.  How does it feel to be back on clay, knowing that you're the French Open champion and there's a lot of expectation on you and maybe pressure as well? 
 
ALBERT COSTA:  Well, I think  -- I'm not feeling any pressure.  I just want to  -- I know I'm playing good tennis, and I have five tournaments to play.  I think I'm playing good, I mean, at the moment.  I was playing also good in hard courts.  We just won the Davis Cup.  I'm feeling very, very good, strong.  So for the moment I'm feeling very confident.
