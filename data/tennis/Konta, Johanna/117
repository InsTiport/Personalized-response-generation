An interview with:   
JOHANNA KONTA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You've won Stanford.  How do you feel physically after quite a difficult match today?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I feel pretty good.  I think it's really important for me to just really take things one day at a time.   
I knew coming into the event, after doing well in Stanford, that I wasn't going to have much time to adjust to the conditions.  So I'm doing the best I can.   
I'm really happy I've given myself another opportunity to play here.   
 Q.  Do you remember where you were a year ago to this day?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Not to this day, but I know what you're referring to.  I was in Granby.   
 Q.  Have you understood the type of journey you've had over the last year to go from a challenger in Granby to a Grand Slam semifinal, winning Stanford, entering the bigger tournaments?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, from the outside it looks much more remarkable than for me.  I am living it every single day so it's very much a progression, a process for me.   
I'm very grateful and humbled by the experiences that I've had in a relatively short amount of time.  I'm not blind to the fact that I've had some really good results this year.  I feel very lucky that my body is healthy and I'm able to play as much as I want to.   
I definitely don't undervalue my experiences in those challengers, really doing my time and coming through them, because I wouldn't be here now if I hadn't been able to do what I did then.   
 Q.  What do you think that run of challengers at Granby and Vancouver did for you back then?  
JOHANNA KONTA: It wasn't just those specific challengers.  There was a whole other part of the season before that as well.   
It was about feeling myself, that I was able to play a lot of matches in succession, and physically and mentally keep fit throughout that, really see how well I could pull up the next day and kind of keep pushing through also when you're tired.   
Quite frankly, you want to be in those situations where you are playing a lot back-to-back because it does mean you are excelling in your sport.   
 Q.  You'll be playing in Rio, the Olympic Games.  The first time for you.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes.   
 Q.  How much forward are you looking to it?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes, it's my first Olympic Games, so there's a lot of excitement because of that.  I've been told so many times that it's completely different to any other tour event, any other event I play during the year.   
I'm really going in not sure what to expect, but really looking forward to mostly representing my country and also to be part of such a historic event.  Yeah, it's pretty incredible.   
Yeah, I'm also looking forward to seeing what the Olympic Village is like, seeing all the different athletes.  It's so one of a kind, I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Have you asked Heather, Laura or anybody about it, because they played in London?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I did speak briefly to them and also to the support staff who were involved in London.  But the only trickiness with London was that it was at Wimbledon, at the venue, and also it was a home Games.   
They've prepared me that it's probably not going to be like that because I think it was very much a real spotlight on the British players because of being a home Olympics.   
I'm sure it will differ in some ways.  But in terms of grandeur, in terms of format, yeah, I'm sure there will be a lot of similarities.   
 Q.  Are you entered only in singles, or doubles and mixed?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I'm entered in singles and doubles, and mixed is decided on-site.   
 Q.  Who would you play with in mixed?  
JOHANNA KONTA: We'll see when we get there.   
 Q.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are coached by Louis Cayer?  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, but he used to help me a few years ago.  I'm still very close to him.  He's a good friend.   
 Q.  What has he meant for you in your development?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, he worked with me quite a number of years ago now.  But he's one of the few good people that I still have in my life.  I consider him a friend.  Yeah, no, he's a great person.  He only added positive things for me.
