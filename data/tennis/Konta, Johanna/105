P. KVITOVA/J. Konta
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What do you think was the difference today?
JOHANNA KONTA: I thought she played a consistently very good match.  I think the couple opportunities I did have, I don't think I did much wrong in them.  I think she actually played well in those times.  It was a constant battle for me to try to create opportunities.  I didn't get the chance to really take any.
But I think the majority of that was her credit and the way she consistently played throughout the match.
Q. Making the quarterfinals again here, is there something about the court conditions or the part of the season or something that you think kind of plays into being able to get good results in Wuhan?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I'm very happy I was able to make it to the quarterfinals here again.  We'll see how next year goes and the years after.  But I do enjoy playing here.  I do think it's a wonderful event.  The organization does try very hard to put on a great tournament.  I do think they succeed at that.
Yeah, I'm just enjoying my time here.  Yeah, on to the next one now.
Q. Disappointing to lose.  What do you take out of this week to build on for next week?  A lot of work next week and a lot left in the season.
JOHANNA KONTA: There is a fair lot of tennis to still be played.  I'm first of all happy that I stayed healthy this week.  Again, I played a number of good matches.  So I have some good tennis under my belt going into Beijing.
But, yeah, just I guess going to have a chat with my coach about this match and the week in general, basically close this week off and then just get ready for the next one.
Q. Petra had a long and difficult match yesterday.  Were you thinking before the match that she would be more tired?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  I think it's been shown time and time again that one long match the day before doesn't necessarily mean they will come out not being able to hit the ball.  Everyone at this level has got a base level of fitness.  Everybody works their butt off to be able to deal with matches like Petra had yesterday on a back-to-back basis.
I think it's just all credit to her, the athlete and the player that she is, yeah, that she recovered the way she did.
Q. She's a player that can have lots of ups and downs.  When she's on like she was tonight, what is the toughest against her?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think because she's such a clean striker of the ball, her priority is always to get the upper hand in the point as soon as possible.  She has such a clean strike and such a heavy ball, it's very difficult to, I guess, really get her off balance or really try to have a say in the point.
Yeah, basically sometimes you're just going along for the ride (laughter).
Q. Different players have different perspectives on this section of the season.  Some of them see it as a building block to Australia already.  Some see it as, I just need to cross the finish line and get the season over with.  How do you see these last few weeks of the season?
JOHANNA KONTA: I definitely do think all the players actually probably have a bit of both with that.  I mean, for me personally, I try to take every week and every match that I play as just a building to not necessarily the next tournament but generally how I want to be as a player and as a competitor.  That's a continuous process no matter where I am in the season.
But I think, like everybody else, everybody has a lot of tennis under their belt.  It's been a long season with the Olympics thrown in the mix as well.  But I'm healthy.  That's the main priority.  I'm enjoying playing.  Yeah, so I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts, the season.
Q. With the ranking right now, you will end your season in Zhuhai.  Are you still fighting for Singapore?
JOHANNA KONTA: I'm not thinking of either.  I'm just competing in the events that I'm in at the moment.  This week I was just here in Wuhan.  I'm not thinking about what will come.  A lot of those things are actually not all under my control.  It also depends on how other players do.  There's not much point for me to really look at it.
So now I'm going to be in Beijing and I'm going to try to do the best that I can in Beijing.
Q. You're now maybe the No. 1 female tennis player in the UK.  Next year you will be starting with the highest ranking of your career.  Do you see it as a pressure for yourself or is it motivation for you to play next year and the rest of your career?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I mean, in terms of rankings, rankings come and go.  I don't play tennis for my ranking.  I play it because I love the sport and I want to be the best that I can be at it.
I really am looking forward to next season as well.  I think it will bring different challenges that I faced this year.  It will just be another opportunity for me to become that much more complete.
Yeah, quite honestly, I haven't thought of next year yet or next season.  I can't really say much more.
