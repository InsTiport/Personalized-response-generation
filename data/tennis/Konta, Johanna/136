  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. That was such a good fight from your side, and Venus too. What is the dominating feeling? Disappointment? Or maybe satisfied because it was a really good level?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Exhaustion. That's the overwhelming feeling right now (laughter).   
It was an incredibly physical match. She did an unbelievable job at turning it around in the third set. I definitely felt that she won that, and deservedly so. I think she played an incredible match and at a very high level.   
I just feel very fortunate that I got to share the court with her.   
   
 Q. You said you grew up watching her play tennis. Was it weird to be on the same court at times?  
JOHANNA KONTA: No. Once you get on court, that stuff gets put aside. Yeah, I went on court to win and to do my best. I did give my best. I gave my all today. It just wasn't enough. Yeah, I lost to a pretty incredible champion.   
   
 Q. Can you talk about the game, trying to serve out the match. Do you think that was an instance where nerves got the best of you? Do you think she stepped up and played a particularly good return game?   
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't think there's ever such a thing at serving it out against Venus. I think you much rather return against her sometimes.   
But, no, I definitely didn't feel like I lost it, to be honest. I really felt that she put a lot of pressure on me through her returns the whole match, every single time.   
Even when I kind of got into the point, she has such good length and weight of shot, yeah, I really just kind of kept my head down and tried to run.   
   
 Q. It looked like she played some of her best defense in that last few games.   
JOHANNA KONTA: Oh, definitely, yeah.   
   
 Q. Just talk about that a little bit. Were you pretty surprised after such a lengthy, physical match? Looked like it was difficult to hit through her.   
JOHANNA KONTA: Surprised, no. Frustrated, obviously. I definitely was working overtime trying to win a point. Yeah, no, I think she did incredibly well. She definitely wanted to win that match, like you would think so.   
But, yeah, no, I'm really satisfied with my effort this week. You know, I've got a lot of things to take home with me and to obviously improve on as well. There's some things I'd like to do better. But as a whole, I played, I felt, quite a highâ€‘level match today against an incredible champion.   
So, yeah, no, I'm going to go to bed sleeping all right tonight.  
   
 Q. What are the rest of your plans for the year? You're not in Beijing quallies. Are you headed back? Will you stay here and play tournaments in Asia?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I'm going to be heading home. I decided to withdraw from Beijing just because of the way it would have worked out. Now that I lost, I would have had to already fly tomorrow and play tomorrow. I didn't think that would be the best thing for my body. I decided just to play this one and I'm going home.   
Linz, Luxembourg, I'm in quallies for both, and then hopefully the 100 K in France.   
   
 Q. From the very beginning, did you have a hunch or feeling that tonight was going to be quite a long battle?   
JOHANNA KONTA: I think anyone who goes up against Venus or, to be honest, any player at this tournament, and expects an easy or a quick one, is quite crazy.   
I was going into the match knowing that I would have to fight my hardest and to honestly stay out there as long as possible. I managed to stay out there quite long, so that's good. That's a win.   
But, yeah, no, I'm really happy about the match I played today. It was a very enjoyable match to be a part of. Like I said, it was a privilege to share the court with her, such a wonderful arena, as well. It's a beautiful court here.   
There were quite great acoustics in there, so you could really hear the crowd. Yeah, no, it was a pleasure to be out there.   
   
 Q. Do you take anything special out of this week about your game, where you're at, the next step?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't take anything particular out of it. I mean, obviously I take a lot of confidence from the fact that I played six matches in a row and I'm in good health. Obviously besides needing a good night's sleep, I'm in good health. Honestly, that's probably the biggest positive: to be able to play at such a high level against some of the best players in the world and to keep repeating that day in and day out. I think that's probably the biggest confidence boost I could hope for.   
Otherwise I've got a lot to work on. You know, I'm definitely not satisfied with everything, but I'm content with where I am right now. Just really looking forward to the next chance I get to step out onto the court for practice or for a match and, yeah, just keep trying.  
   
 Q. After these results, both in New York and now here, everything you did over the summer, is it frustrating at all to have to go back and play quallies every week?  
JOHANNA KONTA: To be honest, it would be silly of me to feel either way because it's just the way it is. That's absolutely fine. I'm going to enjoy it for what it is. I've only got a maximum of three tournaments left for the rest of the year. So the more matches I can play, the more opportunities I have to keep improving and to keep working on the things I want to get better at.   
   
 Q. How do you rate your game indoors as we look forward to the European indoor season, as it were? You're comfortable on an indoor court? You like the speed?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I definitely prefer outdoors, I do. But I think it's a great challenge for me. I'm all about putting myself in situations that are uncomfortable and making myself comfortable in them.   
Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to the challenge and looking forward to the difficulties that will arise with that and try to deal with it as best as possible.
