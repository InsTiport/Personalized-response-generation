J. KONTA/S. Cirstea   
6-2, 6-2   
 Q.  A very dangerous opponent, but you were on fire out there.  Give us your thoughts on the match.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Like you said, Sorana's a very dangerous player.  She's beaten some great players over the years.   
I knew going into the match that it was going to be tough.  She's already played a couple of matches here in Eastbourne.  She was coming in with a bit more match routine than I was.   
I was just really looking forward to coming back on this court and playing in front of all of you.  I will get to come back in a little bit of time.  Overall I'm really happy with the way I was just able to maintain my level through the match.   
 Q.  You just mentioned you have had a lot of success on this court in the past.  How special is it for you to be playing here in your hometown in front of your home crowd and home fans here?  
JOHANNA KONTA: It's pretty special to me.  I feel at home here.  It's something that not many players get to experience, and I get to do that every year.  I feel very, very fortunate and hopefully will be playing in front of you lot the whole week.   
 Q.  Have you been able to enjoy your mum's home cooking this week?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I definitely have.  I've been enjoying staying at home and sleeping in my own bed.   
 Q.  As you mentioned, you will be up against the French Open champion, Ostapenko.  What are your thoughts about facing her?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I played her once before earlier this year actually during Fed Cup.  That was on indoor hard.  We are playing on a different surface here.  Yeah, she's obviously coming in with a lot of confidence, a lot of match routine.   
What she's achieved is absolutely incredible, so I'm looking forward to playing against a Grand Slam champion and looking forward to competing.
