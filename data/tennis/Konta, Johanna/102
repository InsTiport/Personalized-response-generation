6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your thoughts?  You appeared to come up against a pretty tireless opponent out there today.
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, Agnieszka, she was definitely a woman on a mission.  Whenever I felt I could have got a little bit of a foothold in the match, she took it away from me.  She played a consistently consistent match, to be honest.  She hardly missed a ball.
When she is so consistent and she moves the ball around as well as that, she's very, very difficult to beat.  So all credit to her.
I think she was the better player today.  I think that came through in the result.  But I definitely fought till the very end.  I tried to exhaust all avenues possible.
Yeah, it just didn't go my way.  But, again, a lot of good things to take from this week.
Q. This is your first premier event final, so how do you feel about that?  What can you learn from this match?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I had a lot of very amazing memories here at the China Open.  It's definitely one event I will remember for a very, very long time.  Obviously I definitely would have loved to come out on top today, but it just wasn't in the cards for me.
Yeah, no, I think all in all I kept improving every match that I played.  I really tried to build on the previous one constantly.
I think equally today I will have a lot of things that I can build on and improve on, so I'm really looking forward to that.  Hopefully I will be able to create many more opportunities like this.
Q. You seemed to be moving up to the net quite a bit today, more than I think we've seen you do this week.  Was that a plan, a strategy going in?
JOHANNA KONTA: I definitely always look to be as offensive as possible.  But against a player like Agnieszka, who is basically a human wall, you definitely do try to look to get the upper hand in any way possible.  I felt I was going to try on that avenue.
But, yeah, no, I think it was the right way for me to play today.  I just came up against a very in-form Agnieszka.
Q. Do you recall ever playing in as chilly conditions as that?
JOHANNA KONTA: Actually not for a little while, I guess.  With the way our tour is, we do generally follow the sun.  It has been quite chilly for the past few days.  Definitely a lot chillier for the people watching than us two playing.  I can't be too negative about it.
Q. Do the cold conditions mean the conditions are slower?
JOHANNA KONTA: As a general rule of thumb, yeah.  The balls will be a little bit harder, obviously the strings as well.  The conditions do change according to the temperature.
But the good thing was that both of us had actually played in similar temperatures yesterday, so not much had changed since then.
Q. What is your mindset going to be like for the next couple weeks as you look to secure that spot for Singapore?
JOHANNA KONTA: Exactly the same as it has been so far.  I'm heading to Hong Kong tomorrow morning for my next event, looking to do the best that I can there.
Again, the way that Singapore works, not all of it's under my control.  It also depends on how the other players do.  From what I'm understanding and hearing, quite a lot of us are very close together.  I think it will be what it will be once the deadline comes.
Yeah, just right now taking all that I can from this event and then preparing for my next one, giving my best there, keep continuing like that.
