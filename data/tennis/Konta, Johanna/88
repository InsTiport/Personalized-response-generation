3-6, 7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  To be able to get out of that situation must be very pleasing.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I guess I really didn't think too much of what the scoreline was.  I think it was important for me to keep fighting and to keep -- yeah, to stay very present.   
I think there wasn't that much momentum at that point in that match necessarily in her corner, so I think I also just stayed very aware that although she was serving for the match there, there was still -- I was still very much in there.  I really tried to just fight every single point and stay very present.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: That would be -- if we play each other again there and when we play, it will be a different setting and different scenario.  So you got to take it again from 50/50 when you go out on court.   
This, I don't think, will have Vegas too much of an effect on there.  Also will be a different surface, different continent, and just different emotions going through there.   
But for a little bit there I thought felt like Fed Cup.  There was a lot of chanting going on, so...   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, quite a few, so I'm sure we'll just be expecting a lot more of that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, whoever I'm playing I'm going to have a battle on my hands, that's for sure.  I've obviously played Venus a few times and Angie, so I think they're going to have a tough battle tonight.   
Yeah, looking forward to playing either of them.  I think either will be a great opportunity for different reasons.  Yeah, we get to have a night session tomorrow.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Um, I think we had a good game plan going into the match.  Also, I had played her once previously, so I think that was also helpful for me, just so that I have felt her ball before.   
But otherwise it was also a little bit thinking on my feet as well.  Certain things that can change within a match, regardless of the game plan.  I think I did a good job of just adapting, yeah, and fighting.   
 Q.  I guess you're quite satisfied with all the hard work that goes in all year to get you so fit.  Looked like you outlasted her a bit towards the end.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Um, well, I think everyone on tour is working physically to be able to sustain and maintain being obviously in a tournament to the latter stages, and also for these sorts of conditions.  It was very important to stay hydrated out there.  I had to go off court after the second set to change clothes.  They weighed about five kilos worth of sweat.  Quite gross.  (Laughter.)   
But, yeah, taking care of the little things.  Also I think trusting in your physical ability.  That's a big thing, trusting that you've done the work and not to stress on whether you can or cannot stay out there.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, obviously I went Love-40 up in that first game and then she came through that game, so, again, I don't think there was too -- there was still quite a lot of back and forth there.   
I think the momentum shift started happening as obviously we started getting to 2-1, 2-All, and then 3-2.  I think that's when it more started shifting a bit.   
The thing is with momentum it can change very quickly.  It's not like you have the momentum and that's, you're running with it.  It can change very quickly, and I was very aware of that, as obviously in that second set I was 3-Love, almost 4-Love up in that set and, again, the momentum shifted.   
So I had to stay very with it and just very competitive every point.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, no, I just went to the toilet and got changed.  No, you don't get to shower.  No such luck.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: I went into a toilet cubicle, went to the toilet, got changed.  Any more specifics on that one?  No.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: (Laughter.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Um, I guess I'm obviously accumulating some match fitness over even last week and now this week here just the amount of matches I've been able to play.  But it's still a battle every match.   
So it's not that once you've won a couple then it's like it doesn't snowball.  You still to reset before every match and keep working.   
But I'm very happy to be still involved in the tournament.  Hopefully I will work very hard to be involved until the very end.   
For now, I get to look forward to one more match.  Yeah, try to keep working and keep building.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, because I completely lost score.  I thought it was 2-All.  I don't know if you guys saw me, but I was literally standing there and I was thinking, Okay, something is off.  Something is not right.  Wim is looking at me and I was kind of looking around.   
So, yeah, I had bit of a mental kind of wander I guess.  But it's also a good thing.  At least I wasn't focused so much on the score but point by point.  So I was very present in the actual work but not so much the scoreline.  I had a good laugh and he was also laughing.   
But, yeah, no, it was fine.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I think you guys have probably archives of all the on-court coaching that we've done.  Yeah, I don't think we've ever had anything like that.  I think it's in my best interest to always be open and calm and as level-headed as possible when he comes out.  He can only bring attention to things that I am not aware of.  I'm obviously very emotionally investigated in the matches that I'm playing.   
Whereas my team, from the outside they have an outside perspective as well.  You've got to get the heart rate a bit lower to be receptive of that and try to -- because it's for you.  It's in the best interest of you, so...   
 Q.  Just speaking of Wim, first time you're playing Simona with him in your box.  Did that help you in any way?  Did he give you any tactics ahead of the match that been different than the last time?  
JOHANNA KONTA: We prepared for the match exactly the same as every other game.  I think with the way tennis is, there is a lot of coaches on tour that have worked with other players as well.  It's the way the sport works.   
We prepared for the match exactly the same way.  Obviously I had specific things in my mind what I wanted to achieve out there according to the opponent I was playing, but it wasn't anything more specific than all my previous matches.   
 Q.  (Regarding Hunky Dory. )  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, I wish I could get Hunky Dory here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, I pretty much live at Whole Foods, but that's a different story.  There are some great restaurants around.  I've had some great food here.   
But, yeah, otherwise Whole Foods probably.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah.  Yeah.
