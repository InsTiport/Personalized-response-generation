A. KERBER/J. Konta   
7-5, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How would you describe the experience of playing your first slam semi?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I was really, really happy with how I felt on court in terms of nerves or anything.  I felt very comfortable.  I really went out there with a very clear mindset of just trying to compete to the best of my ability today against the opponent that I had on the other side of the court.   
So, yeah.   
 Q.  I think she made just 11 unforced errors in the whole match.  
JOHANNA KONTA: That's probably a lot for her, too (laughter).   
 Q.  Did that sort of tell its own story of the match, do you think?  
JOHANNA KONTA: She's an incredibly tough player.  I think she's one of the, if not the most consistent player on the tour.  And that's no secret.  She really makes every single ball possible and makes you work for every single point.  She definitely played with that little bit more experience than I did.   
But I really enjoyed my experience out there.  I'm really looking forward to the chance of playing her again soon.  Yeah, just looking forward to my next tournament.   
 Q.  Must be very proud of what you've achieved.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I'm really happy with how I was able to compete day in and day out.  Well, every second day in and every second day out.   
Yeah, no, at this level you're constantly being tested.  Whoever you're playing, your limits are constantly being pushed.  I'm really happy how I was able to, you know, keep pushing my threshold, as well, keep gaining lots of new experiences, and just keep improving.   
 Q.  Are you hurting at all?  Are you moving on quickly from that loss?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Physically?   
 Q.  No.  Is there a sense of lost opportunity or you've accepted that you missed for a chance for a Grand Slam final and you've moved on pretty quickly?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't think I missed an opportunity.  I played against a better player today who earned her right into a Grand Slam final.  That's how I view it.  She played a really, really good match.  That's why she is the winner and I'm not today.  I think that's all you need to accept about that.   
But I'm really taking a lot of positive things from it.  I'm really hungry to keep improving and keep enjoying what I'm doing.  So that's where I'm at.   
 Q.  What went through your mind at 3-Love down in the first semifinal?  Ultimate test of your ability to keep fighting back; a tough moment.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Oh, my God, please get on the board (laughter).   
I mean, even though I was 3-0 down, I think every single game went to deuce.  I had a breakpoint in that second game.  It wasn't like 3-0 (snapping fingers).  It was still a tough battle within.   
Yeah, no, I felt I did a good job to claw myself back into that first set.  But, yeah, no, I really enjoyed my time in general this whole Australia trip, starting in China, then Hobart, then here.  I think I've gained a lot more experience, a lot more circumstances that I got to be a part of.   
Yeah, no, just looking forward to keep moving forward.   
 Q.  How realistic do you think it is that Angelique could beat Serena on Saturday?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think we'll find out on Saturday, to be honest.  Yeah, that's all I have to say.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you sort of belong at this level now?  You've beaten top opponents.  Do you feel now you're sort of deservedly part of this group?  You can do it more often, again and again?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't look to be a part of any group.  I look to be the best I can be.  Like I keep saying, I don't look at myself in the mirror and say, You're number this in the world.  That's not how I view my career and my life.   
I just will go back, keep working hard, keep improving the things that I want to improve and keep enjoying what I'm doing.   
 Q.  What have you learnt about yourself through these few days?  Have you had a chance to go, This is what I've learnt?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I really enjoyed the battles.  I really learnt -- not necessarily learnt but reinforced the good old saying of being comfortable being uncomfortable.   
So I think that has been a really good experience for me to have, to really feel what it's like to be pushed and to just hang in there.  I really enjoyed coming through a lot of battles like that in this last fortnight.  Looking forward to many more opportunities like that.   
 Q.  Anything about your response surprised you?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think it's difficult for me to say because I'm very much in the moment; I'm in the happenings.  I think it's more maybe when I go home when my mom will say, Oh, you're really calm.  It will come out more with my loved ones around me to see how I react to a certain thing.   
Yeah, they can pay me compliments.   
 Q.  Is that what you're going to do now, go home and spend time with your family?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes.  I've got a couple of personal things to do here, and then I will, yeah, head back home, then we'll see.   
 Q.  Plans to reward yourself the next day or two?  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, nothing in particular.   
 Q.  Are you still planning to play Fed Cup?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, no, my intentions are still to go.  Obviously I need to see how my body recovers, how my health is, and then I will make the best decision possible.   
 Q.  If you do go, how much will you sort of look forward to that experience, which would be very different from playing a Grand Slam semifinal on Rod Laver Arena?  
JOHANNA KONTA: If I do go, I'm going to really enjoy it.  I've represented Great Britain for a number of years now in Fed Cup.  I've played every single tie in every zone or group stage that we've had.   
Yeah, no, I'm going to enjoy it.  I'm going to be surrounded by a lot of good people.   
 Q.  Do you feel tired physically?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, I don't feel fresh as a daisy.  Yeah, I definitely need some good R&R.   
 Q.  After the Fed Cup, which tournaments have you got penciled in?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I'm currently signed up to do Acapulco, Monterrey, Indian Wells, and Miami.   
 Q.  I guess you were quite lucky of having three of the Murrays around for the tournament.  Did any of them sort of talk to you and not necessarily give you advice but help you through?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I didn't really get the chance to speak to Jamie or Andy very much because our schedules were quite different.  We don't use the same locker room obviously.  I didn't really run into them because that's usually where you run into people.   
In that sense, yeah, no, I didn't really get the chance to have in-depth conversations with them.  Whenever I saw them in passing, Well done; good luck.  A little chitchat.   
 Q.  As Fed Cup captain, you have conversations with Judy.  
JOHANNA KONTA: She was constantly messaging me, so I saw her more often.  Not in the changing rooms.   
 Q.  What's the best piece of advice she gave you, if she gave you advice?  
JOHANNA KONTA: She kept it very simple.  Really enjoy the moment.  Enjoy being here.  Enjoy the battle.  Things like that.   
 Q.  Can you just compare what you felt like going home from the Australian Open after losing in the first round in qualifying and what you'll feel like going home from here this year?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Not very different.  Both times I was looking forward to going home to see my family.  That remains the same.  I go home to see my parents, spend some time in my own bed.  That stays the same.   
 Q.  Comparing disappointment to accomplishment.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Depends what you view as disappointment.  Like I said, I don't live my life and feel my happiness or joy on my wins and losses.  If I'm accomplishing what I feel I'm working on and what I would like to accomplish, then I go home happy.
