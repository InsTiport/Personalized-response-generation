J. KONTA/D. Vekic
6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Could you talk us through probably what was one of your most dominant performances in a slam today?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, it was a good match.  I mean, I thought I had very, very few drops in my level, which I think definitely kept the pressure on her and in trying to find a solution.
I mean, the thing with Donna is until we shook hands, I thought there was always going to be an opportunity or a chance that she was going to raise her level or do something or even for me to drop.  It's never a guarantee to play well throughout the whole match.
At 4-3 there was very little in it for it to go 5-3, as well, so it could have been easily a momentum shift for her, as well.  I thought I did a good job in just contained play.
Overall, just pleased to have come through that and, yeah, just very pleased with the level I played.
Q. What were you sort of most happy with today?  What did you feel worked best?
JOHANNA KONTA: I thought I played the game well.  I think I was able to identify where I was getting points and what was kind of making her feel uncomfortable on court or even I thought I played into the open spaces quite well.  I thought I was able to find opportunities to do that.
But then equally when there were points where she was in control, I thought I did a good job in just staying strong and trying to get an extra ball back.  I think I just accepted to play the game well more than anything.  So I think that, yeah...
Q. How would you assess the level you're playing at now compared with where you were at going into the clay court season?
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, I think the level is quite similar.  I think more than anything I am just playing the game quite well.  I think that also comes from winning some matches, and you get some match fitness in.
I have been in a lot of different situations over the last number of weeks, a lot of tough ones, a lot of maybe ones that don't seem as tough but are tough in their own way.  I think coming through them definitely gives me confidence in being able to deal with different situations when I go back out on court.
So I think similar just maybe just with an added bit of match fitness.
Q. Another good win today.  Well played.  I'd like to ask you about Bono if that's...
JOHANNA KONTA: I love Bono questions.  Ask away.
Q. Can you tell us a bit about his personality?  Does it make a difference whether he's with or without you?  And do you think Bono misses you, too?
JOHANNA KONTA: I know he does.  I know he misses me (smiling).
So his personality, he is -- I mean, he's just brilliant, just all-around brilliant.  I think he knows it, too.  He's stubborn, but that's quite normal for his breed.  It's quite a stubborn breed.
Jackson and I are really patting ourselves on the back, the fact he's toilet trained now.  Although when he goes to Jackson's parents, he always likes to poo behind the couch, I don't know why.  We're working on that.  I don't know why.
Yeah, he's toilet trained at home, and he's just all-around awesome.  Because he's quite independent, he's really funny.  So he will sometimes come for a cuddle but then he'll let you know when he's done and then go do his own thing.  He will play by himself, and then when he wants to play with you, he will come and put his paw on your leg or nudge you.  It's, like, yeah, okay, you can pay attention to me now, I'll let you.
Yeah, no, we love him to bits.  He's awesome.
Q. Sorry to change the subject...  In the next round, you'll be playing one Grand Slam or one multiple Grand Slam champion.  Wondering if you could tell us a bit about how you'd approach the match if it's Sloane or GarbiÃ±e.
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, I have played both of them this year.  I have played Sloane already twice this year.  I have been on court with them.  I mean, both of them play their best tennis in situations like these in Grand Slams.
I mean, whoever I will be playing I'll be playing a tough match, that's for sure.  I haven't played GarbiÃ±e on the clay, I don't think, so if I play her that will be a different experience.  I know she plays well here in Paris, yeah.  That will be that.
And against Sloane, I mean, I played her recently in Rome, but what she does well is she raises her level in tough moments, as well.
Whoever I'm playing I'm looking forward to it.  It will be a great opportunity for me to play against one of the best players in the world, and like you said, both of them are Grand Slam champions, GarbiÃ±e being a two-time Grand Slam champion.  It's a great position for me to be in.
Q. You spent a longer time in your young career playing ITF events compared to most players in the top 50.  How do you reflect on those days?  And how did, like, playing those events in front of, you know, not many people kind of build your character?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I spent a lot of my career there because that's where my ranking put me.  I didn't get too many opportunities throughout the year with wildcards and things like that to play in different areas.
However, I mean, I think also a lot of players who go through that quickly are able to go through it quickly and they break into playing the WTA events more quickly than I did.
For me, it was a bit longer.  I mean, I actually really enjoyed playing those events.  I played actually all my events in Europe or the U.S.  I played a lot of them in the U.S. and Canada.
I mean, I have a lot of really, really good experiences from there.  To be honest, if I hadn't gone through that, I wouldn't be who I am now.  I wouldn't be the kind of player and person I am now.
I think I can only look back on that period with fondness more than anything, because it's definitely gotten to where I am today.
Q. I know you want to get further than the quarterfinals, but given sort of all the ups and downs and tough moments over the last couple of years since you were last here, it must feel pretty special to be back in the last 8 of a Grand Slam again?
JOHANNA KONTA: For sure.  I have only been at this stage a handful of times.  So to be back here, I'm definitely very pleased.  Like you said, this is not my end goal or anything.  I would love to be here till the very end, but I'm also really doing my best at really enjoying the different matches I get to play and the different accomplishments that I get to experience.
Today was definitely one.  I'm really enjoying it and really grateful for it.  Just, yeah, happy to still be here.
Q. You have been pretty efficient in your court time so far.  Does that make a difference when you're going into the second week?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I guess it's been kind, especially in the sense I have been sick outside of that, so it's kind of nice that that's balanced out.  However, before this week, I mean, I have been playing long matches, so it comes and goes, and I'm prepared for both.
I mean, you never know how long your match is going to be until you finish.  Yeah, it always shows -- always presents different challenges even with shorter matches.  Yeah, either way, just prepared for what's coming.
Q. I think I remember seeing you have never played in Chatrier before?
JOHANNA KONTA: I have, yes.  I played Su-Wei there two years ago.
Q. Wondering what you thought of Serena Williams going out yesterday?  Do you think there is a growing mood now that just about everybody is beatable?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think that's been the growing mood for quite sometime now, I think for the last few years.  But, I mean, I didn't watch the match, so I don't know how it went.  I mean, I assumed Sofia played really well, and congrats to her.  I mean, that's always a massive achievement.
I think it's still really great to see Serena playing here, and, I mean, she's always in the running to make it to the end of any tournament.  So, I mean, it's nice to see competitive matches and for I think people to also enjoy matches where nothing's a given, and it can be unpredictable.  I think that's the beauty of sport to have battles where you're not sure what the end result is going to be until it happens.  I think that's always enjoyable for a fan.
Q. Back on the Chatrier, have you been inside the new Chatrier?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  I have not.  I have not been on the new Chatrier (smiling).
Q. Just wondering what you make of it, from what you have seen on TV or whatever?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I actually haven't really seen it, to be honest.  But I'm sure it's beautiful.  If I get to play on it, then -- on, I think I play on Tuesday?  Yeah, I don't know what day it is.  Next time I get to play, if I get to play in it, it will be nice.
Q. You said you have an apartment in Paris that you stay in, right?
JOHANNA KONTA: I rent an apartment.  I don't own one, no.
Q. But is that, like, normal for you at slams?  Do you try to get away from hotels all the time?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think I definitely look to try and stay in places where you can disconnect a little bit.  A lot of the times during the year obviously we stay at official hotels and they can be a bit like a player lounge, which can be a bit exhausting.
I have stayed at this apartment for the past, I think, five, six years.  I can't even remember how long.  But, yeah, no, I enjoy staying there.
