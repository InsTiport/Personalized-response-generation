2-6, 6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Strong start today.  Curious, what do you think the key was in the end and what made the difference for you?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I definitely did start off really well.  I was really, I felt, dictating a lot on my terms.
I think she did a really great job of putting herself back into the match.  She also raised her level; I definitely dropped mine a bit.
I think the momentum just shifted and then I couldn't quite recover it.  She kept running away with it really.  Really wasn't in it much at the end.  It was interesting.
But, yeah, no, I think she played a more consistently high-level match than I did.
Q. Still a very high-quality match throughout.  A lot of winners, especially in the third set.  Does that provide any kind of solace in the aftermath of a loss for you?
JOHANNA KONTA: Quite honestly, I am happy with how I did today.  I think I did the best that I could with the cards that I had with everything.  I really left it all out there.  There wasn't any more I could have given.
Obviously would've been nice to have a couple things go my way a bit more.  Quite honestly, she did a great job of really pulling the match towards her end.
Yeah, I couldn't have done much more today.
Q. Talking about your year...
JOHANNA KONTA: Are we just having a conversation?  (Smiling.)
Q. We've been talking about your year for the last couple weeks.  You could do a lot of micro-assessing of your season.  At what point, if at all, will you look at the whole picture and take away some major themes or things you want to improve on, or have the small steps throughout your season made that easier going into the off-season.
JOHANNA KONTA: I guess because we are continuously looking to get better, so after each match we already look to be better the next day.  So I guess it's not so much of a, Let's look at everything we did and let's see what we can improve on.  It's a continuous process.
We will enjoy the year we had together as a team.  I think everyone is very pleased with the progress we've made.
Then equally, I think all of us are really excited to just keep improving come the pre-season and next year.
Q. Lastly, what do you take away from this week in Zhuhai, and how soon do you head to Rome for vacation?
JOHANNA KONTA: Quite honestly, I feel very, very lucky and blessed that I got to finish my year here.  I'm really happy I got to finish my year playing and finish playing I think three great matches.
It's been a great event here.  If I'm not in Singapore next year then I would love to be here.  So, yeah, I feel very happy to have come here this year.  I will be home for a week first and head to Rome for three days.
Q. Obviously you already got the award of most developed player this year.  I want to know whether you have time to take part in the IPTL for the vacation, to play more tennis?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  I'm currently not scheduled to be playing any exhibitions or anything along those lines.  I'm going to take full advantage of having some time off, and then training.
