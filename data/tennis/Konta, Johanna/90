J. KONTA/C. Wozniacki
6-3, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What is your verdict on that?  A pretty impressive performance.
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I was very happy with I guess the way I was able to assert myself from the very beginning, also tighten up my game a bit as that first set went on, and just maintain my level to the very end.
Against someone like Caroline, she's not going to give it to you.  You really do have to earn it and win it till the very last point.  I'm just very happy I was able to keep that pressure on.
Q. Would you say this is maybe the best level you've ever attained?  You've won eight matches without dropping a set.
JOHANNA KONTA: I think I had a longer streak a couple years ago.  Still got awhile to go till then.  But I'm very pleased with how I've just been able to problem solve in the last matches that I've played, really play myself into matches where I felt I started slowly.  Also, like today, just also maintain the level.
So, yeah, I'm very pleased.  I've played against some very good players.  To be able to come through that, I'm very pleased.
Q. Do you feel going into a match like today, after doing so well recently, you have a lot of momentum behind you which will sort of help you?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think that swings both ways.  Not necessarily.  I try to take the good things from having played quite a few matches.  Having been already in certain pressure situations, certain things so recently, maybe I can relate back to those things within a match.
However, equally I need to keep myself present.  I need to stay within the match that I am.  Just because you win a few previously, it doesn't mean that you'll keep doing it.  It's not really relevant for the match at hand.
Q. Caroline is a player who gets an awful lot of balls back, makes players hit the extra ball.  Were you surprised that you dominated so many of the rallies so well?
JOHANNA KONTA: I knew going into the match that I was going to be facing that, so I really was very clear on wanting to, like I said, assert myself from the first point.  I was prepared to lose some points playing that way, but I felt it was the right way.
I felt, yeah, it was going to give me opportunities at certain points.  I'm very happy it did today, so yeah.
Q. A number of the Grand Slam nations, because of these wonderful events we have, have a lot of funds, they build large facilities.  It doesn't always work out.  The LTA decided to stop funding you.  You seemed to do really well after that.  Could you talk about the dynamic of these large groups having support of players.  In a way is it better to be out on your own sort of fighting and scratching?
JOHANNA KONTA: Firstly, that period of time when the organization decided to stop funding me wasn't in my benefit.  It actually was very difficult.  Everybody needs help.  This is not a cheap sport.  Whether you find that help through a Federation or through a private sponsor or through a family, no one gets there without any help.  I don't believe tough love is necessarily the answer.  I think it also depends on the player.
I think I was just very fortunate to have very good people around me at the time.  My family, my support system, also my coaches at the time did a tremendous job in pulling together around me and making sure that our focus remained on the work and not on external situations which were mainly out of our control.
Q. How do you think your mental game has improved from this time last year?
JOHANNA KONTA: I guess it comes back to, again, the experiences that you're able to have.  Again, I know this may sound like a broken record, but I do try very hard to always make sure I really take the good and the things I can improve on from every match that I play and reinvest it into the next match.  Whenever the similar situation arises, make sure that's in my bank and I can use my experience from that.
I think hopefully I'm getting a little wiser.
Q. Makarova next.  You had a pretty long one with her here last year.  What do you remember about that match?  Will you use it at all in your preparation?
JOHANNA KONTA: Officially I think we've played maybe once since then.  Every time we play, we have a battle.  Yeah, I think last year was 8-6 in the third.  Actually we played out on Margaret Court.  I remember that was a high-level match from both of us.  That was really a great match to be a part of.
I'm looking forward to the challenge, the battle again.  She had a great match against Dominika.  Dominika is not an easy player to beat, and she was able to do that.  She's playing obviously great tennis.
I think she really enjoys playing here.  She always seems to do well on these courts.  I'm looking forward to it.  We'll deal with whatever challenges come up the next day.
Q. I've been confused since I've been in Australia about the pronunciation of your first name.  Is it Sydney Born?
JOHANNA KONTA: Right, what's the question (laughter)?
Yeah, it was quite awkward actually on court.  The announcer or the presenter on court.
THE MODERATOR: The emcee.
JOHANNA KONTA: The emcee, thank you.  I think he tried to get the crowd involved.  Is she from Great Britain?  Is she from Australia?  I'm like, This is kind of awkward.
But, yeah, my place of birth is no secret.  Also where I call home is no secret either.  Yeah, everyone's pretty clear where they stand with me, so...
Q. Have you had any Australian fans trying to claim you on Twitter, around town?
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't really go through much of what's going on social media.  I enjoy sometimes putting photos up, but then I try to stay off it as much as I can.  You can get lost on there for quite some time.
Q. Like Monica Seles, you have some Hungarian heritage, or am I mistaken?
JOHANNA KONTA: My parents are Hungarian, yeah.
Q. How important is routine to you?  I know it's on court during the changeover.  Is it just about hydrating and looking after the body or is it about the routine that makes you do it?
JOHANNA KONTA: With that specifically, it is more about hydrating the body.  Sometimes I need to remind myself to drink a bit more or a bit less.  That's less about routine and just making sure that I'm prepping my body, prepping it to be out there as long as need be.
Q. Do you have specific routines other than that just to keep you in the moment, to clear your mind of external thoughts?
JOHANNA KONTA: Of course.  I think even little things like my preparation for my serve, which everyone likes to talk about, I'm sure that's part of it, as well.  Certain mannerisms, they all go along with it.  Then obviously my train of thought.  I always try to keep myself in a good way, in a quiet way in the mind.
Yeah, I guess in that way I'm able to make sure I feed myself good things and therefore keep myself on the right track.
Q. Do you ever use those things in other situations away from the match court?  Life can sometimes be hectic.
JOHANNA KONTA: Like the check-in of an airport counter?  Breathe, one point at a time (smiling).
I'm sure.  Maybe not specific like tennis words, but definitely deep breathing comes in handy plenty of times, so...
Q. Did you see Dan Evans' match at all?
JOHANNA KONTA: I did watch his match yesterday.  It was really a good one to watch.  It was interesting, I don't often watch matches where I get really into it.  But yesterday I had to calm myself a bit down.  Gee, I'm about to go to bed, let's not get too pumped up here.
No, it was a great one.  Good job from him to come through that.
Q. Did you get a chance to talk to him at all?
JOHANNA KONTA: Just in passing, but nothing more than that.  That's the way the scheduling works.
