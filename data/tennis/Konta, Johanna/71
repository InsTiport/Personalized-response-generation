J. KONTA/J. Ostapenko
7-5, 3-6, 6-4
Q. So tell us, how do you feel now?
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I'm obviously very happy to have come through a tough match like that.  Jelena is playing some incredible tennis.  It's hard to accept sometimes against players like her, you have very little say in some points.
I really just tried to stick to the game plan I had.  I felt I was playing the right way and then, yeah, just kept working hard to try and create my chances and just trusting in the fact that I was going to take some.
Q. You just beat one Grand Slam champion and Angie is next match.  There is a chance you can beat two Grand Slam champions in one day.  How do you feel about that?
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, obviously I'm just very happy to have come through this round.  The next round presents a completely different challenge.  Angie is a completely different player to Jelena.
I'm going to prepare the best that I can for my next opponent and really looking forward to the chance of playing her again.  I haven't had the chance to beat her yet, so I will try this afternoon.
