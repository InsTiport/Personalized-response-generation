3-6, 6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That was some recovery today.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, it was a really tough match.  It was a really tough match to play.  My opponent has the ability to play very, very well.  I mean, she's not a Grand Slam champion for no reason.  She was playing really, really well at the beginning.   
I mean, there wasn't a lot in it for me to be finished after two sets.  So I'm just really pleased to have competed and just really try to find a way to get myself into the match.   
 Q.  Is everything all right in terms of fitness?  Your match finished 2 hours 20 minutes ago.  Have you needed treatment?  Is everything all right?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, no, I've just done my usual recovery, yeah.  Just massage, food, and stretching.   
 Q.  What in general were you very happy with today in terms of your performance, coming back?  That was always going to be a tough match.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think I was really pleased with just my acceptance of recognizing that she was playing really well, and also seeing -- just keeping an open mind, trying to find a way, trying to give her different looks, try to give her different balls, just to try to get her out of her zone, because she was very much in it for a big portion of the match, especially in the first, then a big part of the second.  Pretty much the whole second.   
But, yeah, uhm, just pleased that I kept on playing the game and just trying to really work my way into the match and bring the best level I could, as well.  Yeah, just pleased with that.   
 Q.  Something seemed to throw you early in the second set, I think maybe around 3-All.  Was it a dodgy net cord sound coming from the chair?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I just heard the net cord, the machine go, in the point.  I think it was maybe on her return or something.  I mentioned it to the umpire.  I just mentioned it to her.  I might have heard something wrong.   
 Q.  Can you tell us about the challenge you're going to face in the next round, your experience of playing against Petra.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I haven't played her in a little while.  I think I've only beaten her once.  I think it was at Eastbourne.  But, I mean, she's a two-time Wimbledon champion.  I mean, her favorite surface and her best surface is grass, and here at Wimbledon.  I'm going to be coming up against a very, very inspired and very, very tough Petra.   
She's also been playing incredibly well in the last couple years.  She made the finals of Australia this year.  I know since coming back from that terrible thing that happened with her, I mean, she's playing unbelievable tennis.   
Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to playing a great champion.  Just looking forward to the match.   
 Q.  How significant was that hold midway through the second set?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Which one?   
 Q.  Six deuces, I think it was.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I actually don't know which game you're talking about.  Which one?   
 Q.  Maybe 3-All.  I think you said on the TV, I think I might not be coming back from this.  I think that game was particularly significant.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't know which game you're talking about.  I think we had quite a few long games.  Especially in the second set, I had quite a few breakpoints against me, four for Sloane.  Yeah, I mean, there was very little in it.  Yeah, I was just pleased I kept going.   
 Q.  Since Roland Garros, three slam semifinals, how significant is that when you get into the latter stages, as you are now, into the second week?  How does that translate into sort of a comfort when it comes to that point in the tournament?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Uhm, I mean, obviously, you know, the more opportunities I get to be in the latter stages of Grand Slams, the more experience I gain.  Experience can only bring good things.  It can only help with managing different things, different situations that come up at this point of the tournament.   
However, equally said, there's always different things that happen, as well.  I'm always learning, as well.  I mean, I'm really pleased that I've been able to make it to the second week in two successive Grand Slams.  I've never been able to do that before.  I'm really pleased with that achievement.   
Just really looking forward to playing another great match against a great opponent.  I just look to hopefully keep going.  Looking forward to having another go.   
 Q.  If you play like you did in the last set and a half, do you feel you can beat anyone?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Uhm, I don't think it would be fair on me to isolate the last set and a half because I don't think I did much different in the other set and a half previous.  I played a great match in all.  I played against a great opponent.   
There's always going to be backwards and forwards, I guess the struggle to get control, to try and push each other into uncomfortable positions on court and ask enough questions.   
I don't think anyone can go on court against me feeling sure it's a done deal, yeah.   
 Q.  However you beat her, you've taken apart a very, very good player, almost crushed her at the end.  Not a lot of tennis players can always do that against other good players.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't think I crushed her.  She definitely dropped her level a little bit in the beginning of that third set.  I think that's also credit to how I was raising my level in that second set.   
However, she was finding her way in that third set, as well.  There was very little in it for her to also bring it back to the way she was playing in the first two sets.   
Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm just overall pleased with the way I just handled the match and competed.  Was prepared for either eventuality, really.   
 Q.  I lose count of where it's at, but 13 or 14 of the top 20 have now gone out.  Does that sharpen your sense of what an opportunity you've got?  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, because those players have lost to another player who is obviously playing very well.  So whoever's still in the tournament, there's a reason why they're still here.  That means they're playing very good tennis.   
So, no, every match is challenging.  Every match is difficult.  Everyone who is still in the tournament deserves to still be here.  There's a reason for why they're here.   
 Q.  You obviously played a lot more clay coming into Wimbledon this year than you have in the past because of your success.  Has that made the adjustment between the two seasons more difficult for you?  Do you feel you're back at the grass level you've been here in previous years?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Uhm, I mean, it was definitely a shorter grass preparation than I've had in the last few years.  A very good problem to have.  So, you know, there's definitely going to be an adjustment period.  I was definitely looking to find my feet quite quickly.   
But actually, even in Birmingham and Eastbourne, I felt I did a good job in finding the way I wanted to play and then just trusting that also things were going to come with time.  I mean, the two matches I lost there, I lost against great players, and they were playing very well.   
Yeah, I think overall not necessarily specific to the grass matches, but in general I feel like I'm building with each match that I'm playing.  It's nice that that's kind of continuing through this period.   
 Q.  Can you tell us about your dog Bono.  
JOHANNA KONTA: What about him?   
 Q.  Has he helped you relax away from the court?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes, he brings very good perspective.  My boyfriend just sent me a photo of him lying across him like lounged out.  I think he's a dog of leisure.   
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?   
JOHANNA KONTA: Going out with a bang.  Can't really follow that up (smiling).
