6-4, 6-3
An interview with:
JOHANNA KONTA
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What part of Kucova's game surprised you or caught you off guard?  Anything that might have caught you off guard tonight?
JOHANNA KONTA: Quite honestly, I expected her to play at a good level.  I mean, she's beat many very good players this week so far.  I believe she's been having a good year, as well.
I don't think her level surprised me in any way.  I think, you know, I would have liked to have played a better match myself from my end.  However, you know, she has a lot to say about that as well.  So congrats to her.
Q. It's been a long season, tournament last week.  Were you tired at all?  Did you feel it tonight?
JOHANNA KONTA: I don't think about it, quite honestly.  I think it would be irrelevant of me to.  It's no secret I played a lot of matches in succession, but so has my opponent.  I think both of us were in very similar boats.
I think it was just very important to stay in the today.  I did the best with what I had.  Unfortunately, it wasn't good enough.
Q. We saw you interact with the referee at the end of the match.  What was it about?
JOHANNA KONTA: Oh, I don't even know anymore.
Q. Last year you really ascended in the rankings.  Now with Kucova's win, she is rising in the rankings.  Despite your loss, can part of you allow yourself to be happy for your opponent because she's having her career-changing moment right now?
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, although our paths may be similar on paper, everyone has very much their own journey.  I don't know exactly what she's been through.  I don't know what this means to her.
But for sure I'm sure she's delighted, and good luck to her for the next round.  I think if anyone is a testament of not being a reflection of their ranking, it's probably myself.  I consider her with the same regard.  Going into the match, I was not playing someone who was 120 something.  I was playing another player playing at a very good level.  That's they way I think it's important to approach every match.
