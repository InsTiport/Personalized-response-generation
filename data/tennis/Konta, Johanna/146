  D. ALLERTOVA/J. Konta  7-6, 6-4, 6-2    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Tough loss today obviously.  How do you feel about the match and where do you think it went wrong?  JOHANNA KONTA: Well, obviously it's always disappointing to lose, but I gave it all out there. I don't believe it really went wrong anywhere.  She played at a very consistent level throughout the match.  I think that's what she did better than I did today. Obviously both of us created chances.  Again, I think she took more than I did. But overall, I was happy with how I fought out there and how I continued to try and find a way.  Unfortunately didn't go my way today.   Q.  And what were you thinking during the epic first set tiebreak?  Have you ever played one like that before?  JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, no, I've obviously played many tiebreakers in my career so far.  There have been some that have been quite long.  I'm not sure if -- I don't know.  I'm sure someone out there knows. But I was just taking things one point at a time, and not thinking too far ahead or behind and just trying to stay present. Yeah, again, unfortunately I couldn't come though that set.  She did better than I did.   Q.  How much of a sense during the day did you get of all of the other Brits that were playing today?  A lot of you were playing at the same time.  Did that give you all a bit of an extra motivation, do you think?  Was it an exciting time?  JOHANNA KONTA: Obviously because I was playing today I was very much focused on my own routines and preparation for my match, so I wasn't really looking at everyone else's results.  Actually, I don't know anyone else's results.  I literally just came off court. It's obvious we all want each other to do well, so continued success for everyone else.   Q.  And what are your plans for the grass court season?  Which events will you play?  JOHANNA KONTA: As of now I'm planning to play all of them, starting with the 50K in Eastbourne, home.  Then obviously Nottingham, Birmingham, Eastbourne, and Wimbledon. But hopefully, yeah, I'll be able to play that full schedule, and we'll see.
