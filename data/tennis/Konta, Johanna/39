(Transcribed from WTA recorded audio.)   
 Q.  Talk us through the frustration with the weather yesterday, how you prepared yourself for such a busy day today.  
JOHANNA KONTA: It's never ideal to have a full day of rain where there's no play at all.  Everyone is in the same boat, so I think everyone shared the same frustration.   
What's nice is today the sun is shining, the sky is blue.  It was nice to get out there and have a really tough, competitive match against Sloane.  I was very happy I was able to come through and play another match today.   
 Q.  Talk us through the match.  Quite topsy-turvy.  What pulled you through, especially winning the third set so convincingly?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I definitely raced ahead in the first set.  However, Sloane is as successful as she is because she does find a way to raise her level.  She did that.   
I was very pleased how I was able to continue competing, see the good things I was doing, because there were plenty of them.  Just trusted in being able to accumulate enough points to create chances.  Very happy.   
 Q.  Thoughts on playing Venus on center court later today.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, that's exciting.  I've played her once before here, on the same court.  It will be nice to share the court with her again.  I always enjoy playing her.   
She's someone who's left and is leaving such a mark on our sport.  I'm just looking forward to playing against her again.
