THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Could you tell us about the injury, how bad it is?
JOHANNA KONTA: I'll find out more tomorrow morning.  So I only know kind of the initial feelings of it, which is not always so trustworthy.
So I don't feel too comfortable saying really too much because, actually, I don't know yet until tomorrow morning.  But hopefully it's nothing more than a low-grade strain and more muscle spasm more than anything, hopefully.
But, again, I was told that I'll find out more tomorrow morning.
Q. It's right here?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, kind of right hip, leg, thigh, groin.
Q. Was it something that happened in the match or have you had a problem there before?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  It happened in my service game.  So third set, second game.  I'm not too sure actually what happened.
Q. Is this something that feels like anything that you've had before?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  No.  I have never -- No.  I've had issues kind of in this area, but more on the left side and not for a few years.  And it was different, so no.
Q. Are you feeling like -- you seem very calm but are you feeling upset by the timing of it?
JOHANNA KONTA: It's quite unfortunate, but I guess most importantly right now I feel more kind of at task.  Like, I'm doing everything I can now, going through the steps of making sure.  I'm eliminating things and then starting a quick turnaround hopefully.
Q. You were going to play in Sydney next week as well?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes.
Q. What is your gut feeling?  You're still likely to play in Sydney, do you think?
JOHANNA KONTA: Again, I need to wait until tomorrow morning.  I don't feel comfortable going on anything on gut feeling, especially to do with stuff like this.  Because most important thing is to listen to my body, listen to how I'm feeling in the morning, and really taking it kind of step by step.
Q. I guess you can take a lot of positives from your performance, first two matches, first set today.  How do you feel?
JOHANNA KONTA: Even the second set, to be fair, I didn't do too much wrong.  And there wasn't a lot in it for me to come out from that match, coming through in two sets.  So I think overall I've played better and better tennis, I think, and I've managed to really fight through some challenging situations.
And even actually this match now is a great match for me to play.  And even losing that second set, I don't feel like -- having done not much, wrong I think, is also a really good experience for me to have so early in the season.
Q. Obviously hips generally across tennis are a slightly hot topic at the moment, not just Andy or Kyrgios and people like that.  Is it a particularly difficult area of the body to manage for a tennis player given how much you play on hard courts and the first step you take opening it up and stuff like that?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think as tennis players we are very lucky.  We get all sorts of injuries, everything from overuse to acute and accidents that happen on court.  So we kind of go through it all and even body parts.
I know hips take a massive beating.  Obviously, our game is becoming more and more physical and the demands of the tour as well, week in and week out, is becoming more demanding just because the level of play match in and match out.
So I think, yeah, hips definitely take a beating, but so do knees, so do shoulders, so do ankles, wrists.  Yeah, take your pick.  Back, lower back.  And everything in between.
Q. It looked like you could actually move okay but I guess it just hurt.
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  I wasn't moving as I -- once it happened in that second game of the third set, I wasn't moving.  I was actually trying to anticipate.  I was anticipating and trying to, yeah, feel the point.  I was definitely not able to be as physical as I was up until that point.
Q. What will you do tomorrow?  Maybe a scan physio?
JOHANNA KONTA: It's literally -- well, actually, I'm in the middle of physio treatment now.  So I'm going to go back and finish off.  But it will literally be I'll wake up, see how I am, and then, according to that, I will see if I go get a scan or not.
Q. Is your sister still in Sydney?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yes.  Well, they were up here for the first couple days but they're back down in Sydney.  So I'll be going down to Sydney.
Q. Just looking at the first set today, you obviously were on your game from the start.  Your previous two matches you lost the first set.  Did you go in in any sort of different frame of mind today going into the match?
JOHANNA KONTA: No.  Like with the other matches, I went in with my game plan.  Went in with the clarity of what I wanted to do out there.
I mean, I would like to think that the more matches I play, the quicker I'm able to find my level in matches at the beginning.  So I think that's kind of what happened today.  I found how I wanted to play earlier on.
And actually, on the other hand, I think probably Elina didn't find her level as quickly as she wanted.  So I think it was probably two ends of the spectrum for us.
But, yeah, I would like to think that the more matches I get to play, the more fit I'll get in trying to play the level that I want.
