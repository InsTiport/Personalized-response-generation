J. GOERGES/J. Konta   
6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Was it hard to get your rhythm when she was going for winners so early in points?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think it was just a combination of a lot of things.  I don't think I quite found my footing fast enough, and I think she did very much so, and very, very early on.   
She's a very, very good player in general, and I do think this is her best surface.  She definitely exploited that.  I didn't do quite enough to make the match as competitive as I would've liked, which is disappointing; however, yeah, that's the way the cookie crumbles.   
 Q.  Did you find the court a bit slippery?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I was a little bit like Bambi, but we were playing on the same court and she seemed to be doing all right.  So I don't think I can say it was the court.   
Yeah, not much else to say really.  I feel obviously a little bit disappointed that I couldn't have made the match as competitive as I would've liked.  I wish we had best-of-five sets today just to have that little bit more time.   
Wouldn't necessarily have made a difference.  She played very well.  All credit to her for that.  Yeah.  (Smiling.)   
 Q.  Did it feel any different at all being a seed, being the favorite?  
JOHANNA KONTA: No, not particularly.  We were I think on one of the smaller courts here as well, so I don't think being a seed made any difference in terms that.   
And also equally, if you look at draws, I would think any draw was quite a difficult one at that just because of the quality of player I was playing as well.   
So, no, I didn't really look at any numbers next to my name.   
 Q.  How do you rate the clay court swing overall?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think overall I did the best that I could with what the cards that I was dealt.  Would've been nice to have been healthy for Madrid just to give myself that extra opportunity to compete that week.   
But I'm still involved in doubles here and also mixed, so not quite over yet.  Looking forward to keep trying to improve on this surface, and also keeping in mind that there are a lot of things that carry on from here to the grass and on to the hard again.   
Yeah.   
 Q.  The decision to play mixed here, was there not part of your thought, Well, soon as the main business is over I want to get back on the grass?  Can you just remind us of where you're playing again on the grass?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I'm currently entered for a full grass season, so Nottingham, Birmingham, Eastbourne, and Wimbledon.   
The decision came a little while ago.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to the opportunity.  I enjoy mixed doubles.  It's just another opportunities to be a part of this event and just another opportunity to keep improving.   
 Q.  Does opting into two or three draws, is that with eye towards Rio?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I would love to be involved in as many events there as possible.  I think we'll see once we get to that to see what I can be involved in.  Yeah, the more the merrier.   
 Q.  Compared to Laura, who was very downbeat, you seem very upbeat and positive.  Does that reflect the fact that you weren't expecting as much from the clay as from other surfaces, or the way of processing the disappointment of defeat?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I try to always do a really good job of leaving my work on the court.  That's where my work is.  Obviously a lot of things go into that, but I -- no one died.  I'm healthy.   
Coming off court and seeing some players who are not feeling as healthy I feel very grateful for that, that my body is healthy.  I still get the opportunity to be a part of doubles and mixed here.   
In terms of things I want to improve on, well, I did say -- I am a bit disappointed that I couldn't get a hold into that match; however, I'm also very excited and motivated to keep improving.  That's really all I can do on a daily basis.   
I'm not going to beat myself up too much.  I think it's always important to be kind to yourself.   
 Q.  Coming in here, obviously Australia was kind of a bit of a watershed event in your career.  
JOHANNA KONTA: A what?   
 Q.  Well, it was a big milestone in your career.  Was it something you thought about much coming in here, or is it now ancient history?  Your demeanor would suggest you put it in the past.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I put Australia in the past once I was on the plane going home.  The tour moves on very quickly, and in between Australia and here I've played many, many events since then.   
Yeah, I think the short answer to your question is, yes, I definitely moved on from Australia.  All I can do is just do my best to keep preparing for the next event that I play.
