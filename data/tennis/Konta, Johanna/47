P. KVITOVA/J. Konta
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough match to start with.  Does it feel better that you're actually testing yourself against one of the best grass court players out there?
JOHANNA KONTA: I mean, I think she's one of the best players in the world right now.  I'm not sure where she is in the race, but I'm pretty sure she's inside the Top 4.  I mean, going out there today, I knew I was going to be playing an in-form Petra and there was going to be a very small chance that she was going to go off.  I think for 90% of the match I was actually quite shoulder to shoulder with her, which was a very positive thing for me.  I think that that 10% is what I'm working on right now, to be able to do just that bit better and, yeah, to come through in some of those close moments.
Q. Is there much of a difference between the grass here and the grass in Eastbourne?  You seem to settle down a lot quicker in Eastbourne and have a better run than perhaps here.
JOHANNA KONTA: I can't quite remember right now, but there is a difference between here and Nottingham.  Here it's a lot heavier, quite a bit slower than Nottingham.  But, yeah, I mean, there's always going to be variation in courts and conditions, I mean, even day to day, depending on how muggy it is.
Q. That 4-all game, is that where you kick yourself a little bit?
JOHANNA KONTA: No, I won't be kicking myself.  I think I did a lot of good things, which is more of what I want to be taking from the match.  I don't want to be double-faulting twice in a row.  However, she puts a lot of pressure on you when she's returning.  She has a very big presence.  She's a tall girl and she hits big.  I think that's also credit to her, how she was returning and how she was playing as well.  But, yeah, I like to think I'm stronger than that as well, and that's what I'll continue to work on.  Yeah, but I think overall I asked a lot of questions on her service games as well and I think I returned quite well.  So that's a big positive for me because she's a big server and she served well.  So, yeah, that's it.
Q. It seems like she was hitting a lot of lines as well.  Do you think that will put you personally in good stead for Wimbledon given how hard she fought and how resilient you were?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone is surprised when Petra plays like that.  That's just the way she plays.  I think she's probably the only player on tour that regardless of who she plays, most of the match is going to be on her racket.  So she's a very credible player.  I mean,  again, there were moments where I laugh.  I had to smile about it because I did a lot of things right and I wasn't getting the reward for it.  But I think overall I'm pleased with the level I was able to play, like I said, 90% of the time.  It's that 10% that I want to do better at, and it's that 10% that I want to do better at.  Yeah, like I said, that 90% felt good against someone who is one of the best in the world right now.
Q. You mentioned what a big presence she can be with her return.  Is that something that can prey on your mind when you're serving to someone like that or that you have to try and make sure that it doesn't prey on your mind too much?
JOHANNA KONTA: I think it's something you expect with certain players.  There are a lot players out there that have a presence, who are big girls, who have big returns.  And against those kind of players, you do work on just keeping the attention on your side of the court and going through your own routines and going through your own rhythm and your own motion.  Yeah, I mean, you do your best to do that, but everybody is human.
Q. What's the plan now?  Do you go straight to Eastbourne?
JOHANNA KONTA: Yeah, I'll probably go back to London tonight, stay there maybe one or two days depending, and then heading to Eastbourne soon after that.
Q. Will you be praying to the draw Gods that they are a bit kinder to you in Eastbourne?
JOHANNA KONTA: No, I think I don't ask for easier draw.  I'm a firm believer in that you play certain people at certain times for a reason.  I'm very happy that I had this match today.  I would have liked to have won this match today and had another one here.  But I'm very happy that I got to play someone like her in the lead-up to a tournament like Wimbledon.
Q. You spoke about finding that extra 10% that would mean you could beat someone like Petra.  Do you think in front of a big crowd on Centre Court you might be inspired to find that?
JOHANNA KONTA: That 10% is not a matter of inspiration.  I love what I do.  I'm inspired whether it's on a small court in Nottingham or Centre Court in Wimbledon.  That 10% percent comes with work and comes with daily input.  I think I'm on the right track in earning that 10% more than anything.
