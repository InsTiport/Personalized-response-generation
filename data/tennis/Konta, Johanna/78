C. VANDEWEGHE/J. Konta   
6-1, 6-3   
 Q.  Commiserations.  The first set seemed to go by you very quickly.  You seemed to be more sure footed in the second and then it just got away from you.  Can you just talk about the match, please?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think, unfortunately in my case I think it was a bit of the two ends of the spectrum, I think.  She played very well.  She did basically everything she needed to do to play solid.  She served well.  She returned quite well when she had a good strike.  She hits a very big ball.  So it's quite difficult to play against someone like Coco on a fast surface like grass; when she's hitting it well, you get few chances.  And then my end of the spectrum was I, like you said, actually I didn't find my footing very well, and once you go down quite quickly, after the first set, it's actually quite difficult against someone like her to get back into the match.  I mean overall I think I did a reasonable job at continuing to try and just continue to really do the best that I could, but it definitely wasn't nearly good enough.  But again, I think she did the simple things really well, and she did what she does.  She played big and really just went after her shots.   
 Q.  She seemed to really attack your first serve as well.  Was that particularly difficult to deal with?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I actually didn't feel that way.  I think I did actually a reasonable job in moving my serve around.  I think it was more I didn't move so well today.  I think that let me down in terms of how well I was able to get myself into the points and ^ therefore into the match.  But I think also moving well is also a big part of them being able to move off their return as well.  So I think, yeah, overall I definitely would have wanted to do that better.   
 Q.  In terms of movement, obviously it's a damper day today, a softer day today.  Did that sort of impact movement considering it being quite tough and the ground was probably quite hard and a bit quicker to move on?  
JOHANNA KONTA: The conditions were different.  But they were also different for her as well.  I think I just need to do a better job at next time pushing through that barrier a bit better and to, yeah, I guess really make sure that I do find my footing.  If I slip a couple times, that's fine, but I think it's more to get over that hurdle of feeling short-footed.   
 Q.  Where does this leave your Wimbledon preparations now?  Do you feel like this is a significant blow, another defeat in a short space of time or do you feel fairly confident now?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Another defeat in a short period?  I think I did okay.  I made finals last week.  But cheers to the positivity.   
 Q.  Sorry.  It's a fact, though, isn't it?  
JOHANNA KONTA: What's the fact?   
 Q.  After losing on Sunday in slightly surprise circumstances to the world's no. 70.  You've gone out here to an unseeded player in a relatively short space of time.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Wow.   
 Q.  Is that a big blow for your Wimbledon preparations?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Is it a big blow for you?   
 Q.  No, no.  I like to see British players do well.  So I'm not trying to be awkward.  
JOHANNA KONTA: I think you're doing a pretty good job of that.   
 Q.  How do you feel --  
JOHANNA KONTA: Point being that I think I actually played two good matches here.  I played a very good first round against someone who made semis last week in Hertogenbosch.  I think I played a great match there.  I think last week I played five great matches.  I lost to a player who played better than me on the day.   
Me losing second round against a very good player on this surface is by no means a blow.  It's part of the game.  Just because I am 7 in the world does not mean I am entitled to winning every single match.  My job is to go out there and do the best that I can.
