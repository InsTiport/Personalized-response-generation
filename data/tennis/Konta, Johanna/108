7-5, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You have been named as the most improved player this year.  What is the most important thing to improve your skills and technique?  
JOHANNA KONTA: I didn't know that I was actually named that.  I definitely work very hard to continuously improve my game, but so have all the other players, as well.  I think I just have been most fortunate with being healthy all this year, so I've been able to play as much as I wanted to play, and therefore gain the experiences I've had.   
I've played a lot of great matches on a lot of great stages.  I count myself very fortunate with that.  Yeah, just continuously doing the hard work with my team.  Yeah, the job is never done really.   
 Q.  How pleased were you with how you fought off those set points in the second set and finishing the job in two?  
JOHANNA KONTA: There definitely wasn't much in it in that second set.  Actually even the first set, to be honest.  I think it was a very, very close game.  The time that we spent on court for two sets I think shows that as well.   
I thought we brought out a lot of good tennis in each other.  Whenever one of us dropped off a bit, the other one was always there.  Yeah, it was a really tough battle, and I really enjoyed being a part of it.   
Again, yeah, I think when I had those set points I was fully prepared to obviously play a third if need be.  I really just tried to be brave and just play the way I wanted to play throughout the whole match, and those points as well.   
Equally, I had some game points, breakpoints, set points and even a match point earlier which she saved, so I think that went both ways.   
 Q.  Next round you're likely to meet Kerber or Kvitova.  Can you speak about each of them.  
JOHANNA KONTA: Well, I've played Angelique twice this year.  She's definitely gotten the better of me both times.  If I end up playing her, then it will be an incredibly tough challenge and also another opportunity to play -- actually, it will be the first time I will ever play a world No. 1.  That will be quite cool.   
And against Petra, we've played a few times, and every time has been a battle, as well.  So I think whoever I play, it's going to be a great match to be a part of.  Yeah, I'm just going to do my best and see where that takes me.   
 Q.  You were playing under the roof today.  The forecast is for rain tomorrow.  Presumably the same conditions.  How different is it in that stadium with the roof shut?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Actually, it felt quite similar to yesterday.  I didn't feel much difference.  That could also be because it's quite a big stadium.  I think it doesn't suddenly become an indoor event.  It's also a really, really lovely stadium.  With the roof closed, it's pretty cool as well.   
So if it is raining tomorrow, I think we just count our lucky stars that we can still keep playing.   
 Q.  Yesterday you said that playing Carla would be fun because you'd not played her before.  After two hours and seven minutes, how fun was it?  
JOHANNA KONTA: Oh, it definitely was a lot of fun.  I think I would be in the wrong profession if I didn't desire to be a part of such battles.  I enjoy it.  It makes me better as a player, as a person, as a competitor.  Yeah, no, I definitely really, really enjoyed being on court with her.
