S. HSIEH/J. Konta
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How would you assess that?   Lots of breaks of serve. 
JOHANNA KONTA:   Yeah, and it definitely was a tricky match, but I do think she played incredibly well.   I know she likes this surface, so I definitely had a tough match going out there.
You know, she took better advantage of opportunities than I did, so credit to her.   She played well.

Q.   She's unorthodox, as well, isn't she?
JOHANNA KONTA:   She's a tricky player, definitely.

Q.   What does this do in terms of how you will play for next week?   What will you do from here?
JOHANNA KONTA:   You know, I will go back to the practice courts and continue to practice.   This is another match under my belt and more experience playing girls at the top.   It's all positive, so I'm very much looking forward to going into Wimbledon.

Q.   Was the court a bit slippery at first?
JOHANNA KONTA:   Yeah, but that's to be expected on grass, anyway.   And it's quite a humid day, so that was to be expected.

Q.   When the draw happens on Friday, is that something you'll be following closely online as it happens?   How interested are you in that?
JOHANNA KONTA:   I don't really look ahead in draws.   I just like to know who I play the next day, so I'll probably just be asking my coach.

Q.   Do you have any preference to if you're offered Serena on Centre or the world No. 2000 on Court 17?   Do you have any preference to that?   Would you like a big TV match?
JOHANNA KONTA:   I really have no preference.   I'll just take the match that comes, and I'll be prepared for that match and hopefully I will be doing well.

Q.   What can you take out of today's game ahead of next week?
JOHANNA KONTA:   Like I said before, just the experience of playing another player that's in the top of the game.   I think that's a huge part for me to be able to give myself the opportunities to be able to play against players like that. 
So, yeah, no, I think that's the main thing I will be taking from it.

Q.   Ultimately was it just a frustrating experience?
JOHANNA KONTA:   No, not at all, no, because I do think I played quite well.   Like I said, she just took better advantage of her opportunities. 
I thought it was a good match, and credit to her.   She played better, obviously.   But, no, no, I'm looking forward to moving on from here.

Q.   What's it like playing locally?
JOHANNA KONTA:   Very nice.   I get to sleep at home.   Mom gets to cook for me.   It's very pleasant. 
No, I love Eastbourne.   I love coming here from London.   Obviously London is so busy, so Eastbourne is a bit of a haven for me.

Q.   A change of nationality, as well.   What's it like to have a different home crowd?
JOHANNA KONTA:   No, I got my British citizenship last year so a year ago now.   It's brilliant.   No, this is very much home for me, so I'm very proud to represent Great Britain, so it's very exciting.
No, I enjoy the home crowd.

Q.   And the spectators?
JOHANNA KONTA:   Yeah, it was definitely a good crowd there, so I'm very grateful for the people that came out and supported me.   I know the other British girls are very grateful for that, as well.   It's a good experience.
