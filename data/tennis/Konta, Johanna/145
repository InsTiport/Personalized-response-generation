THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It's been a good run for you in Nottingham and here; obviously disappointing to go out today.   A word about how you felt that you prepared coming out today, this morning?  
JOHANNA KONTA:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   Couple of words about how you felt to have to come out again this morning and try at such a stage in the match?  
JOHANNA KONTA:   Well, obviously we already had quite a difficult day yesterday, you know, going on and off for both of us.   
It's challenging always when that happens.   All these things are very much out of our control, so there is no point in wasting any energy on them because you're not going to change them.   We kind of roll to the punches.  
Yeah, coming out today I knew I was a break down.   She is obviously a very good sever, so I just tried to do my best and tried to put as many balls back as possible.  
In the end, yeah, that one break held and she served very well at the end.  
   
 Q.   Heading now to Eastbourne?   
JOHANNA KONTA:   Yes, going home.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   You're going down now?   
JOHANNA KONTA:   Well, I'll look to get everything sorted here today and look to be heading down, yeah.   
   
 Q.   I think that's three top 100 players you've beaten in the last seven days or so.   How much confidence does that give you?  
JOHANNA KONTA:   Every win gives me confidence in different ways.   Obviously I don't look at the ranking of the other players; there are no easy matches.  
Obviously I'm very happy with the tennis that I'm playing and the opportunities that I've gotten in Nottingham and here to play on the grass.   
I have been lucky enough to get some really good matches on there, and I am just looking to carry this momentum and stay healthy and looking forward to the next week the week after and the week after that.   
   
 Q.   How great is it for you that you've now got Nottingham, Birmingham, and Eastbourne before Wimbledon?  
JOHANNA KONTA:   I think it's brilliant.   I think we are very fortunate that we've gotten an extra week for the grass season this year.   Very happy about that.  
And as you can see with the level of players that are here, and next week and even last week, it definitely make it more interesting for players to come here before Wimbledon.   
So it's a very exciting time for British tennis, and I'm very excited about it.   
   
 Q.   Have you set yourself goals for this year?   
JOHANNA KONTA:   Personal ones, yes, which I won't be sharing.   
What I can say...  
   
 Q.   You can share them.   
JOHANNA KONTA:   Oh, no, I won't.   (Laughing.)   
Well, I mean, I think it's no secret that I want to be staying healthy, because when I'm healthy I give myself the opportunity to be able to compete every week.  
I think that's crucial to build some momentum and some match stamina, which obviously gives you the best chance to find your best form.   
So that's all I want to keep trying to do.   
   
 Q.   You haven't got a ranking in mind?  
JOHANNA KONTA:   No.   No, I don't.   One match at time, one point at time.
