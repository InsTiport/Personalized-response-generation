  A. RUBLEV/G. Pella
 6-1, 6-2
 Q. What a great way to start the ATP Cup for Russia.  What are your thoughts?
 ANDREY RUBLEV:   Yeah, it was my first match of the season, it was my first match after a long break and for the first match I was playing really well and I'm really happy with my performance today.  Also I was lucky that he was two weeks quarantining without practicing, so I think that helped me out a lot.
 In general I was hitting the ball well today.  I was hitting the ball hard from the beginning and, yeah, in the end I'm happy with my performance.  So we'll see what's going to happen next.
 Q. Talk about how well you played and the importance of a first win for Russia?
 ANDREY RUBLEV:   I think it's always nice to win first match because it's give you a little bit confidence, it gives you a little bit more freedom that you don't have that much pressure.  For example, Daniil, he's playing now and he knows that we're already winning 1-0.  So in case if he start to losing somehow in one set or something like that he knows that it's not over, he knows that still it's going to be -- maybe he still have chances to win the match, plus we are 1-0 up, so it gives a little bit more freedom.  Freedom, confidence.  We'll see.  I don't know how he feels, but it's like this and I'm trying to do it.
