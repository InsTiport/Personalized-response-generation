A. RUBLEV/D. Thiem
6-2, 7-5
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. How different does this feel to play a match where you cannot advance compared to a normal match?
ANDREY RUBLEV:   You mean like that I'm not in, like, that I didn't qualify?
Q. Yes, exactly.  How does it feel to play a match like that?
ANDREY RUBLEV:   Yeah, but anyways, for each player it's really important match because they give 200 points, and it's really a lot.  It's more than if you do final on ATP 250.
So in the end, these all points, they are going to stay all the year, so it's a huge advantage.  So of course for every player it's really important.
Even for Dominic to have 400 points or 600 points, it's huge difference.  So in the end, yeah, it's important matches still.
