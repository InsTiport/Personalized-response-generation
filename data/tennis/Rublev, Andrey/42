THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How does it feel to be into the fourth round of the US Open?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Yeah, it feels great.  Is first time I am in the second week of the tournament.  This is amazing because we used to joke before about second week, how good is to be in the second week.  Now I'm here.  It feels good.
Q. How well do you know your next opponent, David Goffin?
ANDREY RUBLEV: No, I know him.  Of course, he used to be -- he is top 10.  He's one of the top players.  So we'll see what's going to happen.
I will try to do my best.  That's it.
Q. Do you know how you're going to play against him?
ANDREY RUBLEV: I mean, I have not many options.  If I want to compete against him, to have any chances, I have to try to show my game, to try to play my rhythm, the way I want it to be.  If I will try to play slower or something, I'm going to be dead on the court.  I have no chance.
Q. How did you play your rhythm today?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Of course, today was tough because I know Damir already many years.  I know he's one of the players that is fighting a lot for every point, who have amazing pace.  He's running, he's trying to catch all the balls to give you back.
I know since the beginning that even if I'm going to hit great shots, he's going to give me back.  So I don't have to relax, I have to continue to play, to finish many points in the net.  I know since the beginning.
I know also if I will do this, I will have a good chance to win.
Q. Who was your favorite player growing up to watch?
ANDREY RUBLEV: When I was kid, it was Safin.  When I was kid, it was the first thing that I saw.  I was, like, completely thinking that he's my idol.  I was watching every match.
Then also Nadal.  He was my idol.  I was buying the same clothes as him, all the new collections.  I was trying to copy.
Yeah, I think these two players, Safin and Nadal, was always my favorite ones.  I liked Federer also always.  But, I don't know, I was not trying to copy with the clothes.  Safin and Nadal I was trying to copy always, and Federer I just like him.
Q. You're very young.  Do you think that experience will matter when you go on court on Monday?
ANDREY RUBLEV: I don't know.  We'll see.  I'm just going to try to enjoy, and that's it.
