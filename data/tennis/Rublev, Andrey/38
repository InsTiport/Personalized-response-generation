4-1, 4-3, 4-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How does it feel to be in the final?  Did that feel like your best performance of the week so far?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Yeah, this was my best tennis in all the week.  I'm really happy, and I hope tomorrow I can show even better game.
Q. Congrats for this amazing performance today.  If you're going to meet against Chung, what aspect of your game are you going to change?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Well, we'll see.  I mean, I play him many times and he know how I play; I know how he play.  We will see if I can change something tomorrow if he win today.  We'll see.  It's tough to say now exactly.
I'll try, like always I will try to play my game to try to dictate, because the first match here, I wasn't playing that aggressive.  I didn't play that good.  I was missing a lot.  So I hope tomorrow I can show a better game.
Q. As the tournament has gone on, you seem to be more comfortable on the court and in the format and everything.  Why do you think that is match by match?
ANDREY RUBLEV: I don't know.  I guess I just finding the rhythm to playing every day matches, and that's it, because last tournaments I didn't play very well and I was losing fast.
And now I played three matches in group.  Now semifinals.  So I just get used to, and I think I find the rhythm.  Now I'm playing better.
Q. How are you going to approach this match mentally?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Which one?
Q. Tomorrow, tomorrow's final.
ANDREY RUBLEV: You mean mentally?
Q. Mentally, yeah.
ANDREY RUBLEV: Just try to keep, to be focused, because with these rules, even if you are losing and you are playing worse than your opponent, you still have chances to win.
That's the main thing with these rules.  Even if you don't feel the ball and you are losing all the match, one point, you can change everything and you can win.  So we'll see tomorrow.
Q. If you're down in the head-to-head like you are against Chung, can you play a bit freer?  Can you just go for your shots?
ANDREY RUBLEV: Yeah, I will try to dictate, I will try to take my forehand, I will try to give him less time.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Because I know how he play.  He's really fast.  He have really amazing shots.  Also, he like to play counterattack, and he's doing this well.
So we'll see.  I think, I hope it's going to be great match.
Q. Do you usually train on the mental aspect?  What do you do for this?
ANDREY RUBLEV: No, there is no -- I mean, I'm not doing something special for the mental stuff.  I mean, it's just, I guess, understanding how you have to be, how you have to perform, the way you have to be on the court.
If you want to be a good player, you have to fight every ball no matter what.  Even if you feel not good, you have to still pushing yourself.
I guess that's how it works.  You learn first time it's a little bit tougher to push every time.  Second time is a little bit more easy and like this, like this, you improve your mental part.
