THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you feel about going into the second round after today's match?  
ANDREY RUBLEV: I mean, I'm really happy because Grigor, I mean, we have really tough matches in the past. He's a true champion. He have amazing career. He just did semifinal of Grand Slam.   
I know it's going to be really tough, especially first round when doesn't matter who you play. Always tough to win and to play because you need to feel the court, the atmosphere. I know is going to be tough.   
But in the end, I play well today. I take all my chances. I could finish the match.   
 Q.  You had a breakthrough in North America. Does that have an impact on your career, especially the victory in Cincinnati?  
ANDREY RUBLEV: Yeah, like I said many times, couple of times before in America, I didn't even expect that I'm going to play couple of tournaments there. By the lucky, I went alternate, and I did really great victories that I didn't expect.   
Of course, is give me a lot of confident, bring me back on the high position in the ranking, which has allowed me now to play all the tournaments till the end of the year main draw.   
I mean, yeah, it did a little huge change for the moment. We'll see if I can keep it this way and I can keep working and still improve.   
 Q.  From the new generation of Russia, there are also newcomers. Does that bring you extra pressure?  
ANDREY RUBLEV: Not really because I try to focus more on me, to focus what I'm doing, not to look what the others are doing.   
In the end, if someone also do, doesn't matter which age players doing we, it's great job for him. It means he's working in a good way, the right way, and he deserve to be there, to do good results. It's means that I might do something wrong, that I'm not working enough, I'm not working in the right way.   
If I'm not doing good results, so it means I need to change something. Or maybe I do everything right, but just something happens that you're unlucky and you have to have more patient because your moment also will come.   
I try to focus more on me.
