 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You have lost a match which you almost won. At what point do you think, crucial point, do you think the match turned around and changed?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: "Almost" doesn't count. You know, I think it was a good match overall. I played the way I wanted to play. I just was not consistent, and there weren't any turning points. There was equal game.  
 I don't know. I was fighting every -- you know, she's a tough player. She's a tough fighter. I was fighting every point, and some games I was playing very consistent my game and some games I was not playing consistent, and I think that made the difference. That's it.  
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Did it make you nervous at any time in the match that every ball you shot at Radwanska somehow came back?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Not somehow. She's a good mover on the court. That's something you have to expect when you play against a player that moves really well.  
 But I think a lot of the times I just didn't use those opportunities that I had, and that's it. But overall I think I was doing all the right things. I just couldn't, you know, couldn't manage to be consistent enough to beat her today. That's it.  
  
  Q. You played Radwanska four times this year. You lost all the matches. Why?   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I didn't lose all the matches. I won in Miami.  
  
  Q. But last four matches you lost with Radwanska.   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: She was just playing better than me. That's it.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) During the third set, around 5-3 or 5-4 when you were on the break, you turned to your coach, I think it was your coach, and said something. What is it you said?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I don't know. I don't remember. Maybe I said that I have to stay more aggressive, I have to play my game. I don't know.
