THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Vera. 


Q.  What changed the match in the third set, do you think? 

VERA ZVONAREVA:  I think I just finally found my game.  I started to play a little bit more aggressive and without mistakes.  I think because I had much more mistakes in the first and the second set.  I think that's why it was 6-1 in the third. 

Q.  Brad Gilbert mentioned today he didn't believe that the world's No. 1 woman could defeat the top one thousand men.  Do you think those sorts of comments are helpful to the women's competition? 

VERA ZVONAREVA:  I don't know, is tough questions.  But why should you always ask about the men's and women's tennis?  I mean, it's really different.  Like you take any other sport:  sometimes you have a men's sport, you don't have women's sport.  For gymnastics, you have women's sport and you don't have men's sport.  So I don't that think you should -- he just should have talking about this because just biologically, women, they're different from men.  Sometimes we can see really interesting matches in women's tennis, and sometimes we can see really interesting matches in men's tennis.  I wouldn't even think about this question.

Q.  Did you think that Nicole was affected by the injury at all?

VERA ZVONAREVA:  When I was on the court, I wasn't thinking about this, I was just thinking about my game.  So I don't know what's going on with her.  But I hope everything is fine.  But when I'm on the court, I don't really think.  Just trying to do my best on the court.
