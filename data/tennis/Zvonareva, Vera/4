 V. AZARENKA/V. Zvonareva
  6-2, 6-3 
  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: You know, I was not consistent, but I played my game. I know as soon as I will be consistent at that, the results will be different.  
  
  Q. Vera, how was that today? Obviously a tough match for you, but you reached the semifinals when you didn't necessarily think you were going to. What can you take away positively from that?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I think I have to be positive, because there is nothing wrong that I've done. I was finally playing my game.   
 Maybe my game was not consistent enough to go through to the final stage in this tournament, but I definitely enjoyed my week. I was playing the tennis that I wanted to play. I'm happy about that.   
 So now I'm really looking forward for some time off, and, you know, for the offseason training, and hopefully, you know, I can start off well the next season.  
  
  Q. Are you going to have a nice holiday somewhere, maybe on a beach?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I have no idea. First I want to go home and I want to, I don't know, just be at home for a couple of weeks and then we'll see. If I feel like I can jump on the plane and go somewhere, I will go. But if not, then I will stay home, because unfortunately the closest beach from Moscow is like five-hour flight. So it's a bit too far.
