6-0, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. The Russians have dominated 1-2-3. What does that say about Russian tennis?
 VERA ZVONAREVA: You know, we've been asked this question a lot recently because we were playing so well. You know, all the Russians were playing so well. It's just amazing that we all were able to do it so good here, you know, to get three medals for our country. 
 I think we're all very proud of it. It means that Russian tennis -- well, it's Olympic Games, and the Russian tennis is just at a great level, it's at the highest level. I think we're all very proud about it.
