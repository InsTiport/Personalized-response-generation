 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Vera, please.   
  
  Q. That was a remarkably fluctuating match. You came back from Love-6 and almost won it in the end.   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I don't think we both showed our best tennis. But we fought well.   
 In the end, it was a good match.   
  
  Q. Both of you seemed to be suffering from physical problems out there. You had the trainer on. She was near to collapsing. Any explanation for that?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I don't know. I had a nosebleed, so I can also answer for myself. You better ask Caroline what was she dealing with.   
 But, yeah, we still fought the best we could.   
  
  Q. You came in as an alternate. Did that make things very difficult? Would you have preferred it to have worked out that Dinara retired before playing yesterday?   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Well, first of all, you know, I don't wish anyone to get injured and I feel bad for Dinara because I know what it is to deal with an injuries. I hope she can recover fast, you know.   
 But for me, didn't really matter. You know, I was here. It is tough when you an alternate because you never know what's going to happen, how you should practice, when you should practice. It just happened so fast. So it's difficult to prepare yourself the best you can.   
 But that's our job, being a professional tennis players. Made it to the alternate. It's still prestigious to be here at the Championships. You know, so everyone is doing their best.
