V. ZVONAREVA/C. Wozniacki
  6-2, 4-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. It was a tough game against Wozniacki. Can you tell us your performance? I mean, yesterday and today, can you compare it on the court?
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Well, it is very difficult to compare because I had two different opponents. I think overall I played a little bit more consistent today, and that helped to win the match. Maybe I'm a little bit more used to the condition and it helps, as well.

 Q. You seem pretty kind of -- you didn't seem to kind of believe in yourself yesterday, but today you seemed to be hitting winners all over the court. Where did all that confidence come from?
 VERA ZVONAREVA: I'm always confident in myself. I always believe in myself.
 I think yesterday it was just a little bit difficult. She's a different player, and, you know, I was trying my best yesterday, but some shots weren't going in. And maybe I was a little bit slower, and today I was a little bit quicker and I was able to, yeah, make a lot of shots.
 I don't know. I don't really -- I'm always confident. You know, I always believe in myself and just -- it was just a little bit better today than yesterday.

 Q. Is it difficult for you to play every day game? You'll play again tomorrow?
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Well, you know, we're used to it. We play week after week all year long, and a lot of the times we have to play a lot of back-to-back matches.
 It is nothing new, and, you know, when we have this format here, we will have one day off somewhere if you go all the way to the finals.
 So I'm not really thinking about it, you know. I have to play tomorrow, I have to play. It's not a big deal.
