 V. ZVONAREVA /K. Flipkens 
  6-0, 6-0 
   
  Q. Are you trying to be known as super woman?   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Why do you say that (laughing)?   
  
  Q. Is it five matches in five days or six matches in six days? I don't remember if you played last Thursday.   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Yeah. Actually, I don't know. Four there, two here, and probably six. Four in a row there, and I had one day off after my first singles. Yeah, six matches in six days.  
  
  Q. First of all, how did you get through this day's match? You arrived what time?   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Actually, I took a flight, that flight at 1:00 a.m. which got me here around 5:30 in the morning. So then I got to the hotel around 7:00. Tried to sleep a little bit.   
 Yeah, came here. Practiced, it was difficult. You know, the match was so long, but I'm happy I got through that one.  
  
  Q. And today, 45 minutes?  
 VERA ZVONAREVA: Yeah, I didn't -- you never expect matches like this, you know. I was getting ready for a tough match. And actually it was tough, but I was just very consistent today, and I didn't really give her chances to get in the match. I'm very pleased with that.   
  
  Q. How did you get through yesterday's match?   
 VERA ZVONAREVA: You know, I was just trying to concentrate on what I have to do, you know, because I wasn't used to the courts, to the balls. It was absolutely different.   
 You know, I was just trying my best. I started off well, then I think my energy level dropped a little bit. It was difficult.   
 But I just kept pushing myself. Never gave up. And well, if -- I just play and play out there. If I fall on the court and can't move anymore, then I can't play anymore.   
 But I believed I can get through it and I can, you know, was just trying to push myself to play, to try and not think about the result at all. I think that was the key to winning the match.
