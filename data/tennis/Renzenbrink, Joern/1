Q.  Just one quick thing, about Bjorkman's game, a lot of us don't know him that well, what is it he does best and are you surprised at how well he's been playing this tournament? 
 
JOERN RENZENBRINK:  Yeah, I played him already about 8 or 9 months ago, and I knew this was his way to play and that he could play very, very well.  And, yeah, this tournament he's playing very good tennis and I couldn't do much more than I did today.  
 

Q.  And he's pretty much a serve and volleyer, it looks like he likes to go to the net? 
 
JOERN RENZENBRINK:  That's what I don't like too much because my last opponents they were all playing from the baseline.  I was attacking, and this time, it went 50/50, he attacked me and then I came in.  
 

Q.  What was the thing you were wearing on your ankle; was that an injury? 
 
JOERN RENZENBRINK:  Some years ago, it's just for protection.
