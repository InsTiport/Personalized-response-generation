Q.  What happened in the final set?  You looked to be in control.  
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I looked what?  
 

Q.  To be in control. 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  The beginning, yes.  Then he took the control.  The match turned for him. 
 

Q.  Was it surprising for you that he made it to come back, because usually on clay courts we saw him losing third sets like 1-6?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  He's playing always good against me, so I have no surprise with this.  
 

Q.  Seemed to question a lot of calls. 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Who?  
 

Q.  Did that unsettle or upset you at all? 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Him?  
 

Q.  Yes. 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  It's clay court, so we can check the marks.  Some marks was very close from the line, so he just asked to check.  
 

Q.  All that questioning didn't have any effect on you at all?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  No.  
 

Q.  Did you think you got a lot of bad calls?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Me?  
 

Q.  Yes. 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  No.  
 

Q.  He played very well, but he also got quite a lot of balls which skidded off the lines.  Did that have much effect on the outcome of the match?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  His game is taking a lot of risk.  So today he played a lot of balls very close from the line.  So that was the game I have to play with.
