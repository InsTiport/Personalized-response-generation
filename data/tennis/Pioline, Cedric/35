Q.  Cedric, where did you learn how to play baseball?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Just watching TV, New York. 
 

Q.  Have you ever had a match where you had no breakpoint opportunities?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yeah, yeah.  Happens sometimes against a big server like Ivanisevic, Stich, Sampras. 
 

Q.  It didn't seem like you were playing that badly, but just that his serve was so impossible to handle that it made the rest of the game tough.
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yeah, it's difficult because he's winning his serve very easy.  So after I have to fight more with my serve.  So maybe if I do some mistakes, I mean, all the pressure is on my shoulder because he's winning, serve like 40-Love, 40-15 each time. 
 

Q.  What did you think in the first game when he hit the ball eight times and you never touched it?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I mean, I was ready for this because I knew how he was playing, the way he's playing.  Just have to wait for opportunity.  But today I didn't have one. 
 

Q.  And how good do you think he can become?  He's already beaten Sampras once this year.  Do you see him as the next great player?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yeah, he can improve his game a lot, I think.  He can be Top 10 player if he's doing the right job -- the right work, I mean. 
 

Q.  What about the rest of his game other than the serve?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  He's a good player. 
 

Q.  When an opponent serves that well against you, is it a temptation for you to try to start to serve very hard also, and does that distract you?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Sorry.  I did not hear you. 
 

Q.  When an opponent is serving that well against you, do you then try and serve well, too?  Do you try and outserve him?  Do you kind of get caught up in that?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  No, not really. 
 

Q.  How would you describe his game at the net?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  At the net? 
 

Q.  Right.
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  It's easy when you serve like this.  Sometimes I did some good returns, he was in trouble.  But when he gets the ball at the shoulder, you  just have to push. 
 

Q.  Who is the toughest server you have faced?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  He is one of them. 
 

Q.  Is he tougher than Goran?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I don't know
