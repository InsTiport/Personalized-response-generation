 MODERATOR: Questions for Cedric.  
 
Q. What was the problem out there today? You lost at Nottingham. Was that a factor at
all? Are you out of form at the moment?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yeah, I think I don't play very good. I don't make the good choices
here. I don't serve very well. I do a lot of double-fault. Also the guy today play good. I
think he tried -- he was very hungry when he came on court. I didn't play good enough to
stop him.  
 
Q. Is it more difficult now where you're sort of past the age of 30 when you lose a bit
of form? Is it getting harder to pick yourself up again?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: When you lose form, whatever, if you are 15 years old or 50 years old,
it's the same. You are out of form, you are out of form. Doesn't matter which age you are.
If you don't play good, you don't play good. It's not because you're older or younger.
