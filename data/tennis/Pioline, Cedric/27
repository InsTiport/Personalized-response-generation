Q.  In your career, have you ever come back from 6-Love, 5-1 in the second set?

CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I don't think so.  Especially, I mean, semifinal against a player like Berasategui, hard player, saving match point.  I don't think so.


Q.  Have you ever thought something in particular in the third set when you were coming back rising your level of tennis?

CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I try to play point after point. Don't think about the score, because I was very down.  Just play, run, play point after point, nothing more.


Q.  Last question is about your physical condition right now.  Do you feel very tired?

CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Now it's better, some treatment.


Q.  You had a little bit of cramps after the match?

CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Cramps, no, nothing.  I think maybe a bit overheat.
