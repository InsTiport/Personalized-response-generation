Q. Cedric, what was it today? What was lacking to win the match?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: A bit of freshness.

Q. Physical or mental freshness?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Both, a little bit. Yes, both.

Q. During the match, your tennis wasn't too bad.

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Right, it wasn't too bad. I made a couple of points more and I would
have won the match.

Q. How did you feel in this great hall, a lot of light, compared to Malmo in Sweden?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Nothing special. The court is always the same size, so no special
impression. I didn't think about it.

Q. Did you come here straight Monday night?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: No. I didn't really know that was my program.

Q. When did you return to Munich? 

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yesterday.

Q. In the afternoon?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes.

Q. You were at the Elysees Palace in Paris with the French president. Was that okay?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes, it was a great moment. Such a satisfaction after a great win. We
really had been digging ourselves into that against Sweden.

Q. Was he nice, the president?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes, he was very nice, very charming.

Q. And you went up the Champs-Elysees?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Well, it was a great moment to see all this crowd that had come to see
us, just to see us. I wouldn't have thought there were so many people. It was a great
moment knowing that they all came to thank you, that is really a rare moment.

Q. You look exhausted?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Right.

Q. Are you happy it's over?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: It's over. I'm glad -- nobody likes to lose. Whatever shape you come to
the court with, you try to deliver a good match, don't you?

Q. It's over for you, no club matches anymore, nothing more? What now? 

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I'm going to leave for holiday now, relax, then I get back to
practicing.

Q. Long holidays like last year?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Two weeks at least.

Q. And the Australian Open next year?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Oh, yes, I'm registered. I'm on the list. I have to see when I've got
to go there. Yes, of course, I'm going.

Q. Two weeks in the sun as last year?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes, maybe. I'm not sure. I'm not certain. So many things have happened
these last weeks. I have to think about it, bring a couple of lose ends together.

Q. After the Davis Cup win, any commitments?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Oh, yes, certainly there will be some commitments. Right now since I
haven't been in Paris, I don't know what's waiting for me. I didn't read a single
newspaper. I don't know what's happening.

Q. Talking about the match, were you surprised about the way Jakob played?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Surprised, yes. He had very good shots. I know that in the past he had
a lot of success. He made tremendous pressure today. He played well, what can I say?

Q. What was the main problem today, to stay focused on the match after a great party or
the fact of being tired because of the playing weekend?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Both are closely linked, aren't they? You are tired so you can't focus
really. It's more difficult to stay focused. Both seem to play a role. I think staying
focused is hard.

Q. They all have cramps during the weekend, Davis Cup. What about you? You are
physically fit, I understand?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: No, I didn't have any cramps. I didn't suffer from cramps. I was
exhausted, that's right.
