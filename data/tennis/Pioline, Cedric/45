 Q. Did you ever feel like the forgotten man of this tournament? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Sorry?  
 
Q. Have you ever felt like you were the forgotten man of this tournament? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: No, I don't think so. I mean, it's okay for me. I just want to play my
match and be quiet.  
 
Q. Do you feel any -- a real difference between last year's match and this year's
match? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: I mean, it's the first round and everybody is fighting like crazy and
you have just to take it as it come and just to win this match, he was playing good and
it's okay--  
 
Q. Do you feel any more comfortable at the tournament after the good tournament last
year when you came in here? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: I like this tournament. Last week I played well, it was really good
time to do a tournament and gave me some confidence, so, it's okay.  
 
Q. You played on one of the old courts today; right? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes.  
 
Q. Do you think a finalist in this tournament deserves a better assignment than that? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes, and no. I didn't play so well in the beginning of the year. So,
maybe they are expecting more results from me. So, maybe if I win some matches here, I
will have bigger hopes.  
 
Q. You didn't play great tennis after your great experience at the Open last year. What
happened to your game? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: I did play good tennis after, this final year.  
 
Q. But at the time you got to Lipton you weren't making a lot of finals or even
semifinals? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yeah, I didn't play so well. I mean, I had some problem, I stopped with
my coach and I didn't feel my tennis so well, so -- for some reason.  
 
Q. Who was your coach? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Who was my coach. Ghost coach. Don't remember. Dumont.  
 
Q. What was the problem? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Some problem with winning. I don't want to explain it between us.  
 
Q. Is that D-U-M-O-N-T? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes, that's right.
