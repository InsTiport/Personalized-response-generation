Q. To the next game, what do you prefer?  Gustavo Kuerten or Petr Korda? 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I don't know who I play, so -- it's Kuerten or Korda? 
 

Q. I think so.
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE: :  I mean, 16 players here. Everybody's playing well.  I never played against Kuerten, but is Top-10 Player now.  I think both are playing very good.  Maybe Kuerten on this surface will be a little bit easier, but it's going to be a tough match any way.
