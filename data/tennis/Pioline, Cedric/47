 Q.  After the first two games he seemed to turn things around
and control it from then on except for a few games.  How were
you not able to control the momentum 

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  It was close, I mean, the key points, he won
it.  That is why he won the match. So I think it was very close.
I mean a lot of game points, a lot of deuce on his serve, on my
serve and after I lost this game so that is why he took the match.


 Q.  Are you still feeling a lot of frustration; particularly
with your forehand?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I have no frustration.  I mean, he played well.
 It was very tough because when I tried to play, he doesn't go
back and I couldn't go to the net, so it was very difficult to
make the points.

 Q.  Cedric, who came down and spoke to you the first half
of the match?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  The supervisor?

 Q.  Yes.

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yes.

 Q.  What did you guys talk about?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  About something.

 Q.  Was it over a call or something like that?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yeah, because the umpire came down and talk
to me and he doesn't have to talk to me like he did, so I ask
for the supervisor.

 Q.  What is your opinion about the new ranking system, the
Grand Slam, the increased points for the Grand Slams?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I think it is good, but I would prefer it last
year because I think I am the only Grand Slam finalist who didn't
reach the Masters, so for me, maybe it came too late.  I hope
for this year I will do again good results.  I think it is good
because when you reach the final you have to do the difference.


 Q.  Talking again about tonight's match, was your shoulder
feeling okay?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Yeah, I mean, I had no problems about it.

 Q.  What is your plan after the-- what is your schedule after
the tournament?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  My schedule is to go back to France for Davis
Cup.

 Q.  I know it.  I came from Hungary.  Do you know your opponent?

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  No.

 Q.  You can sleep normally.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid.

 CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Thank you.
