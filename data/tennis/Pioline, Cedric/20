USTA:  Questions for Cedric.  
 
 
Q.  Long five-setter.  You finished the match with a 6-2 set.  Do you come out feeling confident at this point?  General impressions of the match. 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  I think I played okay.  I mean, the guy today played a good match.  He took all the chances he had.  I'm happy I could win the match because it could be for him.  
 
Q.  With the top seeds out, do you see this as possibly a Grand Slam event that you have a realistic shot of taking?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  You know, I beat Rafter.  Today I had a very difficult match against a qualifier.  Everybody's playing very good in the tournament.  You have to take match-by-match.   If you think you're going into the final, and you don't play the match before, you will never be in final.  I have to concentrate on each match.  Today was tough.  I have to think now about my next match.
