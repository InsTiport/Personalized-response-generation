 Q. Did you have any idea he was injured? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: No. Surely, no. I didn't see he start to cramp, because tiebreaker in
the second set, I think he played normal like he played since the beginning.  
 
Q. How do you feel after that?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Tired, of course. It's very hot out there. There's a lot of effort
physically for to play. I mean, you sweat a lot, and it's more tiring than normal.  
 
Q. (Inaudible)?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yeah, but I had some chances first set. I had one break, a couple of
breakpoints. I was up 3-Love in the tiebreak. I was disappointed, you know, because I
think I had more chances than he had. But I tried to just stay in the match and keep my
serve, and it worked. 
 
Q. How frustrating was that in the first set, you missed the opportunity?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yeah, I could make some points. He made some very good shots on the
breakpoints. It's always a disappointment. You have to keep playing and try to do a little
bit more every time. Sometimes, I mean, you have a happy end.  
 
Q. Could you talk about playing Michael tomorrow?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: Michael is a tough opponent. I mean, even if his ranking is went down
in the last few months, I'm sure he's still able to play very good, like he did today. I
don't have a good record against him, so I'm going to try to play the kind of tennis I
played today and against Moya on Wednesday.  
 
Q. Is it easier or more difficult to play Chang whose style is somewhat like Courier's?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: No, I mean, I'm ready for everybody, no matter.  
 
Q. You said you don't have a good record against Michael. What has he done well against
you in the past? 
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: He's very - how do you say - he gets a good average in his game. He's
always doing shots, one more shot. He's running a lot. He's able to pick some unbelievable
balls. It's always difficult to play against a player like this because you never know
when the point is finish.  
 
Q. Do you like that?
 
 CEDRIC PIOLINE: No, I don't like that (laughter).
