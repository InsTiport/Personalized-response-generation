Q. Were you fed up with that day?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: It was a long day.

Q. Is it the first time it happens to you here?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Every year I believe but not always to me only.

Q. It happened to you against Costa three years ago?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: It is possible. I wish him the same achievements.

Q. When it is raining what happens exactly? Does that make you angry?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: We watch beautiful girls through the window --

Q. Oh, I see. What kind of state of mind did you have when you stepped on the court?
Did you believe it was a boring task to do?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: -- (cont'g) I watch beautiful boys..... (Laughs). 

Q. Did you try to do it as fast as possible so it wouldn't last long?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: The first match is never easy. We never know how it is going to happen
especially with Larsson who is a good player, but unforecastable.

Q. 6-2, 6-2, one hour.

CEDRIC PIOLINE: It is good and especially here we have six matches to play in seven
days so it can be difficult so if you can save your strength, it is very good.

Q. When you were waiting did you have moments when you thought you would prefer to play
the next day or did you want to play the same day?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I prefer to play today but it was really just the limit. When we
stepped on the court it was raining a little bit.

Q. The second round you are going to play Novak, how do you feel about that?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I will think about it when the time comes. I am happy of what I did
today and I hope I am going to continue in the same way.

Q. Is it your match against Edberg which made you fit?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: He is still playing very well.

Q. He plays a serve and volley game.

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Sometimes he hits the frame with the serve, but he does beautiful
volleys.

Q. You arrived a while ago, last week. You had time to adapt to these particular
conditions. Were you able to play a lot?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I was able to play as much as I wanted in spite of the conditions.
Today is really a bad day, the worst day, it was raining without stopping.

Q. Otherwise after Key Biscayne you rested and you practiced on clay immediately?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I rested a little bit. No use to go too far. From now until the month
of July if you watch my schedule there is not much free time.

Q. When did you start working on clay?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: About ten days ago.

Q. Last year you didn't have very good results at that stage.

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I played as well as last year in the first round.

Q. Did you find your automatic reactions? Did you feel good? Did you believe it was
hard?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: It is always a bit difficult. The only thing is to try to be in the
right place at the right moment.

Q. Physically you feel better in your mind than a year ago?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: For the time being I am feeling well. We will see tomorrow.

Q. How do you approach that match, with fear or confidence?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Which match? This tournament?

Q. Yes.

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I tried to settle my tennis. I tried to fix my shots and to do as many
matches as possible here.

Q. A match like that, is it a good win giving you confidence?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: Yes.
