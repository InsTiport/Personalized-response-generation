THE MODERATOR:  First question for Cedric, please. 


Q.  Just general thoughts on your performance really.  Were you worried about going 4-2 down in the first set?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I think I had kind of slow start, and I didn't know what to expect with Andrew's game.  He's playing a strange way.  I mean, you don't know what to expect.  Then I try to get a higher concentration to play better, and it worked. 


Q.  Was there a feeling that you could always try and find another gear to move up to in that match, or do you feel you started off playing 70, 75 percent and you could always improve?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I think I played pretty solid, but I can improve my game.  I hope it will be the case for the next match. I try to just play and don't try to play too complicate, and it seems it's working.  So I'll see if I can do something more difficult. 


Q.  You've got Arazi up next, who, as I'm sure you know, put Magnus Norman out.  What are your thoughts going into that match?

CEDRIC PIOLINE: I think Hicham is a good player on the clay.  His natural game is very good for this surface, so I expect a tough match.  Last time we played it was very tight, so I will have to play a good match if I will have a chance to win.
