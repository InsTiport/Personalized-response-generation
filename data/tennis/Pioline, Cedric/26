Q.  Cedric, with your arm, could you tell us exactly what went wrong, what was wrong with it, what the injury was? 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  Well, it's a tiredness, and it led to a certain heaviness in my arm and a loss of strength.  It was a big handicap.  I couldn't serve as I wanted.  It was really a big handicap. 
 

Q.  Is it largely all the effort from yesterday or was it something that's been coming on for a few matches?
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  It's an accumulation.  It's my first tournament on clay.  On this surface, you have to play more shots than on other surfaces.  Six matches in seven days, because I didn't play Monday, is a lot.  Of course, yesterday's match was exhausting.  I think exhausting is the word. 
 

Q.  You looked also to have some other problems?  I saw you also with the ice.  Apart from the arm, you also had other physical problems today? 
 
CEDRIC PIOLINE:  No.  The physiotherapist told me it could come from behind the shoulder.  But, in fact, it was the same thing, so he put ice.
