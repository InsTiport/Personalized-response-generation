Q.  Can you talk about playing Serena.

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  For the Serena match, I will try my best.  She's a top player again.  I will try my best and try to enjoy.  This is very important for me.

Q.  You never played with her?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  We played two, three times.  Three times, I think.  I lost always.  But this is a new match completely.  As I said before, I feel very good.  I'm really gonna have fun and I go for it.

Q.  You're not going to think, "Oh, wow, Serena is really rusty.  Maybe now is the time to play her"?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  No, actually there is not so much time to think that.  When you go on the court, the most important is not to be nervous.  I will try to be relaxed, and really try to enjoy the match.  I hope the result is going to be positive.  But I know that is very tough.  The only thing that I have to do is just really to try. 

Q.  Jill Craybas, who lost to Serena today, said that she thinks Serena does have this kind of aura, she walks out on the court with confidence.  Some of the players say, "I can't deal with this." 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Yeah, she's very strong player.  I mean, she's kind of similar like today.  She hits very hard also, Serena.  I really respect her as a person, as a player.  I have nothing to say, actually, just really try my best.

Q.  You're not going to feel defeated before you go out there?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  No.  If I am like this, it's almost lose the match before to play.  I just have to go for it and just to believe to myself.
