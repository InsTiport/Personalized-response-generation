Q.  How do you feel beating Anna Kournikova tonight?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Great.  Good feeling.  I played really good.  I felt good on the court.  I really press, and I play my game.  Finally, everything  -- it was all right.  And finally the results came. 

Q.  Seemed like the crowd was really behind Anna.  Did that bother you at all? 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  No.  I knew it from the beginning anyway.  I mean, she's a great player, she's a big name.  Anyway, I have some, let's say, Greek friends outside who really help me.  And I was positive in the court, but Anna make more mistake in the match.  And when she make the mistake, I was there and I finish the point. 

Q.  Well, I will say that you could be the next Anna Kournikova in looks.  You're very pretty.  So, I do believe you beat Anna Kournikova twice: On the field, and being very beautiful, too. 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  I mean, as I said before, I played really good today and I played my game and I was every point fighting almost.  Almost, except two, three games, I lose concentration.  But in the first set I felt a little bit my legs and I probably pull a little bit the muscle.  I mean, I'm looking forward for the next match.

Q.  What follows now? 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Jennifer Capriati is the next one.  I know I just played  -- we just played together in Australia and was pretty tough match and good match.  I know she's anyway big player, and I'm looking forward to play. 

Q.  Good luck. 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Thanks a lot. 

Q.  Could you tell she was getting frustrated out there? 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Sorry? 

Q.  Could you tell that Anna was getting a little frustrated out there?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Probably, yeah.  Probably.  Maybe she feel a little press, I mean she's playing in the country of here.  I think it's normal.  But as I say in the beginning, I mean, I was there and finally she make more mistake than me.  And it was some really close point, and anyway I was probably a little bit more positive, can be.  And fighting too much.
