Q.  It was a wonderful match.  Congratulations on winning your match. 

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  Thank you. 

Q.  I wanted to ask how much pain you're in and to what extent you think it's possible you are going to play tomorrow?

ELENI DANIILIDOU:  I mean, I really couldn't even walk in the end.  Just I pull the muscle there in to my leg, to my left leg.  It was really too much, the pain.  But I had to fight.  Don't forget, I am playing Greece.  Olympic Games in Greece is too special to leave on that moment really the match.  There's no way even if the physio said to me, "You have really to stop."  That's all (tearing up).
