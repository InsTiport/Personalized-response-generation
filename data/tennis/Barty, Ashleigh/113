A. BARTY/A. Sabalenka   
6-7, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  No easy first rounds.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No, definitely not.  I think that was a very tricky matchup.  I thought it was actually a pretty high quality match.  But very happy to squeak through.   
 Q.  How much did you know about her going into the match?  What do you think was the key in terms of turning it around?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Not a hell of a lot.  But I knew she had a big game, is very much a first-strike player.  I was sort of ready for it.  It took me a while to sort of get used to her patterns, understand where she wanted to hit the ball.   
No, I felt like I had my plans in place.  I knew if I hung around long enough, I'd be able to get into the match, work it into my favor a bit.   
 Q.  You knew the noise was coming.  Elaborate a bit on your feelings.  The crowd were involved a bit.  What was your take from the other end?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, we knew it was coming.  I hadn't seen a lot of her matches, but my coach had watched vision.  He was aware it was coming.   
A lot of players grunt.  A lot of players don't grunt.  It's just the way they are, the way they play.  For me, it wasn't a distraction.  It wasn't anything like that.  It was just part and parcel.  I knew it was coming.   
 Q.  Does it irritate you at all?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Not at all.  I think if something that small can irritate you, that's a bigger issue in itself.   
I knew it was coming.  I was prepared for it.  I mean, obviously in the first couple of games, you get used to it.  Everyone has a bit of a different grunt.  But, no, you get used to it.   
 Q.  How pleased were you not to just get the win but to be tested?  There's a time when you might panic, a lot of players would panic in a first-round match playing at home on Laver, to hold it together there?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I'd love to not be tested too much (smiling).   
No, very pleasing to come through that in such a tricky match.  It could have easily gone the other way, had I not found a way to get through the match.  I felt like the experiences and the matches I went through last year really held me in good stead tonight.  It was sort of nice to be able to use that straightaway.   
 Q.  You saved us from a whitewash today.  The only Australian to win.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Good for me, but not so good for the other Aussies.  No, we've still got a few playing tomorrow, a couple on the girl's side.  No, actually wasn't aware of that.   
 Q.  Talk about your next-round opponent.  Similar in some ways?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: She's very much a first-strike player as well.  Played her a couple times, not on hard court for a very long time, I don't think.  But, yes, I think we'll have to sit down, refresh, look at a bit of vision, look at her patterns.   
Again, it's going to be important for me to move well, switch on right from the first ball, be ready to dig out some tough balls early.   
 Q.  How aware were you of what she was doing in Sydney?  She played a really good tournament.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Giorgi?   
 Q.  Yeah.  She was playing a very good tournament there, improved from last year.  Were you watching any of her matches?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: The only ones I saw was the ones where she was playing before me.  Just keeping an eye on the score.  Saw a little bit of her against Angie.   
Yeah, I think in my eyes it's been massive improvements, it's been no secret, especially on serve.  I feel like I've got a reasonably clear plan to play Giorgi.  Even with some of the improvements she's had, hopefully my game has improved as well.   
 Q.  I think it's 38 on Thursday.  No one likes to play in that heat.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Aussies do (smiling).   
 Q.  Would it be in your advantage?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Absolutely.  I love it.  From Brisbane, nice and hot up there.  38 would be perfect.   
Thanks, guys.  Let's go to bed.
