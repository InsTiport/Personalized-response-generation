A. BARTY/D. Collins   
7-5, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you sum that one up?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think today I knew that I needed to be better than I was in my first round, and overall it was a much better performance.  I think it was more solid.  There were still a few ebbs and flows, but overall, a match I was in control of a lot of time, which is what we're after.   
 Q.  How do you feel, like, the slice came into play today?  How are you feeling about its overall effectiveness so far?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's a massive part of my game.  It always has been.  It was a shot that I was taught when I was very young and something that I try to use to my advantage as much as possible, and there are certain matchups where I try to implement it a bit more and other ones where I have to have a better mix of the topspin backhand and the slice backhand.   
But today it was very much a point of focus for me, and I was able to use it effectively more times than not.   
 Q.  We know you don't know who you're playing next, but can you talk about potentially either side of the net, please?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: You need to tell me who it is.   
 Q.  They're out there now.  Court 14.  Su-Wei or...  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, obviously I have played Su-Wei a few times in doubles.  I have played her in singles, as well.  And was an extremely tough match obviously.  She has so much variety and so many options on the court and has the ability to make the match very creative and almost take it out of your hands, in a way.   
And Andrea I haven't played in a very, very long time.  I think I played her at the Hopman Cup when I was maybe, oh, 14 or 15 maybe?  Obviously that one is a bit of a clean slate.  She's an unbelievable competitor that has been around the block, has had such longevity in her career and tough as nails.   
I think regardless who it is, it's a very different matchup but tough nonetheless.   
 Q.  How much confidence did you get from the way you played on the big points today?  Because there were a few times you could have let her in but you won the bulk of those crucial moments.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think when I needed to, I served well.  I was a little bit smarter with where I served on those bigger points and was able to get myself back in control.  I think ultimately that's what we're after is when you're in the big points and the big moments is to come up with your best tennis.   
I think today I was able to do that a little bit more often than she was.  In the end, I was able to run away with it.   
 Q.  Danielle is one of only a handful of players on the WTA right now who has a female coach.  I know you have worked with women in Fed Cup before and obviously you're happy with Craig now.  Is a female coach something you have ever considered?  What do you think it would take for there to be greater numbers than there are now coaching on the women's side especially but the men's side potentially, too --  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Personally I'm very happy with Tyz.  There is no reason to change.  I'm having the best results of my career with Tyz.   
It's nice to see female coaches out and about on both the men's and women's sides.  For me there is no need for change, and I don't think that I ever will.   
 Q.  Are you getting better navigating your way through the Grand Slams, like after the quarterfinal appearances?  Is it something that takes a bit of time to get used to with a couple of days between matches?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a different base just there is so much attention and energy around the place.  The more you do get used to it, the more you can be relaxed and play your normal and best tennis.  I think I have certainly been able to deal with all the external stuff a lot better around Grand Slams.   
My tennis has always been there.  I just felt like in the last 12 months I have been able to have that consistency a bit more, across all levels, WTA Tour level and at Grand Slams I think I have had a consistency across all bases.   
 Q.  Can you elaborate on what Tyz has actually added to that?  You talked about the past 12 months and those improvements, please.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think a general development.  To be honest, clarity within my options and my game, obviously working closely with Crowe, as well.  Tyz, Crowe, and myself often have discussions as a team, as well as my trainers, physios, everyone is very much a unit in one team.  I think that's the best thing is that we are on the same page.   
There are days that things work better; there are days things work worse or don't work as well.  At the end of the day, nothing is as good nor as bad as it seems.  The sun will rise and you get another option and another chance to have another crack the next day.
