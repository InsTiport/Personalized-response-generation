A. BARTY/A. Cornet
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You were facing an opponent that was a bit on a roll after beating Kerber.  How do you think you were able to react today?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, Alize has been in good touch.  She's played well since Wimbledon especially.  I know it's always a tough match when I play her.  She showed me a lesson back in the French Open when I was quite young.  I had that match in the back of my mind.
No, she's a very tough player and I had to play well today.
Q. How did that experience serve you today?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's always nice trying to come out and beat someone who you haven't beaten before.  Particularly that was a long time ago.  But I still remember that kind of feeling.
Definitely extra motivated to come out and try to beat someone who's beaten you last time.
Q. How glad are you that you don't have to play twice today on top of the doubles?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, obviously the rain has caused a few dramas this week.  Yeah, I mean, I've played two matches yesterday, two matches today.  Yes, they're doubles, but they're still on top of that, as well.
I feel great.  I feel good on the court.  Great to come out and play with Demi, she's a great doubles player, a great chick.  It's nice to be able to play with her this week.
Q. A few years ago you quit tennis for a while.  You said you needed to take a break.  How has your relationship changed with tennis since then, especially with all the success you're having?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think I'm certainly in a different head space.  Physically I feel good on the court.  I feel like I have a better game, as well, a more complete game.  I think I'm just a much more mature person than when I was 17.
A no-brainer:  you sort of grow as a person and a player with age and with experience.  I feel like I've done that.  I'm extremely fortunate to have such a good team around me who help me every step of the way, criticize me when I need it, push me, and try to drive me to be the best I could be.
Q. During that break you played cricket.  How did that happen?  How do you compare your experience in a team sport versus tennis?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I've spoken a lot about my change to cricket, how it was kind of a last-minute thing through a physio I'd known.
Obviously there are very few comparisons from cricket to tennis.  I've spoken about that a lot in the past, that individual and team sports are very different.
Q. Do you feel there's any experience you took from that team sport experience in cricket that you can apply to your game now?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think they're completely separate.  To be honest, I always played a lot of doubles, so I got that sort of team aspect when I played with Casey.  Obviously had a really good doubles relationship with Casey and with other players, as well.
Yeah, there aren't too many comparisons.
Q. Now that you've been back for two years, you've been consistently top 20 in the world for almost a full year, do you feel like the path that took you there was the right one?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think every single player has a different path.  Everyone has a different journey, has different experiences.  This is just my journey.  This was my career, my experiences.  I feel like I'm in a really good place.  I feel like a top-20 player.  I feel consistent.  Certainly what I've done to get here has worked for me.
