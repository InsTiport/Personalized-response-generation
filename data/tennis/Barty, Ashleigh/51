A. SABALENKA/A. Barty   
7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your calf, what is your injury? When did you first feel it?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, obviously pretty disappointing. I felt like I had to protect it a little bit. It's important at this time of the year to listen to your body. There were certain things I wasn't able to do. Yeah, just a bit sore and tired and tight and all of those things.   
Kind of felt it quite early on in that first set. Was just trying to hang on a little bit. Progressively got a little bit worse. Just needed to give it a little bit of attention.   
 Q.  You came back really well in the first set. It looked maybe at some point the momentum was going for you. What do you think made the difference in the end? Was it the injury or something she did better?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I think overall Aryna was the better player today. She was able to control her service games a lot better. I felt at times I was hanging on a little bit. I had to take a lot of risks today to try to manage where I was at.   
Yeah, probably more so disappointed in the end that physically I wasn't able to kind of keep up to where I would have liked. Yeah, I mean, it's all good. I still was more well and truly in the match than I probably deserved to be.   
Yeah, it's all good.   
 Q.  This is your first tournament on the Asian swing. What do you make of your performance at this tournament?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Well, I think over the last three years, it hasn't been too bad. When you come to an event, you make three consecutive semifinals, you have one match where you're in the title, it's a successful event for you.   
I feel like this week has been no different. I feel like it's been a very positive week. Obviously disappointed with how it ended today, but still a very positive week.   
 Q.  Speaking of the first set, after you reeled her back in, had the 4-3 lead, seemed like the momentum was on your side. You have one game where the forehand seemed to let you down a little bit. Was that a focus thing? One bad game? How do you see that?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think even on Aryna's service game when I did break in that first set, she did gave me a few cheapies in that first game. I gave them back to her pretty easily at that 5-4 game. I played a poor game.   
Like I said, I was redlining a little bit, risking, having to play a risky brand of tennis, which I usually don't do too much of. It took its toll.   
Disappointed in the end. We look at it like every other match: We focus, move forward, make sure our body is all right for next week.   
 Q.  Speaking of the next few weeks of the season, any worry regarding the injury?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: It's something that you have to look after. It's important that you look after it right away. It's important you look after it over the next 24 to 48 hours.   
I'm sure it's nothing that is too alarming. I tried to do the best that I could to protect it in a way without letting it affect my tennis too much. Yeah, there will be no worries.   
 Q.  There's a few powerful players on the tour. What is it like to face Sabalenka? Is her power somehow different than Serena's or Andreescu's forehand?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I couldn't tell you about Andreescu. Never hit a ball with her.   
Obviously every player is a little bit different. Aryna has an extremely powerful game. She presents herself well on the court. She kind of takes that time away from you. It's intimidating at times, without a doubt.   
I think it's important to try to nullify that as best as you can. I felt like there were periods in the match today where I did that very well. There were periods where she's able to take control. You have to cop that on the chin.   
I mean, she's a quality player. She's going to do that at times. Yes, she is a very powerful player.   
 Q.  It's been a consistent season for you. Maybe there was a little bit ups and downs from Wimbledon. Do you think your mental side has changed a lot?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Sorry, could you repeat that.   
 Q.  Do you think your mental side has changed a little bit after Wimbledon?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I mean, I feel good. It's a long season. It's been important to try to prioritize different parts of the season. We've been very consistent. I feel like there have been small adjustments, small changes. It's been a very positive season across the board.   
A semifinal here is nothing to be ashamed of. It's a great week. We look forward to next week.
