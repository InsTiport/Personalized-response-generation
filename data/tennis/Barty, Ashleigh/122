A. BARTY/A. Pavlyuchenkova   
6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  So how did you feel the match went today?  How were the conditions?  What did you make of your form?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think this court is actually quite similar to the one in Brisbane where I train most of the time, anyway.  I think I feel really comfortable out on this court.   
Obviously tonight I was able to execute pretty well right from the get-go.  I like these conditions here.  I have had a pretty good record here in Asia so far this year.  Yeah, I feel like I played pretty well tonight.   
 Q.  You served really well tonight.  Were you pretty happy with your first serve?  That was probably the most impressive serving I have seen from anyone this week.  It must give you a bit of confidence, I guess, to have that in your arsenal?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I felt like I was able to hit my spots well, especially when I needed it in big points.  I think that 2-Love game in the second was a big one to squeak out of.   
Yeah, I felt confident going after my first serve and then still back on my second serve to win more points than not.   
 Q.  You're pretty well placed now, looking ahead.  You get a nice little rematch with Kerber.  You started the year against her, so this would be a nice way to finish it and see where you're at?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, exactly.  I think I'm in a bit of a different position than I was in January when we played against each other.  This week is just a massive bonus, to qualify for this week.  And now to get a win, you know, I can just look forward to the match tomorrow and try and go out there and play with freedom again and try and put on my best tennis, and whatever happens happens.   
 Q.  Maybe it's a little early to talk about the Australian Open, but now you are the top-ranked Aussie player.  Do you feel pressure next year in your country?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's exciting.  For me, for all Australians, there is always pressure.  Going into the Australian summer it's a massive time of year for us.  I love playing at home, and there is no more pressure than I put on myself to perform well and play well at home.  That's where I want to play my best for the year, to really sort of support our fans who give us so much back in return.   
We're very lucky to be a Grand Slam nation where we can start the year off at home and be in Australia for the first couple of months of the year.   
 Q.  What's your opinion on the round-robin format?  Do you like it?  Normally you would be in the next round already.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's obviously very different.  We don't play any round robins throughout the year, but, I mean, for me it's just like another match.  I don't really think of the round robin.   
I played my match tonight, and you try your best to win, and tomorrow afternoon I get to come out and try and win my next match.   
Probably the closest thing you can compare it to it is like Fed Cup, where you play and regardless of your result you still have to play another singles.   
I love a round robin.  I played a lot as a junior in the round-robin format.  For me, I don't think about it too much.  I just go out and play my match.   
 Q.  I just wondered how you felt about being the youngest player.  Do you think it's an advantage being a bit younger, maybe a bit more confident, a bit more energy?  Or do you think it could come as a disadvantage maybe if you've got less experience?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: The youngest in the draw or on the court tonight?   
 Q.  In this tournament.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I didn't even know that I was.  No, I think for me I have had a really good year and gained a lot of different experiences.   
I think obviously the longer you're on the tour, the more you learn and the more situations that you have been in.  I think I have sort of been exposed to different situations with singles and doubles, as well.  But I feel comfortable out on the court, and I feel like I'm playing really well this whole year.   
I'm looking to finish strong in this last match tomorrow, and then maybe it continues for the weekend.  Yeah, we will just try and do the best we can tomorrow and see where the weekend takes us.
