THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Did you know the city?  Are you planning to go on some sight-seeing tour?  What are your expectations from this tournament?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I mean, obviously it's a very beautiful city.  It's one of the first things that I do when I get to Rome, is always spend the afternoon looking around.  Went for a walk the other day.  It was beautiful.  It's just such a nice city to visit.
I have very fond memories from here, most recently from doubles last year.  But I'm looking forward this year in trying to play a few more singles matches and continue to learn more about the clay, prepare for Roland Garros as best I can.
Q. As you are winning more and more matches and your ranking is increasing, are you feeling more pressure when you play against the other people?  Do you feel they are looking at you like someone to defeat?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No, no more pressure at all, no.  I think obviously the more matches that you play, the more confident you get, the more comfortable you are.  I think for me, I know that I can play consistent tennis week in, week out.  That's the most important thing.
If I get beaten by my opponent, it's too good.  I think I do the best that I can to make sure she has to work as hard as she can to beat me.  Every single match, you can win or lose.  I think I go into it viewing it that way.
