A. BARTY/P. Kvitova
6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A particularly slow court from all reports. How important was it to sort of make your first serves tonight? She's pretty aggressive generally.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think against Petra, that's a massive thing you have to do regardless of the pace of the court. I think probably my first time playing Petra indoors, as well, is a bit of a difference. I think I had to adjust and take some time to get used to her ball off the court and everything like that.
But I was particularly happy with the way I was able to return tonight. I think Petra changed her serving spots to her usual kind of serving spots. I think she was trying to take a little bit more of a risk. That kind of worked in my favor a bit tonight.
Really happy with how we were able to nudge in front early in both sets and keep the foot down.
Q. From the start of the year till the last tournament of the year, it feels like Petra has been a frequent presence in your season. With the five matches you've played, what do these matches with Petra mean for you this season?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think playing against Petra is probably one of my favorite things to do, if I'm being honest. Win or lose, it's going to be a great match. It's going to be played in the right spirit. I just enjoy the challenge of playing against Petra. She really does bring out the best in me.
Like you said, we played in the first tournament of the year, and now we've played in the last. Pretty special way to cap off the season and to start the season. It's a challenge that I love. It's a challenge that I thrive on.
I think each time I've played Petra, I've become a better player having learned what's happened during that match.
Q. Qualifying top of the group gives you a little bit of a view of what's coming for tomorrow. You know you're going to play either Pliskova or Halep. In your mind, how are you going to prepare for that with all the problems we've seen with the court?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I probably won't worry about it till they've played, to be honest. There's a lot of what ifs and things that can happen between now and then. For me it probably starts with a bit of a sleep-in tomorrow, a pretty crazy day.
But no, I won't really worry about that one till they play. I might poke my head out and watch a little bit, but I think Tyz will be watching that one for sure.
Both girls I've played before. There are no surprises. A bit of an adjustment with the conditions and the court and everything like that. We'll worry about that when the time comes.
Q. You and Petra are two of the nicest girls on the tour.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Thank you (smiling).
Q. I noticed you said your motivation is to be a better player and a better person. Could you elaborate on the 'better person' part? How do you define that and why is it so important to you?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think that's the beauty of life, the beauty of the journey that we're on: every day you can try and improve yourself.
I think that's probably, tennis aside, the biggest part of my development over the last two or three years. I feel like I've become a better person. I feel like I'm learning every single day, I'm learning from every experience. That has nothing to do with tennis, or with tennis matches, tennis experiences or anything like that. That's purely from a personal point of view.
It's been a massive development for me. It's come from the people that are around me, the people that surround me, that drive, encourage me every single day to try to be the best version of myself that I can be.
Q. Last time an Aussie reached this stage of the tournament is Sam a few years ago. She's through in the doubles. Have you gotten to catch up with her while you've been here?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No, I've avoided it like the plague (laughter).
Of course I have seen her. I have seen her every day. I watched a little bit of the end of that doubles match. I saw from 5-2 in the second. I'll take all of that match. That was all me just watching in front of the tele.
No, it's incredible for Sam. I'm so happy she was able to be here. I mean, selfishly from a Fed Cup point of view, as well, I'm pretty pleased that we're both here still playing matches, leading all the way up to playing Fed Cup next week. It's going to be really exciting for both of us.
There's no better preparation than playing matches, so selfishly I'm pretty happy that she's through.
Q. What does a cruisy day in Shenzhen look like for Ash Barty?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I mean, typically I'm a morning person, but I'm trying to stretch that out as much as I can because we're kind of on a late schedule. Trying to stay away from online shopping is my biggest issue. When I have that much time, I can go on and do a bit too much shopping.
No, a little bit of practice, chat to the fam, and try to catch up with everybody at home.
Q. When you are answering the question about being a good person, you said that you get good influence from the people around you. Could you name a couple of the persons who gave you the biggest influence in terms of tennis and personally?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think for me it stems from mum and dad, without a doubt. Mum and dad have taught me everything that I've learnt in life. They taught me the values to live by. I feel like I have very strong values because of them. I'm so lucky to have such a supportive network from my family: my mum and dad, my sisters.
Then professionally, it's Tyz, my manager Niki, all of my team, Ben Crowe, everybody behind me. They're not just supporting me through my career, but also they're very close friends and will be forever.
Q. Can you give us a little idea of what you are buying online? I can't help but ask.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Today was actually some stuff for the RSPCA at home. I was doing a little bit of online shopping because I know they're in need of kind of normal stuff for the cats and dogs and kind of everything at the RSPCA shelter. A little bit for them to give back to them when I'm back home in Australia.
Q. At this point of last year, you won in Zhuhai. Now you're here in Shenzhen. What is the biggest change for you this year? Did you think at the beginning of this year you could reach this stage?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's incredible to have progressed from Zhuhai the last two years to be here playing singles in Shenzhen. It's very exciting. We've had a very consistent year across all surfaces, all throughout the year, which has been the most pleasing thing.
A goal of mine at the start of the year was to do well in the Grand Slams. I think I've done that much better this year. I made second week of every Grand Slam. That was a big bonus and a big push towards getting here in Shenzhen.
