A. BARTY/S. Kenin   
6-3, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You said you really didn't want to remember anything about the last time you played Sonya. What will you remember about this match today.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think, yeah, I served much, much better today than I did in Toronto. In particular, I was able to get on top of a lot of points. I still had a period in the second set where I let her see far too many second serves, she was able to take advantage of that.   
In the end, really happy with how I was a bit more aggressive towards the end of the second set and closed it out in straight.   
 Q.  I know you enjoy playing Fed Cup, obviously Hopman Cup. Now that there is no Hopman Cup, a lot of team events popping up on the men's calendar, would you like to see something similar on the WTA Tour that offers points, brings a team environment?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think probably with the calendar that we have at the moment it's challenging to fit much more in. If those events were to take place, I think there would be an adjustment across the whole calendar.   
If it happens, I'd kind of see if it fits in, see how it went. If it doesn't as well, I'm pretty busy with the schedule we have. Obviously playing Fed Cup, having the Hopman Cup in Australia, which is really special for us, it's no longer there now, but it was really special to be a part of in that last edition of it.   
Yeah, if the opportunity came up, I'd have to see. Obviously would love to grab it with both hands. Yeah, certainly not something to stress about now because it's not an option.   
 Q.  With the Laver Cup, the coaches timeouts became popular. For you, is there any current or former player you would imagine you would enjoy getting some coaching tips from, tactical genius you'd like to hear from?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think my coach goes all right. I pick his brain enough. Tyz is very good at what he does. We work very well together. I think without him sitting on the side of the court all the time, I mean, I get that from him. I get a little bit of a taste of it at Fed Cup with Alicia sitting on the side of the court.   
I had more than enough time picking Casey's brain on the doubles court. I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with quality people, people that know their stuff.   
I've learnt a lot from them and continue to do so.   
 Q.  Sonya has played a lot of tennis in the last few days. Did you sense there was any fatigue? Knowing that going in, did you adjust your game plan at all?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Not adjust it. I know she's been on an absolute heater over the last 10 days in particular. Like you said, she's plays a lot of tennis. I know how that feels at times. You can feel really, really good.   
Obviously she's extremely confident and trusting in her game. It's a bit of a double-edged sword at times where you have played a lot of tennis, the fatigue can set in.   
Obviously it was a priority of mine to try to make it as physical as possible, but purely as well because I know when I can bring that physicality into it, I play better tennis myself, more focusing on myself than her.   
 Q.  Through your two matches, what are your takeaways so far in terms of form, confidence? How is your body feeling?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think there's been some really, really good stuff. I think my serve's been great. Been a lot better than it was through the North American hard court season.   
I think conditions here take some adjusting. It takes some time to get used to them. Thankfully I've been able to adjust reasonably quickly in the matches. Even a little bit different playing daytime today than it was early evening last night.   
Yeah, I mean, I can sit here and pick my game apart and be super critical, but I also have to be able to take away the really good stuff, the good times that we've been able to get out of these matches, particularly the last maybe, what, 20 odd points today. As well, I felt like I got on a real run there, was able to play some really good stuff.   
 Q.  Craig was pretty adamant throughout his coaching timeout after the first set of staying positive, not spinning things, but you're in there, playing fine. How important is that in terms of this section of the season to not let yourself get hypercritical?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think particularly after that first set, not often do I call Tyz out after I won a first set. I actually just wanted to get his opinion on how he was seeing the match from the side of the court. Obviously different perspectives, me playing and him on the side of the court. I think more I just wanted to see what he was thinking, how he was viewing the match.   
But we're very much on the same wavelength. It was just him reiterating a few things, keep instilling that positivity which is challenging at times.   
No, look, overall I think it was not bad stuff.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on your next opponent, Petra Martic or Veronika Kudermetova?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I've never played Veronika, I think. I haven't really hit much with her. Nothing at all. It's very much a clean slate. It would be a little bit of homework to do tonight, trying to figure out a way, a game plan that we can get into her game style as much as possible.   
Having played Petra most recently in Miami last year or two years ago, whenever it was, she's got the ability to maneuver the ball all around the court. She's a very experienced player, knows how to win matches. That's a challenge in itself.   
Both very different challenges, very different players. Either way I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Potentially Shenzhen... When there are players coming up like Bianca who hasn't played, like you or Petra, Simona, when you see those players go through runs that you haven't played before, do you think, I kind of want to play them only because I want to see how my game matches up to them? Does that cross your mind?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Absolutely. I'd love to play her. I mean, she hasn't played a lot of tournaments this year. It's kind of that simple. She's done extremely well in the ones she's has played. Yeah, I mean, two, three titles. She's proven she's going to be a top player.   
For her sake, hopefully her body stays healthy. I'm sure that she's looking forward to finishing the season really well. Yeah, I mean, I'd love to play her. I've never hit a ball with her, never kind of done anything. Would love to play her and see how we match up.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  When did you decide to withdraw from the finals of Shenzhen? Did you regret this decision?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I haven't withdrawn from the finals. Do you mean doubles?   
 Q.  Yes, doubles.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No, I mean, we haven't withdrawn. It was just that we weren't going to play these next two weeks. It was a decision that Vika and I had made before when we were setting out our schedule.   
Obviously or body and health come first. We had to prioritize that.
