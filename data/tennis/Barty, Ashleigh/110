6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Good performance.  How is the back?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's good.  It felt really good.  And I think I did everything possible with my team to get us in a position to be able to play today.   
And, yeah, I think today is one of those days where, regardless of the statistics, how I felt on court, it doesn't matter.  We've got an opportunity to come out here a couple days time in round two.   
 Q.  Have you had an opportunity yet to think about that match?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah.  Well, I think, you know, as soon as I got off the court, I'm walking past and it's on the big screen.  It's a bit hard to avoid.   
No. I think for the moment I'll just go through my recovery and then worry about that when I need to.   
 Q.  A lot of things have changed since you played her last time.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's been a few years now.  And I think I'll have to use those experiences, both the good and the bad from that match, going into my next match.  But I think I'm in a very different place.  I think Serena is also in a very different place.   
And I think just what an opportunity.  She's a genuine champion.  What she's done to be able to get back, along with Vika, as well, and a lot of the other girls who are coming back after pregnancy is a pretty amazing thing.   
 Q.  Is it fair to say it's best to meet Serena second round in her Grand Slam comeback than potentially semifinals?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I'd take a semifinal any day.  I think that's a silly question.   
Yeah.  No, no.  I mean, for me, I'm -- you want to play the big names and you want to test yourself against the best, and I think any opportunity you can do that is good.   
But, obviously, deeper in the tournament you're both playing good tennis.  You're in a spot where you deserve to be sometimes it's how the cookie crumbles and that's how the draw is done, and we're playing each other in the second round.   
 Q.  What satisfied you the most today?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I think it really was just getting through today.  It was a very simple approach for me.  It was to go out there and not really worry about it too much.  Just play.  Let myself be free, just play with freedom, and then hopefully be able to come off happy with a win.   
 Q.  Do you think Serena should have been seeded here?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's an extremely tough question.  I think probably in certain ways, yes, and I agree with those arguments; and then also I agree with arguments where it's no.   
I think it's a tough decision.  I know that the WTA are going through all the right processes.  You know, knowing Sam is on the players' council, she's -- you know, we chat to her about it openly and honestly.   
And I think there are valid arguments both ways.  And I think, over time, whatever decision is made, I think the outcome will be right.   
 Q.  As you know firsthand with Casey traveling the families, what do you reckon Serena's challenges are in that sense?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think, knowing Case, it brings certainly a different set of challenges.  But then, in the same breath, it brings so much fun.   
There are so many good days where you have an absolute garbage day on the tennis court, but you go back to the hotel and Blake just wants to kick the foot of you, or he wants to do something like that, and it takes your mind off tennis.   
I think you find ways to adjust.  I know Casey and Amanda did that extremely well.  And I'm sure that Serena, Vika, all of these girls have lots of help with them, but then also enjoy doing it themselves as well.
