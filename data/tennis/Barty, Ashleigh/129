A. Barty/C. Giorgi   
5-2, (ret.)   
 Q.  Congratulations on making semifinal.  Did you have any inkling that she was injured in the early stages of the match?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: For me, no.  I try not to take too much notice to the other side, just tried to start the match well and go about my own business, but obviously we're pretty excited to be through to the semis, but you never want to win a match like that.   
 Q.  I always joke that when you take to the grass I wonder whether you're going to step up to the crease or do you have to remind yourself you're playing tennis.  It's been a great comeback for you.  Looking back now, what are your thoughts on having taken that timeout and playing cricket?  How do you sort of compartmentalize all of that^ ?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah.  I think for me taking that 18 months off was really important, and I think I was just having a mental refresh really and come back and we've had an amazing year so far starting back in singles, and I think it's just clicked over a year now.  So obviously really happy to be back on the grass as well; it's where we started.  So it's great to be able to be in my first semi of a premier and hopefully we can play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  Obviously you're feeling great, playing great and sort of rising up the rankings all the time.  How much better do you think you can get?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think we just take it match by match and day by day really.  I wasn't able to play a match late last year, so I mean it's exciting that we've got nothing really to defend for the rest of the year.  So it's sort of an open slather.  And every match that we're able to win now, the ranking is hopefully going to go up in the right direction.  So it's just an exciting next six months for us.   
 Q.  And do you feel particularly comfortable on grass or are there other surfaces that you say you prefer?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: We grew up on hardcourt in Australia and that's where I play my most tennis, but this is one of my favorite seasons.  I always love coming on the grass and have had good success and obviously have some really nice memories from Wimbledon, and I think that's really special knowing that you only get two or three weeks to prepare for Wimbledon.  So you really have to make the most of it.   
 Q.  It's an interesting point actually.  Jo Konta sort of said it that because it's such a short season, there's no real worry of overplaying because it's all part of the matches leading into Wimbledon.  With doubles as well do you feel that all that is contributing to help you get your footing on grass or do you feel that at some stage you might have to let the doubles sort of rest to give yourself the best chance in the singles?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think for me I didn't play doubles last week in Nottingham.  I was able to just focus on my singles there.  But singles and doubles are both important to me, and you know, I like to concentrate on both at different times.  But for the grass certainly you want to play as many matches as you can before Wimbledon.  But yeah, it's tough to practice on grass and get a lot of quality court time.  So getting matches is really important.
