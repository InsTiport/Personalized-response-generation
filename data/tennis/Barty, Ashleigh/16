  A. BARTY/S. Rogers
 7-5, 2-6, 10-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Talk us through the match today.  Tough opponent.  How did you feel out on court?
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, tricky one against Shelby.  She always has the ability to hit you off the court.  So it was about me trying to neutralize as best I can.  Getting a good start in the third set tiebreaker was crucial in the end.
 Q. You're playing singles and doubles this week, preparing for AO.  How is the body holding up?
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, it's an adjustment without a doubt, having 12 months of not a lot of matches.  But, look, I feel fit.  I feel healthy.  Obviously a little bit of soreness is good knowing that you've been able to test yourself.
 Looking forward to freshening up over the next few days and enjoying the competition of what's left.
 Q. How are you enjoying playing with Jen?  You played one match so far, have another one today.  How is the combination going?
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, it's great with Jen.  We've played a couple matches.  We enjoy each other's company first and foremost.  But I think we complement each other's game really well.  I think in a sense, as well, we're not overly taking doubles too seriously.  For us it's about going out there, enjoying it, working on a few things, then prioritizing our singles.
 Q. You played under the roof today on Margaret Court Arena.  How were the conditions?  A bit different with the roof closed?
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, the roof changes things a little bit.  I makes it quite sterile out there.  When you have a quality ball-striker like Shelby, that adds in another element.
 It's about going out there and not focusing on the conditions as such.  It's just going out there and trying to do the best I can with the cards that I've been dealt.
 Happy to get through today and now get another chance tomorrow.
 Q. Having not played competitively for almost a year, you've had quite a few in consecutive days, sometimes twice a day.  Are you starting to feel the rust coming off a little bit?  Are you getting right back into the competitive match play?
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, it's nice to get into a routine.  I think the rust is always there for I think everyone the first few matches of the season.  But without a doubt, I felt better and better each match.
 Each match has been very different, different challenges, different things I've had to overcome, which is the best thing, to be able to work through those and give myself another chance to play a little bit better the next day, focus on some new challenges for the next day.
 Q. You play the winner of Serena versus Danielle Collins.  Will you watch or see any of that match?  Give us thoughts on playing either of those opponents.
 ASHLEIGH BARTY:   Yeah, probably won't watch that one.  I'll let that one go through, just focus on who the winner is in the end, I suppose.
 Obviously played Danielle a few times.  Played her in Adelaide last year in a tight one.  I always love testing myself against Serena.
 A match I look forward to regardless of whoever wins from that point of view, but looking forward to it tomorrow.
