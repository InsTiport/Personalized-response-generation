THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a pretty long day for you.  I'm curious how you got it done in the end.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, very long day.  You know, obviously the weather is something that we can't control, and a little bit frustrating that a couple of times we got on, it was a pretty quick shower straightaway.  But, yeah, something you can't control.  You just have to try and sit back and kind of make the most of the time you have off the court and know that once you do get back on you have to switch on straightaway.   
 Q.  How did you spend the rain delays?  And how stressful were they, if they were, to get ready?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, no, not very stressful for me.  No, we had a room up at the top and we were just watching the golf, the match play that's on at the moment, which was nice to kind of switch off a little bit.   
You know, we could see how quickly the courts were drying.  So for me it was a matter of 15, 20 minutes before I thought we'd be back on, just go and warm up and get ready again.   
 Q.  Are you happy with how you made up for lost time?  It was a pretty quick one, in the end, for you.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think it's always hard to gauge how those matches feel when I have been here for 12 hours today.  But really happy with the way I was able to come out after the rain delays and kind of get on the front foot pretty early.   
 Q.  You spoke a couple days ago about putting your plan together.  Going to tap into that.  You played with great control tonight.  You felt the longer those rallies went that you got on top there.  What was sort of the plan, if you can divulge and go inside a little bit?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, the conditions were a bit different to what they usually are in Miami.  Usually here it's warm and pretty lively.  With the weather today and how cool it was, it changed conditions dramatically, so it took a little bit of time to get used to that and accepting the fact that I couldn't quite play the way that I wanted to.   
But I did the best with what I had and was able to, you know, get out of some tight service games at crucial times and get a bit of a roll on.   
 Q.  A lot of milestones this week, whether it's Petra or making your first Mandatory final or top 10 on Monday.  What are you most proud of over this fortnight?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Well, I think with the cards we were dealt at the start of the week, I'm so proud of myself and my team for trusting the process and enjoying the journey.  I think we have had some amazing opportunities on the court to do some pretty special things.   
I think now we have another opportunity in a couple days' time to go out there and try and play a really good match.  Obviously it's another chance at a title.  Really excited to be in this position.   
 Q.  Tricky either way, two tough opponents potentially for you.  Can you talk separately about playing Simona, a rematch in Sydney, and Pliskova?  You're familiar with both?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, a tough one both ways.  Obviously I would expect nothing else.  I think when I played Sim in Sydney she was a little bit rusty, hadn't played for a few months.  I was able to make the most of it.  It was a horrendous day, actually.  Windy, pretty tough conditions.  It's a little bit more sterile (phonetic) here most of the time.  Yeah, an extremely tough match.  I think she's playing some of her best tennis again.   
Karolina, we have had a few really good matches in the past.  I think it's split pretty evenly, actually.  Played her most recently in the US Open in another big match.  There wasn't much in that either.  I think either way I get to go out there and try and play my brand of tennis, which is probably the most important thing for either matchup.   
 Q.  Physically, how's it feeling for you?  Body's okay?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Good as gold.  No, I'm very lucky to have my team with me here this week.  Tyz, my trainer and physio, as well.  I'm being extremely spoilt this week and well looked after.
