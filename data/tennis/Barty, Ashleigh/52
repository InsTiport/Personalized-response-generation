A. BARTY/P. Martic   
7-6, 3-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a long one today, but made it through in three. How happy are you with the win?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think that was a very, very high-quality match. I think that was probably one of the better matches that I've played in recent times.   
Probably but for all of maybe two service games on my half, two from Petra, we coughed up maybe two each, but the rest of the match was very high quality.   
I think it could have gone either way. I was happy how I was able to fight in the end, put a lot of pressure on her in a lot of those service games in the third.   
 Q.  20 aces combined in the match. How important was it to get those looks?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think it was important to take your opportunity when you got it. Both times we gave the opposition half a sniff to get into those games. It was important to try to take those opportunities, particularly the first couple of points in games.   
Petra served exceptionally well in that second set. Really didn't give me a look at all. It was about trying to bide my time as much as I could, and waiting for an opportunity if I got one.   
 Q.  When you're on the court, are you able to enjoy the kind of contest that you and Martic were able to put together? When you're on the court, are you able to see the quality?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Absolutely. Frustrating at times, without a doubt. I knew the quality that was coming off of Petra's racquet. It was an incredible match. I think this is why we play the sport. We love the competition.   
I think two players, when the level is like that, I mean, it kind of is disappointing that there has to be a winner and there has to be a loser. I think both of us deserved to win that match and we both played exceptional tennis at times.   
 Q.  4-3 in the final set, the backhand on game point way off the court, landed in. Your reaction on that shot? Were you trying to hit it that good?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I mean, I thought the shot was on. A touch closer than I would have liked. I thought it was on. Petra was out of court. I thought, look, why not take a little bit of a risk. It paid off for me.   
I think, as well, I'm not sure if it was before or after that backhand line, my lob, Petra was able to lob it back. I can't remember which way it went.   
I kind of felt like we both were able to get out of a couple of sticky points in that game.   
Even the 2-1 game, I believe I had some chances as well. Just a really, really high-quality last set, I think.   
 Q.  You're into your sixth semifinal of the year. Obviously you've been able to win titles. For you, how important is it to be this consistent late in the season? What's the key to be able to do that?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: It was a goal myself and my team set out at the start of this year, was to be more consistent with my level of tennis. I think if I was consistent with my level of tennis, I knew that the results would be there. Not every week, but I'd continue to give myself the chance.   
Having played very well in the slams this year, I think it's exciting as well that we've been able to peak at different times of the year, play some really solid stuff through different parts and in different areas of the world. It's really nice to have that consistency kind of all across the globe.   
 Q.  Aryna is still playing, but up a set. The match from last year, you've played her since in Fed Cup, but how do you reflect on that match? Would you be keen for a rematch here?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, of course. I think last year in that match, I was a little bit battered and bruised. I had to try to manufacture some different tennis. Yeah, I mean, I was completely outclassed in that game. I didn't really have the capacity to be able to match it with Aryna. She was on an exceptional run through that period of the year.   
I think in Brisbane this year, playing in Fed Cup, obviously it's different conditions, completely different circumstances, so it's probably hard to take much from either match.   
If it is Aryna that I do play, I look forward to the challenge. She's one of the best players on the tour. Obviously has played very well here in the past. I think it would be a ripper of a match.   
 Q.  Is there any strategy from you and your team to avoid any mental fatigue because of an eventful season for you, a lot of pressure?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: For me, that's when I go home. When I go back to Australia, I go home often throughout the year. I've been home pretty much after every kind of trip this year. I've been home has to be half a dozen times. That's for me how I mentally refresh, physically refresh as well, make sure that I'm ready to go.   
 Q.  Two technical questions. First, often when you come to the net, you're in a very good position. Where do you put your focus on the approach shot?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Making sure it's half decent so I can be in a good position. There are also times where I hesitate and don't come to the net when I should. It's something that we continue to work on, like any other part of my game.   
I think also being able to understand the court a little bit. Having played a lot of doubles helps.   
 Q.  You have very good volleying. Is that a typical Australian thing or something you put the focus on already from very young? How did you develop that?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, again, something I worked on from a young age. But doubles certainly helps out. It helps with my singles when I do come forward. I had a couple of times where I moved forward well today. A couple times that Petra was absolutely exceptional up at the net. I did nothing wrong. I was burned time and time again when she came forward. I think it's about making sure it's at the right time.   
 Q.  On a day like today, it would have been nice to be able to hit 10 serves in the last set, blast your opponent off the court. Talk about the beauty of tennis, how it allows for different body types and playing styles to be successful.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I don't think I'm ever going to be able to serve Petra off the court in particular. She returns very well. Just her wingspan and her control on returns, it's really good. That's never going to be the case for me.   
The grass is always greener. I'd love to be able to do a million things that I can't do. I think girls would also like to be able to do things I can do.   
I just chip away, keep trying to play my style of tennis, my brand of tennis. I know it works for me, not all the time. We try and do it as much as we can.   
 Q.  Talking about going home, the flights for you are a million hours. How do you spend that time? What is the mindset negotiating travel?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think for us Aussies, anything under 12 hours is pretty easy. You kind of get used to that. You adjust to that.   
For us here, it's probably one of the easiest places to get to. It's like eight or nine hours. It just feels like it's a breeze. Feels like it's a domestic flight (smiling).   
I mean, it's something you have to learn to get used to. There's no way around it. You watch a movie, sleep, whatever it is. Timing can also be important, if there are different flights, one in the morning, one at night. Sometimes I'll choose one or the other depending on when I land. Things like that. It's really what's going to get me there the quickest.   
 Q.  Do you have a favorite thing to do on a long flight?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Sleep is the best thing. You wake up and it's almost over. There have been flights where you can't sleep. It's long, it's challenging, it's boring. It's the same for everyone. Not really going to set anyone apart.   
 Q.  Petra Martic won her last 16 three-setters in a row. Did you know she's won all these three-setters at all?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No, no. I mean, that's amazing. I know she's an exceptional athlete, that's for sure. She's one of the best movers on the tour. She fights and scraps for every single point, makes you work very hard for every point that you earn. That doesn't surprise me just with the caliber of athlete that Petra is.   
 Q.  With the awards that are at the end of the season, they're more like fans and people to vote for. You are a fan of the sport as well. What do you think are the most important factors that factor into the Player of the Year award?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I'm going to be a little bit ignorant here. I didn't realize there were that many awards at the end of the year.   
No, I mean, is it a player that decides or the fans decide?   
 Q.  It's journalists.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, you guys. I got to buddy you up a little bit (smiling).   
I think, in my opinion, it needs to be someone that is consistent across all of the year, all the surfaces. I think even during the tough times, it's someone that fights, stands up, continues to keep working hard. I don't think it's necessarily always about the results. It's a lot about the attitude.   
But, I mean, that's just my opinion. You guys decide, so hopefully you like me (smiling).
