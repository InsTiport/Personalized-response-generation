A. BARTY/M. Vondrousova
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you feel about how you played today?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it's getting better and better with each match that I have played. I think that's just a gradual progression of spending time on court and spending time kind of in that competition mode.
But, yeah, all in all, pretty happy with tonight.
Q. In the second set when there were those exchange of breaks, you were up the early break, what happened there? Was there just a bit of a concentration loss?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think I made a couple of poor choices. I changed my mind on a couple of those balls and then got myself in some poor positions with my feet, I think, which is something I had been doing well the whole match is being able to control the ball wherever I wanted to hit it.
And just for that little 15-minute period I was frustrated in my execution with my work around the ball, more than anything.
But kind of once we had the new balls and they quickened up a bit, it kind of clicked me into getting back in into that quicker mode.
Q. Now that you've got a few matches under your belt in a row, is there anything that you feel specifically that you want to be fixing in time for Monday?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think there are a few things that I'd like to fix for tomorrow. I mean, I'm not really concerned about Monday at the moment.
But, yeah, I think the beauty is I have done enough to get myself in a position where, you know, I get another opportunity to try and rectify and fix those things. Looking forward to getting out here tomorrow night again.
Q. Going into that next match against Danielle Collins, what are your thoughts about playing her?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, Danielle is obviously striking the ball exceptionally well. In Brisbane she started with a bang, and she's very much a first-strike player. She has no fear on those first couple balls early in rallies.
It will be important for me to have my running shoes on and try and neutralize when I can and then bring in variety and try and throw her off a little bit if I can, as well.
Q. It's not always easy for first-year events to have crowds like that, but today was a sellout crowd. What was the atmosphere like? The sound of the roar when you were walking in, how did that sound to you?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's incredible. It's really special for me to be playing here at Adelaide. The fans have been incredible.
I think Aussies all across the nation, as Australians, we have sport in our blood. We just love it. So I think when you get a quality field like you have in the men's and the women's draw here, the crowds will come. They appreciate good sport. They appreciate quality competition. That's why they've come here.
It's a credit to the tournament for putting on such a good event, and the players know it's a good event and want to come here.
Q. I know you said earlier in the week that you weren't too fussed about the draw here. Are you aware of the Open draw at the moment?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I have seen it, but, yeah, look, I'm not going to think about it until whenever we are done here. Sunday night, Monday morning, we'll worry about that.
I have seen that we'll play on Monday. Yeah, look, looking forward to tomorrow first before focusing on anything for next week.
Q. You have played multiple times the week before the Australian Open. I'm curious, for you, what are the pluses and the minuses of playing that week right before the Open?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Everything is a bonus. I don't think there are any things that I take out of the weeks playing prior to a slam that are negative.
The last couple of years I have had great runs in Sydney, and that's put me in good stead. I think for me, my choice is to try and get out and play as many matches as possible leading up to the Australian Open, but also it's an opportunity to play in front of an Australian crowd. We only get that a month of the year.
So it would be stupid of me not to try and take that opportunity. I love playing in Australia. I loving playing in front of Australian crowds. It's an opportunity for me that I don't want to waste and something that I want to enjoy. Yeah, it's worked well for us in previous years.
Q. Have you seen the actual trophies that are on show for this event?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I have. It's incredible artwork. I've watched the little video that was put together.
I think for everyone else to see, it's an appreciation of how, you know, Indigenous art is kind of created. It's amazing, particularly the women's ones, how it's burned into the wood. It's incredible.
I had a peak at it when we came in here a few days ago, as well. They look even better in person. I think it's great for the tournament to have, to kind of have that initiative to bring some Indigenous culture into the tournament.
Q. I think you have only played Danielle Collins on clay before? Not sure if you played her on hard. How different would that be? And also, did you know that she had rheumatoid arthritis? Did you hear about her diagnosis, anything about that?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, we have played in Madrid and I think Roland Garros. I think they are the only two times we have played. Obviously clay is very different to a hard court.
But, yeah, I have heard about some of the battles that she's gone through. It's nice to see her back fit and firing. I think she started the season exceptionally well.
Obviously she loves the hard courts. I think for her she feels most comfortable on hard courts where she can be in control of the match. It's going to be important for me to try and take that away from her tomorrow.
Q. On the point of Indigenous art, have you delved into collecting any art?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I have bits and pieces in my home, yeah.
Q. When you say "bits and pieces," I'm talking actual paintings or, like, wood pieces or what?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I have a feature piece in my living room that's the story of a bushfire that's from a family and some artists from Darwin in the Northern Territory.
And also, as a child, I have had a small didgeridoo, but that's not something that I touch. It's not in our culture that I'm there to touch the didgeridoo, but I do have it at home.
But, yeah, I love the kind of the centerpiece of my artwork at home is the story of a bushfire, which is something fitting at the moment, but...
Q. Do you know many of the Aboriginal artists? Would you go out looking for a particular artist like an Emily or a Pearl or any of those?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think my family, my sisters, we all have artwork from the same family of artists in Darwin. There are so many incredible artists all over the country. We are very sport for choice.
It just so happened that I stumbled across this family and found kind of the pieces we were after. But there is exceptional art everywhere, all over the country for us. I think particularly if you go to some of the museums, and they have some kind of special stories they have told with all the art together. It's pretty incredible.
Q. I know everyone is doing their part in terms of donating for bushfire relief, but what was your reaction to yesterday's event in Melbourne and the amount of money they were able to raise over there?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's nothing short of bringing a massive smile to my face, bringing a massive smile to the face of all Australians.
The way us Aussies, as a population, have come together and also people from all over the world have supported us as a nation, it's been incredible. I think it's really nice that everyone can do their little part. Big or small, it all makes a massive difference.
I think it's been really comforting, you know, and really amazing for us as a nation to come together when our backs are against the wall and when it's a tough time.
I think it shows the true Aussie colors and how we are as a nation, how we come together and really support each other.
