A. BARTY/Zheng Saisai
6-3, 7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What do you think you did differently that allowed her to win the second set?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think I was pretty loose. I played a pretty stupid set. I made far too many errors, let her back in the match well and truly.
I think too many times I gave away cheap service games, service games to love, service games to 15. When I did have my opportunity, I didn't take it. A bit of a frustrating one.
But, yeah, happy to get through in the third set in the end.
Q. What do you do when things aren't clicking? It's frustrating as you said. How do you knuckle down after the disappointment of the second set and do what you did in the third set?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I just had to reset. I had to know that the match was well and truly on my racquet. I made probably over 20 errors in that second set, and cheap ones in rolls, in twos and threes in a row, which is disappointing. Not things that I like to do.
Happy with how we were able to respond in that third set. Overall, a frustrating night. But the beauty of this sport is that we're still alive in the tournament. I don't think we play tomorrow, so I've kind of got a fresh day come Friday where, you know, it can be a completely different game.
Q. It's Petra next in the quarterfinals. This is your fourth time playing her this year. They've all been pretty epic matches. I know it's two days away, but what do you think about playing Petra here?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I mean, I love playing Petra. I really do. I don't have the greatest record against her. She is an opponent that I love to test myself against.
I think the match that we played in Sydney was incredible. At AO she had one of her nights where she really got the better of me. In Miami I was able to turn the tide a little bit.
It's a match that I look forward to. Obviously she's a world-class player. It's an extremely difficult matchup. Looking forward to testing myself again against her. It's always a tricky one for me. Looking forward to it.
Q. How is your calf? It was strapped tonight. Was it strapped in the first round?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yes.
Q. It's okay?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: It's all good. I think it just needs a little bit of help to get through this period. But all good. No, no worries from our end.
Q. Were you asked about Petra yet?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yes, but I can always talk more about Petra.
Q. Fourth time you'll meet this year, all on hard courts. You won the last one. What do you take out of the Miami match specifically?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think I can probably take a little bit out of every single match that we've played, particularly this year we've had some really nice matches.
I think Petra is always someone that I love to test myself against. She's one of the best human beings on the WTA Tour. It's always nice to be able to share the court with her. Come Friday, we're going to have hopefully another good match.
Yeah, there are bits and pieces that I take out of that match from Miami tactically. There are bits and pieces I take out of the match from Sydney. I was really close there. Then in Melbourne, she was able to exploit a few things.
I think each match was a little bit different, different conditions obviously, different again here. But looking forward to the challenge come Friday.
Q. You played with Zheng Saisai a few times. You win all the fights. What about the battle strategy, have you changed the strategy? What about today's game? Do you feel different because it's in China?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think we have played a few times. I think we've played recently at Wimbledon. Obviously before that again in China in Wuhan. I think each time I've played her, there are different challenges.
Also, like a match like tonight, I felt it was very much on my racquet and I needed to control the court at times, be more patient at times. Yeah, it is a matchup that we've played a few times now.
