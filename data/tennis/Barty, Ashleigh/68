A. BARTY/J. Pegula
6-3, 6-3
ASHLEIGH BARTY
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you sum that match up, please.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: A little bit scratchy, but solid enough when I needed it.  And I think overall, for not knowing Jess overly well, was able to figure it out when I needed to.
There were moments in the match when it was tighter, but I was able to be really solid again and do the basics well.
Q. So going forward how are you feeling about everything?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, really good.  I think I just did enough to give myself an opportunity to play another match.  I think I now have a couple of days between matches.
So, yeah, look, we'll just go back and refine a few things on the practice court, but overall I feel like I've been playing a really good level of tennis over the last month.  So it's just about going out there and trying to improve on that and continuing to do that every match.
Q. What do you need to work on this week to go to that next level and contend, do you think?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Literally just one match at a time.  I think that the level is there.  I know that there's -- you know, there are no red flags, nothing I need to stress or worry about.  It's just about going out there and enjoying playing the matches, enjoy competing, making sure I'm there for every rally, there for every point, and trying to give myself the best chance.
Q. How did you feel you served today and did you feel that you were getting enough out of that first serve today?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think when I hit my spots I was certainly rewarded, but probably didn't serve my best.  But like I said, at times when I needed some bigger first serve or some structure with my points, I was able to make those first serves and kind of set it up the way I wanted to.
And, yeah, there were a lot of things that I would have loved to have done better in that match, but we did enough to get a win, so that's the most important thing.
Q. You have spoken in the past about when you started on the tour some of the challenges that you faced in terms of missing home.  Could you tell us how you're finding life on the tour now, your time in Paris, and have you brought any creature comforts or things with you from home to remind you of home?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, certainly not any easier.  It never gets easier leaving home.
But I think I have a fantastic group around me.  My coach and I have a very close relationship.  We're very lucky to have physios and other girls around from Australia as well.
But I think I'm enjoying it.  I'm loving my time on the court.  I'm having a really good time off the court, as well, and being able to kind of separate the business and the leisure a little bit.  And enjoy both.
Q. A tennis career is shaped by decisions and choices that players make.  If you had to choose just one decision as the best decision or the most important decision that you've made, what would that be?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Coming back.
Q. And while you were playing cricket, what were your thoughts?  What drew you back to our sport?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think I have spoken plenty about cricket in the past.  I have spoken enough about it.  But it was certainly a good decision for me to come back to play tennis.  It was a natural decision and obviously a very good one.
Q. On the cricket issue, I mean, when you get over to England for Wimbledon, will you get a chance to go watch the men's world cup.  Will you go out of your way to watch a game?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I'll definitely try to watch it.  I think I'll be watching the women's football world cup.  I'll be watching the cricket world cup for the men.  It's a little bit of a sporting haven over the next month for everyone.  So I think I'll be glued to the TV like the rest of the world.
Q. Can you talk provisionally about your next round, your opponents, please?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: If you can tell me who they are, I can.
Q. (Off microphone.)
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, they haven't played?
Well, I think obviously Danielle I played in Madrid just a couple of weeks ago and with a match that ebbed and flowed.  Probably one of the most bizarre matches I have ever played in my life.
But, yeah, having recently played her, there are a few things that I picked up from that match.  So if it is her, we will work on those things.  And obviously I found a way to win that match, so there are some good things that came out of it.
And if it's Maria, I played her recently in Indian Wells, as well.  Have played her on clay before in Charleston.  Obviously green clay is a little bit different.
But, again, pretty familiar with both of those girls.  I think they'll have a ripping match for sure.  I don't think that's going to be an easy one for either of them.
So, yeah, look I think Tyzz will be out there watching and, if not, he'll watch the footage afterwards and we'll have a chat about it.
But no surprises from either girl.  For me, it's about going out there and executing a game plan that we know works against both of them.
Q. Just wondering what you think of your new kit with the stripes.  Are you a fan of them?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I don't mind it.  I think it looks pretty good against the clay, as well.  It's obviously Diego and I wearing this line from Fila, which is pretty exciting.  They've kind of released it sporadically over the year.
But very cool.  I think it pops.  There's a bit of black going around, as well, with a lot of the girls are in black and in darker colors, and it always look good against the red clay.
Q. You have always had more conservative kits.  That's a bit of a change for you aesthetically.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah.  I picked it up and I was like, Oh, yeah.  This is -- wow.
But obviously when I put it on, it's not as out there as I thought it would be.  But I'm happy to wear whatever.  It's comfortable, so I'm good to go.
Q. Perhaps the second greatest men to ever play here, BjÃ¶rn Borg played his career in Fila.  Have the Fila people spoken to you about him or do you have a familiarity of his role here?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Oh, I think anytime that you have a legend of the sport with links to apparel or your rackets, or whatever it is, there's a link in a way.  And I think obviously BjÃ¶rn was with Fila for I think his whole career, and it's very much a big part of the Fila family we have now.
There are a lot of us walking around wearing Fila, and it's pretty good to know that we've had a legend wearing the same kit as us as well.
