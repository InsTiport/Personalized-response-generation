A. BARTY/J. Goerges   
4-6, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Down a set and a break.  How do you think you were able to turn that around?  What were the adjustments that you made to get the win?  
ASHLEIGH  BARTY: Yeah, little bit of a tactical change.  I think I had to try an assert myself a little bit earlier in points.  It was a little bit of a serve off in that last set.  Then when I was able to finally get some momentum and get into Julia's service games, I was able to get into points and work my way into those games and give myself a chance.  I think it was pretty close across the board the whole match.   
 Q.  Talk about what you went through yesterday.  It's very dramatic day for you even if you were not playing.  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it was an easy day for me.  I watched a good tennis match, and then quickly did a quick warmup and hit for 40 minutes.  Here we are.  It was a pretty crazy day.  I knew I had zero control.  I just had to see what happened, then play the situation.   
 Q.  Kind of felt like you were sort of moving through the gears as the game progressed.  Did you feel that as well?  What do you put that down to?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: It's always nice to get better as a match goes on.  I felt pretty good physically out there.  I was looking after my service games as well.  So it was just a matter of taking the opportunity if and when it came.  But it is certainly nice to get better as the match goes on, but also saying that you'd like to be pretty good right from the get go.  There's always room to improve and adjust and try and find a way to get yourself into the match.   
 Q.  We have quite a few big WTA tournaments in China.  Are they different from each other or just similar Chinese tournaments?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, each has their own personality, I suppose.  I mean, for me, it feels like we're close ish to home.  It's quite easy for us to jump up.  It's similar time zone.  In that sense, it's quick for us to adjust when we do come to China, and having those big tournaments is that extra incentive.  I have had pretty good results in China over the past couple of years and I certainly enjoy my time here.   
 Q.  Compared to some players who has more years on the tour, Chinese players might not know too much about you.  If my tennis friend ask me, Who is this Ashleigh Barty girl, she's so good, she was in final in Zhuhai, what should I tell them?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I mean, I don't think between players there are any secrets anymore.  Everyone is able to get the vision, the footage, whatever they need to know how to play you.  But from a spectators point of view, I mean, it would be very kind if anyone ever said that about me, firstly.  But, no, I'd describe myself as a player that plays with variety.  I like to play with freedom and enjoy my tennis and bring as many shots into the game as possible.  That's what my coach taught me right from when I was five years old playing.  That's what I continue to try and do and to develop as I'm getting older and playing more on the tour.   
 Q.  You mentioned your variety of shots.  Do you put that down in some part to your cricket playing as well?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No.   
 Q.  No?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No.   
 Q.  I was interested because some cricketers go to baseball or to other racket sports or bat sports to kind of look at other ways to striking the ball.  But that's not something that applies to you?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: No.  I was fortunate enough to have Jim, my coach, teach me all of the shots from when I was quite young.  I think it's been a natural development since I came back from having a bit of a break.  Yes, I've probably gotten a little bit better, as the rest of my game has.  I think just naturally that they're developing.  We spend time trying to, I suppose, bring in more variety, but in the same sense, also keep it as simple as possible and let my instinct take over a little bit when I play.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to make the final here in Zhuhai?  And if you could just kind of break down your potential opponents, either Muguruza or Wang?  
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's exciting to be in the last match of the year, I suppose, and give myself an opportunity at the title before heading home and putting my feet up and chilling with the puppies a little bit.  No, I think both of those girls    I mean, I haven't played GarbiÃ±e this year I don't think, so obviously that's a little bit fresh.  And I have only played Q on a clay court.  I think in both of those matches, it's kind of a fresh slate.  We can go into it.  Nothing really changes for me.  I go out and try to play the same way.  Yes, there are some tactical changes that we try to implement and different things that we try and expose from their side.  But in the same breath, I get to go out there, and it's one match and then I get to go home and relax.  Leave it all out there and do the best that I can and whatever happens, happens.
