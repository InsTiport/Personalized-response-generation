A. BARTY/P. Kvitova
7-6, 3-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What was the key to this one going your way?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I think it was, as I said, it was important for me to try and take Petra's serve away from her as much as possible.  She's got an absolute world-class serve.
Yeah, at times it was still out of my control, but I tried to do the best I could and tried to get into as many service games as I could, and I thought I did that really well tonight.
Q. You pointed to your head a little bit as you were walking to the net as you looked over to Tyz.  Can you explain why?  Why do you think this was kind of a big mental win?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I think it's just been a massive difference since Wimbledon last year.  I think for me that was a bit of a turning point.
We have done a lot of hard work over the last, oh, eight, nine, ten months, whatever it is, to try and just get that little bit better and try and tick every box that we can.  I feel like it's made an amazing difference in my tennis, both me as a person and a player.
Q. Looks like you finally now got your top 10.  How does that feel?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Bloody good.  (Smiling.)
No, I think it's been a goal of mine.  That's no secret.  It's amazing what happens when you put your hopes and dreams out into the universe and do the work.  You know, it's amazing.
I had an opportunity last week that I wasn't able to grab, and this week was about coming here and continuing to try and trust the process and enjoy the journey that I'm on.  It's a pretty beautiful thing being able to play tennis for a living.
Q. Is it the case that there's still a long way to go in this, to be able to just put that to one side and come out for another match and potentially another one after that again?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, that's the challenge, isn't it?  I think going out there and being able to enjoy the opportunity of another semifinal, every tournament you enter into you want to do as well as you can and go as deep as you can.
It's a first for me here in Miami, and it's an opportunity for me to go out there and try and play some of my best tennis again.
Q. Anett next.  I don't know if you watched any of her match?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: I did not.
Q. What do you make of the challenge up ahead with her in the semis?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, it's a pretty clean slate.  We haven't played each other in a very long time.  Haven't hit much together.  The occasional practice here and there, but, you know, I think Tyz and I will put our heads together and try and come up with a game plan, and on the day it's about coming out and trying to execute the best that I can.
Q. You mentioned that you guys have played together on the juniors.  I looked it up.  2011.  Different lifetime.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Where?
Q. Roland Garros juniors and then another...
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Together or against each other?
Q. Against.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, I can't remember.
Q. I was going to see if you remember at all.  If not, that's fine.
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, no.  Crickets there.  Sorry.
Q. Speaking of cricket...
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Let's not talk about cricket.  Sorry, no.
Q. What does top 10 mean to you?  As a destination for a lot of people's careers, a goal, it's a tough one to set.  Getting here, you haven't seen your name up there like you will on Monday, what's that mean to you?
ASHLEIGH BARTY: Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That's the thing.  It's a goal that we set at the start of the year and it's been a goal of mine for a long time now.
It's amazing that I have been able to achieve it.  But there is still a long way to go, and I'm not satisfied.  I'm still hungry to get better as a person and as a player.  If that means that the ranking gets higher and higher, that's pretty cool, as well.
