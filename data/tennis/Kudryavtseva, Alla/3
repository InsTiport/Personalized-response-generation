  6-3, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: First question.   
  
  Q. A little bit disappointing as you had a lead in both sets. Could you talk about that a little bit.   
 ALLA KUDRYAVTSEVA: Yeah, I think I started well considering how nervous I was. Well, I guess I just got more nervous as I went on.   
 Melanie played well. She fought. She just was there for every point. She's a great player. Like I said, she improved every week.   
 It's okay. You know, she's No. 1 for them, too.   
  
  Q. Obviously your first match in Fed Cup. Was that the reason for the nerves?   
 ALLA KUDRYAVTSEVA: Yeah. Well, obviously. It's a great honor to play for your country, but also a great responsibility. So I did feel a lot of pressure.   
 I don't know if I ever had so many people cheer so aggressively against me. That was great, a great experience.   
  
  Q. What were you trying to accomplish as the match went on? What was it you were trying to do to get an advantage on her?   
 ALLA KUDRYAVTSEVA: Uhm, I was trying to be more aggressive. But I think I was -- I just made more mistakes. So I didn't use quite a few, you know, easy balls at situations that were to my advantage, so...   
 Tough luck. Only myself to blame, so... But Melanie, she's tough. She doesn't give anything. You give her a little chance, she's right on it. She has the guts. She has the courage to go for it no matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is. That's why she's so good.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
