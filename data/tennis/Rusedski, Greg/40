THE MODERATOR:  Greg Rusedski would like to read a statement. 


GREG RUSEDSKI:  Thank you.  Thank you.  I just want to just say a few words and just read a statement. I've just been very encouraged by the reaction that I've had from people.  I've had nothing but support from people.  I've had, even in the locker room, I've been particularly pleased by the players' reaction; they've been very positive and sympathetic towards me. At this state, I have nothing further to add to my statement at the moment.  If I do, I will let you know.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask my lawyer, Mark Gaye (phonetic spelling), because I want to concentrate on my tennis right now.  I've got a match coming up, I've got to get ready for Sydney this week, and I've got the Australian Open as well.  So I'd just like to say I'm looking forward to playing my match against Chela.  It's obviously going to be a difficult first-round match, but one I am going to try to do my best in.  That's all I'd like to say for today. 

Q.  Do you regard this as a terrible slur? 

GREG RUSEDSKI:  I'm just not going to answer any further questions, so...   I just thought I'd like to give you all the courtesy and the decency, since you've been asking me for requests and interviews and stuff.  So at least you know who to go to and who to ask questions to so I can just concentrate on my game of tennis at the moment because that's what I do for a living, that's what I love to do, and that's why I'm here in Australia.  Thank you.
