J. STRUFF/D. Lajovic
3-6, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. How are you feeling after that win?
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF:   Yeah, very, very relieved.  It was a tough match.  I didn't start very well.  Dusan was playing pretty good.  He had breakpoints beginning of the second set.  I managed to stay in the match.  Yeah, I managed to gain some more self-confidence there in my strokes.
Yeah, it was a very tough match.  I managed to break him.  In the third set I had the feeling I had very good energy from the beginning on.  I got the break.  Played a very bad game at 4-3.  I'm very happy that I broke back to 5-4.  Then was a tough game at the end.  I think I saved two breakpoints, I'm not sure.
But, yeah, very, very happy about this.
Q. Next game is Sascha versus Djokovic.  What do you feel about that?
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF:   That's a good match.  Sascha is playing very, very good tennis in practice.  He's such a talented player.  Yeah, he will be definitely very good, chance to win Grand Slams in the future, for sure.  He was so close in US Open.
Yeah, Novak, we don't need to tell or say something to him.  He's just outrageous.  But still I think Sascha has a shot.  I'm going to support him, like, big-time.  Hope we can win the title.
