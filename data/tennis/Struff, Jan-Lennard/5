 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How does it feel to get Germany off to such an incredible start?
 JAN-LENNARD STRUFF:   Yeah, it was a very good match from my side.  It was very tough at the beginning.  Milos was playing really good.  I had the feeling he was, like, a bit ahead of me.  Trying to break.  I couldn't really serve.  He was really serving well first and second serve.
 From second set I got a break straightaway.  Let it go.  Feel a bit bad, but tried to stay focused.  Had many break chances.  He saved them very well.
 I'm glad I played a really good set and tiebreak, as well.  Really happy to get the first point for Germany.
 Q. What are you feeling about the court and the conditions right now?
 JAN-LENNARD STRUFF:   Yeah, I'm very happy that it was a bit warmer than last days.  It gets a bit faster then.  Obviously for Milos and me, it's better if it's a bit faster.
 The conditions are this year pretty cold, I would say.  I would love to see a bit more the sun.
 Q. What would you say is the best aspect of your game right now?
 JAN-LENNARD STRUFF:   Yeah, my serve is pretty strong.  Try to work on this.  Serve and volley.  I missed some volleys today.  In general I think I did like good percentage of winning points at the net.
 Yeah, that's the key.  We're working a lot on this.  Yeah, we're working actually on everything to improve my game.  But consistency of the first serve, which was in the first set not that great at some point.
 But to get this win, it's very good.
