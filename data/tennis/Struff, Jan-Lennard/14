J. STRUFF/A. Zverev
6-3, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You hadn't beaten Zverev before.  What does this win mean to you?
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF: Yeah, thanks.  Yeah, I went in 0-5 into the match, lost one challenger match and four ATP meetings.
So, yeah, it's very important for me.  Yeah, 6-3, 6-1, it's amazing.  Yeah, played a good match.  He was missing some shots today, but at the end of the day I'm very happy with that.
Q. You have been playing a lot of doubles lately.
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF: Yes.
Q. Obviously you're a singles player.  How has that helped your game?
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF: Helped me a lot.  I have a great partner, Ben McLachlan with me on my side.  And, yeah, improved the serve, improved the volley game.  Adapt for the singles, as well, like coming to the net a lot, playing good volleys, playing aggressive.  Returning is helping a lot.
Like, yeah, I start playing better and better in doubles, and that helps a lot for really my movement to the net, like, serve and volleying.  Get, like, easy points but fast points, like serve and then you can volley the ball, like, instead of running back at the baseline, baseline, hitting, hitting.
So, yeah, it's very, very good for that.
