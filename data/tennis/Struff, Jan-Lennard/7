Canada - 0
(Transcribed from ATP audio.)
Q. Congrats on the win. Seemed like it was a pretty clean performance. What did you think?
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF: Yeah, I was very happy with the way I played and it was very important for us to get the first point. Unfortunately Sascha lost now and I don't know if it's still possible that we can go through, but I don't think so. It's like it's very tough. But never mind, we go for the 2-1. I mean, for Canada, obviously, it's like a big match now. But we try to win and get to the second point for our Germany team now in doubles.
Q. Felix is a tough opponent. Obviously, had a great year last year.
JAN-LENNARD STRUFF: Yeah, for sure. He's very young and I knew I have to go out and play very good tennis to beat him and actually, I did and I was very happy with the performance and the way I played. But still, he's a great player. If I beat him now 6-1, 6-4, he's very talented and very good player. It's just one match.
