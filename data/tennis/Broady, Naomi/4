  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. How do you feel your performance was today? Obviously you would be disappointed. 
NAOMI BROADY: I think I didn't play very well. I think it's easy to say that I didn't play very well, but she's obviously ranked where she is for a reason. 
Her balls obviously stay very low, which is difficult for me. She's a great returner, which makes it more difficult for me, too. 
I had high hopes to possibly get a win, or at least be competitive. Towards the end of the second set, I did feel like I started to have a few more chances to get back into the match, but I just couldn't quite lift my game enough.

Q. I suppose today there's a silver lining in the sense that Liam has a relationship with his father which is back on. Must bring you much joy. I don't know if you can tell us how you feel about that. 
NAOMI BROADY: I don't get involved with that at all. 
My silver lining today is I was doing this Aces for Bally. There are quite a few players doing it. I don't know if you saw it on Twitter. We're donating a certain amount per ace we hit towards the Elena Baltacha Tennis Foundation. I don't know how many aces I hit today. But I hit a few. My silver lining is that some money goes towards Bally's legacy and hopefully towards the younger kids.
