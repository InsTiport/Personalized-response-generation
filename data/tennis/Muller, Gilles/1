G. MULLER/J. Millman
7-6, 6-4
Q. Congratulations.  It must feel really nice to return to the site where 12 months ago you had your great breakthrough.
GILLES MULLER: Oh, yeah, definitely.  I was looking forward for a long time to come back.  At one point last year at the end of the season when I was injured I wasn't sure if I would be able to come back.
Yeah, I was very happy when I arrived in Sydney.
Q. And did you get the same feelings back immediately, like when you returned to the court, the conditions, the feeling, the memories?  Did you feel like you picked up where you left off?
GILLES MULLER: Not really.  I mean, it's kind of tough, beginning of the season.  I had a couple of months more where I didn't play any matches because of that injury, so I mean, it's only my match now.  Yeah, I still feel a little bit rusty on the court, but, yeah, we'll get there.
Q. Is it elbow?  Is this why you have the sleeve?
GILLES MULLER: Yeah, the elbow.
Q. How is it feeling now?  Is it just kind of a precautionary thing you're doing when you're wearing that and you're easing your way back in?
GILLES MULLER: Yeah, I mean, my elbow feels like an elbow that was abused for the last several years (smiling).  So, yeah, I mean, it's all right.  I mean, I'm not going to say it's perfect, but it's okay.
I'm able to perform well, and so that's the main goal.  We'll see what happens.
Q. The next match is against Benoit Paire in the quarterfinals.  What do you think about that one?
GILLES MULLER: Well, Benoit is not an easy player.  He's a tough competitor and always giving people a hard time on the court, but a very good player, very talented.  Last couple matches I played him, I think I lost.  So it's going to be tough.
