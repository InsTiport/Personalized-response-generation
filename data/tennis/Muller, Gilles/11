 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Get your thoughts on the match and how you played tonight.   
 GILLES MULLER: Well, I'm very happy I won that match. But I'm not very happy with the way I played today. I was very tight from the beginning, and I felt like I was pretty, yeah, I didn't play my game throughout whole match.   
 I think I served well and that's what saved me today. But my baseline and net game was not as good as two days ago.  
  
  Q. Did Bernard surprise you a little bit early on?  
 GILLES MULLER: Surprise not. I mean, I was aware how he could play, but I was impressed with the way he handled the situation. I think he handled it better than me. I was the one I was tight and he was just loose and playing his game. Wasn't saying anything and was calm the whole match. I was pretty impressed by that.  
  
  Q. So you found it difficult with the big crowd supporting Tomic?   
 GILLES MULLER: Not really. I played on Arthur Ashe at US Open against Andy Roddick so I'm used to those situations. But there was not a situation which was tough for me today. It's the first time playing on a big court like that in a must-win situation. I was favored. He was the one who has nothing to lose. I think I didn't handle it very good.   
  
  Q. And how do you feel now about your chances now that you're through on the third round?   
 GILLES MULLER: Well, I mean, I'm happy about that for sure. I mean, if I would have known that I would have -- would go to the third round, I would be very happy before the tournament.   
 Now I'm playing Del Potro, and that's the other way around again. I'm just going to go out there and enjoy it and play my game.
