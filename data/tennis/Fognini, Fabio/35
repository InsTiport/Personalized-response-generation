 F. FOGNINI/F. Delbonis
  6‑4, 1‑6, 6‑7, 6‑2, 6‑3 
   
 Q. After this long match, what are your thoughts about the next one and playing Lopez?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Is gonna be for sure a really difficult match because he always play good here. So we meet few times quarterfinal, I think. He's lefty, so everybody know how it's difficult to return with lefty.   
Yeah, good slice. He always come in. So I know him very well. So I lost last time in NewYork, but I think in a different kind of matches, because I was beating Rafa in five set, and next day I wake up and next day again. I try to play but was difficult mentally, was really complicated.   
But the same times I know that it's gonna be really, really complicated. I would like to stay focused on my game, try to do my best and we will see if I have the opportunity to beat him or to take him longer.   
   
 Q. This has nothing to do with tennis, but your thoughts on Italy.   
FABIO FOGNINI: So don't ask me.   
   
 Q. Well, it's about Italy's team in the Euros, how much you're watching and what your thoughts are about the team.   
FABIO FOGNINI: At the moment, we are okay. I think next match is going to be really difficult again because Germany, it's one of the best teams in the Euro Cup. So I'm supporting a team like everybody, I think 99% in this room. Hopefully to beat Germany.
