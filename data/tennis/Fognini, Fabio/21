F. FOGNINI/F. Delbonis   
6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  You must be very happy with that performance.  Just a quick question about that court.  As you probably know, it's going to be torn down at the end of this tournament.  How good is it to play on it, what kind of atmosphere is it, and will you be sad to see it go?  
FABIO FOGNINI: As you say, it's really nice court.  I think I only play once.  I play Mannarino a few years ago.  At the beginning of the tournament, I practice there, and today I play.  So the court is nice.  You feel the atmosphere, of course.   
And, you know, I don't know what going to happen in the next year because I heard also that they going to destroy the court and make up a new one, but nothing else.   
 Q.  It's going to be a park or a grass lawn, I think, yeah.  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yes.  Lawn.   
 Q.  Just a lawn, yeah.  There's not going to be any atmosphere at all next year.  
FABIO FOGNINI: I'm lucky I play in the new one, in Simonne-Mathieu, and it's bigger.  It's new, so it's really nice.   
But new Chatrier, new one, new Simonne-Mathieu, and maybe in two years if I play is the new Suzanne-Lenglen.   
 Q.  Just a question about your shoes.  Are they actually a pair?  Because they're a different color, aren't they?  
FABIO FOGNINI: No.  I just bought like this.   
(Smiling.)  No.  I'm joking.  I just paint it.   
(Laughter.)   
 Q.  You're obviously a big fan of the clay.  You love the French Open.  You've had success on the clay.  How does it make you feel when you hear other players say that they don't like playing at the French Open or don't like playing on the clay courts?  Do you take offense to that or is it preference?  Kyrgios said some things, obviously, a couple others have said they don't like it.  Your thoughts on that?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Kyrgios is Kyrgios.  And me, I'm me.  So believe me, I mean, I don't care what he say.  I mean, he can play whatever he want.  And we all know that if he want to play, he's danger in every surface.   
But at the moment, I think he don't want to play.  That's not for others to face or whatever.  He just say that he don't like Roland Garros, so I accept his decision.   
But I don't care, at the same time, because for me it's a big tournament.  Of course if I play here and go on, it doesn't matter.  It's big tournament.   
So it was his decision.   
 Q.  Did you understand, though, who would be offended by what he said and just the fact that Roland Garros has a history, obviously, and a lot of people like this place just like Wimbledon?  
FABIO FOGNINI: It's not my problem, believe me.  It's his problem.
