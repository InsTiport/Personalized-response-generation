F. FOGNINI/R. Bautista Agut
  7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Can you say a few words about Tsonga tomorrow.   Do you think you will be the favorite?
FABIO FOGNINI:   No, is him the favorite, for sure.   I play two times and I lost two times.   But you never know.   Of course, I'm better than these two times.   I don't know, I just try to do my best. 
Today was difficult.   I hope tomorrow is going to be a sunny day and we can play good tennis and enjoy. 

Q.   Why do you think you lost twice against him?
FABIO FOGNINI:   Why I think?   Because I lost. 
It was three years ago in MontrÃ©al and I think two years ago in Paris.   The two times was really tight match.   I lost in three sets, 7‑6, 7‑5, 6‑4.   The other 7‑6, 6‑4, something like. 
If I have to tell you something, he is the favorite, for sure. 

Q.   Do you expect the crowd to be for you or for him?
FABIO FOGNINI:   Half and half, I think.   55/45 for me because I was born close to here, San Remo.   Most of the crowd is Italian here.   More spectators coming from Italy.
