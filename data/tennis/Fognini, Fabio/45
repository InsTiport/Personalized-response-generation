    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Getting back to winning in this tournament, how are you feeling?   Sort of settled down in this tournament compared to maybe how you were in Rome?   Are things coming together for you here compared to Rome?   Do you feel more calm, maybe?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I mean, it's not ‑‑after Rome I went to Barcelona, and I spoke with my coach and we say, Okay, let's work, it's the only way to do it.   
    I went Barcelona few days, for five, six days.   I work a lot my body, my physical, and of course tennis, two times per day.  
    And now, of course, I'm happy because Grand Slam is always different.   Happy to be in the third round again.  
   
 Q.   Monfils in the third round.   You two have had some interesting meetings in the past.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, play against GaÃ«l, it's always difficult.   We play always great match, great fight.  
    I would like, I mean, an opportunity to play good, of course, and if I have some chance, go for it.  
    I mean, complicate his life and try to win, of course.   Because I am here for that.  
   
 Q.   You two have two of the biggest personalities on the men's game.   Do you feel that when you're on the court?   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   Well, I mean, I feel that we're gonna probably play on Chatrier or Suzanne Lenglen, it's good for the people, it's good for the crowd, for sure.   
    I play against him, I mean, it's difficult, especially here in Paris, because he's always play good.  
    But right now I one day off to think about that, tomorrow is another day, and hope to be ready on Saturday for this match.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it will be a normal match or something crazy?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I don't know.   I mean, I don't know.   I'm not crazy.   That's all (laughter).  
    Sometimes in the court I lost my mind, but that's part of our sport.   The good part of our sport, I think.  
   
 Q.   So it won't be boring?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I mean, not boring, not for sure, I think.   But it's going to be interesting match, for sure, because we have always great fight against him.   We know each other very well since juniors.  
    I hope it's gonna be great fight, great tennis.   That's the only thing that I would like to think.
