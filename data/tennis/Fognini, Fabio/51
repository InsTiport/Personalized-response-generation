  7‑6, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You must be delighted with that performance.   
FABIO FOGNINI:   I am, for sure (smiling).   I play another time I think a really good match with a fantastic player.   I mean, is top 10.   He won so many tournaments.   
Now I just have to say I'm really happy.   First semifinal in Monte‑Carlo, home.   So happy.   
   
 Q.   What was the key today?   
FABIO FOGNINI:   I don't know.   There is too many key.   I mean, play with Richard is not easy.   His backhand, it's unbelievable.   
I was trying to pushing him outside the baseline and play with my forehand.   So this is work a lot, especially at the beginning of the match when I have the chance.   4‑1 in the tiebreak, he coming back.   
The important thing I think was the tiebreak.   I mean, at the beginning I went 3‑0.   Was not easy.   Was not easy because first set was really physical.   After second set, he cooled down a little bit.   I mean, my performance was really great another time.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it's true to say it is the biggest moment of your career so far?  
FABIO FOGNINI:   Yeah, for sure, this is one of the best performance ever for me.   I mean, I just started, so is the first semifinal in Masters 1000.   I'm happy.   I have another opportunity to play with a great player here in the center court in front of too many people, special friend and family.   
So right now, as I say before, I'm really happy to play this semifinal.   
   
 Q.   You live not far from here.   So you have all the fans, family and friends.   It must have been very special.   Is it different from other matches?  
FABIO FOGNINI:   Yeah, for sure.   I just say at beginning of the week, for me, this tournament, 75% is Italian.   Many people coming here.   We are really close here from home.   Too many friends, family especially.   Everybody coming here to support me.   
I feel great.   Really comfortable.   
   
 Q.   Do you think maybe Gasquet was not 100% today or do you think he was at his top?  
FABIO FOGNINI:   I don't know.   That question you have to ask him.   It's not important to me.   I play I don't know if my best tennis this week, but I am really consistent.   I am just happy for now.   
For sure physically in the second set he come down a little bit.   But that's part of the tennis.   Nothing to say.
