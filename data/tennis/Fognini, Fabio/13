THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Is jetlag at all an issue seeing as you flew in yesterday?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Could be normal, no? I think I'm really proud and really happy about my performance. I did everything I can do. I play I think really good tennis. I was just tired in the end because, of course, I have less energy than the beginning. In a few moments, I was feeling that.   
 Q.  Take us through your last 48 hours. Must have been such an exciting time for you.  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah, for sure. Was completely tough leaving home, as you know. The first thing that I did, I was asking Flavia if was feeling okay, if everything was 100%. She say okay. I decide to fly in the end.   
I mean, for me was not important this result but was important that I was playing really good tennis. I was arriving yesterday, I was almost 3 in the morning. Wake up, play 20 minutes, going on court like that. I know Daniil is on the top of his career right now, so I was feeling really good even if I was losing during the whole match.   
 Q.  How much was the adrenaline kicking in very early on?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah, I think probably. Probably early was the only thing that was jumping like this without probably expectation.   
But I think tomorrow and especially the second day will be more tough than now because normally tomorrow and the second day the jetlag is coming. I feel more tired. I feel more pain everywhere, for sure.   
I think now is time to recovery. I'm exhausted. For sure I don't really want to play doubles. I'm really tired at the moment.   
Tomorrow is another day off. We see. I think the next match will be really important for us, not only for me. For me, of course, because I don't know how I wake up because we play in the morning. Just like today, I going to try to do my best.   
I was knowing leaving home I have no expectations about this ATP Cup because it's something important in my life happen the last week of December. Is like that. But I'm really proud about myself because I'm here. I think I play really good tennis. I think it's really good preparation for the next two tournaments.   
 Q.  Norway and Casper Ruud, who had a good win today. Another good challenge for you going forward?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yes.   
 Q.  You started so well in the first set. What was behind that great start against Medvedev? What were you doing better than him at that time?  
FABIO FOGNINI: I think even if I was tired, I was in control most of the time. I was feeling a little bit, of course, tired, without energy in my legs. Just at the end of the point when I have to close it, went to the net, I miss a few volley. I was not fresh like the beginning.   
I was 5-0 in 20 minutes. He's No. 5, 4 in the world. It tough also. Probably for him was tougher than me.   
 Q.  He said yesterday you said before you don't like playing him. Is that true?  
FABIO FOGNINI: I mean, of course, because it's one of the best players in the world. I know with my tennis, I can beat everybody, so...   
I'm happy for him if he say that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
FABIO FOGNINI: I don't care. Happy for him.
