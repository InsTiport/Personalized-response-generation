F. FOGNINI/R. Bautista Agut
7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Three-hour match today.  How do you feel physically and with your ankle?
FABIO FOGNINI: I'm tired at the moment, but I think it's normal.  Now, I mean, I feel some pain, of course, but I hope that it's nothing serious.
Q. (Off microphone.)
FABIO FOGNINI: At the moment, no.  But after three hours -- we play one set, one hour 15 minutes.  So I think was really long with that other rally.
And at the moment, yes, I'm tired.  I feel some pain, but I have more than one day to recover.  Hopefully that is nothing serious and try to recover as best I can.
Q. I saw a lot of Italian player coming, young Italian player coming on the tour.  Do you know if something change with the Italian Federation to add them?
FABIO FOGNINI: I don't know.  That's not a question that I probably can answer.
I hope that more Italian we are, I think is better.  I mean, now I'm 32.  Giuseppe is 35.  Bolelli is 34.  And we have few junior that are growing up, hopefully fast, because -- one is Musetti.  The other one is Sinner.  And hopefully they going to be here as soon as they can.  But I think you have to do step by step, of course.
And I think they have high level to play Challenger at the moment, to win a Challenger, because one of them win a Challenger.  And, you know, I think in every step is important for their career.  Hopefully I wish them to growing up faster, but -- and that's it.
But, you know, I think also that it's really tough, the career, I mean, with a lot of up and down.  So they have to be ready.  That's the first thing.
