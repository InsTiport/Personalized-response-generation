   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Four wins so far here in the tournament.  I guess it's exceeded expectations to this point.  How do you feel at this point right now into the third round?  Is this as deep as you've ever been in a Masters Series? 
 FABIO FOGNINI:  I feel play very good.  I won the qually.  I don't know what it is exactly, but I feel very good right now.  This is the best victory for me. 
 That's the tennis:  I have to play better him today on the court.  I try.  I do that.  I won. 

 Q.  Andy Murray obviously had a bit of a wrist problem.  He's a high-ranked player.  You took care of business on your end. 
 FABIO FOGNINI:  Before I know that Andy was injury three month of the wrist.  Was playing with Volandri in Hamburg.  5-1 in the first set, he retired.  He's a great, very good player.  He was top 10 for sure I don't know how many months, but was top 10.  Make top five easy. 

 Q.  More than likely a match-up with the world's No. 1.  In your wildest dreams, did you think that would happen? 
 FABIO FOGNINI:  That's a great occasion for me play with Roger.  Roger, it's the No. 1.  That's good for me.  I think also for Italy to see the match on TV. 
 I'm young, so I have to try to have experience.  Now I'm okay, I'm fine.  I have to try the best on the court tomorrow. 

 Q.  The name Fabio, is it short for something else? 
 FABIO FOGNINI:  No, just Fabio. 

 Q.  What part of Italy are you from? 
 FABIO FOGNINI:  North of Italy, Liguria.  Is near Monte-Carlo.
