THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Were you unhappy about being put on Court 14?  Do you think it should have been a bigger court?
FABIO FOGNINI: That's the schedule.  Schedule like that.  Nothing to say.
Q. You were caught saying in Italian, Damn English, I wish a bomb would explode on this club.  It was clear you were angry about what happened?
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah, the court was not really good.  You know, you play sport?
Q. Not as well as you.
FABIO FOGNINI: Well, most of the time when you're on court, you're frustrated.  For sure I was not happy about my performance today because I was knowing I have a lot to win in this case, because was I think I have a good chance to win.
Something happen on court, if I feel sorry for somebody, I have to say sorry.  Now I have to be focused on the second half of the season.
Q. You're currently serving a two-year suspended sentence, and if you commit a major offense...
FABIO FOGNINI: I just say to your colleague.  Next question.
Q. Are you sorry you said that?
FABIO FOGNINI: I say sorry.  If somebody feel offensive, I say sorry.  No problem.
Q. How is your hand?
FABIO FOGNINI: I have pain now.
Q. Is there anything else you don't like about Wimbledon?  Because it's quite a strong thing to say about a bomb.
FABIO FOGNINI: Nothing else.  I just say everything to him.
Q. Do you know what constitutes a major offense?
FABIO FOGNINI: I just answered before.
Q. I'm just saying...
FABIO FOGNINI: Next question, please.
