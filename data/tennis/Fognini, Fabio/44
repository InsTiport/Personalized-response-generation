J. TSONGA/F. Fognini
  5‑7, 6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   The match seemed to get away from you at the end.   You seemed to have a problem controlling your emotions.   Can you talk about that. 
FABIO FOGNINI:   I mean, I just want answer about the first question.   I lost the control, yeah, for sure.   I think was really tight match, 7‑5.   The second set was very tight.   Every game I had a lot of chance on maybe 2‑1 and 3‑2.   I have two 15‑40. 
But one bad call I lost everything.   I lost my game, that's the first.   Then, of course, I lost a little bit my emotion. 

Q.   Do you regret that, that you lost control of your emotions?
FABIO FOGNINI:   I'm not the first one and only one that he do that.   I'm not scared and not shy to tell you.
