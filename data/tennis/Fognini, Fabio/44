      5‑7, 6‑2, 6‑4, 0‑6, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.   
   
 Q.   Obviously very unusual match.   Just overall, what are your thoughts on all the changes that happened throughout the course of the match?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   It was tough match.   You know, just two days ago we play.   We play, always fighting.   
    Of course, I lost.   But I think at the time I had my chance, I had my opportunity, but few balls there.   Maybe it make the difference.   
    Especially the second set, how I start the second set, and after the 3‑2 when I broke him another time on the fifth.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the penalty point you had in the last set was deserved?   And also, we noticed you had a long chat with the supervisor.   Can you explain to us what that was about?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I have nothing to explain.   I just told him how I was thinking.   Physio was there close to him, so I called the physio because I was feeling during the fourth set some pain on my left quad and nothing more.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel on this court?   It was said that Suzanne Lenglen is very different from the other courts.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I play great.   I play epic match there, and I feel great.   I feel great.   
    Also during the match was a very tough match, really long.   You know, I'm happy about my tennis.   I'm not happy, of course, because I lost, but this is the sport.  
   
 Q.   But the clay was the same as on the other courts?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I don't know.   I don't know how to say, but, I mean, I think is the same.   The only thing is the court is really big and you have more space behind you.   I mean, I think nothing is changed.  
   
 Q.   After observing your pattern of behavior in a lot of your matches, it might seem like you like the fact that maybe some fans don't like you as much as maybe they like other players.   Do you enjoy that or...   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I always try to enjoy.   It's difficult.   
   
 Q.   But the fact that, you know, when we hear those boos, I think maybe some players would go home and cry.   You clearly aren't affected.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I'm not like that.   I just understand how the situation is now.   Of course, I feel bad because I lost.   But when you lose, then you give everything on court.   It's okay.   I mean, it's not okay, but it's okay when you finish and you say, Okay, I went on court, I do 100% today.   
    I played well in same situation.   And after with my coach, we would like to see the video and try to change what today was not working.  
   
 Q.   What were your thoughts during the fourth set when it didn't look like he was trying at all?   Looked like he was saving energy for the fifth set.   What were you thinking as that's happening?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   Ask him.   
   
 Q.   What were you thinking while it was happening?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   He always do like that, it's not my point.   I just say that I was starting better than the second set, for sure.   I start more solid with long rally.  
    At the end, I don't know.   Ask him when he's coming if he feel something or not.   That's not my answer.  
   
 Q.   Would you say you're the biggest talker on the tour and what does it to do to your game to talk that much on the court?   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   You say that or who say that?   
   
 Q.   That's what you notice in general.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I don't care.   I go on my way.   That's what I have to say to you.   Nothing more.   
   
 Q.   There were several moments of tension actually between you and the box of GaÃ«l Monfils.   You told them several times to be quiet.   Can you share some thoughts about that?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   You crazy?   
   
 Q.   No, I saw that.   I was behind the box.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   It was not for the box.   It was one people talking every time to me after the second serve, after, during the play.   
    So it was nothing on GaÃ«l's box.   If you say that, I mean, I think you didn't see the match.   
   
 Q.   Fair enough.   
    FABIO FOGNINI:   It's stupid question, sorry, but I have nothing to GaÃ«l's box.   I respect him.   I respect his box.   If you say that, it's a stupid question.   
   
 Q.   When you're on the court, do you want people to like you or do you not care?  
    FABIO FOGNINI:   I just, as I say to your friend near to you, so I can't answer now.   I was clear.   So if you understand what I say, then you understand.   If not, is not my problem.
