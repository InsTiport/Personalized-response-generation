  F. FOGNINI/B. Paire
 6-1, 7-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Talk about today's match.
 FABIO FOGNINI:   For sure I was playing better than yesterday.  My opponent, he's dangerous, he really dangerous.  I was trying to be myself really solid since I was playing 6-1, 3-Love.  I know he was trying to do something different.  I played really bad two games.  I get, of course, a bit angry.
 I was in the match every second, so that's the good point of today, of my performance.
 Q. How are you finding the conditions and the court and the crowd?
 FABIO FOGNINI:   Tough to say because conditions are completely different than where we are living, Europe, United States.  I'm happy to be here without any problem.  We did the hard quarantine.  That was tough.  It was really strict, how you say, points of the quarantine.
 But I'm happy because we have a chance to play normal.  We have public.  People can come to enjoy the match, to support us.  Nothing else.
