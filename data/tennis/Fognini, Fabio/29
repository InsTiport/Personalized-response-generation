A. ZVEREV/F. Fognini
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You played some of the best tennis of your career to beat the World No. 1 Murray the other day.  Today the magic was missing a little bit.  Was it the conditions, the opponent?  What was it?
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah, I think both.  My opponent played really good tennis, and the conditions was better for him, for sure.
