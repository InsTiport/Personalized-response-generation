F. FOGNINI/A. Mannarino   
6-7, 7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How is the leg, first off?  
FABIO FOGNINI: It was a long match.  It was really tough since the beginning.  I was, I think, first crazy set 4-1, double break, and I lose.  I was break down and I won the tiebreak in the third.   
It was really tough.  Always tough play against him.  He's lefty.  A really, really good backhand.  But, you know, I'm happy because first semifinal here in Sydney, so happy for my performance, because I was saying on the court I always play bad on the tournament.  So finally I'm the last four (smiling).   
 Q.  It was a tight match overall and your second three-set game in a row.  How are you feeling after?  Are you fatigued?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Of course I'm a little bit tired now, but now I have time to recovery, hopefully be recovery well and be ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  There was lots of random music going on out there.  You seemed to be distracted by it.  What was that all about?  
FABIO FOGNINI: I mean, something that was probably the festival.  I don't know (smiling).   
Strange.  I don't know if it was inside the stadium or outside.   
 Q.  Yeah, everyone seemed confused about it.  
FABIO FOGNINI: Probably.  Was really strange.   
 Q.  So you had a couple of moments in frustration out there at times.  
FABIO FOGNINI: A little bit, yes.  Especially at the end of the first set, because I was playing really good since 4-1, even if it was 4-4.  He was playing a little bit better, but, you know, I lost the first set.  How I lose the first set was really frustrating, yeah.   
 Q.  So it's your first semifinal in Sydney.  Playing Daniil Medvedev tomorrow.  Looking forward to that?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah, I'm really looking forward.  Once I'm here, of course I have to try to do my best and reach my goal to reach the final.   
I play once last year in Cincinnati.  He's a really young guy and he play really good, so I have to be ready.   
 Q.  Your outfit today was quite interesting.  
FABIO FOGNINI: You like it?   
 Q.  I loved it.  I thought it was great.  
FABIO FOGNINI: Italian look.   
 Q.  It got some color onto the court.  
FABIO FOGNINI: Yeah.  We decide to, I mean, to play with that.  I think it's nice.  Something different.  So I'm happy.   
 Q.  It was quite a long game going back and forth, especially in that game in the second set.  That went for like a long time there.  What do you think was overall effective on your game?  
FABIO FOGNINI: I mean, I was telling before that was really long game, especially in a few moments of the match.  But, you know, that's why we are here, just to compete and be ready for this tournament.  And of course next week we play best-of-five sets, so I think I'm ready.   
I'm happy to be in semifinal for the first time.  I'm happy with my game.  Now, for sure, I would like to play my first final here in Sydney.   
 Q.  It was so close throughout the whole match until the fifth game, you hit that backhand winner, you broke, and then you didn't lose another point.  What changed in terms of the dynamic or the pattern?  
FABIO FOGNINI: Nothing.  I think he was really tired at the end of the match, because we almost playing three hours.  Was really tough match, really long rally.   
I'm tired, too, but, you know, at the end I think I was a little bit more fresh and, you know, happy for the victory.  That's it.
