  THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Shahar, do you take any consolation at all that you challenged Serena more than any other opponent, both here and Australia? 
 SHAHAR PEER:  Not really, because the result is that I lost, and she's the winner.  She's going to play the final, not me.  I mean maybe I'm happy a little bit from the way I was playing the first set.  I was playing a little bit better than the second set. 
 I didn't feel very good timing the whole match.  I don't know.  I was not feeling very -- I was looking at my statistics in the big board, and I had seven winners the first set, which is obviously not really my game. 
 But still, I was very close; it could go either way.  And unfortunately, second set she was running away.  She was serving very good the whole match.  Second set her unforced were much less than the beginning. 

 Q.  The emotions were pretty high out there? 
 SHAHAR PEER:  The what? 

 Q.  From the fans.  There was a lot of confrontation between you and your fans. 
 SHAHAR PEER:  Yeah, the second game -- no, the third game when I was serving my second time, the first part was so loud when I was just laughing.  It was very nice to see how everybody were involved.  And I didn't think everybody would stay.  But I hope we gave a good time for the fans, at least the first set, and unfortunately, I lost today.  But I hope they enjoyed the match. 

 Q.  Yesterday you mentioned that your grandparents are from Czechoslovakia.  Are they from Czech or Slovakia? 
 SHAHAR PEER:  More Slovakia, but before it used to be together. 

 Q.  Do you know cities? 
 SHAHAR PEER:  No. 

 Q.  From Slovakia? 
 SHAHAR PEER:  No, I know they are from Slovakia.
