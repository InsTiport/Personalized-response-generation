 Q. Are you happy with the win? It was a grueling match? 
 
 IRINA SPIRLEA: It was what? 
 
Q. A grueling match.
 
 IRINA SPIRLEA: It's always when you play with Amanda. I mean, it's tough to win easy
against her. I mean, I don't know anybody who beats her like one and one. Even if she
beats her one and one, she plays her two hours. So I'm happy, yeah, with the way I played.
Beating Amanda gives you a lot of confidence because she's one of the toughest players,
you know, strongest players on The Tour now. You need a lot of patience to beat her. She's
not going to give you a lot of free points. 
 
Q. What did you have to do? What did it require on your side to win tonight?
 
 IRINA SPIRLEA: At the beginning, I think I was a little bit confused with the wind, you
know. After a while, I start to use more the wind from that side, where it was the wind,
and have more patience. It's not my strongest point to have patience, but tonight I had
it, so I'm happy. 
 
Q. In looking ahead, how do you feel about your game and your chances in this
tournament?
 
 IRINA SPIRLEA: Next round I have to play Monica. I never beat her actually. Last time
we had a tough match. So, you know, I'm looking forward to play well, do well in this
tournament. So far, you know.
