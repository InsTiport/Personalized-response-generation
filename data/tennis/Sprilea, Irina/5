Q.  Compared to your level of play yesterday, how would you evaluate your play today, the caliber of your play today?  Do you think that you didn't play up to the level you played yesterday or do you think that maybe Jana put a lot of pressure on you? 
 
IRINA SPIRLEA:   I think it's another match. It's completely another style.  I was playing pretty well, but she played very well.  She was serving well and she was returning well and she was coming in.  It was tough to pass her.  I was expecting to come in.  I was trying to go to the net sometimes before her.  I think she played well, and she deserved to win.  I was doing everything I could to make her mess it up, but it was not working. 
 

Q.  Did having to finish after midnight last night take anything out of you today?  Did you feel tired after that today, sluggish? 
 
IRINA SPIRLEA:   No, I slept at around 3 o'clock, but it was okay.  That's okay.  Actually, I had a good sleep, so it's nothing to do with the time. 
 

Q.  What aspects of your game do you think you need to work on most to move higher next year?
 
IRINA SPIRLEA:   Maybe to go a little bit more to the net and take the ball earlier, take the time.  I'll have to work on my serve a little bit more.  Everything, you have to work all the time, because the game is improving.  You have to keep going. 
 

Q.  How do you feel about your year, looking back?
 
IRINA SPIRLEA:   I think I had a great year so far.  It's my best year and I'm happy that I finish finally.  I would have loved to play tomorrow in the final, but I'm not complaining, I had a great tournament, a great year and I'm happy about the way I played.
