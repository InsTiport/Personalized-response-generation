 Q. Sabine, has Gigi Fernandez suddenly become a formidable opponent in singles? 
 
 SABINE HACK: I don't know. I didn't play well. Especially I didn't return well. I don't
know. I played too much on her backhand and she came in a lot. My game plan didn't work
out quite well. The first hard court tournament last week I lost first round, so maybe I
didn't go too confident in this match and I hope it is going to get better.  
 
Q. What round did you go out at Wimbledon? 
 
 SABINE HACK: First.  
 
Q. Two poor results in a row in Grand Slams. Do you see a connection? 
 
 SABINE HACK: Wimbledon, I didn't even want to play because usually I don't play on fast
surfaces. And here, I mean I thought my goal was like third fourth round, but Gigi -- it
isn't easy to get through -- she doesn't give you any rhythm. She comes in all the time.
She volleys really well, so I wanted to keep her back and it just didn't work.  
 
Q. Have you seen a marked improvement in her game in singles in the past few months? 
 
 SABINE HACK: I played her two years ago here and I lost but I think she plays the same.
She is really good at the net but she doesn't really move good. I wanted to get her
moving. What is really good in the serve and the volley. That is why she is one of the
best doubles players.  
 
Q. You say your game plan didn't really work. Did she do anything in particular that
surprised you? 
 
 SABINE HACK: No. I mean, I just basically didn't have the depth in my groundstrokes,
which made her -- made it possible so that she could come in and I played too much to her
backhand when she comes in with the backhand slice and I didn't want to have her at the
net. It is basically my own mistake.  
 
Q. Thanks very much.
