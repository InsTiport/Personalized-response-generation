Q.  How well did you think Kimiko played today? 

SABINE HACK:  I think she played well.  I don't know.  I've never played against her before, and so, I didn't know, but I think she played pretty well. 


Q.  Anything about her game impress you? 

SABINE HACK:  I think everything is pretty solid, you know.  Her serve, forehand, and backhand.  She hits good angles, I think it's very solid. 


Q.  Sabine, when you went up a break, 3-2 in the first set and then everything kind of fell apart after that? 

SABINE HACK:  Yes. 


Q.  What happened after that? 

SABINE HACK:  I really don't know.  I have no explanation for that.  I don't know.  I just backed up a little bit, I didn't play so aggressive like I did in the beginning and then, on a fast surface like this, if you back up, you just make so many mistakes and I just couldn't get back in the match for some reason, I don't know.  It wasn't my day today. 


Q.  Thank you.
