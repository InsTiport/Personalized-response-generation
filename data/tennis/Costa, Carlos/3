 Q. Were you thinking about your fifth set -- during the fifth set were you thinking
about your French Open match with Krajicek? 
 
 CARLOS COSTA: If I'm in?  
 
Q. During the fifth set were you -- 
 
 CARLOS COSTA: No. We play I think the first set, but what are you asking?  
 Oh, that's right, when I was 4-2 up and I lost the set, I said to me, you have to win
this match, you have to beat him, because if you don't beat him today, maybe you don't
beat him never. Because I lost in French Open last year and then in another tournament
last year. It's tough to try again.
