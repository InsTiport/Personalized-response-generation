 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you tell me, have you played Diego before?  Obviously you have watched him play.  Was this a different Diego?  Is he playing better now than you had seen him previously?
 LORENZO SONEGO:   Sorry, my English is very bad.
 Q. Your English is better than my Italian.  Don't say you're sorry.  Can you say how you thought Diego played today?  Was he very strong today?
 LORENZO SONEGO:   Yeah, is the first time against Diego.  Is a good player on clay.  Very strong player.  Today was a tough match.  I know that.  I had a problem with my arm.
 Today Diego was better than me.
