S. KUNIEDA/S. Houdet
4-6, 6-1, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Title number nine here.  How does it feel?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: It is the happiest one this time because I absent because of injury, so it was tough to come back, to get this trophy, yeah.
Q. All the talk last year at the Australian Open was Federer-Nadal final.  You and Stephane brought an old classic back at this year's Australian Open.  How did it feel to be back on court battling against Stephane?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: Yes, I met him I think 52 or 53 times.  So it was a record Nadal-Federer.  I have a special emotion against him anytime.  If I beat him, it is very, very happy.  Not same as others.  It is special, yeah.
Q. 5-2, Stephane had three championship points at one point, how did you come back mentally and physically to get yourself through it?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: Yes, I believe myself all the time.  Ann Quinn is there.  She's my mental trainer.  It was very big point.  She was here this time, yeah, very big support.
Q. Last year was the year of the young guns coming through.  It was Australia where some of your longest unbeaten runs began.  Should the men's draw watch out for another Shingo revival?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: Yes, now men is very tough.  I think anyone can get trophy.  Because last year, four Grand Slams, four champions.  So now I don't know who will win next time.
Q. Before this tournament you made it back into the top five in the rankings.  How does that feel?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: Yes, I think from last year end, maybe from October, I felt getting better about my tennis.  I'm getting confidence.  Now I could do what I wanted, yeah.
Q. What's next?
SHINGO KUNIEDA: New Shingo is coming (smiling).
