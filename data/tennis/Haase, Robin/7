A. RODDICK/R. Haase
  6‑3, 6‑4, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk about the particular challenges of playing Andy Roddick. 
ROBIN HAASE:   Well, I mean, everyone knows he serves really good.   He kind of changed his game in the last few years, defending a little bit more, slicing more, trying to come to the net if he can. 
But he doesn't mind to play long rallies.   I don't like to play long rallies, as well.   Actually, my plan was to make him run a little bit.   But what happened is that I played one step too slow every time and then I need to run. 
I think in the first set, he was lucky.   I should have broken maybe once or even twice more.   On breakpoints, he had two, three line balls where I almost asked for Hawk‑Eye, that close.   I think if I can make one of those two games, I win the first set, and of course then the match is totally different because I probably going to play a little bit looser because I'm in front, and now it was the other way around.

Q.   Do you think his style makes you hit more errors than you normally would?
ROBIN HAASE:   I mean, he's really quick.   He covers the court really well.   So the point often ends with a fault or a winner. 
So probably if you look at the stats in his match, players would hit probably more unforced errors than usual.   But, I mean, I think that's with every top 20 player or top 30 player.   You need to win against the guys.   They don't give you anything.   So, of course, you make more mistakes than you play against someone who is 100 in the world.
