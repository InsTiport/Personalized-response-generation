 M. FISH/R. Haase
  6-3, 6-7, 6-2, 1-1 (ret.) 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What happened from your point of view, please?   
 ROBIN HAASE: Well, about the match or about why I gave up?   
  
  Q. Yeah, the latter; maybe they're connected. You tell me.   
 ROBIN HAASE: No, they're not connected, because against Verdasco in the third set I slipped. At 4-All, 40-30 for him I slipped with my right knee. I overstretched it.   
 At first I had pain, but after two, three minutes it was gone. After the match it was fine, but the next day I had a lot of fluid inside. I mean, I'm used to the fluid so that wasn't the problem.   
 The reason why I gave up now was everything else was hurting me: my legs, back, other knee, except for the knee where the fluid is in.  
  
  Q. Everything?   
 ROBIN HAASE: Everything else was starting to hurt me: my back, my legs, my other knee. So that was the reason why I stopped, because in my head I couldn't play probably anymore because I was scared to injure something else.  
  
  Q. Did you think about calling the trainer?  
 ROBIN HAASE: It's no use to call the trainer. I've seen the trainer before the match; the trainer can't help me on court.  
  
  Q. How did your opponent take it?  
 ROBIN HAASE: I think he's happy that he won. I think he feels sorry for me that I had to give up. Yeah.  
  
  Q. Have you been battling with those injuries during the year?   
 ROBIN HAASE: I've been injured one and a half years for the right knee, and I haven't -- since I've played I haven't had any trouble, and now I slipped and now I had the fluid inside. Yeah.
