THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Would you say the match today was tougher than the one with Rafael Nadal?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I think that all the matches are always different.   It's a complete different game against Viktor.   First of all, he served really well, he put a lot of returns in, especially in the important parts of the match.   
In the beginning I had some chances on his serve.   Maybe if I break there, maybe I was a little bit too passive, been a little bit more aggressive, would have broken, would have been a different match.   But it wasn't.   
He played great.   With his game, the way he was serving, especially in the tiebreak, I mean, I can do what I want, this guy had four aces and one service winner in the tiebreak, I'm most likely not going to win the tiebreak.  
   
 Q.   How would you rate your play today?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I think I played well and I wouldn't compare it to any other matches.   That's what I said after winning against Lu, and Rafa, it's always a totally different match.   I'm happy with my tournament.   When I came to quallies, someone would have said sign here for beating Rafa, making second round and qualifying, I would have signed that paper.   
   
 Q.   Was there a window where you could have turned the whole thing around?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Well, in that one game, obviously I tried something different on the return.   Tried taking it earlier.   Got also a little lucky there.   Basically besides one or two service games in the whole match, maybe in the beginning and one time where he double‑faulted twice in a row, there weren't many games where I had chances.   
If it was 30‑All, he had either an ace or a good serve that I didn't give back.   He didn't give me any chances.   
All the matches where I have won against great players, it doesn't make a difference if it's this tournament or even last year when I beat Isner, I could be aggressive on return of serve.   
I didn't get second serves, and I think when I got the second serves, I did it well.   But his first serve, he was serving too well.  
   
 Q.   You hit that outrageous return of serve.   Came back over.   Is that something you've done before?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Well, he hit a good kick serve.   I wanted to hit a dropshot.   I hit a dropshot and it came back over.   Everyone smiled, which is a good thing.   
   
 Q.   Can you compare grass to clay?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Everyone knows I like to play on grass and prefer to play on grass.   That's why it's also great that the grass court season has been extended.   
On the other side, like I've said before a few times, my type of play is aggressive.   I like to come to the net.   Obviously the faster the surface, the easier it is for me to do that.   I'm playing in rain in 10 degrees and the balls are heavy on clay is not exactly great for my game.   But I've learned to cope with that.   
Like I've showed during this tournament, I can beat a lot of good guys on a given day if I put the game together.   
Yeah, I guess all credit to Vik.   He served too well for me today to be aggressive.   I'm happy with the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You said you would have signed up for it.   How would you sum up the whole experience of this week, even beyond the court?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Well, everything.   It's a lot of new experiences.   It's been great.   Obviously having the pleasure and being able to play on Centre Court and then to play a match like that, doesn't make a difference if I lost today or not, no one will ever be able to take that I way from me.   
Same thing I said after winning last year in Halle, I came here with expectations to play in quallies, knowing that the quallies is very tough because the first time that the singles main draw cut was that high.   So the goal then was to qualify.   Okay, when you're in the main draw, you go match by match.   Winning two matches against Rafa and against Lu, who are very good players, yeah, it's just a great experience.   
Yeah, now I have to look forward, and look forward to the next tournament.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) was in the crowd today?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I gave him tickets.   Not from me, but a friend of mine asked me if I could put the tickets down.   I wrote the name down on the paper, but I didn't think about it.   Then when I went on the court, I saw him.   I was like, Okay, maybe that's the person I left the tickets for.   
It's great.   It's an honor for him.   I don't know a lot about soccer, so I'm not going to get into that.   It was an honor for him to be there and watch the match.   Also saw that he was sitting in the box area.   
Yeah, everything has just been really great.   I'm excited and I'm looking forward to playing good tennis for the rest of the year.   
   
 Q.   Sponsor patches.   
DUSTIN BROWN:   Yeah, it was just for that match.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about that.   
DUSTIN BROWN:   They called and said, Do you want to wear the patch?   
I said, Yes, and put it on.   
   
 Q.   What is the schedule now?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   The schedule is to go to the airport and take the earliest flight, because tomorrow morning, I have club matches in Cologne, Germany.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to the US Open?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Well, that's a little bit down the road.   I haven't seen anything about that yet because next thing is going to Cologne and playing club matches tomorrow morning.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a schedule planned after here?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I'm going to Newport.   That's the next plan.   After that I will see what I'm doing.   I haven't entered any other tournaments yet.   
I think with the points from now, I should be in the main draw at the US Open.   Again, I didn't look at all of that.   I guess after the next two weeks when the ranking comes out, I'll see.  
   
 Q.   Dreadlocks are so beautiful.   Talk about playing elite level tennis with the dreads?   Do you enjoy it?   Ever been a downside?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Not sure how to answer that question.   Like I said yesterday, that is part of being me and I play tennis.   What my hair is doing while I'm playing tennis, it doesn't bother me, otherwise I wouldn't have the hair.   That's why that question's a little difficult for me to answer.   
   
 Q.   Did you not consider taking any kind of break after this?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   Yeah, well, obviously a lot of us have obligations.   I got to look at the big picture.   The plan was from the beginning that if I'm not in the tournament, I will be there for the team and play tomorrow.   Whatever state I'll be in tomorrow, is a different situation.   If the team decides, Okay, Dustin, you should take a break, we don't think you should play.   
On the other side, it's only two sets and a champion's tiebreaker, which is a lot easier than playing best‑of‑five out here.   
   
 Q.   Are you planning to get back to Jamaica at any stage?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Obviously I'm going to go.   When I'm going to go, I'm not sure yet.   Normally I go at the end of the year during the off‑season.  
   
 Q.   You should be proud of yourself.   
DUSTIN BROWN:   I never said I'm not proud.   That's what I said.   You asked me the question, I told you I'm happy with my tournament.   
   
 Q.   You're proud of yourself?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Obviously.   
   
 Q.   On a scale of 1 to 10, you would say 9?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Sometimes these questions don't make a lot of sense because it is great that I've done that.   But like I said, tomorrow, the next thing is tomorrow.   The next thing after that is Newport.   After I won the Rafa match, I went to the room.   Okay, I was awake because I was so full of adrenaline.   But then I can't just sit there and say, Oh, great.   I beat Rafa.   Life is great.   Then two days later, what?   
So one thing has happened, it is great.   When I'm in Jamaica at the end of the year, then I can have a Red Stripe and say, Great.   Great year, Dustin.   You played great.   There's no time for that right now.   
   
 Q.   Besides beating Rafa, what is the best memory you will take home from this Wimbledon tournament?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Well, everything.   Going through quallies, having a lot of great people around me.   There was a lot of new experiences with everything.   Obviously being able to play on Centre Court, which I've always dreamed about playing.   I mean, then pulling off a performance like that, I probably didn't think that was going to happen.   
All of that is great.   I don't think there's one exact moment.   Everything is coming together.   It's just made everything special.   
   
 Q.   Will the money you've earned here help you perhaps get more of a full‑time coach?   You've been working with Craig.   
DUSTIN BROWN:   That obviously depends.   Obviously it's great to make money in a tournament like this.   But then sometimes people that look at that don't look at the bunch of weeks where we play a challenger where first round of challenger in Italy, for example, you get  300 minus 30% tax.   You can check what a flight is from Frankfurt to Italy.   
It's one great week.   Obviously a lot of money.   But there's also so many weeks where we throw money out the window basically, just for flights and food.   That's just for us alone.  
   
 Q.   Do you have debt to pay off at all?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I don't see what that has to do with this.
