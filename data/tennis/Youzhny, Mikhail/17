   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What's the problem? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Wrist pain. 

 Q. Wrist pain? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yes.

 Q. Which wrist? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: My right hand. I start to feel, you know, against Gasquet in last set a little bit. The next day was worse and worse little bit. 
 But I don't think I going to play. I was going to try, but was not. Hajek play a lot. He just give me chance to win. I'm not practice yesterday, just try to warm up today. And I feel I cannot. 

 Q. Did you have any treatment? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: No, I have treatment every day. I going to doctor every day. I have some anti-pain pills. I do everything what I can do for these days, but it doesn't help. 

 Q. Do you know what it is? Is it tendinitis? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yes, first they say just tired because I play five hours. First match in the season after big rest. First of all, they say just tired the tendons and muscles. 
 But after like three, four days, it's same situation. I don't do picture or something. I just want to come back to Moscow and start to make...

 Q. You didn't practice yesterday at all?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: I didn't practice at all yesterday.

 Q. You felt it today in the warmup?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: I cannot play backhand at all. I can play little bit forehand, but still little bit pain. I understand it's no chance to play well here. If I continue to play here, you know, I can miss a lot of time. 

 Q. Did you actually get to the court today?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: No. It's no reason, because I go to doctor. I ask, Is it possible to maybe take tablets? He said, Maybe it's possible, not hundred percent. But maybe in future will be much worse because without pain you will play harder and nobody knows what happens later.

 Q. Have you had this before? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: No, first time.

 Q. How disappointing is it after winning that long match now having to pull out?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yeah, you know, of course it's tough for me now because actually I play well. I ready to play. But this is life sometimes. You have injury and you have to pull out if you cannot play. 

 Q. Do you have any idea how long? Did the doctor say?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: No. He just tell me if I continue to play today, it could be really long. So but how long now, I hope not really long.
