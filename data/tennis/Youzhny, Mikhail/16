M. YOUZHNY/J. Tipsarevic
  6-3, 6-4

 Q. Dubai has been kind to you over the years. It seems to be a tournament that you prosper at?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Actually, I won my first match in Dubai like when I played for the third time here. But so, anyway, I enjoy to play here, and it's a good tournament. 

 Q. You feel as though you can do even better than you've done in previous years - one final and four semis? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yeah, I tried. Actually, I really enjoy to play here and I like this place. So might have good results here. 

 Q. What was the key to your victory today?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: I think my key, I took little bit advantage of Janko because he had a really tough match last night. And I'm finished little better than him. And maybe I'm just recovering better than him because he made more mistakes than me. 

 Q. What do you expect for the next match? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: I saw little bit how Jurgen beat Cilic. It was a really tough match for me because he plays well now. He's had really good results for the last times, Jurgen. So it will be tough. 

 Q. You struggled in the match against the Slovakian?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: What? 

 Q. In the match against the Slovakian, but afterwards you've been playing straight sets. How has it made the transformation? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: In Rotterdam I have little bit injury. I didn't practice almost one week. And I just started to practice not even practice, just start to play here on Friday. And I have to go in first match it will be really tough. Moving not so well, and this guy played really good. So it was really, really tough. And it was second set had really close to lose. 

 Q. You've had a wrist injury and hamstring injury this year?
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yeah.

 Q. Which is the worst of the two? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: They're both worst (laughing). 

 Q. Are either of them still with you or have they both gone away? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: No, it's now it's pretty good. I feel a little bit on my leg, but it's okay. My wrist, it's good. 
 But anyway, no. It's tough going in there, and tough matches all the time, so sometimes it happens. 

 Q. Where do you go after Dubai tournament? Davis Cup? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Yeah, I have to play Davis Cup, Moscow against India, and after Indian Wells and Miami.

 Q. Is that a busy schedule this year for you? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: It's not only for me, I think (smiling). It's for all players. We have to play Masters in Indian Wells and Miami, and to play Davis Cup, and actually to play -- actually, I don't have any choice. 

 Q. What is your goal for this year, ranking or some tournaments, special tournaments? 
 MIKHAIL YOUZHNY: Of course you want to be top. One thing is I want to play without injury all year, and show almost at every match my really good game. Not too much I've been down in previous years. I want to play this year at really high level, but we'll see what's happening.
