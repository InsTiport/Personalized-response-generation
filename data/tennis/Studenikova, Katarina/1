 Q. Do you feel she was pretty vulnerable tonight to get upset? Did you feel you could
upset her tonight? 
 
 KATARINA STUDENIKOVA: At the beginning, no, then I started to play quite good, second
set, and if I -- maybe if I would have been in the third set, was 3-2 down, if I would
maybe make that point, maybe I could make 2-4 and 2-5. It's quite -- quite a long way to
go.  
 
Q. She had the trainer come out. Did you see anything that seemed to be causing her
discomfort or problems? 
 
 KATARINA STUDENIKOVA: No.  
 
Q. Was the wind bothering you at all and were you trying to play the ball,
occasionally, a little high because of that? 
 
 KATARINA STUDENIKOVA: Yeah, because I play straight balls and the wind is bothering me.
But I can play in wind. But, today, it was -- in the second set, when the wind was not so
strong and I played quite good.
