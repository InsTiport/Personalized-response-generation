Q. Guillaume, you were up two sets and then you come to the fifth set at 4-5, you get
three match points, the first of which he hits an amazing backhand winner on; can you tell
me about that point? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Well, is the passing shot of the year, maybe. 

Q. Did it look -- I mean, it was good? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Excuse me? 

Q. It was good? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Of course it was good. 

Q. Because there was a point in the tiebreaker at 5-1 where right before the changeover
you didn't like the call and he had come over -- 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: He seen the point at 5-1 and the breaker and when it's match point,
it's not the same point. 

Q. I'm not saying it's the same point. 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: I understand what you're saying, but the passing shot was great. 

Q. How about the point on the sixth point in the tiebreaker; was it clearly out? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Yes. 

Q. On the final point, it seemed as though when he hit the return you didn't even move,
were you conceding the winner then, was the match over then? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Talking about the breaker was 7-1 and passing the breaker is nothing
in the match compared what could have been before. So, you talk about the last point, but
the last point means nothing. Did you play a tennis match before? 

Q. I have, yes. You played a very good one today. 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: Thank you. 

Q. When you were down 4-Love in the tiebreaker in the fifth set just like you were down
4-Love in the tiebreaker in the first set, at that point did you think you could still
come back like you did in the first set? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: I tried. 

Q. Did you ask him about his injury or you felt that he was seriously hurt? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: I play against him. I don't care about the fact he has an injury or
not. I played and if he was injured I could have beat him. It means he was much better
than me. 

Q. I thought in his transcript he said you asked him if he was injured or if he wanted
a trainer? 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: If I asked? I never ask anything to the trainer. 

Q. I just wanted to clear that up. It sounds as if on this sheet that you had asked him
if he was interested in a trainer. 

GUILLAUME RAOUX: No.
