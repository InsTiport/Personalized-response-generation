MAGDA LINETTE/C. Paquet
3-6, 6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. First of all, I would like to ask you about today's match.  Your performance in the first set was incredible, but later Magda showed maybe a little bit more experience.  But what was your opinion about this match?  Because you're so young.  You showed incredibly good performance.
CHLOE PAQUET: Yeah, the first set was good.  I mean, Magda missed a lot, so it helped me a lot.  And I think she changed her game after.
She was more aggressive, and it was very tough to play my game.  So congrats to her.  I gave everything, so of course I'm disappointed.
It's my favorite tournament of the year.  But I think she was better today.
Q. How did you feel on court?  Because a lot of people were cheering for you.  The whole stadium was with you; right?
CHLOE PAQUET: Yeah, the crowd was amazing.  With the French on Court 14, it's always a good court for us.  Yesterday we saw Pierre-Hugues and the atmosphere was amazing.  And today also there were a lot supporting me, but unfortunately it was not my day.
Q. And what do you think technically about your tennis right now?  Do you think that you are composing 100% of your tennis or how could you describe your current level of tennis?
CHLOE PAQUET: I think today was not 100%, for sure, of my game.  It was not the best match of the year for sure.  But I got everything.
So I have some regrets of my game.  My serve was not good today.  I didn't move great.
And she's a good player.  So I was not -- I mean, she was better than me today.
