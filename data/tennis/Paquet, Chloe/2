P. PARMENTIER/C. Paquet   
3-6, 7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  To start a match again can't be easy, right?  
CHLOE PAQUET: No, it isn't, especially the first time.  And it was a long match, and towards the end last night I wasn't feeling that well, so it was very hard to get to sleep.   
When you have two out of three winning sets, it makes you stress out, and Pauline was the winner today, and therefore, it was a bit complicated.   
 Q.  You could see that you were hoping at the beginning of the third set that you hoped that it would be interrupted and take over the next day?  
CHLOE PAQUET: Yes, of course, but the umpire said we're going to continue another 20 minutes.   
But obviously I wouldn't have anything to say.  But if Rafa was on the court, what I can say is there wasn't enough light, and if we both agree to stop after two sets, he said 20 minutes, and I thought, Well, if we can have time, we should have finished the set.   
But in 20 minutes, we knew that we weren't able to do that, and we both agreed.  I understand that they have a schedule, and I understand that they want to make sure that as many possible matches are played and the next day it could rain.  But if it were another player and if it were a very well-ranked one, I think they would have stopped after two sets.   
 Q.  We saw that your calf was hurting.  What happened?  Because in the beginning of the match, it seemed as though you were well.  
CHLOE PAQUET: Yes, I was.  I was well.  But I started having a cramp, and I asked the trainer to come.  He asked me, What's the problem?   
I said, Well, my calf is hurting.   
He massaged me, and then it became a real cramp.  And unfortunately that's what happened.   
 Q.  (off microphone.)  
CHLOE PAQUET: Yeah, today it was okay, but I didn't really have a problem to finish the match.
