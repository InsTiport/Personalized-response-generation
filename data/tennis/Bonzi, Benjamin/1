 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I have a question about the experience of playing with smaller crowds.  It's obviously a far different experience than the one you had in 2017.  Would you say that it's helpful to have small crowds because you don't feel so much pressure or do you feel you prefer to have the big crowds to lift you up and give you energy?
 BENJAMIN BONZI:   No, of course I prefer to get the big crowd, but, you know, this is very strange condition.  There is still not too much people, but I have got my coach next to the court and when you get on to the court you only have to focus on the game.  There is no fans here this year and you have to deal with that, but just think about the game.
 Q. Do you think in some ways it helps you focus?
 BENJAMIN BONZI:   That there is no crowd?
 Q. The fact that there's, yeah, no crowd and it's kind of quiet.
 BENJAMIN BONZI:   Yeah, I think it's easier because there is not too much sound around.  This is kind of calm and, yes, of course there is less pressure with no crowd.  You only have to think about your game and, yeah, I think it's easier.
 Q. How do you feel about those conditions today?  Were they unlike any that you played in before?
 BENJAMIN BONZI:   Which condition?  This is perfect, no?  (Laughing.)  This is perfect.
 No, it's very cold.  There is a lot of -- it is very windy.  And, yeah, it's very, very cold, so this is not easy to play.
 But we have to play with that.  We have to adapt.  And yeah, it's better to play than no tournament, so we have to deal with it.
