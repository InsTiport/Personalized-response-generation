THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  How do you feel about playing Agassi?
 
DOMINIK HRBATY:  I hope it's going to be great match.  We played here year 2000.  I beat him here that time. With Andre I always like to play.  It's always great tennis.  He's a great player.  I have nothing to lose.  I always enjoy the match against the guy like him.  I'm looking forward to it.  For sure if I play -- I hope if I play like today, I have a big chance to win. 
 

Q.  What's changed since then?
 
DOMINIK HRBATY:  I think I play more consistent now than I used to play in 2000.  Now I have more solid results.  My tennis is not that much up and down.  I think I do less mistakes, easy mistakes, than I did before maybe.  I go more often also to the net.  I improved my ground strokes.  I think I can play from any position a lot of different angles, which at that time I didn't used to play; I played many same shots, and now I have a bigger variety. 
 

Q.  Was that one of your best performances on clay for many years?  It certainly looked like it.
 
DOMINIK HRBATY:  Yeah, I played well.  I mean, last year I didn't have probably -- I had a final on clay in Casablanca, but didn't beat anybody big this year.  Especially I beat first time also Tim, which, for me, it's very important.  With these kind of guys like him, I never liked to play too much. But I played very well today and I served big, so I can say that was one of my best matches this year - I mean on clay, not on the tour.
