THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You must be pretty happy with today's game.  Nice and easy to get through in three sets. 
 
DOMINIK HRBATY:  You know, it always helps to get through to the quarterfinals.  I wouldn't say so easy, but very quickly.  I can save a little bit of energy for my quarterfinal match.  
 
Q.  How do you think you're playing at the moment?  What is your current form like?  Do you think you can go further? 
 
DOMINIK HRBATY:  There is Safin or Rochus, both those guys I beat couple times.  So I think I have a chance again.  Today was a little difficult to play because we played on the outside court and was really very windy, and the wind was turning around.  So wasn't easy for us.  But when I played against Gaudio on the big court, where usually there is no wind, it was very good game I played.  I felt that it's very good tennis I play.  And you see there is on Tuesday there should be hot weather, 37.  So looking forward to it (smiling).
