THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  How disappointed were you when you found out you would play with the roof closed? 

DOMINIK HRBATY:  Of course, I wasn't happy.  I mean, I was still confident and I can give Marat a hard time.  I think his game step up one or two levels when he found out that we play indoor.  He was serving much better.  I think you can't serve like this if you play outdoor, I mean, just so solid and so hard.  And also there is a heat factor which you can get, you know, little tired or just have a -- you don't feel for a couple of games not really well.  But he played well first two sets.  Didn't have really chances.  My serve wasn't that accurate like his.  Couldn't get the rhythm little bit with the roof closed.  Then in the end, after he broke me, I didn't play like maybe last three games well.  It was in the end of the match already.  He was playing too well anyway.  I don't think I would beat him.

Q.  Is this the best he ever played against you?

DOMINIK HRBATY:  Yeah, for sure.

Q.  Do you see him as a favorite if any of his next matches would be played under the roof? 

DOMINIK HRBATY:  Yeah.  With his serve, definitely.  I mean, he's very consistent with the serve.  It's tough to break.  I mean, he made some mistakes from the baseline, but you have to return the serving first.  Still, he played many winners, many good shots.  You know, if he plays like this, of course he has chance.  But against the guys like Federer and Hewitt, you have to play one more match like this.
