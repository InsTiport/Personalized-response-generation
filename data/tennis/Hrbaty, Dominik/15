THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Were you a little surprised by him at the beginning of the match or were you slow to get into it?
 
DOMINIK HRBATY: He was playing well.  He didn't miss any balls in the wind, that we played in the beginning was so strong and I had more trouble with the wind than with the opponent.  But he, I mean, he was not missing too many balls so also he didn't play bad.  He played great tennis.  Just in the third set, I told myself,  "Okay, let's fight, and we'll see how it will go." And I feel  -- I start to feel like I got my chances and after the third set I won, I just believed that I'm not gonna lose and I won easy.  Then I think he won only one serve till the end of the match.  The wind start slowing down little bit and I got into the shape little bit more and I played much more better and didn't give him any chance then.
