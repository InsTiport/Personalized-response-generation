ITF:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Could you talk in general about how the match went, what your injury was?  Tommy Haas said he thought it was a trick to stall for time or something.  What was the extent of your injury?

DOMINIK HRBATY:  He played well today.  I didn't play that well.  For me was a good practice to go to Basel.  I was coming here to just make good preparation for the other tournament because that's more important to go for race to Hannover.  Every match for me is good, but it's more important to go to make a race to Hannover.  Now I know what I can play.  It was my first indoor tournament.  Now I know what can I play indoor, what I don't.  I think was a good match for me. 

Q.  And your injury?

DOMINIK HRBATY:  Yeah, I feel pain in the leg.  I had a broken muscles in the other leg in the same spot.  It's the same spot.  I had like a little problems to go up with the stairs now.  It's painful.  But we going to see tomorrow what's wrong. 

Q.  Would you prefer hard places?  You now have a little handicap?

DOMINIK HRBATY:  I don't understand.

Q.  What do you prefer, hard places?  Here is very hard to play, very quick.  Is for you better?

DOMINIK HRBATY:  Doesn't matter.  If you play well, you can play well on any surface.  If you play bad, you play bad on any surface.  Doesn't matter what you playing.
