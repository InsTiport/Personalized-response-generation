THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tatiana, when did you first know that Vika had some back issues and she wouldn't be able to play today? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   She told me she already felt it in Australia, like before the final.   I mean, she felt it but it didn't stop her from playing. 
But she said, I mean, it had to be fine.   But she practiced this morning, like she was trying to warm up.   She felt so much worst.   She felt worst when she woke up this morning.   She tried to warm up and she said she wouldn't be able.

Q.   Do you have any idea whether she's hoping or planning to play tomorrow or do you think she's pretty much made a decision on that? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, we didn't make that decision yet because she had like treatment the whole day today.   She was trying with her physio to do the best they can.   So we'll see tomorrow morning. 

Q.   Neither your players nor the American players had the sense that Vika might not play today until the announcement was made.   Even your own players were surprised.   How surprised were you?   She said she was feeling poorly the last few days, but I know she practiced the last couple days and today.   Was it a sudden thing?   Can you tell us more about this injury? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, it's not a sudden thing.   I mean, injury is always very unfortunate thing.   She told me that she has this problem.

Q.   When did she tell you? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   She told me when she arrived.   But it didn't sound so serious.   So everybody hoped that she will play.   But you know how it goes with the injuries.   It was a long flight from Australia.   She tried to practice here.   The surface here is kind of tough on your body.   She felt worst after practicing here, so... 

Q.   Was there any thought you would tell Yakimova she might be playing?   She said she didn't have any idea until today. 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, I told her yesterday that there might be a chance.   But obviously I couldn't tell her until today morning when Vika tried to warm up and she was sure that she couldn't. 
So, yes, it was a little bit surprise for Yakimova. 

Q.   Olga, you started very well today against Serena in the first set.   Was it just a matter of getting some nerves out of the way?   What helped you play so well to get to 5‑All in the first? 
OLGA GOVORTSOVA:   Well, I had a couple days.   I got here on Tuesday night.   I had a couple days to prepare.   I think I did a good job in the first set. 
Second set I lost a little bit focus in the beginning.   It's tough with a players like that.   If you down like 2‑0, 3‑0, it's tough to get back to the game.   But I think the first set I had a couple chances on her serve and then when she started winning the second set, I guess for me was tough to get back. 

Q.   You were wearing blue today, which didn't seem like a Belarus color.   How did you pick that? 
OLGA GOVORTSOVA:   Well, I have a Peak contract.   That's my sponsor.   So we put Belarus on the back of my shirt. 

Q.   You have to wear something adidas?
OLGA GOVORTSOVA:   No, Peak, it's Chinese company.

Q.   How is this different than other surfaces the team has worked on?
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   You know, all the surfaces, they different around the world.   This one, I find it really ‑ I don't know the word ‑ but it's tough on your body.   Your body is getting sore really fast from the surface. 

Q.   Was that a factor in the problems in getting the serves out of the way?   It seemed like your players had problems with their serves during the matches. 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   No, I don't think the surface is the problem.   I think it's more the lights and the surroundings. 

Q.   What adjustments do you make to get the team ready for Sunday? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, good question.   I'll see this evening. 

Q.   Can you both talk about what it's like now to have the No.1 ranked player in the world?
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, it's really great.   I mean, it happened first time in the history of our country.   I mean, people really like kind of celebrated when Vika won the Australian Open and became No.1.   Everybody just talked about it.   It was on TV, newspapers.   Everywhere people were talking, strangers talking, Did you see the match, she's No.1 now. 
I think it's a huge impact on the whole country, and especially tennis.   Hopefully we going to have a lot of young kids coming, more junior players.   It's going to hopefully stimulate the whole tennis growth. 

Q.   What does it mean for you to raise the profile of Belarus?
OLGA GOVORTSOVA:   I think everybody have a different career.   Of course, it's great for Belarus we have the No.1 player.   But I think everybody has their own lives, their own career.   They have to work. 
It's great that she's No.1, but I think for like me, you have to keep working to be also like top 10, and other girls also. 

Q.   Tatiana, we see Vika as the legitimate No.1 because she won the Australian Open.   Many people think that's how you judge.   She has a lot of points coming up.   How do you think she's going to deal with that, keeping the No.1? 
CAPTAIN POUTCHEK:   Well, I think she has a game to be No.1.   She is No.1 now.   So, of course, it's really tough to maintain as No.1.   But she has everything to be there and to still be there by the end of the year.
