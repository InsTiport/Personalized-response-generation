K. KHACHANOV/G. Barrere   
6-3, 7-6, 0-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Can you just comment about after the first set, did you feel tired at the time?  You just to lose your concentration?  Can you comment on that?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, I mean, you know, first of all, best of five sets, sometimes it happens.  You have to accept that it can be up and down.   
You know, the best scenario is if you win in three sets.  But, you know, that's why Grand Slams, they are always make it special, you know, that the matches become long.   
But for me it was kind of momentum that I lost, I would say.  At the beginning of the third set, I had the break point in the first game.  You know, he hit the line, and then after it changed quickly.  Plus, I think I blocked it with my back.   
So, you know, suddenly I went down 3-0, you know, or 4-0, and then you are, like, thinking you are losing the set.   
So I would say it's concentration.  I lost a little bit concentration after tough second set, plus I would say I was thinking more about the back for a while.   
 Q.  We don't know who will be your opponent, but it looks like Martin Klizan.  He's leading in the match.  Can you tell me more about him?  How well do you know him?  I know you practiced with him in Roland Garros.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, okay, but, you know, again, he didn't win the match yet and tomorrow is another day, you know, another chance for Lucas to come back.   
So I don't want to say 100% that I will play against Klizan, you know, but okay.  We need to see.  And I never play against him.  I practiced I think first time ever here in Roland Garros.   
We know each other pretty much.  I was following some matches of him.  He's a little bit maybe, how to say, sometimes hitting, you know, unpredictable shots, let's say like this.  But overall is I think good player on clay.  He won couple of tournaments, I would say.   
And, yeah, first of all, I want to see who wins this match, and then I can comment more on my opponent.
