THE MODERATOR: First question, please.
Q. Could you just tell me how you felt in the first set where Taylor didn't give you any rhythm or anything, really. Just talk about the first set.
KAREN KHACHANOV: Exactly like this. I mean, he started like on the 10th speed, you know. In the car you have only six, but he started with 10. And he was hitting everything like full power and he didn't give me any rhythm. He made all the shots in my serve in the first games. And then it was just break, one break, and then I think at the end of the first set I already had him, I had a break point. If I would break maybe him on this score maybe I would turn it even around earlier, but it was all about this to keep fighting and waiting for your chances, so that's what I did.
Q. What did Marat say or others say courtside or you figure out yourself from the second set onwards?
KAREN KHACHANOV: I think that I did, I played good since the beginning, he just played more aggressive, more faster, just to the sides, didn't miss. So I think I did those, so I stepped in a little bit more. Started to play with more trajectory to push him a little bit back from the baseline, and in general I think pumped myself up to play, to increase even higher level. I'm really proud of that.
Q. Did you ever feel comfortable in the match even when you sort of got that 3-love lead in the third set?
KAREN KHACHANOV: You never feel comfortable when you're losing, but, yeah, you know sometimes you need to see the reality maybe to give credit to the guy, that he plays just a little bit better than you and your chances will come probably in a few games, but sometimes maybe it could be another way. But the reality shows that I did it in two matches in a row, that I played good and I just waited for my chances to turn around the match.
Q. So you've come back in two sort of singles matches so far. Would you like a slightly more straightforward game next in two days time?
KAREN KHACHANOV: You mean, to do what?
Q. You came back the other day.
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah.
Q. And then you've come back again here. Would you like a more straightforward game?
KAREN KHACHANOV: I wish, I wish, but let's see what happens next. Yeah, I think that I am warming up good. I'm warmed up well and it's just sometimes a question of the most breaks suddenly happen or at the beginning of the match or at the end of the set. So I will try to focus to try to not lose the first game.
Q. You hit 12 aces, so $1,200 towards the bush fire victims. How important is it that tennis players do pledge their support for this?
KAREN KHACHANOV: I think that's the greatest idea that came into tennis, to support this cause, because, yeah, unfortunately this is happening in Australia and, yeah, I just wish to serve as many aces as possible to give more money from my side.
