K. KHACHANOV/J. Del Potro
7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What would you say were the key points that helped you win today?
KAREN KHACHANOV: I would say obviously serve.  I mean, I think it's in his game, as well.  You know, serve/return, that's where you start the point and where you can take advantage of it.
In the third set, I lose two times my serve.  Basically that's it.
But I think in the third set he started to play much better.  He started to go more for the shots, the first one to step in.  I was going a little bit more back.  That's, I think, the main points.
Q. Looking ahead to the match with Thiem, how do you see that one playing out, especially in light of Paris last November?  You love Paris.
KAREN KHACHANOV: It looks like.  Yeah, I mean, right now honestly I'm still not thinking about.  I rather to take some rest.  But is, you know, last eight players, for sure.
I will try to do my best against him.  He's, you know, here he did three years in a row not less than semifinals.  So for sure he's, you know, one of the top ones on clay.
But I will try to fight and let's see.  Let's see what happens.
Q. What was going through your mind when you fell to your knees at the very last moment?  Seemed like a very big moment for you.
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, okay, that's what I'm working for, to live moments like this.
So, you know, when you win matches like this, you're just happy.  You know, you're just happy for all the efforts that you have done before, for all the matches that you played.  And, yeah, you're just thankful for a team and family, so thinking about that.
Q. I hope it's okay to ask you, I think your wife is expecting a baby?
KAREN KHACHANOV: Not only my wife.  Myself, as well (smiling).
Q. The two of you together.
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah (smiling).
Q. Is it very soon?  Is she finding it very stressful, the two things together, the excitement of this?
KAREN KHACHANOV: Not really stressful.  You can ask her.  But most likely Paris will be the last tournament and then she cannot travel.  And we're expecting hopefully in September.
