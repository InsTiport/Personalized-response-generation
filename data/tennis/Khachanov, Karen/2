 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you talk me through your match today and how you were feeling on the court?
 KAREN KHACHANOV:   Yeah, you know, never easy, never easy matches.  First rounds, playing an Australian guy.  I never heard of him, but you heard from other guys that he has a big serve, big forehand, going for the shots.  So it's never easy to play guys like this, especially when they feel like they have nothing to lose.  But on the other side they are really pumped and motivated to play.
 So I would say it was a difficult match, I'm happy that I could go through and I really enjoy now playing tennis from the beginning of the year.  I'm happy to compete again and I feel fresh, I feel physically ready, so just it was not an easy match but I'm happy with the win.
