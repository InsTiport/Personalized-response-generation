K. KHACHANOV/M. Klizan   
6-1, 6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  So how do you see today's match?  What was deciding?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I mean, I think from my side was solid match.  I think he was a little bit tired after two five-setters, so I felt it from the beginning.  And I think that's what was the main key for me, you know, to try to move him, to not give him some easy shots, because he's dangerous guy.  He's going for his shots.  He's very unpredictable.   
And I think I did well from the beginning.  In the second set, I had a little bit ups and downs at the beginning of the set.  And I think the second set was most likely the deciding, mentally, for him and for me.   
 Q.  What was the atmosphere like in the court?  For a stadium, it's a small court with the fans so close.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, it's very nice court.  It's always packed, you know, and you feel this atmosphere.   
I said many times, I like to play in France.  I like the public here.  People support me well.  And, yeah, I hope for next match it will be even better and bigger court.   
 Q.  I notice you work with Gaetan Olivier.  I just wanted to know, when did you start and why did you choose him, and does that mean that you're using Chinese medicine right now?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I can see that you know him pretty well, no?   
I mean, yeah, we started from Madrid tournament.  I was looking for a physio, and he -- like you said, he's acupuncturist as well.  So he worked before with GaÃ«l.  We have the same agency, so I think he recommend me when I spoke with them looking for a physio.   
And I'm really happy with his work.  And we started to work together since Madrid.   
 Q.  You had some back problems.  Is it okay now?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, it's better.  I mean, it happened during the match, like, a spasm, you know.  And I didn't tight -- you know, didn't stretch the muscle, so I didn't block it.  So basically, thank you for asking, it's much better.
