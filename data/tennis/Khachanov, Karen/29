6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  What is your feeling about your first final in Masters 1000?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I mean, of course it's a good feeling.  But how can I feel?  I was in semis this year.  And of course last tournament of the year especially.  I mean, I'm really happy to achieve this, to make it to the finals.  But the tournament is not over.  I mean, I'm looking forward to play finals tomorrow.  For sure would be nice match against any of the legends.   
And but in general of course I'm happy.   
 Q.  You had a little tough time serving out for the first set breakpoint against you.  Once you got that, did you feel a lot more confident?  Did it give you a good feeling?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yeah, of course.  I mean, when you win first set it gives you extra advantage, I think.  And this moment -- actually he played some balls really well and maybe I made some mistakes but the match was very intense.  And when I broke him also on 4-All I played a good game so maybe lost a little bit of concentration at some points on my serve.   
But as I said, when you take the first set it gives you extra advantage.  And the first games I was really pumped in the second set after taking -- after closing the first set.   
 Q.  I was reading the statistics before you came into this tournament.  You didn't have a very good record against top 10 players and suddenly it's three in a row.  Is it a question of, I'll beat one, I'll just beating them all?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yes.  I said already a few times in the previous interviews that I had some really tough and close matches against top guys and I was really believing that it has to turn around at one point.   
So that's basically what happened.  And if you keep maintaining the level what you play, I think that's the main reason why these matches actually I won.   
So like I said before, I was waiting for this moment again to try to go and compete against top guys, and this time I won.   
 Q.  Do you think you are playing this week your best tennis ever?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Okay.  I mean, still I won in other tournaments.  And I would say I'm happy to play on this level, especially last tournament of the year.  You know, like, still being able to be fresh mentally, to be fresh physically, and to play that level, yes.   
But in general, of course, it's one of the biggest I think achievements right now to make finals in the Masters 1000.  And I'm just happy that match by match I'm just increasing the level of the game.   
 Q.  There's a lot of glitz and noise and sound.  Do you like that kind of atmosphere and the intensity of the crowd as well?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yes.  Yes.  I said already many times that I like to play on big courts when it's full of people and especially when they cheer for you.   
 Q.  And you win presumably.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Yes.   
 Q.  Before you another Russian has won here, Marat Safin.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: One Russian?  Oh, the last Russian.   
 Q.  Yes, the last Russian, Marat Safin.  And you are the next Marat, no?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I would have to ask you.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Okay.  I agree.   
 Q.  It's possible.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Possible.  Okay.  I still need to work more to be where he was.  I mean, he was No. 1 in the world.  Still I'm not No. 1.  There's still long way to achieve what he did.  But hopefully it will be.  I mean, I never mind to do that.   
 Q.  How is it possible for you tomorrow to beat a legend in the final of the Masters 1000?  Give us the recipe, please.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: First of all, I would like against who I will play.  So...   
 Q.  Legend.  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Legend.  But two different players, right?   
So first of all, I would like to see who wins this match and then we speak with the coach and with the team how to approach this match.  I cannot tell you because it's two different players.   
 Q.  But are you convinced you can do it?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Okay.  Convinced.  When two guys in the final, I think both of them believe that they can win; right?  So I believe that I can win but I need to bring my best tennis and let's see against who I will play first.  But of course I would like to win.   
 Q.  On this whole legends thing and youngsters, how inspiring are these kind of characters?  You grow up watching them play and then to be in the final against one of them.  It doesn't matter whether it's Federer or Djokovic.  Obviously this is the kind of thing you dream of.  But now the reality is here.  How do you face it?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I mean, what is good thing is that, you know, I'm still playing with them, like you said.  You know, it's not like they've finished their careers and then you come to the top of ranking.   
So still, I'm happy to play against them in the highest stages.  You know, like in the finals especially.  And to face -- I mean, I played this year against many top guys and I think that's a good thing.  That gives me more experience to play against them on the higher stages of Grand Slams, of big tournaments like Masters 1000.   
So I think it's just a matter of being prepared and to go for it and to try to get the win.  It's the same, like, actually when they play against each other.  You know, they know each other well and then the better player wins in this situation.   
 Q.  What have you seen about the way they operate that can help you for your future?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: To operate what?   
 Q.  The way they prepare, the way they just go about their day, the way they tackle the tournament, the way they come to a tournament.  Is there anything that you have seen about them in your young career?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Okay, now maybe how to say?  When you are younger and when you are lower, you see more things.  But when you are becoming closer to them maybe they don't show as many things as before because you are becoming a tough and dangerous opponent for them.   
 Q.  What did you see when you were younger then?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: Man, I cannot open their secrets.  I'm sorry.   
 Q.  About Marat Safin again, was he an idol for you or an example to follow?  
KAREN KHACHANOV: I said many times, yes, he was my favorite tennis player.
