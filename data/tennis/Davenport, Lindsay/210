MODERATOR:  Questions for Lindsay. 


Q.  When you look around the room here, this is just the way you like it?  (Not much press.) 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Doesn't bother me.

Q.  In a few minutes when Anna comes in, it's jammed. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Is that a question? 

Q.  (Inaudible). 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Doesn't matter what people write about.  It matters who is playing well, who gets through.  So far I'm still in there. 

Q.  Why do you think that is, you move quietly along?  There's been so much attention on the Williams sisters, Kournikova.  Why do you think you've just been moving along?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I don't know.  You tell me. 

Q.  Obviously, it doesn't bother you. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No.  I mean, pretty happy with going out there and playing tennis.  That's why I'm here.  Prefer not to be written about. 

Q.  Do you feel you're just really on top of your game right now?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No.  I feel like I've gotten better.  I feel like the quick courts here help my game a lot.  It's hard to really handle a lot of pace of these courts.  I felt like I've been serving pretty well, getting more back on top of my groundstrokes, getting through I think Kim Clijsters was a tough match.  Getting through that gave me a lot of confidence.  Now I think it gets really tough from here on out.  Next opponent's very good.  I've had really two close matches with her.  Must be playing well.  I didn't see a point of today's match.  It's going to be another tough match. 

Q.  Doesn't bother you not to play in the stadium?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No.  I mean, normally through a Grand Slam, you might play one match on the other Stadium Court sometimes.  I mean, there were some good matches on Center Court today.  Pierce and Raymond, Kournikova and Henin.  Four very good opponents.  That kind of stuff doesn't bother me.

Q.  How are you feeling? 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Physically, I feel really good.  No injuries.  I had the foot injury that was bothering me before The Open.  It's healed pretty well.  I've been able to go a hundred percent on it.  It's important, I've been able to practice pretty hard here, get my game back.  Hopefully it will be getting better.

Q.  Are you still driving?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Yes.

Q.  Are you going to be driving next week?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I don't know.  They said most of the roads are going to be closed.  I'm not actually sure what days those are yet.

Q.  Starts tomorrow. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Have to listen to the news then, figure out the traffic. 

Q.  Would you take the train?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Would I? 

Q.  Yes. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No.  I like driving.

Q.  Something wrong with the No.  7 train in Flushing?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No.  My family has been taking it out here.  They like it.  If I have a car, I'd rather drive myself.
