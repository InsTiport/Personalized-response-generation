THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Lindsay. 


Q.  We're doing like the Top 30 moments.  Can you talk about your title here in '97, then your title in 2000. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Yeah.  '97 was a breakthrough because after Atlanta, that was really the first big title that I won on tour.  Took a lot of pride in that after first turning pro here at this tournament.  I remember I played a bit of a surprise finalist in Spirlea in the finals.  I think I had a tough match with Venus that year.  It was exciting to be able to win kind of in the tournament I loved to play in the most.  2000 was probably a bit more exciting.  I kind of had the a good roll going after winning the Australian Open, playing Martina in the finals.  I was down a set and a break and came back to win that.  I remember getting really a great buzz after winning that title, and that meant a lot to me.  It's very exciting. 

Q.  Kind of nice you won the first title here in the new building. 

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  That was the first year, wasn't it?  I didn't realize that.  But, yeah.  I was so excited with that win.  It definitely was a tough tournament for me.  Had won a lot of matches in a row up to that point.  Even in the finals, it was a battle.  I was able to mentally overcome a deficit and then really cruise in the third. 

Q.  I know you played in front of a lot of big crowds, but what was it like to play in front of a big crowd in Southern California?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  It was fun.  I know so many people that come here, box-seat holders, a lot of friends from Laguna come.  I feel like it's a really comfortable place for me to play.
