Q.  How well do you think you were playing today?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I thought today I played very well.  I probably played some of my not greatest tennis the last couple of weeks.  I haven't played very well.  And I was so nervous coming in here, because I wanted to play well here, and you never know how you're going to play, after you've been playing pretty bad for a while.  So I was very nervous.  But I think that made me a little more concentrated and I wanted to win this match very badly. 
 

Q.  Why do you think you were playing bad?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I don't know, I think the last couple of weeks it's just been a long year.  And I've been indoors forever now, and I normally like to play outdoors, I'm from California.  And I think it's been a long year and I've played more tournaments this year than I ever have.  Hopefully that's it.  But I played well tonight and I'm hoping to keep it going for one more week.  
 

Q.  Lindsay, what runs through your mind when you stand there and see something like that with Gaby and you're at this phase in your career?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Yeah, it was really sad.  I know a lot of players broke out in tears, I was on the edge of it, for sure.  But it's so sad to see because she's still so young and she played so well.  But the other thing is you can tell how happy she is.  So everyone is only happy for her.  But it's very sentimental. 
 

Q.  Does it make you think about this point in your career?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Oh, no, I didn't think about that.  I was thinking of some other players on the tour that might do that soon but not myself. 
 

Q.  Did it make you think about what you want to do before you get there?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  No, it didn't. 
 

Q.  Did you have mixed feelings because of some of your results with Gaby?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Mixed feelings about -- 
 

Q.  Her leaving?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I don't want her to leave. 
 

Q.  You made a comment on TV?
 
LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Yeah, I said I'm happy competitively, because I had a lot of trouble towards the end  of my career beating her, but that was just a joke.  But very difficult for me to play against.  I'm not going to talk about her anymore (laughter.)
