VERONIQUE MARCHAL:  Questions for Lindsay.
  

Q.  I heard you muttering to yourself about your serve, you'd been practicing it yesterday.

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I just felt like I served terrible.  I didn't feel like I served well at all here.  I probably didn't practice it enough or get it down.  It's tough conditions here.  It hasn't been that windy, but it's a little windier than it has been in the last couple weeks. I think that definitely hurt me today, my serve.
  

Q.  And she served very well?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  She served unbelievable, I thought.  I played her many times.  That's the best she ever served against me.  I didn't hit -- I didn't get many second serves.  I think that was a real big key today.
  

Q.  What is the status of your personal relationship with Mary Joe at this moment?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Sounds like we were an item  (laughter).  I think we're not as close as we used to be.  I think we're talking now a little bit.  We're trying to work everything out.  It's going to take some time.  Who knows what happens.  I don't think we know.
  

Q.  No hug at the net, though, after the match today as there's been in the past.

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Exactly.  We played last week, too.  It was fine, we played, no hug there either.
  

Q.  Why did you switch doubles partners?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Well, there was actually a couple reasons.  I wasn't sure if Mary Joe was going to play this year or how committed her schedule was going to be.  We were a great team.  We won a lot of tournaments together.  I just wasn't sure exactly what her plans were.  So I moved on.
  

Q.  Is it maybe a communication problem?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  It was a little bit.  The signs I was getting were she was quitting, only going to play a couple tournaments this year.  She changed her mind, I think.  I didn't really know that.  I had already agreed to play with someone else.  It was kind of bad times all the way around.
  

Q.  Is that kind of at the heart of the matter there?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I think so.  There's some other  things, but that was definitely the straw I guess that broke the camel's back, however that saying goes.
  

Q.  So is it difficult to play her at this point?  You always said that before when you were best friends.

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  It's not as difficult now.  I played her last week, played very well.  She played me here and played very well.  Maybe because both times we were playing in our hometowns.  She played very, very well today.  I was very impressed.
  

Q.  You didn't talk at all after the match?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  I haven't seen her yet.  I actually just went back to my hotel and showered and came back.  I haven't actually seen her.
  

Q.  But you guys are talking at this point?

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Yes.  We don't say, "I hate you," we're trying to become friends again.

LINDSAY DAVENPORT:  Thank you.
