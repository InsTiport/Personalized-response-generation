MODERATOR:  Ms. Serna, who has beaten Ms. Pierce 7-6, 7-6. 
 
 
Q. Was this as big a win as you've had?
 
MAGUI SERNA:  Well, I beat her already once at the French Open, but she wasn't No.  3 of the world.  I beat Novotna when she was No.  3.  It's like close my best win ever. 
 
Q. Did you watch the French Open final?
 
MAGUI SERNA:  Yes.  I was in Birmingham playing my tournament on grass.  I saw the final there. 
 
Q. How much different did you think she played today than what you saw against Conchita?
 
MAGUI SERNA:  It's completely different.  Here is grass court, over there is clay court.  I think she prefer to play on clay court than on grass.  She doesn't like to play so much on grass.  I knew she was going to be like with a lot of confidence.  When she play against Conchi, she hits very hard.  On clay you can hit hard.  Here if you play with slice and come into the net, it's not that easy to move here on grass.  She doesn't have that much time to prepare grass like I do.  I played Birmingham, then I went to Eastbourne, then I came here.  She just played the French Open. 
 
Q. Seemed like she had a hard time finding her rhythm. 
 
MAGUI SERNA:  It's very difficult to get rhythm here on grass court.  Points, they don't last that long as clay court, as on hard court.  Just have serve.  If you serve well, it's difficult to play a point.  That's why, I don't know, she wasn't getting the rhythm.
