THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  You have had some great success together.  How do you do it? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  We don't know (laughter).  No, I mean, I think we are -- we have really good feeling between us, you know.  Like our coordination, it's really good, you know.  We know each other from a long time.  On the court, that's helped a lot for us. 

Q.  It must be very good this year for you, seeing as last year you were beaten by the Williams sisters.  Is this special for you being here? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Yeah, of course, we won the tournament this year.  Last year we lost the final.  So is more special.  But I think what is special is we're still playing together.  That's for us the special thing.

Q.  How long do you think you will continue to play together? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Until the end. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  I don't know when, but until then. 

Q.  What is your goal for the year now? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  We are looking to try to be both No. 1 together, end of the year, not No. 1 and No. 2.  I mean, the team, and individual, try to be No. 1.  That's why we not going to play any tournaments separate.  Yeah, this is the goal that we want to look for. 

Q.  Are you sorry that the Williams sisters and Kim Clijsters and Sugiyama were not here so you could play them, too? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  What? 

Q.  Do you wish that the Williams sisters, Sugiyama and Clijsters were playing? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  I think we would like it if they play, no?  I think it's better for the public, better for us, better for the circuit, no?  But if they decide don't play, we can't do anything.
