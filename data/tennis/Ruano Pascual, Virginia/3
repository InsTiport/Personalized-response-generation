THE MODERATOR:  Questions for our doubles champions. 


Q.  The second title of the year, is that correct? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yes. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Uh-huh. 

Q.  You obviously know their game. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yes. 

Q.  Because you played them in Australia and beat them there, right? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

Q.  Anything different today? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Uhm, no.  I think the game was the same, like in Australia, yeah.  Was less nervous.  In Australia was more tough because we felt nervous.  But today was fine. 

Q.  Was that because it was the Australian, or was it because it was the first time? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Both, no? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, both. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  For the Australian, it was the final.  Was the first time we play against Likhovtseva and Kuznetsova.  We didn't know how they going to play.  So now today we know how to play against. 

Q.  Virginia, Paola was telling us earlier this week that you were always going to play the same tournaments together, with the goal that you would both finish No. 1.  She had to miss a couple of tournaments recently, right, because of an injury? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Yes. 

Q.  Were you ever tempted to break the promise? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Yes, I didn't play, so (laughter). 

Q.  But you didn't play? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Yes. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  She was waiting for me. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  I get holidays at home. 

Q.  Were you both in the finals here a couple of years ago together? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yes. 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  Uh-huh. 

Q.  How does this rate in comparison to that one, finishing as runner-up? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  I think was three years ago.  Was one of the -- was first final, no, in a grand event.  So today after three years, we have more experience, and we think we are playing high level than three years ago.  So the experience is important, no, when we play the final. 

Q.  You're the No. 1 team in the world.  What is the secret to your success? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  It's a secret (smiling). 

Q.  Would it be teamwork?  It seems that you cover each other very, very well on the court. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, I think we know each other really very well on the court, you know, and, I mean, we can -- I mean, I don't know.  I think our goal, it's the return, you know, and how we move on the court.  Like, yeah, I think this is -- it's how we know each other, you know.  We play for eight years.  And that's so important. 

Q.  Eight years? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yes.  And past experience that we have now for all the years that we play and for the last events that we play, and we won, we have experience.  We believe more ourself, you know, than like three or four years ago. 

Q.  And you're good friends, too, right? 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  Yeah, and we are friends.

Q.  Do you have an argument on the court or fight? 

VIRGINIA RUANO PASCUAL:  No. 

PAOLA SUAREZ:  No, no.  We are always laughing.  We enjoy to play together.  We have fun, yeah.
