L. KUBOT/J. Struff
  7/6, 7/6, 6/4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   I just have two English questions:   Your match today, just tell us how you felt and how it went. 
LUKASZ KUBOT:   To be honest, I'm very satisfied with the game I played today.   I didn't get broken with my serve, so I think I served very well today.
That was the key to win the match.   I think the first set was not the highest level.   We didn't have many opportunities to break each other.   So we were serving well.
And then second and third set was just one break, so I'm happy I made it.   I think it's very good start for me at this tournament.

Q.   Last year you made the quarterfinals, if I'm correct.   Tell me what it's like to try to defend those points especially. 
LUKASZ KUBOT:   Well, to be honest, it's first situation, firstâ€‘time situation like this for me.   I'm not trying to defend the points.
I'm trying to go out there and trying to play my game.   As I said, I'm focusing match by match.   I'm happy to end this first round and looking forward for another match.
That's it.

Q.   So you just keep that out of your head?
LUKASZ KUBOT:   Exactly.   I'm trying to do that.
