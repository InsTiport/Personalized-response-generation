Q.  Were you disappointed? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  No, I think is good match, and Andy playing really good today.  He's really confidence and really focus on his game.  I was trying hard, you know, try to come back.  I won the second set, but he just too good today. 
 
Q.  The final set, it just seemed to ebb away for you.
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, you know, it's like he keep hit the ball really, really good.  He's moving well, and he's serving well, you know.  He just need one break from his opponent so...  And then he's make his game easy. 
 
Q.  Do you think he can go on and win it all?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I would think so.  You know, quarterfinal now, so I think he's a good one to pick.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about what you've learned this year from Wimbledon, and what you'll take away.
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, last 16, my first time on a Grand Slam, and I did third round last year here so I do it better here.  Then I have a good season on hard court in the US, which is I'm looking for it to go on and play on hard court.  Hopefully, for the good season. 
 
Q.  You've had two hard matches as well  - today, and also Nadal as well.  Can you talk about the reaction back home, because it's difficult for us to gauge how big you are back in Thailand. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, for the first three matches, you know, it's all live to Thailand.  There's a free channel to show it live, so a lot of people watching it.  I mean, most of the people watching the game and really following what I'm doing.  They excited that I'm doing well and keep winning, winning, winning.  You know, finally reaching last 16, playing Andy Roddick, which is, I mean, tough match.  And, you know, I think they all watch live today.  
 
Q.  When are you going back home?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Actually, I'm gonna take off tomorrow, as soon as I can. 
 
Q.  Do you think there will be a huge reception?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I would think so, yeah  - like every time I go home (smiling). 
 
Q.  Presumably, you get recognized a lot when you're at home?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Is it nice then when you come to London? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  You know, if I'm going home, well, of course a lot of people recognize me.  But if I'm staying outside of Thailand, I have more time to do, you know, the thing on my own like my private, you know. 
 
Q.  What did you do over the weekend?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I went to do some shopping on Saturday afternoon and, you know, just practicing on Sunday and then just take it easy, just get ready for the match today. 
 
Q.  Are you going to get your mum a present?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I don't know.  
 
Q.  I read in one of the interviews that you said you wanted to get your mum a present.
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, yeah, I always buy her something after I get home.  This trip is really long for me.  I didn't go home for the last three months, I think.  
 
Q.  Are you going to take a break?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I'm gonna take a break for two weeks and then go to US.
