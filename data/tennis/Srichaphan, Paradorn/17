PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  He been doing well, except for the last couple tournaments he not doing really well.  He been playing well for the whole two years.  You know, nobody can just hold that up all the time.  But he still tough out there, especially in this Grand Slam.  You know, his mind is really into it.

You know, he's always tough. 
 
Q.  After the Roddick match, Ljubicic came in and had some critical remarks to make about Andy, particularly the way he comports himself on the court.  You've had matches with Andy.  He said an awful lot of players don't like Andy personally because of that.  There's a lot of talk about Andy in the locker room.  Do you agree with that?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I would say Andy and me is really good friends.  You know, I'm friendly with Ivan Ljubicic.  I'm friendly with everybody on tour.  Everybody to me, they great to me.  Well, in this case I would say is my good friends.  He's all right.  You know, everybody, most of the people, like him.

PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Actually, most of the time dish is really spicy.  I mean, is not really spicy, but is kick when you take it.  Most restaurant, they try to cook it smooth for foreigner.  If they see Thai people, "All right, here we go."

PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I'm really, really happy that I'm doing well.  You know, my representing, I'm Asian, I'm from Thailand.  I hope is going to be more and more younger junior player coming up.  When I was a kid, I'm looking up to Michael Chang, which, you know, he's Asian.  That's why I'm really thinking that I can do this. 
 
Q.  Do you feel pressure to succeed to do that?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  No.  Every match, I just walk on court, if I going to win, if I going to loss, it just the game.  I try to go out there and having fun, you know, try to perform. 
 
Q.  What would a Grand Slam for you mean to Asia?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Is huge, I mean, Grand Slam.  Especially this one.  I mean, because is hard court, which is my best surface.  I grow up on hard court at home.  Is the last Grand Slam of the year.  You know, the conditioning is heat, just like home.  I enjoy play tournaments in the US.  
 
Q.  On the court you are very calm and positive compared to other players.  Do you think that has something to do with the Asian mentality?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  No.  I mean, my personality on court is, you know, look calm down, not really see I'm get mad or getting angry.  I could control myself easier if I just go out there and enjoy the match, you know, keep it calm.
