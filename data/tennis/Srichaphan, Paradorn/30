THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Right Shoulder Disease is catching.  Have you got ice on your shoulder?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I put some ice on my shoulder because I've been playing a lot of matches so it's getting a little bit tight.  But it's gonna be okay.  
 
Q.  What's it like out there?  You've had 48 hours on the ground, and you've already played two matches. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Just trying to enjoy my match, just trying to have fun.  Like today, I lost the first set, was down a break.  Just try to hang in the match, just try to holding my serve, having good time.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about playing Ferrero in your next match, your quarterfinal against Juan Carlos. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I played him last time in Paris, and I won I think 6-3, 6-2. 
 
Q.  Would you say he had a very similar game to you?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I mean, his game is from the baseliner, and he's a great player.  In this weather it's gonna be tough.  It's windy.  I hope to play a good match against him tomorrow.  It's gonna be good match.  
 
Q.  These conditions, do they have a negative impact on your preparation for a Grand Slam?  Could all these matches you're playing in the lead-up to the Grand Slam in these sort of conditions have a negative impact on your preparation for a major?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Not at all.  You have to get used to the weather, get used to our conditioning of the different tournaments.  
 
Q.  It would appear that you actually thrive on playing as many matches as possible.  Is that a fair comment? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  My body feels okay, you know, even I play a lot of matches because, you know, I've been working hard off the court.  I don't mind to play many matches.  I don't mind to play a lot of matches.  Thank you.
