THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  That was quite a high-quality match.  Did you feel that, I mean it was mostly winners from you and Todd?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I mean, Todd, he's a great player.  He had a lot of experience.  So, you know, it's always tough to play him because I play him already two times and I lost to him.  This time, you know, he almost got me again.  But it's really tight match and it's pretty good match, I think.  
 
Q.  Up until 4-3 in the second set, did you feel that you were in control of the match? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  In the second set?  
 
Q.  Yeah. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah.  I mean, after I broke him the first game, second set, I know that if I keeping my serve, holding my serve, it could be finish by two sets.  But, you know, it's always tough because he trying to come back, too.  Like I said, he have a lot of experience.  So he, you know, he won the tiebreaker.  I was up 4-2.  Then he come back and won it.  Again, in the third set, is look like he gonna won the match.  But, you never know what can happen.  So I just try to hang in there and then, you know, just having deuce that game, then he make double-faults.  So kind of... 
 
Q.  Does that make the match more exciting, because it kept going for you? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, yeah, I think it's very exciting match because, you know, is look like I gonna won in two sets.  Then he won the second set.  Then he broke me the first game and then he was up the break already in the third set.  So everything just turned around and I played well in the last couple game, you know.  
 
Q.  How are you feeling, generally? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, I feeling great.  I reach another semifinal in the Masters Series.  Especially here in Miami, which is a great city.  
 
Q.  You have 52 winners to only 23 unforced errors.
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  How many?  
 
Q.  52 winners to 23 unforced errors.  That's what it said on the TV. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  What is my percentage in first serve (smiling)?  
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Was better the last match.  Last match was 52.  So, well, I think I have to improve my first serve but, I mean, I still, you know... Win my service game with my second serve, which is good.  
 
Q.  Looking forward, what are your thoughts on the semifinal now? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I'm gonna play Moya, and I never play him.  He's great player.  I'm looking forward for the match.  One-day rest tomorrow and it's gonna be good match, I guess.  It's gonna be a lot of long rally and I really looking forward to play that match. 
 
Q.  In many ways, a different kind of match for you?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Oh, yeah, for sure, yeah.  We both play baseline game, see who's hitting the ball better that day.
