THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  Missing out on the Kooyong Classic, did that throw the preparation out to a fair degree?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, for sure, after Chennai, I came straight here to try to play Kooyong.  But hurting my wrist, was swelling.  I had to pull out of Kooyong and have to get ready for this tournament.  You know, was not that great preparation, you know, no hitting before the match like a week, almost a week.  Just can't hit.  Just spend a lot of time in the gym, just try to keep the body going.  I'm glad that I win the first round.  Didn't expect to finishing the match either. 
 
Q.  You had a strap on the wrist today, correct? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I always strap my wrist. 
 
Q.  Did it give you any discomfort at all?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  For sure, yeah, in the beginning.  You know, the pains go away already, feel great with the wrist.  But still have to tape it, just protect it.  But didn't feel that great.  
 
Q.  Disappointing not to get a crack at Federer?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, that's the draw that, you know, expect to play him the third round, you know.  Obviously Nieminen is a great player.  Was tough out there today.  It's great that, you know, just like I say, glad already I tough it out in the first round.  Yeah. 
 
Q.  What's the toughest thing about playing him?  He's very aggressive, isn't he?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Who's this?  
 
Q.  Nieminen. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, lefty.  So that's different.  He play well.  You know, he used to be in Top 30, so... 
 
Q.  The aims for 2005?  The ranking has dropped a bit in 2004.  Obviously looking to pump those up for this year. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, for sure.  I working pretty hard at the off-season in December, and done well the first week, reaching the final in Chennai again.  Just bad timing hurting my wrist.  Expect to do well here.  But first round here, take two weeks off, go to Europe and hopefully doing well there.  Just try to keep my body fresh and healthy.
