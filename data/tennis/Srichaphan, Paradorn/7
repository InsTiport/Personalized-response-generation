THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  High toss on the serve, was it difficult to get the timing down at all? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, that's his style, he's toss the ball high.  I play him a couple times, I mean, more than three times.  So I expecting that.  I think he serving well today, so. 
 
Q.  How do you think about this summer? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, last year I do better, but this year I do okay.  But I try to think positive, look forward to play next tournaments in Asia.  So going back home, get ready and, you know, try to do my best again.  
 
Q.  What you do you think it will really take to make a splash at a Grand Slam for you?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, firstly, good draw.  And, actually, this year US Open is not bad draw.  I mean, get to third round to play Hrbaty.  We been playing couple times.  He just playing better, he feeling better today. For me to do well at a Slam, it's always important, too.  But I think you have to more consistent in my game, to keep playing like the first round or second round.  I feel like today I didn't feel like the way I'm playing like in first round or second round. 
 
Q.  Do you think it's hard to maintain concentration over a long Grand Slam, two weeks?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I would think so, yeah.  I don't think I get through that yet.  When I getting to third round, I feel like, you know, it's take almost a week already.  If I win today, is already one week.  Is sometimes hard to focus.  But that's what I have to work on. 
 
Q.  What do you think about future of Asian tennis? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, I been asking a lot this question.  Yeah, it's always important for Asian tennis.  I would love to see more tournaments in Asia, maybe a couple more.  So there would be give the opportunity to the younger or young kid in Asia.  
 
Q.  Do you have any superstitions or quirks on the court that you do for luck or anything? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Not really.  I, you know, well, some time I, you know, I wearing the red shirt which is, you know, if I could.  But I didn't put it on.  
 
Q.  What kind of car do you drive?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Chevrolet.  They sponsor me. 
 
Q.  Do you have any favorite junk foods or snack foods or anything?
