THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  What happened today? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  About what?  
 
Q.  Your injury. 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Okay (smiling).  I hurting my quad, left quad, since last week in Chennai in quarterfinal.  That's why I have to pull out in doubles.  Then coming here, you know, I keep playing, but is not -- it wasn't that bad in the first round, but I still have to playing with the supporter that I have to tight it up in my legs.  So, I mean, keep playing is just gonna get worse.  And doctor said is not gonna be better if you go out there tonight and trying too hard and, you know, you maybe need longer recovery. 
 
Q.  If you weren't playing tonight, if you were playing tomorrow, would you still be in the tournament?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  You mean if I play tomorrow?  
 
Q.  Yeah, instead of tonight.  Would you still have played?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I think it is still tough.  It's kind of getting worse from last two days.  Been playing a lot of point, you know, running back and forward.  You know, when you feeling it more and more, then you gonna hurt more.  
 
Q.  So is this more really a precaution for the Australian Open?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, I think I have to listening to my body first that, you know, big one is next week, but also this tournament is also important for me.  To reaching quarterfinal and have to pull out, you know, I'm not really want to do it.  But my body is not -- my leg is not ready for it.  So if I keep playing, it's gonna getting worse, and then maybe I can't play next week.  
 
Q.  The thought of playing tonight, though, virtually ended it, didn't it? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  No, because is also two matches today for me.  Maybe if tomorrow.  I mean, who knows?  Maybe you wake up in the morning, maybe feel better, but probably not.  
 
Q.  So what do you do from now, the next few days?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I got to get a lot of treatment.  Two days off.  Maybe start hitting a little bit on Sunday, and hopefully I play Tuesday in Melbourne.  
 
Q.  Do you think you would have withdrawn if the Australian Open wasn't next week?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  If I didn't feel better, I probably would have to do it.  But, you know, three or four days off, get ready for it, it should hopefully be okay. 
 
Q.  Can you put a request in for Tuesday night at the Open?  Is that how it works?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I don't think so.  It's go by the draw, I think.  Like top half maybe Monday or Tuesday, depends how they doing it.
