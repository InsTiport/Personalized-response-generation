THE MODERATOR:  First question for Paradorn.  
 
 
Q.  Have you ever had any problems like this cramping in the past at any time that you can remember? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  The last time I had the pain was in Toronto because it's really hot, and humidity.  You know, we both trying hard, so this happen because when is getting tight and is tough match like this.  Is not really happen to me often, though. 
 
Q.  What about the performance, though?  You had to be real happy about playing Kafelnikov, a very tough opponent, and you come out and you lost the second set, a tough second set.  Then you really played well in the third.  What are your comments about that? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, you know, this is my first time I won a match against him.  I play him already two times and, you know, it's great to win this match.  I close to finish the match in the second set, but he just coming back strong.  Finally, I just try to hang in there and, you know, just try to hold my serve and break him once.  
 
Q.  When did you start cramping in the match? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  In the middle of the third set is really bad.  You know, just try to hang in there and, you know, just try to stay on the court.  I have to use the time between the point (inaudible).  So I'm glad that I can put it off. 
 
Q.  How do you feel about going into your fourth round against Rios?  What are your thoughts about playing Rios?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, he's a great player.  I play him a couple time.  I always have a tough match against him.  Hopefully, I'm looking forward to play well and have a great match.
