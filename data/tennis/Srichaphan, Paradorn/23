THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  Did you find that was a pretty tough qualifier, in three sets?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Yeah, I play him one time two years ago in Bangkok challenger.  I won same thing, 7-6 in the third.  He's a great player, he qualifying here.  I playing him here my first match on clay after French Open last year, so I'm glad that I won today.  
 
Q.  How has your clay preparation been?  What have you done?  Where have you been?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Actually, I didn't do anything much before I come here.  I played Davis Cup last week on hard court, and I go back home, I resting for three days with no practice because I need some rest after Miami.  And, actually, I didn't practice on clay before I get here.  I get here on Sunday morning, so I'm practicing two days, Sunday and Monday, and playing today.  
 
Q.  What sort of a goal have you set yourself for the clay season, looking as far forward as Roland Garros?
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  I didn't have anything to defending from now until the French Open.  I make third round last year.  I didn't do anything well last year from Monte-Carlo until everything, I mean every tournaments before French Open.  So, I mean, clay is not my favorite surface, so I'm glad I won today.  I pick up a couple point.  If I doing well for the next couple weeks, I would say I set my goal at, after Wimbledon, I would like to be in Top 10.  
 
Q.  He was saying that he got very, very nervous at 5-3 when he was serving for the match.  Did you sense that out there? 
 
PARADORN SRICHAPHAN:  Well, yeah.  After he make a couple double-faults on that game that he serving for the match, and, plus, it's really difficult to play today.  It's really windy, and the player  -- most of the player cannot play that game really.  So it's kind of difficult.
