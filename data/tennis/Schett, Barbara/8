 USTA: Questions for Barbara? 
 
Q. How are you playing?
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: I'm playing consistent at the moment. I lost this year twice in the
first round. I am playing more consistent than the years before. That's why I'm ranked, I
think. 
 
Q. Do you have some keys to getting ready for a tournament so you don't lose that
opening round match?
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: The opening match or what? That I don't lose? 
 
Q. You say you've only lost twice in the first round. A lot of players that come to a
tournament are not ready.
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: I wasn't ready at the tournaments that I lost. The first tournament I
lost in Indian Wells where I lost I was sick before and I shouldn't have even played
there. That was when I lost. And then, the last tournament in Stanford, I lost against Amy
Frazier. That was my first hardcourt tournament and I always have problems when I change
from claycourt to hardcourt. That's why I think preparation was just not good enough for
the tournament. That's why I lost. 
 
Q. Do you think Top Ten is reasonable for you this year?
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: Yes, I think. I mean, I'm 12, No. 12 ranked now. Of course that's a big
goal for me, to just break through into the Top Ten and it's just a couple of -- I mean
it's just, I think, 150 or 200 points. That depends how the others play. 
 
Q. In Europe, you're pretty well known. In America --
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: I am? (Laughing.) 
 
Q. You may be the best unknown player playing at this tournament.
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: I have to do something crazy probably so people get to know me.
(Laughing.) 
 
Q. Do you do something crazy?
 
 BARBARA SCHETT: No, I don't. 
 
Q. Thank you very much.
