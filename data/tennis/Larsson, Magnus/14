Q. Magnus, what were your thoughts after the first set? 
 
MAGNUS LARSSON:  I played him in Key Biscayne; got two games.  I was just trying to keep the ball in play the first set, make him play.  I hit a few shots.  Even though, lost the first set, I felt pretty positive the next few games with every point.  I was feeling pretty good. 
 

Q. Was that loss in Key Biscayne any more incentive for you to do something here?
 
MAGNUS LARSSON:  I lost big there.  I was not really fit that match.  I had a tough match before.  I did not really play as good as I wanted.  I knew this was a better chance to beat him, claycourts, heavy claycourts, heavy balls.  I was pretty optimistic before the match, as well.
