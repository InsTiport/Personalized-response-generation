MAGNUS LARSSON: I got off to a bad start. I was thinking too much about the breaker I lost. Just didn't play -- I just played a bad first service game. It just slipped away a little bit too easy. But he played a little bit better. I was a little bit too defensive in my game. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: I mean, I'd rather be up two to one. I still felt I had a pretty good shot to win the match. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: I started to serve a little bit better in the fourth and fifth set. I think that was the key. I just tried to stay with him. Got off to an early break in the fourth. I got my momentum back a little bit. He started to miss a few more shots. I got off to a good start in the fourth. That was really the key, I think. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: No. It was a great atmosphere out there. He had some fans. I had some fans. It was like a soccer match in the beginning of the fifth set. A really great crowd. That helps. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: Doesn't really matter if it's No. 1 or No. 10. I've beaten him before. You know, he's still Marcelo Rios, even if it's No. 1 or No. 2. He's not unbeatable. We had some good fights before. I won some, lost some. Just don't have to think about the rankings, just go out there and play. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: It was a bit gusty. It was a little bit windy down there. Every now and then there was a lot of errors. But I was hitting the ball well. In the end I also served well, which I feel I didn't do the first three sets. In the end I made some aces. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: He hits lefty, with the wrong arm. That's all. He doesn't serve that hard maybe. He has a pretty good placement on it. Usually I don't return lefties so good. Just try to put it back in the court. I don't think I returned worse than normal. It was okay. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: I haven't seen him before. I haven't played him. It will be a good experience. It's a good draw in the fourth round. Both me and Oliver are probably looking forward to that match. One of us going to go to the quarters. We're both, I think, pretty happy with that.
