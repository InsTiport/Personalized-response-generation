MAGNUS LARSSON: I played him in Key Biscayne; got two games. I was just trying to keep the ball in play the first set, make him play. I hit a few shots. Even though, lost the first set, I felt pretty positive the next few games with every point. I was feeling pretty good. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: I lost big there. I was not really fit that match. I had a tough match before. I did not really play as good as I wanted. I knew this was a better chance to beat him, claycourts, heavy claycourts, heavy balls. I was pretty optimistic before the match, as well.
