Q. I'd like to ask - this is extraneous - when Bjorkman hit that lob on that big point, did it go over the pipes? 
 
 CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: I think so.  
 
Q. You feel it did? 
 
 CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: Yes. That's not unusual for Jonas (laughter).  
 
Q. He's practiced that shot, of course. Well done. 
 
 CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: Thank you.  
 
Q. How are you going to spend your holidays? 
 
 MAGNUS LARSSON: In a week, me and Carl and my other coach Stefan, my sister and her son, we go to Austria for skiing one week, five or six days. It's going to be nice. After that, we start to prepare for next year. But we're going to have two nice weeks, not play too much tennis.  
 
Q. Can you give us an idea how you feel, the first time the United States has been beaten in a Davis Cup Final since '73, first time it's 5-Love in a final since Sweden beat India. Your thoughts, feelings, emotions? 
 
 CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: I'm proud of my team, the way they have acted the whole week, fantastic job. That it's 5-Love, I said in the beginning that it's going to be five tough matches. But 5-Love, I didn't think really of winning them all. We have the luck on our side. It was a pity for Pete, for the U.S. team, that he was injured, yeah.
