MAGNUS LARSSON: Well, the most important thing is that we won the match. Of course, it's disappointing the way it ended. I think the whole Swedish team will take it. We move onto an exciting Saturday. It would be much nicer to win a five-set match, closer match, but this is the way it is. Nothing we can do about it. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: Well, he took a timeout. After that, he really didn't move 100 percent. Didn't serve a hundred percent. It got worse. So I felt at the end of the second, if I win the second set, that I would probably win the game. But it's still hard to play. You don't know if he's going to play or not. I just try to be focused. The coach and the bench behind me, they really told me like, "Don't bother about him, just try to stay focused and go on." It was to play like normal. 

MAGNUS LARSSON: No, it was surprising. I mean, if he had injury before the match, I don't see a reason why he should go on court to play one or two tough five-setters. I don't know what happened or when it happened. 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: I think it's going to be a tough fight. But of course it looks easier when we are 2-O after Friday. 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: That's good. 

CAPTAIN HAGESKOG: No. But I feel particularly lucky (laughter). Of course, we feel comfortable here. We have great memories. It's a nice arena, with a full crowd, 11,000 people. Of course, it's nice to be here and play the final.
