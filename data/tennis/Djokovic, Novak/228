6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You tried in the second set.  It was too much, or it was Rafa playing better?  How do you analyze it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, Rafa was obviously a better player today.  He deserved to win.  I mean, he was controlling the game from beginning to the end.   
Second set was a bit closer.  Maybe I had some chances to be in the lead, 2-All.  Was a long game.  I lost the break there.   
But, you know, all in all, I did try my best.  It wasn't a very high quality of tennis from my side.  I mean, I made a lot of unforced errors, especially first set.   
Just his quality was very high.  You know, he managed to do whatever he wanted really, especially in the first set.  I was getting a lot of balls back.  He was serving well.  He was using his court positioning well.   
Today was warmer than last three, four days, so conditions were quite different.  The ball was bouncing very high.   
Well, he managed to be better in these kind of conditions.   
 Q.  Does this match give you any special thoughts on the road ahead for you on what you have to do or change?  Do you take something out of this performance still?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, first of all, it was really good to play in semifinals of big event, and to play against one of the top rivals I have in my life.  I haven't had that feeling in months, so it's great to feel that.   
It was a positive week, a positive experience.  I take, as I say, more positives than negatives into the next week in Rome.  As I go along, I hope to continue getting better and getting stronger.   
I felt like I was playing well throughout the week.  Today maybe slightly I could have played better.  But, again, I just had an opponent that was too good.   
Well, I have to move on.  Semifinals is a good result.  Hopefully I'll have another good result in Rome.   
 Q.  You are the last winner in Paris, in Roland Garros.  Do you think Rafa is the big favorite to win in Paris this year?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, yes, he is.   
 Q.  Do you have a few thoughts about a new team, people you would like to see next to you, and help you?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm not going to share anything with you now.  I hope you understand and respect that.  I'm just going to go along, and in the next three, four weeks maximum, I'll make my decisions around that, about the team.  Then, of course, I'll let you know.   
 Q.  Do you think it may have worked to your disadvantage that you didn't get to play yesterday, especially with the change in temperature and conditions?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I don't know.  I mean, maybe.  I don't want to find excuses why he played that well and why I didn't play maybe as well.   
It's just as it is.  I felt comfortable hitting the ball last few days, physically ready, mentally sharp as well.  I was trying my best.   
But it's just one of these days where your opponent is just playing better than you, and you have to be able to say, Congratulations, and move on.   
You know, he did get the better of me in most of the stats today, most of the shots.  But, as I say, you know, I have lots of good things to take out of this week.
