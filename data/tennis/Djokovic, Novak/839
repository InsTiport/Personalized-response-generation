  A. MURRAY/N. Djokovic  
7-6, 7-6  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. At 2-2 in the second set, did you ask your coach what time it was?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No.   
  
  Q. What did you ask, if you don't mind?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Can't tell you.   
  
  Q. Was fatigue a factor out there today?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: A little bit, yeah. I finished late last night, so could make it a factor.  
  
  Q. You twisted your ankle in the second set. How much did that affect you?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I was thinking a little bit about it, but it wasn't that bad. It was more the heat and started from that.  
  
  Q. Obviously you were really good yesterday. Did you feel a little bit more off today, not quite as good?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, yes. It's different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you. You know, he was making me do a lot unforced errors. It's a fast court, but Nadal plays high balls which are suitable to my forehand.   
 But he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand. I just lost the rhythm.  
  
  Q. How did you think you returned today?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, overall, I wasn't really happy with the way I played today. I could have played better. I had some chances.
