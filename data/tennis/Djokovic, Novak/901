   THE MODERATOR:  First question for Novak.   
  
  Q.  You said the court the other day was pretty slow.  How would you assess the court you played on today?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  It was faster than the Centre Court for me.  Probably, you know, there were some changes because the player I played against today was a big server and he didn't give me any rhythm.   
 You know, it's very difficult to play against those players on grass.  I'm really happy to get through.   
  
  Q.  What do you foresee for the tournament, your next opponent?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Well, I'm really happy to get the two rounds, to pass the two rounds.  I had a pretty good round in the first round and played pretty well.  Today I was performing good and bad.   
 You know, I had a lot of oscillation, ups and downs.  It's normal.  As I said, it's a player who doesn't allow you to get the rhythm.   
 My next opponent is Nicolas Kiefer, who is a very good player, former No. 3, 4 in the world.   
  
  Q.  Semifinalist here.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Yes, semifinalist here in Wimbledon.  He had really impressive results on any surface.  You know, I expect a very difficult match, even though he was off the tour for quite a long time 'cause he was injured.   
 But, you know, he came back and he showed that he's still in a good shape even though he had a big break.  I'm sure he's very motivated because he doesn't have, again, anything to lose because he had a really long break.   
 It's going to be a difficult match.  But, you know, let's see what happens.  You know, he's a player who plays from the baseline.  He likes to have rhythm.  For me I think it's going to be a little bit better.   
  
  Q.  If you had your life on the line in a tennis match, who would you pick to play that match for you, Nadal or Federer?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  I don't know.  I can't answer that question.
