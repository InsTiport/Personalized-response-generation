J. NIEMINEN/N. Djokovic
  6-4, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Just your general feelings on the match.
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, obviously disappointed, you know, whenever I lose. I'm disappointed about the match today. There was a lot of wind, difficult conditions. He played better and deserved to win.

 Q. You had a shot at No. 2 today. Did that make the loss a little bit tougher?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No. 

 Q. What were your thoughts going into the tiebreaker?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I didn't change much. Obviously I had -- I was thinking about those breakpoints, missed opportunities. 

 Q. Besides the break points, anything that just didn't work for you today?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: My forehand didn't really work today, and you could see in all the important moments he served to my forehand and I couldn't put the ball in. 
 Just a bad day. 

 Q. People are always going to bring up the racquet now. Like every time you have a loss they're going bring up the racquet. Still no problem adjusting with your racquet?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No. I don't want to talk about it now. Just trying to focus on Australian Open. 

 Q. So what are your general feelings going in now? You've had a couple weeks of play. Is your game where you want it to be?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, not 100%, but getting there. I needed a couple matches here. That's why I came to Sydney. Hopefully I can get into my shape from last year for Melbourne. 

 Q. Had your family at the Australian Open last year. Are they going to come this year?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Unfortunately not. 

 Q. You had a chance to look at your draw?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No. 

 Q. How are your confidence levels after a match like that going Melbourne?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it's always great to win a tournament prior to a Grand Slam, but he was better today. You have to give him credit for that. I just hope I will maintain my high level of performance. You know, it wasn't really what I expected, especially today. 
 But, you know, we keep on going.

 Q. It has to be a completely different feeling now going into a Grand Slam defending it for the first time. Just talk about that. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, this is a first-time experience. Try to accept it as a positive challenge. Obviously if I want to be on the top I have to -- I have to, well, accept the pressure of the defending champion. 

 Q. Other than just finding your rhythm in your game, are there any other things you have to do? Do you feel like when you get there you have to play more aggressive, solid? What are you looking for? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you know, all the things have to come together, you know. It's the start of the season and still adjusting on some things and haven't played a match in a while. 
 So everybody starts a bit slowly. Hopefully it's going to come back. 

 Q. Do you favor this concept of pushing the Australian Open two weeks later in the year? It's been brought up by a couple guys. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, I do. I do. I think players need more attention, because, you know, health is coming in the matter of question, really. You have a lot of pull-outs, and you don't want to see that as a sponsor of the tournament or as a fan, that some of the top players of the top 10 are not coming to your events. 
 Tennis is by far the longest season in sport, and I think we should have -- we should do something about it in the future. But, still, it's not only about the players. It's about the tournaments. 
 It's about a lot of things. Hopefully we can make an agreement.

 Q. After everything the players went through the last couple years trying to get a new schedule for 2009, can you imagine going back and trying to get a new calendar all over again?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't think you can change everything from the start, from the bottom, because it takes a lot of energy and work. 
 As I said, it's not only about the players, tournaments, there is a lot of tradition and history everywhere around the world. You have to consider that as well.
 The thing is that if you want to see the top players performing on the high level on every tournament, then we have to make an adjustable schedule.

 Q. Novak, forgive me I just arrived early today. You've met with Adam Helfant personally, the ATP executive. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes.

 Q. He came to see you?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes.

 Q. What impressed you about him? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You know, I couldn't get a lot from the one meeting, but first impressions were positive. Hopefully he can achieve and do what he is saying that he can.
