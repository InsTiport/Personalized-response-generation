THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  As we know, in our great sport there are some fun moments and then some not so fun moments. So I'm going to ask you a tough question. Earlier in the year it was said that we all have to learn from what happened and have accountability in relationship to the Justin situation. At Wimbledon, you said that you would read the victim reports and the impact reports and get back to us. My question is have you read those reports?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes.   
 Q.  And could you please comment on those reports.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he has taken the responsibility for his actions and what has happened that night. So he went back to deal with this himself. Obviously there is a lot of work in his private life that needs addressing.   
And that's all there is. You know, he's not part of the ATP political system at the moment, and I think it's for the best for all of us. What future holds for him and for us, we don't know. We don't know that. But I'm still in touch with him. I still communicate with Justin.   
And that's all there is. He's going to go back. He's going to try to handle this matter in best possible way. I really wish him all the best. It's unfortunate that that has happened. Because I think he was a great asset, as I was mentioning in Wimbledon and before, for the players.   
But he has taken the responsibility. I have read what you wanted me to read in Wimbledon, and that's all there is to it. I have no further comments for you.   
 Q.  You and Roger had a pretty good match recently. You have very different records here at the US Open the past few years. What do you put that down to? Does it have to do with the surface or your playing styles? Pure luck?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I don't think there is such thing as luck if it happens year after year for many years.   
So, you know, I personally have enjoyed lots of success and have been blessed to play well on these courts here in the US Open, especially the Arthur Ashe. I have not lost too many matches in my career playing night session, and a lot of matches that I get to play in Arthur Ashe are night sessions. So I really do enjoy that loud atmosphere that happens in there, which is quite the opposite of, for example, Wimbledon, except the last finals match.   
And I think you just adjust to it. You adapt to it. You accept it. You embrace it. I do embrace it because I think it's good for our sport to have various different atmospheres on the center courts of four different slams that are very unique and obviously the biggest events in our sport.   
 Q.  You've got a lot of tools and weapons at your disposal. How important would you say your movement is to your success? And I'm wondering, today it looked like there was something maybe going on with your foot during practice, and I'm just wondering how much of a concern that is or what's going on with that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it's just a minor thing with the foot. You know, blisters like anybody has those. But it's nothing major that is posing a concern for the event.   
But look, movement is -- I think movement is probably undervalued in terms of when you evaluate someone's game. And Roger has talked a lot about his movement because his movement is one of the best movements that we've ever had with any tennis player.   
And my movement obviously is also the base of everything. It allows me to actually swing through my shots to get some balls that maybe most of the other players cannot get to.   
I slide a lot, whether it's clay, hard court, or grass. I think the flexibility of my ankles has helped with that pretty, so to say, aggressive style of movement.   
And I credit my childhood spent on the skis as well, and I used to spend a lot of time skiing. I think that had an effect as well with kind of coordination and change of, I guess, movement from one side to another. Even though they are different sports, but, in essence, you know, you are using some major muscle groups and joints and stuff like this in most of the sports.   
So I think movement is the most important thing because it just allows you to be more in balance. And, you know, in the end of the day, that is what you're looking for as a tennis player. How can you hit the ball, you know, being in the right balance so you can, you know, penetrate the ball with the right speed, accuracy, and precision.   
 Q.  Nick Kyrgios caught a very heavy fine last week. Does the player council (inaudible).  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We don't. I mean, as far as I am informed, we did not speak about, you know, fining any player so far. And I've been in council for, in total, I think, seven, eight years.   
So I guess the management decides and the board decides, you know, with the department that is responsible for that particular matter, they decide, you know, together I guess also with the tournament because they have to evaluate what is the damage in the particular tournament of what that fine is.   
 Q.  Some time has gone by now. Where would you rank that Wimbledon finish in your career in terms of compared to other matches? And also what are the long-term impacts of a victory like that on your game, on your mentality and confidence? Does it stay with you quite a while?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's top two matches I have ever played. I think because -- you know, the other match is the one against Nadal in the finals of Australian Open went almost for six hours. So those two matches really are very special and take a special place in my career and my mind as well.   
Of course I do still have flashes from the Australian match still that many years after. And of course I would wish to remember, you know, Wimbledon finals against Roger this year for many years to come.   
But at the same time, as a tennis player, this sport can be a little bit cruel when it comes to, I guess, marvelling or celebrating your own success. You don't have that much luxury of time to really reflect on everything because the season keeps going. So, you know, only three, four weeks later, I had to go back and compete in the hard courts in Cincinnati, and here I am in US Open, last slam of the year.   
So of course once I'm, I guess, done with my career or maybe slowing down the pace with tournaments, I guess I'll have more time to really reflect on everything and look at those matches.   
But, you know, once you are in this kind of mechanism, it's really hard to look back too much, if you know what I mean. Of course you're looking back and then it awakens certain kind of emotion that of course it's positive and it allows you to awaken that confidence in you. And the belief and the motivation, it inspires you to again keep going and trying to reach more historic results.   
But at the same time, you have to stay in the present moment.   
 Q.  A lot of people like to predict and they wonder who is going to end up with the most Grand Slam titles. And after Wimbledon, people have been thinking that that could possibly be yourself. Do you pay any attention to that? Do you like hearing that? Do you wish people wouldn't discuss it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I'm aware of it, of course. I mean, I'm part of this world. Of course I can't completely switch off and eliminate what people are talking about.   
And it's flattering, obviously. But at the same time, you know, it's still a very long way ahead of me. It does also put a certain level of responsibility to me as well, because I am, you know, aiming to do that. You know, it's definitely one of my ambitions and goals, if you want.   
I am 32. So, you know, things are a little bit different than they were ten years ago, but I still feel young inside and outside. And I still am very motivated to keep going and especially at this stage. I mean, it always has been the case but, especially now, more or less everything is about Grand Slams in terms of how I see tennis and how I approach them because, you know, they matter the most.   
So I will definitely try to play my best tennis and aim to play my best tennis at this event.   
 Q.  Have you had the first meeting of the new council and what impact do you think the joining of Federer and Nadal will have on the policy-making of the council?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, the impact is already great because they are the legends of our sport and two big names joining the council. There's already have been a big impact on the rest of the players in the council, of course the larger group of tennis players in general, knowing that these two guys are willing to contribute, to come in to help out, to support, to participate in discussions and some decision-making.   
And it was interesting. You know, it has never happened that you have one, two, and three of the world in council group that is group of ten players. So all I hear from other players is positive comments about it.   
And it went well. They were very engaged. So looking forward to work with them.   
 Q.  It wasn't seven hours, then?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It wasn't. And actually, that's why it was very surprising, to be honest. Because the last two before last night, the last two meetings we had were six and seven hours. And last night was two, two hours 15 minutes. Because it was well-prepared prior to the meeting, and we kind of -- we still didn't go through a full agenda. Of course, that's what happens most of the times.   
But, you know, it's good that we at least are doing also work prior to sitting down so we could have a more efficient meeting.
