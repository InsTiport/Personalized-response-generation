N. DJOKOVIC/M. Ancic
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. Nice to get that one out of way tonight?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, well, that is what I was thinking would be better for both of us, whoever wins the match, to end up tonight so he can rest for the semifinal.

 Q. Was it frustrating waiting through the long rain delay?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it is. You're warming up the muscles and then you're getting cold. On and off the court for a couple of times isn't really the best thing for your body and for your physical condition.
 It was the same for both of us. We just had to accept it. I think as a winner I can say it's much better to finish tonight.

 Q. It was a Serbia/Croatia match. What do you think of the crowd's behavior?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Look, it was very unusual atmosphere for a tennis match. But after what we have seen between fans of those two countries in the last couple of years, we could expect something closely like this.
 Look, you got to understand, that's the way they're trying to support their player and their country. For them, this is the only way they can really express their feelings for their country.
 On the other hand, I know they can be disturbing and overreact, and the players and the crowd and the rest the people don't like it.
 But that's the way it is.

 Q. At the end the January there is an auction, a charity of your memorabilia. Can you tell us about it.
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I mean, I'm not informed about it. I'm sorry.
