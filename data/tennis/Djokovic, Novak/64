3-6, 7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you think this one escaped from you?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he deserved the victory. He was the better player.
Second and third set I started off very well, but then I wasn't sharp. I lacked, you know, that little bit of, I guess, dynamic movement and acceleration in my shots. I didn't have any breakpoints for two sets.
I mean, he did serve well, credit to him, but just wasn't pleased with the way I played.
Q. From our side it looked like the energy level was dropping a bit maybe after that second set. Is there any fatigue, something going on?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I mean, not really, you know. I felt okay. It was just that -- yeah, it was one of those days where you just maybe can't find that sharpness that is necessary in these kind of matches.
Q. I just wondered what your schedule will be from here? Because obviously Rafa has got a chance of overtaking you as No. 1. Will you try and sort of schedule to stay ahead?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Scheduled to play Paris and London for now.
Q. I was wondering about your elbow, which you treated in the last match, and your shoulder. Are you feeling completely all right?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes. No, no. No issues. Thank you for asking. No issues.
Q. What was challenging for you in the second set and third set? How did Stefanos...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he had the high quality tennis and he played very well, I think, after his serve. He was backing up his serve with a really good and aggressive first shots in the rally.
As I said, I didn't make him defend, you know, I guess enough. I just gave him enough time to really dictate the play from back of the court, and, you know, he deserved to win.
Q. Do you think he has the potential to become World No. 1 in future?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: He definitely has, yes.
