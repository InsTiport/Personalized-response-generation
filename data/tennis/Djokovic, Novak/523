THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk to me about the game.   Would you say you got lucky?   It was a joke.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, it was a tough game, of course.   He was a better player first half of the match.   I was trying to find rhythm.   A lot of unforced errors.   
Just had a very difficult time to be in the point.   He did a great job in staying very solid and putting a lot of pressure on me.   Then I had to fight.   It was a very even match up to the last point.   
Just glad to get lucky and dance on the court after the match.  
   
 Q.   What about the dance?   I haven't seen you do it a lot.   Is it special to MontrÃ©al?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't know if you heard last press conference.   I talked about it.   I said I had a deal with my friends that I'm going to do it after every match if I win here.   If I get encouragement from the fans, maybe I'll keep on doing it at the other tournaments.  
   
 Q.   Talking about the dance actually, are you going to end up doing it with the little scooter you were posting photos of?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   We'll see.   I'm not planning anything.   
   
 Q.   A few players today were complaining about the ball, specifically Nadal.   Do you have any comment on that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, I agree.   It's different this year than the past years.   I don't know if is just for this tournament.   Usually the balls are the same.   Maybe sometimes the ball pressure is different if the ball is old.   By saying 'old' I mean kept somewhere in a warehouse or somewhere, you know, for long time, for few months, then it loses pressure.   
Look, it's the same for everybody.   So it is what it is.   You have to adjust to it.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the crowd?   Fairly loud sometimes.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   The crowd was great.   They were supporting me, him also.   I hope they enjoyed the match.   I tried my best to fight and, you know, obviously win this match and also entertain the crowd with some good points, and with the dance in the end.   
I hope they got a good night session for two hours of good tennis.   
   
 Q.   Is it your friends choosing for the next dance?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Look, you know, it's going to be this song and the dance more or less is the same.   Maybe just change some small detail.   Today was the hair.   I was inspired by one of the dancers from the video.   I don't know, maybe if I win tomorrow, I'll come up with something else.
