N. DJOKOVIC/L. Pouille
7-6, 6-1
Q. First-set breaker, a tight one.  You got through that and then rolled through the second set.  What was the key in the breaker?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I thought he played really well.  Throughout the first set we both held our service games quite comfortably to the tiebreak.
And then, you know, I just stayed in there.  Very focused.  Didn't drop my level.  He did.  Double-faulted and missed a couple of forehands and obviously that cost him the tiebreak.
After that, you know, beginning of the second set I knew it was very important to try to break his serve right away and get into advantage, which I have.  I have managed to finish off the match really well.
Q. You asked for physio for your elbow.  What was the problem?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I had some tightness, especially on my serve.  Managed to finish the match, which is great.  But, you know, pain is there, so hopefully I'll have no pain for tomorrow.
Q. The little boy that you posted the video of in your Instagram yesterday, I wondered if you could talk about how you met him and why those moments are so important for you.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I met him just before we walked into the court.  He was actually holding my hand while I was walking with him on the court.
They told me the story about him.  Actually, I heard, I think was it after the first set that they said, the speaker in the house said that he has survived the neuroblastoma cancer when he was 10-days-old baby.  He's wearing the shirt "I'm a Champion."
You know, those kind of moments, you know, stay with him for a long time.  I wanted to make him feel comfortable, and I know what it means to him to be on the court.  For me, it's just a little bit of attention and a gesture to make him feel good.
Q. You're back in the semifinal tomorrow.  What are your thoughts on the matchup against Medvedev?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he's in form, definitely.  A lot of matches, a lot of confidence, not missing the ball from back of the court.  Played finals in Washington and Montreal.  Hasn't dropped a set here.
It doesn't seem he's tired from that amount of matches, actually, and contrary, it's serving him well.  When you're winning so many matches in a row, obviously confidence level is very high.  Then you're going for the shots.
He has a big serve.  He has improved his movement a lot because he's a tall guy.  He's all-around player, has a lot of variety in his game.
It's going to be a tough one.  I think it's also going to be physical and I'm hoping for the best.
