N. DJOKOVIC/D. Schwartzman
6-3, 6-7, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you describe what happened in the second set tiebreak, how you were able to rally.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, credit to Diego for playing well.  He came out with the right game plan.  He was hitting the ball clean.  He was hitting it fast.  He was mixing up the pace.  He was dropshot-ing really well.  It was really hard to read the play.
The conditions were very, very heavy, very wet court.  Not two same bounces.  The ball wasn't bouncing high at all.  It's completely different from day.  For him, he didn't have to worry about high balls.  He was just picking everything on the rise.
Very close match.  I mean, third set, one point where we had that great point, ending when I got the dropshot, that was the turning point.  That's where I made a break.  That was enough.
Q. You played almost six hours in two days, late evening each time.  How do you feel and how much of an impact can it have for tomorrow?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We'll see.  I don't know what kind of impact it's going to have.  It's obvious that I played more than Rafa.  At the same time I'm in the finals, and that's a great success.  I'm obviously very pleased about that.
I'll try to do my best to recover.  It's not the first time I find myself in these kinds of situations.  I feel okay, of course not as fresh as at the beginning of the week.  It is what it is.  I'll try to recover for tomorrow.
Q. Obviously you're not in the greatest condition for tomorrow.  Are you happy to see Rafa back in the final, as well, considering what he's gone through over the past few weeks?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As an admirer of his, yes.  As an opponent, no (smiling).
Q. Talk about what it's like to see Rafa come through the past four weeks, the road he's been on, now back in his top form.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: He's one of the greatest champions this game has ever seen.  His mentality, his approach, his resilience, ability to fight back after long absence from the tour, injuries, surgeries, he's had it all.
He keeps on showing to the world why he's one of the biggest legends of tennis history.  I have greatest respect for him.  He's my greatest rival of all time, for sure.  I've had so many matches against him.  Up to date, we had the longest rivalry of tennis of all time.  Played over 50 matches.  Every time we get to play each other, it's a thrill.  It's the ultimate challenge.
