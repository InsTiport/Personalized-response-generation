  N. DJOKOVIC/G. Monfils
4-6, 6-1, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Give a comment about your semifinal. You'll fight against Rafael. Do you have enough confidence to defeat him again after defeating him a week and a half ago?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: The fact is I have enough confidence. Now the question is if I will have enough physical strength to hold on. 
 So it's been exhausting tournament so far for all of us. I came to the semifinal and I'm not gonna think about me being tired or things like that. I pulled out a great match today. Incredible tiring exhausting physically and mentally. But the most important thing is that I won. So I did win last couple of times against Nadal that we played on this surface, so this can be a little advantage for me. 
 But, as I said, you know, it's going to be very close, and hopefully I can get the positive outcome.
