 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You had a lot of success attacking Andy's backhand. Was this like a predefined game plan for you?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I knew I had to be kind of in a control of the rallies, and I did that. I needed to get a lot of returns back. I did that, as well. I was using the forehands quite well.   
 So just happy with overall performance.   
  
  Q. That looked easy tonight. Was it?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's never easy, you know. I mean, straights-set win, results-wise, it is easy maybe if you look at it. You know, you got to make these shots. You've got to get his serves back in the court and try to win the rallies.   
 If you're not in a comfortable zone, return zone, and he makes a lot of free points with his serve, then he puts pressure on your serve and you're in trouble. So I tried to avoid that, because that happened between us, you know, a couple last times that we played. I wasn't managing to find a comfort zone in the return.   
 But tonight it was great.  
  
  Q. Obviously Roger Federer is your next opponent tomorrow night. Is it going to come down to energy?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's going to come down to maybe a couple of points. Last couple matches we played were very close. Most of the matches we played went three sets or five sets at the US Open. It's probably going to be similar tomorrow. It's a big challenge for both of us. So I think it's great for the tournament to see us playing in the semifinal. And then on the other hand Nadal/Murray. It's going to be a great atmosphere. It's the last tournament of the year, except the Davis Cup final that I'm playing next week.   
 It's great achievement that I already reached the semifinal. I will try to give my best tomorrow night.   
 I don't think that energy-wise I'm feeling weak or this is going to be an issue tomorrow night. I think, you know, it's just a matter of good or bad day, you know.   
  
  Q. Was your eye okay tonight? Did you ever find out what the problem was?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was a contact lenses. It's all right now, yeah. I glued them to my eyes (smiling).   
  
  Q. You had that great win over Roger in New York. You played a couple of times since then and lost. Is that going to affect your confidence or game plan?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I think my confidence since Wimbledon is very high. I've been playing very good tennis, made a lot of good results. In China as well, and in Europe.   
 Yes, last two times I have lost against him, but close matches, so...   
 Yeah, I will try to step it up and take my chances and hope to prevail.   
  
  Q. You said at the start of the week that you were prioritizing the Davis Cup final, but fully concentrating on this as well. Have you actually been more relaxed because you're in a win-win situation and that may have added an extra level to your game?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you can try to handle the pressure on the ways that you think that are the best for you. You can be relaxed on the court or focused, whatever, depending on the player. But as soon as you step on the court, you feel this tension of playing the match.   
 It's definitely important to me to win every match here. That's what I have showed on the court. So I'm still in the tournament, and I really want to go all the way if I play well. Then, you know, I'll think about Davis Cup.   
  
  Q. You came out to the court with a pirate or you were trying to practice with only one eye?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, it was a little joke (laughter).
