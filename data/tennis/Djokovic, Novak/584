 N. DJOKOVIC/C. Berlocq
  6‑1, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese, please.   
   
 Q.   For the second set, when you take lead to 5‑0 but then you win finally 5‑3, I want to know that probably you fail to stay focused during the match.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I didn't fail.   I won the match.   So in my eyes, that's good enough.   I mean, I have played a great match, much better than I have done in the first round.  
So, yes, it was interesting couple of games in the end of the match where he came up with some good shots.   We played some entertaining points.  
I should have done a better job in winning those games and winning this match before, but look, you know, in the end I won in straight sets.   That's what matters the most.  
   
 Q.   A couple of days ago it seems that a video between you and Sharapova start to be very much popular on the Internet.   But in the afternoon when we interviewed Sharapova, Sharapova said that actually she didn't know that even you're going to play a match tonight.   Did you keep a close watch on her match, as well?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, she's just pretending that she didn't know.   (Laughter.)  
I'm sure she follows my matches very closely, as I follow her.   
   
 Q.   It is rumored that in French Open when you and your coach start champagne to celebrate because you win actually because Nadal for eight games.   I really want to understand what's going on there.   Can you tell me the real situation at that time?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Can you repeat that question?   I really didn't understand what you're asking just now.   Can you please repeat?   
   
 Q.   It is said in the Internet that in the final of French Open, while it was raining, you, together with your coaches, start several bottles of champagne to celebrate because at that point you had already taken lead over Nadal for eight games.   So I want to understand whether this is real.   If not, what's the real situation?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, there is no truth in that.   Why would I celebrate if I had continuing of the match the next day?   
I didn't win that match.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.   
   
 Q.   There has been talk recently that in the women's game they're going to try and stamp out the grunting.   Do you have an opinion at all on the amount of grunting that goes on in the women's game?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I have to choose my words wisely right now.   (Smiling.)  
No, look, everybody has a different way of I guess expressing themselves in the court, and if that's been a part of Azarenka and Sharapova's game throughout all their life, that's the way it is.  
You know, I think that there is no rule that forbids them to grunt and to do so.   Monica Seles did, and she had no problems even though, you know, it can be annoying to their opponents, but still they're not doing that, I think, to, you know, provoke their opponents or do something in order to win that match.  
It's just a part of their game, part of them.   I guess it's on the other people to decide what they want to do with that.   In my eyes, it's fine.   I'm just looking at those matches; I'm not playing against them.   
   
 Q.   Maria may be pretending that she doesn't care about you, but you must be aware of she's involved in the Sugarpova business.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes, I tried it.  
   
 Q.   You tried it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   So how good it is?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's quite good.   It's quite sweet.   
   
 Q.   Do you like it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I do.   I do.   I've tried only a few because she has a variety of those, you know, sweet candies.   I'm waiting for more.   
   
 Q.   Also, I know that you tried a few Chinese after the match when you were doing the on‑court interview, but we didn't hear clearly what you actually said.   Could you please share that again?   What was that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   About what?   Sorry, I didn't understand.   About my Chinese?   When?   
   
 Q.   After the match.   On the court interview.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I have been ‑‑I said ‑‑okay.   I said (speaking Chinese.)  
Not bad.  
   
 Q.   Do you actually know what that means?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I know.   At least they told me.   "Thank you for the support."   
Right?   Nothing bad.   (Laughter.)   I hope they were not playing with me.
