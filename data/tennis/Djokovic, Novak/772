N. DJOKOVIC/J. Chardy
  7-5, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How do you analyze your performance today?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, ti's hard to analyze on a day like this, to be honest. I've played against a big hitter, and he was going for his shots. I was very much aware of that. He puts a lot of pressure on your service games obviously when he hits hard and just hits ridiculously fast his returns. 
 It's kind of hard to get any rhythm, and considering the weather as well which we were playing in, it was really difficult for a ball toss, for anything. 
 So just overall I'm happy that -- to get a win out of this day. It's a positive thing. 

 Q. Throwing the racquet is not a good example, but it seemed to have helped you. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, look, I'm emotional guy. It's not the first time and not the last time it happened. I just wanted to just release the nervousness I had. That's it. 

 Q. It worked and you broke back. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, yeah.

 Q. In terms of just how you feel, are you fresh? I mean, it was nice to win in straight sets in those conditions and not have to go to a third. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: True, true. It was crucial, especially the first set, to win it, and then get with the big advantage in the continuation of the match.
 I knew that it's not going to be easy to break him with a big serve like that, so I just had to hold on and wait for the chances. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on the quarterfinal? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, both of these players are baseline specialists, and Simon is very solid from the baseline. He likes to be more patient than Davydenko, who's really aggressive and the likes to go for his shots. 
 Any of those guys it's gonna be hard.
