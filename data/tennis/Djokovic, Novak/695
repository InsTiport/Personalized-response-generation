N. DJOKOVIC/I. Dodig
  7-5, 6-7, 6-0, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You certainly were made to work out tonight. He chased everything down. It was a hard night. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you know maybe the positive thing about this match is I was challenged, pushed to the limits in the first two sets and stayed around three, three and a half hours on the court.
 I'm not physically tired. I didn't have any lead up to Australian Open. I was playing Hopman Cup couple of the matches. But I feel good on the court. Today in the first two sets I wasn't happy with the way I was playing. Definitely wasn't my best. 
 But in third and fourth it was okay. Just look forward to the next challenge.

 Q. You did look a bit slack. Can you put your finger on why that was?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's tough to say. Everything is okay. Sometimes your legs aren't listening to you.

 Q. I suppose it's a long tournament and you can't be at your best all the time. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: That's true. It's better for this to happen just now in the opening rounds than later.

 Q. And you got Viktor Troicki next. How do you feel about playing him? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We played couple of times last three, four months. He's definitely on a roll, playing really well. Won his first tournament of the career in Moscow last year and now finals in Sydney. He has a big serve. We know each other very, very from the Davis Cup and from junior days.
 We grew up playing tennis. So it's going to be a tough third round definitely for both of us.

 Q. On the TV there, are you paying much attention to this match as well? Roger is being pushed to the limit by Gilles Simon. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I've been looking at the match. Definitely Simon winning Sydney, he's playing well. 

 Q. Wouldn't be a bad thing for you if Roger was to fall by the wayside. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I have to do my work on the court regardless. 

 Q. Everyone seemed happy and loud and getting along out there tonight. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: From the fan's perspective, I think they had fun. It was obvious they liked to be around to watch the pros in action. This tournament has a lot of different colors, nations, and sometimes it feels like you're on a football match with the support. 
 For us it's unusual and sometimes good to feel that. Keeps you going even more.
