THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. A very different outcome today. How do you feel after a good one like that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was the best performance I had so far this week. Came at the right time against, you know, one of my biggest rivals and the guy I lost to last time we played in the finals of French Open.  
So, you know, obviously I approached this match very seriously in trying to prepare myself and get myself in a good position to win. That's what I have done. I served very well for a set and a half.   
First set I think 85% of first serves in, which definitely helps in these matches to get some free points and to, you know, allow myself to relax a little bit more in the return games.  
You know, he obviously didn't play on his best level, but I felt like I was pretty solid from back of the court and doing what I needed to do.  
   
 Q. 4‑All and you broke him, and then broke him the first two games he served in the second set. You really raised your level yesterday. At this point in time at 4‑All did you raise your level, did he fade a little bit, or combination?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I think, you know, I tried to apply pressure on his second serves and have done well in the 4‑All Love‑30. You know, put myself in a position to eventually break, and then, you know, just stayed solid. Didn't make any, you know, winners there, but just played solid.   
Make him play an extra shot. He made some unforced errors. I got that crucial break.  
   
 Q. Eight service games; one ace. Was he able to read what you were doing, or was it more about placement rather than...   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I think it was just important for me after two pretty bad service matches that I had this tournament so far to just get that percentage of first serves in higher. Not really going for aces but more for accuracy, precision, and kind of allowing myself to have a good look at the second shot.  
   
 Q. Yesterday you talked about how the injury to your wrist had really messed up your serving, and obviously today it was fine.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Not wrist, the elbow.  
   
 Q. The elbow, yeah. Messed up your serving, your routine. Do you feel now it's actually coming back a little bit after today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes. Well, as I play more and spend more time on the practice court during the matches, as well, I allow myself to get back into the right routine and get back in the rhythm where I want to be.   
I felt like today, as well, that the baseline game was much more solid, more controlled. Whenever I needed to, you know, kind of hit the ball and take over the control of the rally, I have done so.  
So it's just, overall, from every aspect of my game was a much better performance than it was in first matches.  
   
 Q. You're going to play a different type of player tomorrow. Will your preparation tomorrow morning be any different than the preparation this morning?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, obviously I'm going to approach it the way I have done today, you know, very seriously doing in my preparations everything I have done so far.   
But specifically for my tomorrow's opponent the preparation will be slightly different in terms of tactics, because he's a completely different player, you know, from the one that I had today.  
Hopefully I will execute the plan well.   
   
 Q. I want to ask you about last week. I know you got to the final, but you also played doubles. Did that tire you out at all in going through the distance in Montreal and being, you know, not maybe 100% physically, mentally to play the final?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No. It's behind me now, so honestly I wasn't thinking about that too much. I was actually trying to take the positives out of playing doubles and where it helped me to serve and return better for my singles matches, as well.   
I don't play doubles that often. As a matter of fact, just couple tournaments a year. So I really enjoyed it. I really cared of winning the doubles. Played with my good friend Janko that struggled a lot last couple of years with injuries and everything.   
He hasn't won many matches, and I was glad at least that in doubles we are doing well. Hopefully that can help his confidence and the way he feels on tennis court.  
Yeah, we played three‑hour match in the finals, Andy and I. You know, I still felt physically fine after the match was over. Of course it was tiring, a lot of rallies, but in the end of the day I don't think the doubles influenced too much.   
   
 Q. Do you think that you have enough support here from audience, your fans here in Cincinnati?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I mean, of course. I do need any kind of support, you know, from people from my country who live here in United States, but also, you know, people who are from United States or anybody who comes and follows tennis.   
You always like to have the crowd behind you because this is‑‑ can give you an extra motivation and edge and make you feel good on the court.  
I do feel I have quite good support, so I appreciate that. I'm very grateful for that.
