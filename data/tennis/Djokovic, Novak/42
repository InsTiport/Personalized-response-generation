N. DJOKOVIC/K. Khachanov   
6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What went wrong? You took over an hour.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No answer to that question (smiling).   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the match tonight?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I think the wind was even stronger today on the court, changing directions all the time. It was really, really tough to get the rhythm for the serve.   
I wasn't serving as well as I have in the first two matches in terms of first-serve percentage. But second serve was quite accurate. I used I guess all spots in the boxes, both ends, pretty well.   
I don't think Karen has played up to par. He knows and he's capable to play much better than he has tonight. He made a lot of unforced errors, which obviously made my life easier especially in the first set to go up 5-1, two breaks.   
But I think from my end was a solid, solid performance. I moved well in the defense. I was using the variety, the dropshots, always making him guess what is coming next. That was the goal obviously.   
 Q.  Gael Monfils possibly. You have a great record against him. Your thoughts?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, Gael Monfils is in form. He's top 10 of the world. He's playing possibly his best tennis that he's ever played. I think his best season was 10 years or more ago when he was 6, 7 in the world, playing semis of Grand Slams.   
I've never lost to him, but we had some pretty long matches and tough encounters. One of the best if not the best athletes in our sport. He moves so well. He's so fit. For me he has the most interesting game in tennis. I love watching him play and I love playing against him.   
But got to pay respect to Gasquet, as well. They're just getting on the court. I need to say a few words about him.   
Obviously I have a very good record against Richard, but quite different player, style of tennis than Monfils. He plays with a one-handed backhand with a lot of spin. He likes to have a little bit more time so he can get in the right position and balance. He uses slice. He's so talented.   
Both of them are very talented players. Yeah, one thing for sure: I'm going to play a French player tomorrow.
