 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What's the problem with you in the tiebreak?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: There was no problem. He played too good.   
  
  Q. Given your good performances so far in China, how much of a disappointment is this, this kind of a day?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I'm disappointed, because I think I played a great match, but overall, these two weeks have been great for me.   
  
  Q. Is it physical fitness is your main problem in this match?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No.  
  
  Q. No? So what is the main problem you met today?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was just his good game.   
  
  Q. Is this one of the best matches he played against you?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, probably.   
  
  Q. Could you comment on the organization of Shanghai ATP 1000 Series? Are you satisfied with the organization?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I'm very satisfied.   
 It is one of the best organized tournaments in the world. Should be example to the whole tournaments. They have everything that the players need to be happy.  
  
  Q. Looking to London, obviously this is a blow. Do you feel you can bounce back from this? Will this provide more motivation perhaps going to London?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, there is still two tournaments to go before London, so I'm not thinking about London this moment.
