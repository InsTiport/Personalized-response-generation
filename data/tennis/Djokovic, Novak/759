N. DJOKOVIC/N. Davydenko
  3-6, 6-4, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Really long battle, hard battle. How would you describe your performance? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I wasn't feeling that great on the court. Physically-wise, I was a bit slow, kind of couldn't get in great rhythm. With reactions, as well. 
 But I'm just happy to win the first match. I knew that it's going to be long one. Davydenko is in great form, very aggressive player. But, you know, in the end, quite happy to get through. 

 Q. Did you have a physical problem going into the match or was it during the match?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You know, generally I'm very exhausted because of the long season. 

 Q. What was the key point for you today to be able to win after such a bad start?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know. I really think he was a better player in the first two sets and maybe overall in the whole match. 
 But, you know, when you have bad days, you still manage to win, find a way to win. I think that's something that is great to have in your game. 

 Q. Are you surprised by Soderling's win over Rafa, and what do you think of your next game against him?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he played really well. I think Rafa is struggling a little bit with his form. Soderling was serving well and had nothing to lose. He deserved to win. 
 We gonna have tough one. There is no easy match here. Look, especially after today's long performance, I just hope physically I recover. 

 Q. Is you serving confidence? Physically you're not well? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Confidence is there. Game is there. Form is there. But physically, you can't fight the nature sometimes. You can't do much about it. 

 Q. Can you talk about your physical trainer. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I just changed in last five months. Everything has been working great. I dedicated a lot of time to this aspect of the game. I feel strong on the court. 

 Q. What kind of match do you think it's going to be against Soderling? It feels like you have an advantage against him, you're 5-0 against him. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I wouldn't rate myself as a favorite in that match because he's in a great form. I finished very late today. I hope tomorrow the free day will help me to recover. 
 It's gonna be a tough one, I guess. You know, small details, couple of points will decide the winner.
