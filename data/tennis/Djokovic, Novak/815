6-1, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. It's always difficult to play those late night matches. How much of a relief was it to get through and win that one?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's big relief. We've been waiting for a couple of hours for the women's match and warming up on and off. Really happy to get through in the fourth set.   
 It could really go either way. We had long rallies, even though the results doesn't show the real picture. We played really, really long match with the difficult rallies. Once he gets into the rhythm, he's one of the toughest opponents on this surface.   
 I was aware of that. He had the really slow start, but that was probably because of the fact we waited for a long match before us.  
  
  Q. That was the toughest match so far. Do you feel you're improving with each match?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, I do. I feel more confident the more wins I have under my belt. It's logical. I did have a slow start on the tournaments before Australian Open, but this was my priority.   
 I'm really happy that things are going well with the racquet as well. I'm feeling much better on the court mentally and physically and game-wise. Hopefully I can continue in the same way in the quarterfinals.   
  
  Q. These late nights are becoming something of a tradition at the Australian Open. What's your experience this year?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You have this unique excitement when you play the night matches. It's really fun. You know, you make the history by going into the 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.   
 But, then on the other hand, I don't think that this really benefits a lot of people that we played that late. Hopefully in the future we can make some compromise.  
  
  Q. Did you and Marcos see and talk about how late the women's match was going when you were waiting?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We had quite a lot fun before the match. In the locker room we were cheering that the match finishes a bit earlier, but it didn't.   
 It's all in the good way.   
  
  Q. What about in the quarterfinals? Andy hasn't had quite the time on the court that you have. Will that suit you?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, depends. I don't think it's going to hurt me a lot physically that I had a long matches. Actually, I will try to use it in my favor.   
 Physically I feel good. I had very good preparational (sic) period of a couple of weeks during the off-season, and good matches in Sydney.   
 So I feel physically very fit to play best-of-five every two days. I think I'm going to have enough time to recover and wait for the great on counter against Roddick.   
  
  Q. When do you play, Tuesday or Wednesday?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know. You can get this information anywhere.  
  
  Q. I thought you know that's why I ask.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No.  
  
  Q. Were you having problems your knee or some part of your leg?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No, actually, I had trouble with blisters this couple of the matches here in the Australian Open because I -- it's a big heat, and I've changed a little the shoes. That's what usually happens in the start of the season when you don't play matches for a long time, for a month or two.   
 Then you start moving fast again and feeling the intensity of the official match, but it's nothing serious.
