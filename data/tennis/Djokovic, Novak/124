N. DJOKOVIC/D. Dzumhur
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with English questions, please.  Over here.
Q. So, Novak, congratulations and Happy New Year again.  Is it a good game to start the year so fast and easy?  I remember yesterday you were talking about Damir Dzumhur and you told me that he's one of fastest players.  And then today you get the fastest game today.  So, this easy game, if we can say that, it will give you space to have a good rest before tomorrow?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Look, results-wise, it did and time-wise it did look quite comfortable.  I don't think it's nice and fair to say it's easy because I have respect for Dzumhur.  But he did not play at his best.  He made a lot of unforced errors.  He was nervous to be on the court.  Center court is different with the atmosphere and ambiance.  I still think that he can play better than he did in tonight's match and also in our last match in Paris.
So I definitely wish him all the best.  And he comes from Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is a neighboring country to my country.  And, obviously, we speak the same language and I get along very well with him and he is a very nice guy.
That was kind of the circumstances tonight for him and on my side I tried to do everything right from the first moment, have a good focus and intensity and not allow my opponent to really feel like he has a chance to get back in the match and I was there basically every game, every point and I was happy the way that I was playing.
And I'm happy I didn't spend too much time on the court.  I've had plenty of time on the court in Abu Dhabi and now with doubles yesterday, so I'm looking forward to continuing playing this way.
Q. Novak, two of the top seeds lost today in the first round.  Do you think that the draw is more open for you, maybe, you are the best player in the world, the top seed here?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: The draw is the draw.  I'm going to play as I'm winning along.  I'm going to play every day against someone, so whether it's a seeded player or not, it doesn't change much to me.
So, of course, having the first week of the year obviously that causes a lot of, you know, surprise wins or losses that we have seen in the past because it's the opening week of the season and players are still a bit rusty and engaging their engine so to say and maybe lower-ranked players have, you know, just more liberty to go through the shots and play a great match that they and - it happens.
But that's why I really want to start off well this tournament, which I have tonight, and I will just try to focus on my own game.
Q. You talked about rustiness of other players.  The headline tonight is that you won in 55 minutes.  Do you think that for you it's good that it might resound to your rivals for the Australian and other majors this year that when they...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I hope the news travels! (Novak laughs).
Q. It's a cliche to say it is a warning to them, or you're putting down a marker, but does it mean something to you that that happens?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You do follow, especially what your top rivals are doing, who are they playing, watch highlights.  Of course, this is - as much as this is your passion and love, it's also your work.  You have to do your homework and understand where everybody stands and how everybody plays, how everybody feels.  And I consider that part of my homework, so I'm sure that they are following what I do as well.
