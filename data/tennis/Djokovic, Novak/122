N. DJOKOVIC/N. Basilashvili
4-6, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. You played six sets today, almost three hours on court.  You have spent almost three hours on court.  You have very tough opponent tomorrow that didn't give any chance to Stan.  Do you think he will use the fact you might be tired against you tomorrow?  Are you exhausted?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm fine, I'll be fine.
Q. It was a difficult match again.  Are you happy with...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Which one?  Singles?
Q. Singles, sorry.  Are you happy with your tennis today and this week?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I feel I have a gear or two up still.  I can still get to one or two levels up, but I thought under the circumstances I managed to find a way to win against a player that is hitting the ball very fast and just being very aggressive and it's hard to predict where the ball is going to go with a player like him.
So you kind of have to be, you know, be alert at the same time when the chances present to take the control.  Easier said than done because he was really hitting the ball fast from back of the court so he was not giving me a lot of time to manipulate, maneuver from back of the court so many times I find myself in the defense.  You know, I managed to get a win which is what matters.
Q. Can we have a word about Bautista Agut for tomorrow?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Tough opponent for sure.  He hasn't dropped a set this week.  He played great today against Stan.  I saw the match.  Just very consistent.  Doesn't miss much.
In conditions like this, it's quite suitable to him, I would say.  He gets to many balls and he makes you play, makes you play.  That's his strength.  He puts always an extra ball in the court.
Q. You played with your brother Marko this week.  Can you repeat this experience during the year?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: The way we played actually why not.  We just got off the court so it's really tough.  We both wanted to win badly and it hurts, you know, this kind of loss.
After being match point up and David and Herbert are fantastic players, they blew us off the court in the first set and we managed to come back and to play at such a high level for us, I mean was amazing.  It was a great feeling.
Obviously, it is disappointing to be so close and not to be able to win, but again at the same time it was amazing experience.  I'm very grateful to live it with my brother.
