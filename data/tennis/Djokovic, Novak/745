N. DJOKOVIC/M. Fish
  6-1, 0-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You said on court you were jet lagged and it was cold. Does that kind of sum up the match tonight?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you know, I definitely had a couple of tiring weeks behind me with Davis Cup and Dubai, so I was really skeptical if I'm going to be able to physically recover from all of that, including the jet lag and time zone change. 
 You know, I was happy with the way I moved today. I had a lot of ups and downs. Second set, that was just forget about it, I guess.
 You know, overall, first and third set were quite okay, so hopefully I can get some good night's sleep and get ready for the next one.

 Q. When you lose a second set like that, what does it tell you about your fighting spirit almost that you fought in the third set, or is it tempting to just say, oh, it's a bad week? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, look, when he broke me second time, he served well for 5-love. From that moment on, I was already thinking about the third set. 
 So I tried to, you know, analyze what I need to do to make my game a little bit better in order to win.

 Q. You're sounding very clogged up. Is it a cold or allergies or what? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Allergies, yeah. 

 Q. Other than that, is that the only thing that you can think of that's negative?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't want to sound like I have excuses. It's like these things happen. We're all humans. It's all part of us. We drink water, we eat food like everybody else. 
 But we have to get used to the conditions much quicker than anybody else, and naturally body itself requires, you know, a lot more days than we actually have.
