7-5, 6-7, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Crushing defeat to end the year.  Just talk us through that basically.  You must have thought you were in it having saved those four match points in the second set?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, yeah, I mean, what he did from 0-4 in the third-set tiebreaker was just unreal.  I mean, I don't think I played bad.  Actually, I made both of my first serves, actually all of my first serves.  4-1, 4-2, 4-5, you know, 4-6, I made all first serves.
He just crushed the ball.  Everything went in from both corners, and he played couple of very short slices, you know, angles.
Yeah, I mean, what can you do?  I mean, I was in a driver's position at 4-Love.  I thought, you know, I was very close to win it.  Yeah, I mean, he just took it away from me.
But he deserved it, because he just went for it and everything worked.
Q. Do you see that match as a potential warmup of you if you two go all the way again next year in Australia?  Can he challenge you for the No. 1 spot?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't know.  It's too far away to talk about it now.
Q. You won four titles in a row here leading into 2015.  Haven't won in London since.  I just wondered if you felt there is any particular reason for that?  It's just quite strange you played so well here years ago and haven't won a title in the last years.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it happens, I guess.  Can't win them all.
Q. Yeah, I was wondering what's the difference the way Dominic played the tiebreaks?  He played very aggressive.  Once again, you didn't give him any free points, but what was the difference in the tiebreaks, do you think?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I mean, you know, the difference was that when you hit full power and everything goes in, it just goes in.  When you hit full power, sometimes it goes out.  So simple.
He, just as I said, he did everything right from 0-4.  I mean, I have to put my hats down and say, Congratulations.
I actually didn't play bad any point after 4-Love.  I thought I was, every point, I was in it.  I did hit the ball, I was not pushing it, but he just, yeah, he smashed it and he just played great.
Q. Thinking about 2020 and this news about Australian Open playing that date in April, for that date is calculated about the application of the vaccine...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't understand anything you asked me.  2020, Australian Open, April?  Sorry.  I don't get it.
Q. Yes.  Thinking about 2020, about the new dates of Australian Open...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   2021, you mean?  Not 2020.
Q. 2021, yes, sorry.  I was talking about the application of the vaccine.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   The what?  Sorry?  Vaccine?
Q. Vaccine, vaccine, yes, the vaccine.  If it's not a requirement for enter the countries of who participate the tournament, would you apply it?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Apply what?  Sorry.  I don't understand.
Q. Vaccine, the vaccine for COVID.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't know anything about vaccine to go into Australia.  I have not heard about that at all.  And I have not heard about Australia being in April.
Actually, Australia is in January, so I haven't heard anything about vaccine, to be honest.  So I don't think it's required.
Q. Those dates are speculation by one person in Australia.  Just how relieved are you now?  Obviously very disappointed with this result, but how are you relieved that the 2020 season is over?  And what will you do to start preparation for 2021?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I'm not relieved.  I mean, I enjoy playing tennis.  Why would I be relieved?
It's just disappointing to finish the season with a loss like this, but at the same time, you know, I enjoy competing.  I enjoy traveling.  Enjoy doing what I love.
Yeah, let's see what 2021 brings.  I'm not sure.  You know, obviously Australia is around the corner in a way, but no one can enter before January so it's going to be, you know, a bit longer preseason I think for all of us wherever we are based.  Then let's see from there.
