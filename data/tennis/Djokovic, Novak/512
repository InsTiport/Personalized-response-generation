R. NADAL/N. Djokovic
  6‑4, 3‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What was the turning point, according to you?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It was very close match.   So, I mean, there were very few points that decided the winner.   Can't really pick one moment. 
I had my chances.   He had his chances.   You know, I guess at the end he played better. 

Q.   Thoughts on the odd moment when you were hit. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, we sorted it out in the end, so...   It's all fine. 

Q.   How would you analyze your match, your performance? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I thought I could have played better.   In certain moments I made a lot of unforced errors when I had chances, you know, in the rallies.   A lot of easy forehands that I missed. 
You can't afford that when you're playing against Rafa.   You know he doesn't give you many chances. 

Q.   Do you think you should change something in your game that improve tonight?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't understand the question. 

Q.   Do you think you should change some tactic for tonight?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It was a very close match.   It could have gone either way.   I can't really answer that question. 

Q.   Outside of the tiebreak, the level of playing was pretty incredible. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, whenever we play against each other, it's always a thrilling match for crowd to see, very high level.   We are both competing at the high level.   We both want to win these matches. 
This time he got the best out of this match. 

Q.   In the beginning of the final set tiebreak, Rafa played a great backhand passing shot cross‑court.   Did you feel a little bit more tentative trying to come to the net afterwards? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   You know, as I said, I had my chances.   First four or five points he just played great in tiebreak.   He made a big difference there.   It was too late to come back. 

Q.   Was the crowd at all bothering you tonight?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, no.   I thought the crowd was fantastic.   We both had support.   It was an amazing atmosphere to play in. 

Q.   When Nadal hit you with the ball, you seemed to be a little bit upset. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, at that moment, because it was an important point. 
But look, you know, I don't think he meant to go for my head.   We sorted it out, as I said, in the end. 

Q.   Seems like Nadal was reading your serve really well.   Did you do anything to try to change that? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I made a lot of double‑faults, which I couldn't explain, the first set especially.   After that I served well in the important moments. 
But, yeah, he returned quite well.   He was staying closer to the line and picking up the returns really, really well.
