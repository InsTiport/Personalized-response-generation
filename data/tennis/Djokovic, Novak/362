  6‑4, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. How fresh were you today after that long day that ended up late in the evening yesterday?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I was feeling fine. I've done everything I could, considering the time that I had between the two matches, to recover and get ready for this one. I had a long break after Wimbledon, so rested, got myself prepared for the hard court season.   
Entering the doubles tournament this week, I knew that I'm going to potentially have this particular situations. But I was enjoying, enjoying playing doubles. Unfortunately we lost today in semis. But had a lot of fun sharing the court with Janko. Also helped my singles game. Glad I reached the semifinal.   
   
 Q. Can you explain the incident about the weed. Would have had to have been the first time that ever happened to you, wasn't it?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was yesterday, as well. I'm glad that I wasn't the only one who was feeling it. Yesterday in the doubles match, today again. Somebody's really enjoying his life around the tennis court.   
   
 Q. When they didn't do anything about it, did it annoy you?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I think it stopped after a while. Whoever it was, I think he spent all his ash, and he was probably on the seventh sky somewhere (smiling). I felt I was playing better as I was inhaling (laughter).   
   
 Q. How happy are you with your level today compared to your level yesterday? How satisfied are you with the way you played?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I played better than I did yesterday. But still I need to get at least a level or two higher tomorrow in order to win the title. I know that.   
But I also have the experience of playing in finals of the biggest events. I've played Nishikori and Murray many, many times before on this particular surface. So I'm going to be obviously motivated to win the title as much as my opponent, whoever it is tomorrow.   
Hopefully I'll be able to rise to the occasion and play the best match of the week.   
   
 Q. I hate to ask the obligatory Canadian question, especially when it's about Daniel. At the age of 43, what do you make of what he's continuing to accomplish while he continues to annoy everybody in the locker room?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, continues to annoy me. I never won against him in doubles. He's keeping that clean sheet against me.   
He's an example of somebody that has so much passion for the sport, can be a real role model for many young tennis players coming on the tour. Regardless of him playing doubles or singles, he's out there every day practicing, working, working in the gym, recovering, being fully committed to the sport at the age of 43.   
I mean, that says enough about who he is and how he approaches the sport. So from that point of view I respect him a lot.   
We are born in the same city, so that makes it more special. I'm just glad to see how he keeps on going and winning more and more.   
   
 Q. You mentioned you enjoyed the doubles, with Nestor as well. Do you see yourself down the road, when you play less singles, I'm not saying you are old, but playing more doubles?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Only if Danny coaches me, starts traveling with me. Maybe I'll play with him in about 15 years. He'll still be playing (laughter).   
I don't know, I don't know. Obviously I do enjoy doubles, more so because I don't play doubles too often. So whenever I participate in the doubles tournament, I'm very pumped up, I'm very focused and determined to play well.   
Particularly this week, because I played with Janko, who has had really a tough two years. Hasn't played many matches. Was injured. Many different injuries. He hasn't really been finding his form, more so his health. He was two years top‑10 player in the world. We're very good friends. We know each other for a lifetime.   
I enjoyed winning also with him on the court because I know that's going to help his confidence, make him feel good on the court, as well.   
   
 Q. After the match yesterday, which got a little bit tricky in the second set, you knew today you were facing Chardy. You were 9‑0 against him. Is there a different approach or extra comfort that you get from that because you've had such a dominant career against him?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Of course, I mean, if you have a good head‑to‑head record against the player you're facing, it gives you a little bit of a mental edge or an advantage coming into the court. So that's what I felt.   
In fact, crucial moments, that's maybe also what helped to get the right shots at the right time.   
   
 Q. Could you give us your thoughts on both players you could face tomorrow.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Nishikori has been playing some of the best tennis I've seen him play, honestly. Washington, he won the title. Coming in here, winning against Nadal, who was in form, in straights sets, pretty impressive tennis.   
He's very quick. He's probably playing one of the fastest baseline games on the tour. So it's not easy to play against him because he constantly puts pressure on your game.   
On the other hand, Andy, who is all‑around player, very complete, has been somebody that has been around for so many years. He knows how to play in the big stage, in the big matches.   
It's going to be interesting to see because they're both playing well. Whoever I play against, I know what I need to do, and that's playing my best in order to win. So I need to get myself ready.   
   
 Q. The trainer came out twice for your arm. Is it any concern? It wasn't before, but is it now?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's on and off this week. It's been bothering me a little bit more than usual. But I've been playing with it. With certain treatments and time that I spend on the table with my physio, ATP physios, it does help me to play. So I don't think it's a big concern for tomorrow.   
   
 Q. You're not going to bring it every day. You know that. You mentioned yesterday that the level wasn't where it had been the day before. What changed today to really take the level to another level?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it also has a lot to do with your opponent, who you're playing against. Gulbis is a very unpredictable player. He serves very big. He's prone to make a lot of mistakes in his game, but then also he can make a lot of winners. He gets a lot of balls back in play. He has a great return. He's very talented. He's not afraid to go for his shots.   
You kind of always, you know, are undecisive [sic] whether you want to defend or get in the court because you don't know what's coming your way. That's why I was a bit out of your comfort zone yesterday.   
But today Chardy was a little bit more predictable. I knew what I was expecting, so that's why I felt a little more comfortable.  
   
 Q. Regardless of the results tomorrow, can you say that you enjoy Montréal?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Very much. Always.
