  6‑2, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What happened in your eyes out there?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, first of all, congratulations to Jo.   He played some great tennis.   Served very well.   He was obviously the better player on the court.  
I, on the other hand, haven't played even close to what I intended before going to the court.   Just nothing was going.   No baseline, no serve, no return.  
So just generally very bad day, very poor performance.   Couldn't do much.  
   
 Q.   Obviously a lot of tennis for you in the last 24 hours.   How much did fatigue possibly play a factor in what happened today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, I didn't feel exhausted or something like that if you're referring to the matches I played yesterday.   It's just that I ‑‑ not even in the first match I was not feeling very comfortable on the court.   I wasn't hitting the ball clean and a lot of unforced errors.   
It's maybe lack of matches on this surface, and, well, it takes time.   Let's just say it's going to be better, I'm sure.   The worst cannot be from this.   I'm going to practice the next few days and try to get as much hours as I can playing points as well on the practice courts and get ready for Cincinnati.   
Obviously I'm disappointed that I lost this early in the tournament, but on the other hand I had a tough draw yesterday and today again.   Tsonga, who played in a very high level, great quality shots, all I can say is well done and I have to move on.  
   
 Q.   How concerned are you about your performances against GaÃ«l and against Jo today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it's now so quickly after the match.   Obviously I feel disappointment, and, you know, just trying to understand what I did wrong.  
I'm going to analyze the matches that I played these two days, speak with the team, and improve.   That's it.  
The confidence is the hardest thing to get but easiest thing to lose.   Matches like this can really, you know, play with your mind.   But in the end of the day, it's not the first match and last match that I lost in my career.  
I know what is the next step, and I know what I need to do.   I know that already tomorrow is a new day, and I forget about what happened and move on.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel coming into Toronto that your preparation was maybe not as good as you would have wanted?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I prepared for over two weeks.   I played a lot of tennis on the hard courts and arrived early here.   Toronto is the same like all the years.   I cannot find an excuse now, lack of preparation, so forth.   
I thought I had quality practices with good players prior to this event, but it just happened.   You know, I cannot keep on trying to find that little reason why this happened.   I mean, it's just one of those bad days.   
Sometimes you can find a way to get out of the trouble; sometimes you cannot.   Today it wasn't to be.  
   
 Q.   At what time in the match, when in the match today did you know you really didn't have it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Very early.   I mean, when I lost a break in the first set and 1‑All already, a couple of unforced errors, and just only one break point.   He aced me the last game.  
So just from the beginning till the end, the only game that I felt great was the first game of the match.   So I'll try to memorize that for the next days (smiling).   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your first loss as a married man?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I have one win and one loss, not bad, 50% of success (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised that you couldn't turn it back around today and kind of switch the momentum back to your side?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I was hoping I can after the first set was done.   I encouraged myself even on 2‑5 down and he was serving for the match.   
Of course I fight.   I'm competing.   I'm here for a reason.   I arrived to give my best on the court, and my best obviously changes day to day depending on how you feel, and you can't always be at the top of your, peak of your performance.  
So that was the case today.   I did try to pull out the match and tried to bring out my best game, but, you know, he neutralized my shots.   He played tactically very well with great power from his serve and forehand, and it was nothing I could do.  
   
 Q.   Are you worried at all about the No. 1 ranking and defending points and gaining more points coming into the US Open?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, I'm not really thinking about this, no.
