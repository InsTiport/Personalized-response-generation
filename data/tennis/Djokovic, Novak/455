N. DJOKOVIC/G. Garcia‑Lopez
  4‑6, 6‑3, 6‑1

Q.   How did you get out of that hole?   Guillermo was playing well.   Conditions were difficult. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, conditions today were quite different from previous two days, two matches that I played in this tournament.   Definitely a bit slower conditions suited his game. 
But, you know, I allowed him to lead in this match.   He was very solid.   I made a lot of unforced errors.   I didn't keep my patience. 
I changed the tactics in the middle of the second set, managed to regroup and find the right approach.   After that it was a great performance. 

Q.   Now you play Roger again.   You had a couple of great matches this season.   What do you expect from this one? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, nothing more, nothing less than a tough one for both of us.   It's always a challenge to play Roger.   He's been playing really good tennis the last couple of months.   Since the beginning of year I think he plays much better than he did the whole last season. 
Today he also had a tough one against Tsonga.   So we'll see.   We both were tested today.   In order to win against Roger, I'm going to have to be on top of my game.   I know that.   Hopefully I will. 

Q.   We know your wrist has been bothering you.   How does it feel today?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It feels good.   It feels good.   It's been progressing each day.   Hopefully tomorrow it won't bother me.
