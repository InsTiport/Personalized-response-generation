 N. DJOKOVIC/P. Mathieu
  6-1, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
  Q. You seem to have reached an agreement with your new racquet.  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes. Well, it's always good to win and then things go a little bit smoother from then on.  
 But still, of course, not 100% comfortable with it. But it takes time, you know, mentally to make that switch as well. I'm confident about the future.  
  
  Q. How long were you able to practice with it before?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Couple weeks. Not really much. I been -- it's a hard, very hard thing to do. Probably the most difficult decision in tennis, switching the racquet when things are going good and with the way I finished the season.  
 Then I decided even before that to change the racquet, so I was testing for a couple months here and there. But Head and Wilson are the two biggest companies in the sport, and they have some differences. They try to make the racquet as best as possible, you know, to my wishes.  
 They did a good job. They're really trying. So even though the racquet is the same practically, it takes time mentally to be able to get used to something new.  
  
  Q. How much more comfortable are you with it this week than last week?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: A lot more. A lot more. I didn't have a lot have practice before my match in Brisbane and didn't get used to the conditions, jet lag and a lot of things involved.  
 Here it's a different story, so very happy to get a couple matches under my belt here. Hopefully I can be ready for the most important event here in Australia.  
  
  Q. There was a little bit of criticism about how you played in Brisbane. How do you react to that?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Look, it's normal that if you lose everybody has to say something about it. Everybody has a right to say whatever they want. I know what I do, and I'll try to do it as best as I can and practice hard and try to make good results.  
  
  Q. It was very hot on court today.  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was very hot. I think this day was the hottest since I came to Australia.  
  
  Q. Ever?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Not ever, just this year. But they're the conditions that you have. You have to get used to them, because it's the same for everybody.  
  
  Q. Seems like you wanted to get off the court as quick as possible today.  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, as I said after the match, it's always good to win easy on a day like this.  
  
  Q. Are you happy with the way you played today?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes. I served well throughout most of the match. I was more or less happy with my consistency thought the match. I wasn't really having a lot of ups and downs. It was one high level of the game, and really didn't give him any chance to think that he can come back.  
  
  Q. When it's as hot as this, is it more difficult to keep concentration?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it is. Everybody is trying to keep their focus 100% throughout the match, but it's not possible. I mean, everybody is human and normal. Everybody is -- reacts on different kind of things.  
 Of course, it's absolutely normal that you have some ups and downs during the match and during the tournament, but if you're able to overcome that then you are a champion.  
  
  Q. Thoughts on playing Ancic next.  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We played a couple of times before, and I know him really well, like he knows me. He's been very unlucky with his health in the last couple of years. That's too bad, because he's a great, great player and great talent, and a great, great person as well. Good friend of mine.  
 But I'm happy that he's coming back. He's -- looking at the results he's been playing really well here and he feels comfortable, so I expect a tough match.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like Mathieu was affected by the heat today?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Think we all are, so...  
 I think we are we all are.  
  
  Q. More than you?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know really. You have to ask him.  
  
  Q. Players often say it's harder to defend a title. How do you see your prospects going into the Australian Open?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Look, I know -- I'm aware of the pressure and expectations that are behind me as the defending champion.  
 But, look, on the brighter side, I will have big challenge in front of me. Look, I will have to get used to that if I want to stay in the top of the men's tennis.  
 Hopefully I'm going to be a couple of times in this situation as a defending champion.
