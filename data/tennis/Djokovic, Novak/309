A flash interview with:   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Novak, could you tell us what the problem was.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's an eye problem.  I have had it ever since I arrived to Dubai.  Started with an infection and then severe allergy.  That's what I was told.   
It's gotten worse in the last two days, unfortunately.  It's the first time that I have had such a problem with the eye.  It was unfortunate.  It was ultra sensitive today, the lights, and just wasn't to be.   
I'm really sad to finish the tournament this way.  I apologize of course -- I apologize to all the people who came in to watch the match.  I apologize to the tournament director and everybody, you know, who came out to support me.  You know, I'm really sad to end out the tournament this way, but I was forced to.   
 Q.  It's a very sad end to a great run of so many finals.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, yeah.  Look, this is the least of my thoughts in the moment.  You know, I just hope that this problem with the eye will fade away in the next couple of days.  I got a lot of important events waiting for me in the next period.  Of course Davis Cup back home and Indian Wells, Miami, and of course clay court season.   
So, you know, physically I feel fine.  Mentally, as well.  It's just something that I hope that is gonna, you know, vanish after several days, but in contrary, it was getting worse.  I have to deal with it.   
 Q.  Is it both eyes or one eye?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's both.  It started with the right but the right one is worse but it's both now.   
 Q.  What has the tournament doctor said to you?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, as I said, it's the same thing that I explained already.  There was not much that they could do on the court basically when I invited them down.   
 Q.  You were unplayable?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah.  For me today was just -- you know, of course I want to wish Feliciano the best and congratulate him for playing well throughout the tournament.   
I don't want to take anything away from his performance tonight.  But, you know, it didn't feel right in any way for me today.  I know that already from the very morning today, and the practice session was just awful, as well.   
Yeah, I tried.  You know, in the end of the day, I tried and I hope that people will recognize that.   
 Q.  Is it related to your contacts?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I was instructed not to wear contact lenses because of the fact that lenses are actually not helping this situation actually.  They are making it worse.  So I was wearing contacts only on the match yesterday night.  And today, other than that, I was not wearing them at all.   
That's all.  You know, that's all I can say.  If I had a third eye I would, you know, play the tournament.  I'm sorry that I'm talking to you now with my sunglasses at 10:00 p.m.  It's not a usual sight, but that's what it is and just hoping it's going to get better.
