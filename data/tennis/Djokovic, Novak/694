 N. DJOKOVIC/T. Berdych
  6-7, 6-2, 4-2 (ret.) 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: What can I say?   
  
  Q. Hard afternoon's work, wasn't it?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was -- I don't know. I don't know how to explain today's match really. In one word: catastrophe. I think the match overall and my game, it was the worst I think match this year for me, worst performance.   
 But I managed to get a win, so I guess that's what matters.  
  
  Q. Looked a bit sluggish in the first set.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, you know, I hate when I play this way, but I was still trying to fight within myself and try to stay focused and at least hold the serve.   
 The serve was really good, so at least one of the elements in my game was good today. I could rely on that shot. Both of us, we served well in the first set. You know, you didn't have a chance on the return:   
  
  Q. First set, sitting and watching seemed as hot as anything in Australia this year. What was it like for you out there?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As hot?   
  
  Q. Uh-huh.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No, I didn't feel the heat that much. I felt the heat with speed of the ball actually; speed of the ball was unbelievable. I mean, the balls became potatoes. You could not hit two balls in front of the baseline. I mean, it was terrible.   
 Just as soon as the sun came down a little bit around 4:00, the tennis was better. There was more rallies, more variety. So I think for the next year they should move the first semifinal at least for two hours later.  
  
  Q. You had one night match, but you don't have to play day after day in that kind of heat.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah. To be honest, I already feel the big improvement playing in the heat. I felt it in Australia that I was feeling good, not feeling the heat effect too much as I had in the past.  
 Here, today was a very hot day. I felt great on the court. Felt great meaning I could have gone the distance, you know. Physically I felt well; game-wise I felt like a baby.  
 But, you know, tomorrow it's a night match. I guess it's going to be a little bit slower conditions, so I look forward to it.  
  
  Q. Is there anything you've done particularly to help with that? It was a big problem for you in the past, wasn't it?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, I have done some things that I cannot talk about. (Smiling.) But I have worked on it, believe me. I know it's been an issue for me health-wise. Most of the tournaments we play we play during the day. We follow the good weather. I mean, we always go play in the summer, summer of Australia, summer of Europe, summer of the States. So you need to be ready to go the distance.  
 I felt the consequences of not managing to hold on to the heat in the past, but now I can confident say it's better.  
  
  Q. Was it a physical thing or a mental thing?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Both.   
  
  Q. Feliciano commented the other day you are the quickest mover from the baseline on the tour now, ahead of Andy Murray. What do you think of that?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm flattered to hear that I'm the quickest mover. I've been working a lot on my footwork.   
 But I don't know. It's not only about moving quick, it's about being balanced and setting up for shots. So I think Nadal is still up there. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. If you do play Roger in the final, how much of an advantage will it be to you the way you played him in Australia in particular?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Quite different conditions. In Australia really slow conditions, slow surface, ball bounces a bit higher. So it was more suitable to me.  
 Here -- but, still, I've played well over the years in this center court, especially in the night matches. So as I said, I look forward to it. We played many times. In last four, five months, we played five matches or something. It was always very close.   
 You know, I can expect a really good match. It's good for the tournament to have a Federer/Djokovic final obviously. It will be a big challenge.  
  
  Q. I tried to ask you this question yesterday and you diplomatically answered it. I'll ask it in another way.  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Really?  
  
  Q. How much of an advantage would it be for Roger, in that your final will start at 7:00, quarter past 7:00, and he's played every single match at night?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As I told and I'll tell you again, I've played in the night and day before. How much advantage it would be, I don't think it's going to be a major advantage, because it's not like I never played in the night in this tournament.   
 But maybe, you know. We'll see. We'll see tomorrow if I have my ass kicked after an hour I will say... (Laughing.)   
  
  Q. I might ask you again.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You might ask it again. (Laughter.) Okay. Don't write this, please. She's all the time... I cannot even say a word. (Laughing.)  
Q. Do you come into this match with Roger with any kind of psychological advantage having beaten him in Australia? You beat him pretty well.   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, but it's only one match. I lost maybe three times before that to him. So I don't think that he will think too much about that match, because he hasn't lost that often in the last five, six years in Grand Slams.  
 We know each other really well. We know each other's game. Mostly in last three, four years we had matches in semis or finals. It's always high stake and big challenge.   
 That's what it's all about. If you want to be the best, you have to win against the best.  
  
  Q. What was the more dramatic and meaningful win over Roger, New York or Melbourne?  
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Meaningful, I don't know, because they were both really, really meaningful and important. But more dramatic was US Open, definitely.
