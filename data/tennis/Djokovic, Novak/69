N. DJOKOVIC/D. Kudla
6-3, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Two sets to love. How is going the shoulder?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Good. It's almost pain-free. Has a little bit of pain, but I'm really pleased with the way it went.
Q. You said you suffered the start of this problem a couple of weeks ago. How did you get hurt? What is the diagnosis?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Forgive me, I'm not going to talk about it.
Q. You said you didn't practice before this match.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah.
Q. Will you follow that throughout the rest of the tournament?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Depends. Today the situation was much, much better than the last match, so we'll see tomorrow.
Q. There was a video circulating online during your warmup where you confronted a fan. Can you explain what happened there?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Just had a little chat (smiling).
Q. On a different subject. Tomorrow night the women's No. 1, Naomi Osaka, plays Coco Gauff. What are your thoughts about Coco Gauff and the opportunity of that matchup with Naomi Osaka?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, Coco is definitely a new superstar of tennis. It's great to see her fighting spirit, her intensity. She's only 15. She brings so much maturity in her game for such a young age. It's very impressive.
Definitely a fan of her and fan of Naomi, as well, what she has done in the last couple of years.
It's going to be really interesting because they're both very likable players and girls. They have a lot of fans. It's going to be definitely a great match to see.
Q. The incident beforehand, you said 'I'll find you' afterwards, 'I'll come find you'?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: To have a drink. I liked the guy. I'm going to buy him a drink.
Q. What did he say to you?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: We'll keep it between us. But he definitely helped me. He doesn't even know, but he did help me.
Q. In the match you were pretty fired up early on with the crowd, as well.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I was. Night sessions, New York, crowd gets into it. A couple guys that had a couple of drinks more than I guess they were supposed to. But it was all good after.
Q. Is it safe to say that during the practice session, the fan said something about a rival?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, if you have the video, you'll hear I guess.
As I said, I'm not going to talk about it. I think he did me a favor. Even maybe he didn't want to do me a favor, he did me a favor, big favor.
Q. On the shoulder, you were in quite a bit of distress during your last match. In order to be able to get out there today and play, did you have some sort of pain-killing injection or other treatment?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As I said, I would appreciate if you respect me not talking about it in details. I mean, I understand you guys want to know. I made a decision not to get into details, not to speak about it. Please understand me.
I'm very glad with the way it went. I am able to play. That for me is a huge blessing today because it was probably the complete opposite two days ago. I did not practice yesterday, that's true. I did a lot of things in the last few days to be able to play.
