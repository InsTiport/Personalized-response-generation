N. DJOKOVIC/T. Berdych
  7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR: Questions in English. 

Q. Are you happy you came through in two sets? It was tough. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, I definitely didn't want to go into the third. But again, credit to Berdych for playing on a high level, pushing me in the back of the court with his depth on the shots, especially from the forehand side. I thought he did very well. 
We both served high percentage and got a lot of free points there. I thought I returned decent, made him play an extra shot, but his quality of the first shot was really good. Just coming, you know, stepping into the court, coming to the net, taking his chances every time the ball was short. 
And, so, yeah, was decided in tiebreaks two times, and very few points, really, decided a winner today. Could have gone a different way. He had set point in the first set, as well. In the important moments, I just managed to hang in there, you know, just stay tough. That's what I'm most proud of. 

Q. Do you ever get the impression that he is playing against the reputation as well as the opponent in that because you're world No. 1, because you have won so many matches this year, he has to go for a bit extra which helps your strategy?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, depends how you look at it. Yeah, it does help maybe, in a way, knowing I have a very good record against him. But, you know, he's also stepping in the court and not having too much to lose. That makes him concentrate even harder, and then makes him play his best. So from that perspective it's not that great coming to the court as a favorite. 
But again, this is what you expect and you have to be ready for when you're playing against established top‑10 player, someone as top quality as Tomas Berdych, that it can be decided with a few points, especially if he serves as well as he did today. 
So even as well as I felt my return in the entire season, you know, I think today, you know, it was not only about his first serve, but first shot, as well. 
It was a really tough match, a real battle that went to the last point. But, you know, I'm just glad I managed to stay calm in the important moments and pull it through. 

Q. According to the ATP this is the first time of your career that you win a match without breaking the serve of your opponent. That's an incredible stat. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Really? I was not aware of that. I honestly doubt that's true, but if it is, shame on me for not being able to break. No, really it's the first time I hear. It's hard to believe I haven't broken anybody ‑‑
THE MODERATOR: The other way around. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: That's my point. Yeah. Great (smiling). 

Q. You took a few tumbles on the court today. Is it tougher to move on this surface this year, or is it a coincidence?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Look, you know, I mean, when somebody's hitting the ball well as Tomas did tonight, it happens that, you know, don't know in which corner he's going to choose. It happens you lose your balance, and, okay, fall. 
I was fighting for the ball, and it happens. It's nothing against the surface. It's just sometimes the movement is such. 

Q. What's the weirdest, most bizarre or most amusing thing that's happened to you this year?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Ah? On the court? 

Q. To do with tennis. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Ah... It's midnight, and... 

Q. Trying to go in a different area. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Let me think about it. I will tell you in London. 

Q. Nadal or Wawrinka next. You know both of them pretty well. What do you expect on these kind of indoor surface now?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Ball bounces high, and we talked a little bit about conditions being slightly slower than previous years, so I think it's quite suitable to Nadal's game, but also Stan's game. 
They both love playing in Paris. They both won Grand Slams in this city. Of course that kind of sensation and awareness when you come to the city where you won Grand Slam, of course it gives you a little bit of confidence. 
So I'm expecting a great match against both of them, whoever I get to play against. Hopefully I will be able to be top of my game, because that's what it's going to be needed.
