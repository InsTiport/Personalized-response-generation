A. RODDICK/N. Djokovic
  6-4, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Your served looked like it was giving you a little bit more problems than usual today. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: The game overall was terrible. Just played a very bad match, even though it was 6-4, 7-5. Every time I need to do play well, I made some mistakes, especially from forehand side, which is my stronger side. 
 Supposed to play more winners than unforced errors. But, you know, bad day I guess.

 Q. You had 20 winners and 29 unforced errors. Was that maybe being too aggressive possibly?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I mean, Andy, he was getting a lot of balls back, but he didn't do anything special. I mean, he was just playing, and he didn't even play any deep balls. 
 He was just kind of making me play an extra shot, and I was making unforced errors from all court. It was just terrible.

 Q. There's been a lot of talk about your physical condition. Was that a factor at all today? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No, not at all.

 Q. Are you happy with your return game? First returns were really low. Was that a function of Andy's placement? You both served about the same speed-wise. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Speed-wise? 

 Q. Yeah. Your returns statistics were low. I was wondering, is that a function of Andy moving the ball around on you?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No. Well, he's a very difficult server, you know. He's one of the best server in the game, so it's hard. Sometimes you got to predict where the ball is gonna go, so you got to move a bit earlier. 
 I returned well in the second set. I returned okay. I had so many chances in the rallies. As I said, so many unforced errors.

 Q. Heading to New York, are you happy with where you're at? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I mean, overall it's been okay two weeks. I know I feel the ball well, I just I guess need to be more stable in the match. I cannot afford so many errors.

 Q. Towards the end of the match, right when you broke Andy almost the next to the last game of the set, then you got broken immediately back, what happened there? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, four mistakes.
