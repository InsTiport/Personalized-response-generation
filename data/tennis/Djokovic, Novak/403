I. KARLOVIC/N. Djokovic
  6‑7, 7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was it surprising a little bit with the weather conditions and everything?   He was able to serve at such a high and consistent level through that match?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I can't say if it was surprising or not, but he served very well.   But you could expect that.   I was coming   into the match knowing that I will have very, very few chances. 
But I was hoping that these conditions and the wind will kind of give me some second‑serve opportunities, but it didn't look this way.

Q.   What do you take out of the week over and above everything else?   Is it the match practice you had?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I had plenty of matches, singles and doubles, I think six in total, so I think it's good.   You know, obviously I wish I could go further at least in singles, but it's the way it is. 
But it was a good week.   I want to thank the organizers of the tournament and everybody for welcoming me and my team, my family.   It was really enjoyable experience.

Q.   What's your program next week?   Is it Melbourne Park the whole time?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it's going to be in Melbourne.   I'm going to be in Melbourne for the Australian Open, just preparing myself and trying to get used to the time change as quick as possible.

Q.   Can you just go through that seventh game in the third set, like why the break and stuff, what happened there?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, in these particular matches, one ball can decide a winner, and that was the case.   Just played a little bit too defensive in that game.   I thought I just, instead of kind of going through the ball, just send the ball back. 
He sliced, he came to the net, and mixed up the pace.   He made unbelievable passing shot, hitting both lines in the corner and what can you say?   That's all.   The match was over. 
Going into the second tiebreaker, 6‑All and other few exchanges, I thought I could do well, better, but, you know, he just came up with the good shots. 

Q.   From a tournament like this, going to Australian Open is completely another story, five sets, another place.   What's in your mind?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, knowing that I have a great record in Melbourne for Australian Open for so many years gives me enough confidence that going into 2015 tournament, I like playing best of five. 
I think in these particular matches against opponent like Karlovic, I think I have more chances.   But, you know, again, it's a Grand Slam.   Everybody has so much motivation to perform their best.   It comes very early in the schedule, in the year.   You have just maybe one or two weeks to kind of warm up for a Grand Slam, and then you have a huge gap to Roland Garros. 
It's not easy, but it's the way it is.   I hope I can be at my best.

Q.   Is the fever gone?   Do you feel fit now?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, still going through my system, but it will be fine for Melbourne.   Obviously I have more than enough time.
