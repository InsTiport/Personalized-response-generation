N. DJOKOVIC/G. Dimitrov   
4-6, 6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Was there a stage in that match where you thought there was a danger of being in serious trouble?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I mean, he started off the match very well.  I knew it from the beginning that it's going to be tough.  That's all I can say.   
 Q.  You seemed to have a problem with your knee during a point.  Can you tell us what happened?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No problem, thankfully.  Just an awkward footing in that point, but all is well.   
 Q.  There was a point in the second set where you were 5-2 up, and you lost one point and you were a bit frustrated.  Does that show that you're determined to play for every point and win it no matter what the score?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I mean, there was probably one or two points the entire match I show my emotions.  I was quite focused.  I think I handled the emotions well.   
But again, I am determined.  That's why I am here.   
 Q.  A lot of players don't like to compare situations, but in a match like this, do you feel there still are moments where you're searching for more playing by instinct?  The backhand as you used to play?  Or do you not ever think at all?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I didn't really -- can you repeat that?  I didn't really understand your point.   
 Q.  Compared to maybe six or eight months ago, do you feel you're playing freely as you used to be or maybe overthinking some choices you wouldn't do before, or...  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I mean, look, you know, you're right.  I don't like to compare because I believe every day is a new day.  So, you know, I'm a different person, I'm a different player each day.  According to that, I'm trying to improve and trying to adjust.   
Of course, there are times when you feel better or less better on the court, but, you know, I think my game is, you know, where it needs to be at the moment.   
Sure, I can play better.  I know that.  But you can't always be 100%.   
 Q.  Tomorrow you play Marin Cilic.  Know him very well.  But you have never lost to him.  He's in great form at the moment.  What could be significant tomorrow?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I mean, as you said, he's in great form.  He has a big serve that he relies on a lot.  He's a big guy.  But he uses the court very well.  He's quite aggressive.  Every short ball he's stepping in.  He plays quite flat.   
He loves, I guess, this kind of very quick conditions.  He won Cincinnati in a very similar, even faster conditions.   
So, yeah, I know what I need to do, and hopefully I'll be able to execute it well tomorrow.   
 Q.  Marin said that despite the bad record he has against you, when he steps on the court it's a new match.  So you start from scratch.  But do you feel like this when you step on the court against someone you have beaten all the time.  
 In the back of the mind, is it still playing at some point?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, certainly there is, to some extent, you know, probably the mental edge over the opponent knowing that you've won, you know, all your previous meetings before, but that, again, doesn't play I guess decisive role in the matches.   
As he said, you know, we both start from 0-0 from the scratch, and also considering his form, you know, can expect a tough one.   
 Q.  The crowd really enjoyed the game today.  How special was it on match point when everyone stood up and cheered you on?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, it was a wonderful moment, obviously.  I'm very grateful to have such a crowd and perform in front of them.  I think they appreciated the battle between Grigor and I today.  I think we both gave what we could.  I think it was a really, really nice match to be a part of.
