THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about what happened in the first game of the second set with your right foot or right heel.   How bad was the scare, if you can call it that?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It was just an awkward movement.   I was in an off‑balance position.   I was running and I made a quick movement that caused a sharp pain at that instant moment.   
But after the match we determined that it's nothing serious, so it's all fine.   
   
 Q.   Could you tell us something about your next match, Fognini.   Did you see the match against Nadal last week?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes, I saw some part of that match.   He was playing great.   But I think that slower surface, little bit higher bounce, suits him better than here.   I think the center court here in Shanghai plays much faster than the one in Beijing.   It's a different ball.   Just the ball stays quite low.   
But again, not taking anything away from his qualities.   He's for a reason where he is now.   He's had a great summer.   He's obviously feeling much more comfortable on the court.   
   
 Q.   Going back to the foot.   Was it on the bone or was it muscular, tendon?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's all good now.   It's all good.   
   
 Q.   Just thinking back a couple of years.   Last time you were getting ready for a Davis Cup final for Serbia, you said that was your primary focus.   Now you've won the Davis Cup.   Is it your primary focus for the rest of the season?   You have the ATP World Tour Finals.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's definitely one of the top priorities till the end of the year.   It's still end of the season, but there's not much left.   There's several tournaments left for me, this included, where I will try to go as far as I can, eventually have an opportunity to get back to No.1.   It doesn't depend only from me.   It depends from Nadal.   
If I continue playing well, that is something that is most important for me.   Now to build that confidence, try to get myself aggressive on the court and get my game back to where it should be, that's the primary focus.   
Of course, tournament‑wise, Davis Cup is right up there.   I mean, we are in finals of Davis Cup.   Masters Cup in London is also very important for me individually.   But for the team and for our nation, having an opportunity to win another Davis Cup title at home is a huge chance.   I mean, God knows if we are going to have this good and successful generation again.   We are trying to grab every opportunity that we are presented.   
You know, this year I sacrificed a lot to play Davis Cup.   I got injured at Davis Cup in America.   But I'm not regretting because it's a very unique and special feeling when you're representing your country.   It makes you very proud.   That's something that nobody can take away from you.   It's one of the nicest feelings that I get to experience on the tennis court, being able to play for Serbia.   
   
 Q.   A lot of tennis players, including yourself, have jumped onto this social media thing.   Can you talk about what it's like using Twitter, Facebook, to engage your fans.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, we are living in the world where the virtual reality, Internet, social networks, different social platforms, are the way to communicate with people who are on the opposite side of the world.   That's how it all started.   But now it's been evolving so much, it is one of the most important ways of communication.   
For somebody like myself, I have a big team of people around me that has suggested for me to be more active in social networks.   I've been trying to keep up.   I've been trying to return the attention and the love that I get, the support from the fans, because there's a lot of people who follow me and who have been sending me a lot of presents, messages of support, in the good and bad moments.   This is something that I have to appreciate.   
   
 Q.   A little bit about the mindset of somebody who is one of the best in their time period.   Obviously everyone realistically knows at some point in time you aren't going to be able to perform at that level day in, day out down the line.   Do you actually ever think of that?   It's totally out of your mind?   How do you deal with that inevitability or don't you?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Everybody reaches the final stages of his or her career at some point.   But I'm not really thinking about it at all.   What I'm trying to do is to enjoy every moment that I can to play this way, to be at the, let's say, peak of my abilities, physical and mental abilities.   As long as it's like that, I'll be playing this sport with a big pleasure.   
   
 Q.   You tweeted a picture of the doorway of the lockers, but you never showed the picture inside.   Can you tell us like how it is inside?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I'm sorry, it's highly confidential information (smiling).   
It's a sofa, a massage chair, massage table, a nice shower.   It's a lot of fun.
