THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It was a bit of a slow start for you in the beginning.   Did you feel you were going to do the job in two sets today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, you know, I always hope I can do it.   You know, it's expected to have ups and downs when you're playing such a talented player and somebody that can play equally well and offensive and defensive style.  
He came up with some great shots today.   I thought that he had really good chances to win the first set.   I managed to stay composed, play well when I needed to, and then, you know, it was much different when you have a set advantage.  
   
 Q.   Were you in total surprise to see Roger Federer to go out of the tournament yesterday with Andy Roddick playing so well?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Oh, it's not a surprise if somebody is playing that well.   You know, you have to hand it to Roddick.   You know, he played well.   He served well.   I haven't watched the whole match.   I watched couple games.   
But, yeah, Roddick is well‑known for his great serve, has lots of experience playing in the big stage, in the big matches, and he knows what he needs to do.   You know, he obviously was very, very motivated to win against a top player.  
   
 Q.   Can you see yourself winning this tournament again this year?   Do you feel healthy to do that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I always believe I can do it.   You know, I have high goals and expectations.   
But I take one match at a time.   Now it's quarterfinals.   Del Potro, Ferrer, it's gonna be very difficult whoever comes out as winner from that match.  
But I'm ready.   You know, I feel physically I'm fresh, fit, you know.   Mentally I'm always there, you know.   I always want to win every match that I play on.   
I have a day off tomorrow, which gives me enough time to prepare for next challenge.  
   
 Q.   You had an incredible last year, 2011 and some good results this year.   How is it defending these titles and following up a fantastic last year going into this year?   How do you keep your motivation?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Motivation is always present.   As long as it's there, you know, I'll be playing this sport with a lot of passion.   I'll be committed to it 100%.  
I've played already many years, you know, on the tour on the top level, and won a lot of major tournaments.  
But I still feel that I have many years in front of me, you know, as long as my health serves me and as long as I'm mentally there, you know, focused, determined, motivated to prove to myself and the others that I can be, you know, one of the top players.   
Um, you know, I'm waking up every morning knowing that I love this sport, and it's something that gives me a lot of energy and drives me to practice hard and always seek to perfect my game as much as I can.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel in the game?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   In the game?   Today?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I felt good.   You know, I had some ups and downs throughout the first set, but it was a good performance.   Tricky opponent, so I'm looking forward to next one.  
   
 Q.   The sort of younger players, a group of players who have yet to properly emerge, how far away do you think they might be from being able to challenge the likes of you?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   You want to name some or...   
   
 Q.   I'd prefer you to name some if you will.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't know who you're referring to.  
   
 Q.   Sort of the Dimitrov, Tomic thing.   You've played a few of these guys from that generation.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   This I a new generation coming up, and it's good for the sport to have a new generations, to see new faces on the tour.   
It's always a challenge for the players that have been around for many years to play them, you know.   And Raonic, for example, has a big serve.   He has the game to be a top 10 player, definitely.  
Dimitrov is very talented.   Tomic, as well.   They all have great potential.   They all have great variety in their styles of the game.   But it all depends how consistent they will be.   
You know, that's always the question, you know, transition from really junior tennis and going through this lower category of the tournaments, and then coming into the world tour ATP circuit which is, you know, we all know, Grand Slams and Masters Series and, you know, 1000, 500 events where all the best players in the world are playing.  
That's where they need to step it up and get some top 10 wins.   It's not gonna be easy.
