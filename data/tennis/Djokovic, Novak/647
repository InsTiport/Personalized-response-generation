THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You're losing too many times.   We're not used to that.   How do you explain it?   Do you know that losing, you have more chances to go to the semifinals now if tonight Ferrer beats Berdych?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I wasn't thinking about the other match.   I cannot influence the other match.   So, as I said before, I try to focus on what I do and winning my match.   
I lost the match, you know, that I think I was on the way to win.   First set I played well.   Opening couple games, his service games, I had a lot of chances.   You know, he made a break and he got to the match.   I think he started playing better.   
But, you know, if this is my last match in the Masters Cup, I'll be happy because I think, at least comparing to the match against Ferrer, I played a little bit better.   
   
 Q.   You could be the first winner ever in the Masters Cup even if you lost two round robin matches.   Never happened before, but you still have a chance.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Good (smiling).   
   
 Q.   When you think back to the early part of this year when you were winning all those matches, is there anything missing now that was there then?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Freshness.   
   
 Q.   It's obvious to all of us for obvious reasons you're not as fresh as you'd like to be.   How is that showing itself in your day‑to‑day life?   Are you sleeping a lot, feeling lethargic?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, to be honest, it's not like I'm sleeping, you know, 15 hours a day.   I'm sleeping normal hours as usual.   It's just that, you know, body says that it's overload.   It's been too much this year.   Obviously mentally I feel a little bit drained, as well.   I just don't have that freshness in my mind for the matches and I don't have these dynamics that I had in all 10 months of the year.   
But this is something to be expected after a year that I had.   And now, if I play here, I play more.   Tomorrow, if I don't, I look forward to go for a much‑needed rest.   
   
 Q.   After getting hurt in the Davis Cup, have you changed even just a tiny bit your service motion?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, I did, because of the injury, the stomach.   A lot of things happened in between.   
But, you know, to be quite honest, I really don't want to go back and see, you know, what I could do better or maybe in order to prepare for this tournament.   Everything happens for a reason.   I believe it's like that.   
I had an unbelievable year.   Nothing can really ruin that.   I will always remember this year as the best of my life.   
I just want to prepare well for 2012.   
   
 Q.   It's a very unique situation.   How do you go about it?   Do you now prepare that you play Roger Federer tomorrow or do you wait for the late match and then start preparing?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I will do more or less everything like I'm playing.   If I have a chance, and I have a decent chance, it can happen.   I think David is playing well, so it can happen that he wins against Tomas, then I would play against Roger tomorrow.   So I will prepare.   
   
 Q.   Yesterday Rafa said he's lost a little bit of his passion for tennis because of the fatigue.   Can you understand how that can happen and has it ever happened to you?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I think you have those days where you don't feel like playing, you don't feel like practicing.   There are tournaments, especially the ones towards the end of the year, you know, where you don't feel as hundred percent fresh mentally, physically, emotionally.   Obviously, that's why he felt that way.   
I understand him, you know, because I can say we are more or less in a similar situation.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you'll do between now and the Australian Open after this tournament?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I will have a couple weeks' rest and preparation.   You know, the usual things.   Nothing in particular will change.   
Comparing to last year, I'm not playing Davis Cup finals, so I will have that extra week which will give me a bit more time to rest, a bit more time to prepare.   I'm not playing any official tournament before Australian Open.   I'm playing a couple exhibition matches in Abu Dhabi, maybe some in Australia, then getting ready for the Melbourne.   
   
 Q.   Will you make any changes to your schedule next year, bearing in mind the Olympics coming up?   Probably that's a title you'd like to go for next year.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes, the scheduling will obviously be a little bit affected by Olympics.   We anyway have a very busy schedule during the summer.   With Olympics, it's going to be really hard, you know, to kind of prepare well for grass, then right away next week you have a 1000 event in Canada.   
Yes, it's going to be tough for all of us, but it's the same for everybody.   You just have to accept it.   
I think this year what I have done well, I have to say, is I skipped couple of tournaments which were actually quite important to me, Monte‑Carlo for example after Miami.   That came out to be a good decision in my scheduling because then I had a little bit more time to prepare for that surface, then I played as well as I played.   
Scheduling is really relevant, so I will pay a lot of attention to that.   
   
 Q.   If you're going to lose to anyone, are you happy it's to Janko, especially as he gets a nice end‑of‑year bonus?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes, it's great.   Look, he deserved to win.   He was the better player in the second part of the match.   It's obvious it's never easy to perform against somebody you know very well.   Regardless who is across the net, obviously you want to win.   That was the case today.   But it wasn't meant to be.   
I'm glad he got the chance to play and got the chance to win as well.   It can give him a lot of confidence for next year.   
   
 Q.   In terms of confidence, imagine ending your season today, can this end of season be damaging for the start of the next one or are you still full of confidence from the past months?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   What is missing, as I said just a couple of minutes ago, is that freshness.   Will to win, just being on the court, giving hundred percent.   I'm not able to do that now because I just have very little left.   
So I think I have more than enough time to get my old strength back and prepare well.   So I'm sure that if I have as good of preparation as I had last year, I'm confident I can do well in Australia.
