N. DJOKOVIC/D. Shapovalov   
6-1, 6-3   
(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)   
 Q.  What are you most pleased about with your game today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Just how solid I was.  I thought I was from back of the court very solid, not giving Denis time to swing.  He has a big swing.  He can play really with a lot of spin and also a lot of speed and power from back of the court.  I took away that time from him.   
First set he obviously made a lot of unforced errors.  Second set he started playing better and was a closer set.  But I thought I had opportunities from the very beginning of his service games.   
I served very well.  I think that was probably the best shot I've had.   
 Q.  You only have a few hours to recover for the next match.  Quite an unusual situation.  How challenging is that going to be?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I didn't spend too much time on the court in this first match.  That's a positive obviously in these circumstances.  But it's not the first, probably not the last time I'm going to play two matches in a day.  I'm looking forward to it.   
I've been playing well, feeling well, high confidence.  Hopefully I can keep on going.
