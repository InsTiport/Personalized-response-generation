  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. In the first set, John was 85% of first serves, and you're winning 6‑2. Do you feel like you're still improving even at the end of the season?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You can always improve. I guess everybody's different. Just depends from your character or your approach to tennis and generally to everyday commitments.   
I thought I should always try to improve in every possible occasion. Every time I'm on the court I see things I can be better on. That's one of the reasons that I keep on getting that motivation to move on.   
Today was a great match. Obviously the fact that he served that high of a first percentage of serves in and I managed to break him twice says enough about the quality of the return that I had today. That was the key to win the match.   
Conditions didn't help him, didn't help his serve, even though he was serving around 200 average. But I was managing to pick up balls from each corner on the return. I was feeling like I can get a lot of balls back in play and make him move, which was one of the intentions tactically in order to be successful today.   
   
 Q. Talk a little about your new trick shot. Did you put a lot of thought into it or was it something that came off when you were practicing?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Which one? Trick shot?   
   
 Q. Off the return.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Oh, yeah (smiling).   
Fortunately for me, there was somebody that recorded that. Doesn't happen very often. I didn't work on it. It's just instinctively I turned around and managed to play what I played. It was funny. I thought of that and complementing my trick shots.   
I don't know if I'm able to repeat that. I don't think so in a match. It's all about risk management, and I think it's too high of a risk to play that shot. I think, you know, still in a match it's different because you also have respect for the opponent and the game, so you can't really start doing different kind of things because it's a bit disrespectful towards your opponent.   
   
 Q. Towards the end of the season, a lot of players are tired. You certainly don't seem to be. 2010 and 2013, you played the ATP Finals and Davis Cup Finals back‑to‑back one week after the other. Obviously Andy Murray will have to do that this year with a change of surface. Given your experience of doing that in the past, how tough is that? How tough will it be for him if he has to change surface?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, that's in a way a good problem to have. He's playing in World Tour Finals in London and Davis Cup Finals for the first time. So I think that's a position in which he wanted to be in. He was aware that that might happen.   
I heard there was some speculations on his thoughts of skipping the World Tour Finals to be more prepared for the Davis Cup. But the decision depends solely on him and his team. Obviously they know the best what they're doing.   
It's going to be a challenge. If he plays London, obviously is a home favorite there, I'm sure he's not going to go there just to play a few matches in a round‑robin, he'll go there for sure to try to win as many matches as possible and get as far as he can, which is later on going to shorten his time for preparation on clay in Belgium.   
It's the way it is. But having said that, I think he has a good problem in a way to being in kind of two finals.
