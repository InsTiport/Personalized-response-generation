N. DJOKOVIC/F. Lopez
6-2, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You seemed really frustrated after the second set.  What went wrong and how did you fix it?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Just frustrating when you drop -- you play one sloppy service game in the beginning.  Was 30-Love in that game and I allowed him to break me and the set was gone.
I thought I played a pretty good first set, and then after that, you know, I was just trying to hang in there and wait for the opportunities.  I played good beginning of the third.  Fourth was anybody's game, really.  Didn't have many chances on his service games.
Played a very good tiebreak.  That's a positive.
Q. The fourth set obviously was 6-6 and goes to a tiebreak.  It seemed like the tiebreak was almost over before it started.  What was the difference between the fourth set and the tiebreak?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I started to feel the end of the fourth like my serve, finding the range on my serve, which wasn't working at all in the first part of the match.  Obviously when you start serving better, more accurate, higher percent of first serves in, you feel more confident.
So that allowed me to kind of relax on the returns.  Return points I managed to anticipate well.  On 2-1 and 3-1, both of his first serves I anticipated well.  Returned pretty good and, you know, allowed myself to make two mini breaks, which is a big advantage in the tiebreak.
Q. How happy are you with just your consistency tonight?  Only 17 unforced errors.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, in a match like this against a player who comes in a lot, chips and charges and has a huge first serve, you need to be able to try to reduce your unforced error ratios as much as you can.
That's why I was trying to do.  Obviously always things you could have done better, but it's a win in four sets against a player who is in form, playing well in Cincinnati, playing with the confidence, and winning against some top players.
All in all, I'm in the semifinals.  I have two days off, and hopefully will be able to get ready for the next one.
Q. You have a perfect record against Cilic, but he's the defending champion here.  Do you think he takes a little more confidence into it than he normally would?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I would think so because of the fact that he won his first Grand Slam title last year in New York.  He hasn't lost a match, you know, 12, 13 matches in a row, so I'm sure that he feels confident.  He won today a really close match.  A couple of five-setters he had already in this tournament.
But he has a big serve.  I think around 30 aces he had today, so the serve gets him out of trouble.  I know him very well.  I have played with him many, many times.  We are great friends.  Great guy.
I know what to do, and I'm opening I can execute the game plan obviously and play my best.
Q. When you face a player that you have had that much success against, do you anticipate him trying something new?  Do you sort of then try to think ahead to how you would react to that?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, there are different scenarios that you can predict.  Obviously when the moments are kind of tight and important during the match, most of the players have certain patterns of the serve and of the game.
So you try to analyze that, try and go back to those matches that I have played against him this year and other years and get myself ready.
Of course I'm sure he's not going to start coming to the net after every ball, but I'm sure he's gonna try to be aggressive, going to try to take his chances.  That's how he won last year US Open.  I watched him play.  He played great.  Best tennis of his life.
This is where he loves playing.  He loves the conditions on Arthur Ashe.  As I said, I'm going to try to use that advantage and having success against him in the past and to my favor.
Q. Second straight match where you lost the second set and then played very good tennis afterwards.  Is there a correlation?  Do you just kind of make it more focused?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, well, again, I was focusing today on the beginning of the second.  Just didn't want to lose the concentration, and unfortunately it happened.  I had a couple of break points in the first game of the second set, and obviously maybe the story would be different if I broke him there.
Started off with a break up, but I was break down and 3-Love down and he started swinging freely.  I kind of backed up a little bit and the game changed.  Sport of small margins, especially on the high level, one or two points can really change the course of the match.
