THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You said that that's not a way that you want to advance.   Can you just talk about that?   Did you notice that his shoulder was giving him trouble during the time you played?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, the first time I noticed that something is wrong is during his second service game in the match, 3‑Love for me.   His first serves didn't go over 90 miles per hour, so something obviously was wrong with his shoulder.  
You know, it's unfortunate.   It was a night session match and many people came to watch.   Obviously I was also expecting a good and interesting and tough match.  
It's the way it is.   Hopefully he recovers for the US Open.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how it's going with MariÃ¡n Vajda on vacation, is Dusan Vemic being promoted?   Is it a different dynamic with you guys when the head coach isn't here?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, you know, I know Dusan for very long time, since I was five, six year old boy playing in Partizan Tennis Club back in Belgrade, back then he was, you know, one of our best players in Serbia.  
So we are friends for a while.   You know, he stopped his career last year.   We talked.   You know, he joined the team.   MariÃ¡n is still the head coach, of course, but he can't travel as much full time as he did in last couple of years.  
So when he's not able, Dusan comes in and he covers some of the tournaments.   There are also tournaments where we're all together, where there are both of them working together.   It's a great understanding between them and between us.   I have pleasure working with both of them.  
   
 Q.   There was an article that came out recently that shared you have been working with a doctor who was changing your diet, giving you books to recommend, whatnot.   Can you elaborate on that a little bit?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, look, you know, I have worked with different people throughout my career, and he was one of them.   He had his contribution to the success that we had, but not as much that everybody claims.  
He was not the miracle person, you know.   There was no secrets, even though everybody was trying to figure out what is the secret of the run that I had there, what am I using.   
But it's actually the work that I put into all these years and, you know, mentally it all came together for me.  
It was just one piece of the big puzzle.  
   
 Q.   Can you take anything out of that match tonight, or do you just have to put it to one side because of the way it went?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, look, you know, for me, in a way it's good to stay as short as possible on the court because I have had a lot of tennis in the last couple of weeks.  
So, you know, obviously I don't want to win with injury of my opponent, but in this moment I try to gather as much energy as I can and save as much energy as I can and take one day actually at a time.   
I'm not really trying to think, you know, in advance during this week, because I know that I'm not the freshest player in this tournament, you know, so that's why I'm trying to take it step by step.  
   
 Q.   For the US Open, they play fifth set tiebreaks which is different from the rest of the slams.   What do you think about that?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   For me it's fine, really, both ways.   I have played once I think in my career in US Open fifth‑set tiebreak.   It was against Stepanek I think 2000 ‑‑ was it 7 or 8?   
I remember we went the distance, a long match.   Then you have obviously the opposite of that in Wimbledon where you have no tiebreaks and Mahut and Isner played 11 hours.  
So you can look at it from different perspectives and see.   You obviously wouldn't have a history in making in last year if you had tiebreaker in last set in Wimbledon.   
So from that point of view, it's good to have no tiebreaks and maybe eventually get players to go the distance.  
But on the other hand, maybe it's good for the players and for bigger picture to have the tiebreak, because then after the match like that you can't recover and then most likely you're going to finish the tournament in next round.  
   
 Q.   You have had a lot of success in NewYork and have enjoyed the tournament a fair amount.   If you could change one thing about the US Open to make it into your dream US Open, what would that one thing be?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't know if I should say that, but the roof on center court.   (Laughter.)  
No, the US Open is already doing a great job.   You know, it's one of the biggest tournaments in the world.   Entertainment‑wise, it's the best.   You know, the night sessions there are very unique, you know, people are getting into it.   It's very entertaining for players.   
You know, the US Open already has for previous years a tradition of Monday finals, and hopefully the weather is going to serve us this time.  
   
 Q.   When you talked about everything came together for you mentally not too long ago, is that a result of match results or things off the court or a combination?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, you know, I think it was many things combined really, because I did go through the stage of my career where I was doubting if I can really reach my lifetime goals to be No. 1, to win Wimbledon and many Grand Slams.   
Obviously I had a very strong competition with Rafa and Roger.   I was very consistent with my results, but I just wasn't managing to make that final step because they were so dominant.  
You know, I figured some things out.   I matured and got better on and off the court and realized what I need to do.  
That's how it all came together.  
   
 Q.   Your countryman, Viktor, likes to go to King's Island roller coaster.   What do you like to do in Cincinnati and what do you like to do in New York?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I know he's an adventure seeker.   I have joined him once I think four or five years ago, and I think I'll let it be.   That's the only time.   
It's exciting, it's adrenaline rush, but I'm not into roller coasters too much.   I prefer staying on the ground.   
Well, you know, it's tough because, you know, especially coming in from Canada late, you can't do really much.   We're not really in Cincinnati.   We are outside in Mason, so we're playing every day and there is not much time and energy to spend on the other things.  
   
 Q.   Once things finish for you this tournament ‑ and next week is a nontournament week for you ‑ what will you do?   Obviously you're saying you're not fresh and that's true with the amount you've played, but with the first couple of days next week will you do absolutely nothing, and I mean really nothing, or will you pick up a racquet, do any sort of gym work?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it all depends again how far I'm going in this tournament.   We have different plans, different schedules, depending on this week with a team.  
The rest of the team is joining us in New York.   I'm looking forward to the week of practice and resting, to be honest.   Yes, opening couple days of the week I will just try to recover as much as I can, gather my strength, and then work and get ready for US Open.
