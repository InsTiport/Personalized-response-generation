 N. DJOKOVIC/A. Murray
  4‑6, 6‑3, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you give us your assessment of the match, coming back from a set down?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Another great match.   Another great performance from both of us.   I hope that people who watched it agree with my opinion.   
I didn't expect anything less, you know, other than a tough match that went down the wire and was decided in the last point.   
It was important for me after dropping a first set to stay mentally tough and believe that I can get my opportunities, and when they're presented to try to step in and use them.   That's what I've done.   
I don't think I've played bad in the first set.   It was him playing really well, serving extremely well.   He lost only couple of points on his first serve throughout the whole set.   So that says enough about his quality.   
And then, you know, he made some unforced errors.   He allowed me to get back to the match.   Then I think it was quite even up to the last point.   
   
 Q.   How crucial do you think saving the breakpoints at the beginning of the second set was?   On the big points, do you ever consider not going for the lines?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it's difficult to say what is the right way to play.   I mean, Andy is all over the court.   He doesn't have much weaknesses.   So I try to follow my instincts and play the right shots that I feel are right at that moment.   
You know, I could have gone a double break twice in the third set.   I haven't.   He came back.   As I said, you know, he could have easily been a winner and sitting here as a winner of today's match.   But that's something that you expect when you're playing at such a high level.   We have a great rivalry that hopefully will develop even more in the future.   
   
 Q.   Do you believe in the crucial moments when you stay calm, even when your opponent has match points, do you believe you've matured in those situations, like in Shanghai and today coming back from a set down?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Calm mind always wins.   I guess that's an answer.   
I did, you know, learn what I need to do.   I try to take from every experience the best that I can and mature every year as a player and as a person.   So I guess that necessary experience helped me even today, you know, that I've had over the years playing on the top level.   
I've had many matches that I was coming back from a set down or match points down.   Well, I can't say that I'm managing always to be the tough player mentally when I'm match points down, that I would always come back.   It's really unpredictable.   But I always try to focus on every point individually.   
   
 Q.   Given all the history that you have with Andy, going back to juniors, does it make it extra special that you're now having these matches and rivalry right at the top of the game?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Of course it does.   I mean, we know each other so well.   The friendship goes for long time, since we were 11 years old.   It's the first time when we met, when we played.   
You know, more or less we developed into the professional tennis players at the same time, you know.   So, as I said, hopefully this rivalry will evolve and we can have many more great matches on the tour.   
   
 Q.   One of the most interesting stats during the match was that you apparently run 3.2 kilometers during matches against Murray as opposed to 1.8 in matches against others.   Can you talk about what it's like playing against someone who is as good a defensive player as you are?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's something I always have in the back of my mind when I get to play Andy, it's going to be a physically very demanding match on any surface.   I didn't expect, as I said on the start, anything less.   I needed to work for my points.   I needed to earn them.   
You know, I didn't expect him to make an unforced error.   He was really taking his chances in the first set.   He was a better player throughout that first part of the match.   
You know, I had to hang in there.   That's all I can say.   That was my mindset, you know, to try to stay out there, win every point that I play.   Mentally, don't try to think too far or what happened already or what's going to happen, just be at the present moment.   
That helped me.   That helped me in the Shanghai final.   It helped me once again here.   I'm once again very happy that I managed to stay calm in those situations.   
   
 Q.   You've been pretty clinical this year in matches that come down to a deciding set.   Can you talk about the confidence and emotions that go through your mind when it comes down to the wire.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, confidence plays a key role for any person on this planet, I think, especially for the athletes at this level.   You need to try to rely on your strength in your game and you need to believe in your shots, believe in your instincts.   When you have that positive mindset, when you believe in your game, you have better chances of winning those crucial points.   
   
 Q.   Looking ahead to your next match against Tomas Berdych, what are your thoughts?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, well, you know, the good thing about this format, it gives you a day to recover.   I'm going to need that day tomorrow.   Just try to take it easy, work on some things a little bit on the practice.   Then, of course, get on the court and try to win.   
You know, it was really important obviously for me to win this match today, as it was for Andy.   But I will not try to depend on some other players' scores and matches.   I will try to, you know, focus and win every match that I play on.   
   
 Q.   Talking about you going the distance with Andy in the last couple of matches.   But when you get into that situation, you're in a fifth set or a third set, do you have flashbacks to the previous couple of occasions when you've gone the distance with him?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, a lot of things go through the mind.   I would lie if I said I didn't have any flashbacks.   Of course, you know, at that moment when you're match point down or match point up, you know, you try always to be at the present moment.   That's my mindset.   It's not easy because it's a huge obviously moment and a lot of things going on.   
Of course, if you're playing in front of almost 20,000 people, there's also a lot of things that can affect you, you know, on the court.   But you always try to stay calm, focus on every shot.   I guess simple way of putting things on the tennis court is sometimes better.   
   
 Q.   A question off court.   Yesterday Roger was saying a couple of things he can't do, is not able to do, one is cook and another one is skate.   If it came down to you, what are some things you just can't do or you're not good at doing?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, you caught me unprepared.   What can't I do (laughter)?   Many things I can't do actually.   
One thing I know how to do is to play tennis.   I guess I'll stick with that.   There are so many other sports that I'm not talented for.   Like basketball, I need to work on that.   Even though it's our national sport.   My skills are very bad there.   Cooking also, not so great.   I like spending time in the kitchen, but only to be eating from my plate, not really preparing.   
   
 Q.   No.1 in the world, millionaires, probably billionaire in a few years.   You are a role model and sometimes also a fashion model.   Now you're wearing a jacket by UNIQLO which costings $40.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Are you sure?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   I bought it for my wife.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Financially very open conversation now (laughter).   
   
 Q.   I want to know how much...   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: ...   I pay for the jacket.   
   
 Q.   You get sponsored by UNIQLO.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Do you think when you come into press conference, I have to wear this because it's my sponsor or not?   Is it worry or not?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   First of all, it's a responsibility towards your sponsor for clothing.   I'm with UNIQLO since Roland Garros this year, so I'm obliged to wear UNIQLO.   I like wearing UNIQLO.   Hopefully your wife likes the jacket.   I can get you one for free later.   
I like fashion also.   I think fashion is a very important part of everybody's life.   In my mind it's important to look nice whenever you can on and off the court.   But it's obviously very subjective.   I think a person shouldn't be dependent on fashion because everybody has their preference.   
   
 Q.   You had a lot of support out there today.   Were you surprised how much there was in front of Andy's home crowd?   Does that make a lot of difference to you when it comes to key moments?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   The majority of the support went his side.   That's something that was normal to expect because he's playing in front of his home crowd.   He had lots of success in London this year.   
But I also had supporters.   I could always focus on those supporters.   They were with me throughout the match.   
Well, you know, whatever happens outside of the court, you have to still try to do your job, and that is to win the match.
