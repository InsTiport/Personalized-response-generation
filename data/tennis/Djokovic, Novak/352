A. MURRAY/N. Djokovic
  6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. What was the difference today in terms of what allowed Andy to beat you? Do you see yourself and Andy as being maybe the next biggest rivalry in tennis?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I think we already have a rivalry. It's not the next. It's already existing there for many years. 
Andy is deservedly a winner today on the court. I thought what made the difference was his serve and my serve. I didn't serve well the first set and a half. After, I just wasn't able to serve. 
But not taking anything away from him, from his victory. He deserved it. He stepped in, played some great shots. Most of all the moments when he needed to, he served very, very well. 
Breakpoints that one game, when I had I think four, five opportunities to break back, he just came up always with big serves, so I couldn't do much. 
But it was a great week all in all for me. I didn't know what to expect obviously coming in, first hard court tournament. I know people always expect me to do well, but I try to be modest with my expectations and just kind of see how each day goes. 
When I reflect on the week, of course it's positive. I'm playing better as the tournament progressed, and hopefully I can continue in the same style in Cincinnati. 

Q. You seemed to have a little problem with your right elbow. You mentioned it yesterday. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, it was unfortunate. Came at the wrong time. But I guess because of the overload in a way, it's understandable. We played over two and a half hours to that point. So the elbow suffered a little bit. 
It was unfortunate because I didn't get any free points basically in the third set on my serve. That made a difference. It made my life difficult on the court. 

Q. Can you talk about the conditions out there, the heat, how that affected the play today. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, I actually didn't notice the thermal meter during the week except today. This is the first day. I don't know if they put it on purpose there. It showed maximum 50 Celsius on the court. So it was pretty warm. 
But, again, conditions are the same for both him and me. This is part of our sport. It's what we have to face. It's what we have to accept. Towards the end of the match it was a bit cooler. It was nicer to play. 
But overall very demanding physically, as it always is against Andy. 

Q. You're talking about your arm. Does it worry you as we're getting near the US Open?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I just did some tests. They were good. They were positive. I hope for the best. 

Q. It was your first loss in about 30 games in a Masters. How do you feel now that this streak is over?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you never like losing, but any streak comes to an end. I'm fine, you know. Again, I lost to a better player today. I lost to Andy, who I know very well. 
I did fight till the last point and did try my best. That's something that I take as a positive from this week. 

Q. How tough was it mentally to lose the fifth game that lasted like forever?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, it was. As I said, I didn't have a rally opportunity. He came up, I think he saved four, five breakpoints with first serves, wide, T, and he was hitting the angle well. 
He served very efficiently today. I think that has got him out of the trouble. 

Q. You've beaten Andy the last eight times you played since Wimbledon 2013. Was this a better Andy Murray that you played today?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Certainly from the perspective of the serve, yes. Also he has been aggressive in certain moments when he needed to. 
I think it was a good quality, high quality match generally. But this is what is expected. When we play each other, we always kind of take the best out of ourselves. We need to deliver the best game possible in order to win. That's what he did, and I congratulate him.
