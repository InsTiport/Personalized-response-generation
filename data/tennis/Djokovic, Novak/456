N. DJOKOVIC/P. Carreno Busta
  6‑0, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Must be extremely happy with your game today, not only that it was so quick, but your movement.   You played so fast today sometimes it was too fast to see the ball. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's great.   Hope I continue like that (smiling). 

Q.   You're playing another gentleman from Spain. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Another clay court specialist, another match which I approach with, you know, kind of an aggressive mindset in terms of game plan.   That's it. 
I have already great variety in the game which is one of the key components for an optimal success on this surface.   You need to be able to play equally well defensively and offensively.   That's something I was doing quite well in the first two rounds. 

Q.   45 minutes the other day, 47 today.   You seem in a particular hurry at this tournament.   Something you're doing differently?   Is it a conscious thing? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Each year you try to improve, you try to work on certain elements in your game that can, you know, produce the matches like this. 
I've had more time comparing to last year to practice on the clay courts and to get my game to the level where I want it to be.   Lost only two games in the first two matches.   Can't be better than this, for sure. 
I don't want to get carried away.   I am confident on the court.   I'm coming off a great American hard court season.   I want to keep that going. 
Of course, on clay courts you never know really because you can feel comfortable, you can feel well, but you can also easily lose your rhythm.   That's why I'm only concentrating on the next match and next opponent. 
Besides the fact that Tomas lost, you have all the top players in the quarterfinals progressing.   I was watching the other matches of the other top players.   They're all playing great.   It's going to be very interesting from tomorrow on to see how the matches will go on. 

Q.   It was just rumors yesterday that you didn't practice or you had some problems, physical problems?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, I did not practice.   I had to rest my arm. 

Q.   The wrist?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah.   I had that issue for the last week, as I said.   Good thing for me was that I had a day off between the first and second match.   That allowed me to rest my arm and do physiotherapy and try to try to recover it. 
It's already much, much better. 

Q.   Gone?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Not gone, but much, much better. 

Q.   The wrist improved compared to your last match?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes. 

Q.   It's obviously very early to say this, but do you think this is the most confident you've felt starting on clay?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, first two matches have gone my way from the start to the end.   I've played some great tennis. 
But, as you said, it's still early to really judge or really compare my game to the clay court performances I had in previous years. 
I couldn't ask for a better start, that's for sure, for the first two matches.   Now the matches will get tougher obviously.   The challenges will also be bigger.   We'll see. 
It's never easy to play against the top players.   Garcia‑LÃ³pez just won against Berdych.   If I win against him, I'll get to play another top‑10 player, so we'll see how it goes. 

Q.   What do you think about today Fognini's behavior?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I didn't see anything.   I was not in the club.   I was practicing while he was performing. 
I heard the crowd cheering, then whistling.   I didn't understand what was going on, to be honest.   I just saw in the locker room there were many players watching that match, his reactions. 
I know him off the court really well.   We grew up together.   He's good friend of mine.   He's definitely a player to watch in every meaning of that word (smiling). 

Q.   You've had more time to prepare for the tournament this year.   Did you feel the previous years it was a little bit too short?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes.   Also the Davis Cup and so forth.   It's not easy to always have ideal schedule.   But this year being able to have two weeks between my last match in Miami and the first match here is great.   It's more time than I had in previous years.   That's one of the reasons why I feel better on the court. 

Q.   A football question about the World Cup.   Do you have one big memory when you were a child watching the World Cup?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Many. 

Q.   You can think about it and answer tomorrow, if you want. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Obviously, I was watching my country perform well.   I remember the last match that I watched Serbia played in the World Cup was 2010 against Germany.   We won 1‑0.   That was a huge win for us. 
World Cup in football is next to Olympic Games probably the biggest sports event in all the world.   Attention is directed to that competition.   We are all excited to watch again. 
Unfortunately my country won't be a part of it, but I will support some other countries. 

Q.   Which country?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Croatia and Bosnia first.   They're neighboring countries.   Then the host:   Brazil.   There are some great teams.   Of course, I like Italy, as well. 
But first our neighbors. 

Q.   And Monaco is not represented either. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Exactly (smiling).
