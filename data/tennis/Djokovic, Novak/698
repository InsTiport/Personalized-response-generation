N. DJOKOVIC/G. Monfils
  6-2, 6-2, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did you expect such a game from Gael Monfils? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I didn't really think about his game. I was thinking about my game and my focus. It was unbelievable today. Under the circumstances, maybe one of the best matches I have played this year. It was definitely a lot of pressure, expectations. 
 But, you know, this is the finals of Davis Cup. You cannot get more energy than this. So I'm very, very happy with the way I played. 

 Q. What did you think in the third set when Gael broke you twice? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I just wanted to stay calm. I'm emotional on the court. But today I was really, really playing well, yeah. 

 Q. When you speak to the public, we had the translation, you said 'French means nothing'. What did you mean by saying that?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I was saying to the crowd that we should over-cheer them because I believe that the crowd should be involved in the game, that 15,000 cannot be over-cheered by 1,000. 
 French crowd is incredible in this match. I mean, that's why I had to involve our crowd. It was the best atmosphere today. It's very difficult when you have such a professional and organized crowd as the French. 
 But, you know, it's 2-All, so let's see if we are able to give the right support to Viktor. 

 Q. Why didn't you play in the doubles? Was it to preserve you for this game today? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes. I didn't feel that was the best option. And we cannot say that it was a wrong option of putting Viktor and Zimonjic in the doubles because they were playing great tennis. They were just one, two points from the victory. It was a good decision from my side so I can save my energy for singles today. 
 I felt great. 

 Q. Novak, how did you feel yesterday after the loss of the doubles? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I definitely didn't feel happy after seeing my colleagues losing after 2-0, 2-1, 4-3,15-40, so many chances. But you have to give credit to Clement and Llodra who after so much pressure came back and won the match. They played unbelievable. 

 Q. Can you explain the choice of Viktor today for the last game? Did you know it was Llodra playing?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm not sure really. To be honest, I was on the court. I didn't talk with my team yesterday. I just wanted to be fit and ready mentally and physically for my match, not think about eventually a fifth match, because it was 2-1 for France and anything could happen. 
 We believe that Viktor is a good option. We believe he can play well, these singles, because he's been playing a good match yesterday in doubles. He was serving well, returning well. He's feeling good, feeling motivated to be a hero of this match. We wish him all the best. We will support him and see. 
 Unfortunately, Janko in this moment, he's not ready enough to perform his best. He didn't play well in the first match. But that's why we are a team here and that's why we have options.
