N. DJOKOVIC/K. Nishikori
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   A very fluent victory.   Can you tell us the match from your perspective?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, it was obvious that Kei ‑ because of fatigue maybe finishing late last night or a little injury ‑ he didn't serve as well as he can, as well as he wanted.
But other than that, I think he played very well from back of the court.   But I served exceptionally well when it was important, both first and second set, and that allowed me obviously to have a lot of free points.   Allowed me to put more pressure on his service games. 
All in all, it was a very good performance.

Q.   When you look back that US Open final against Kei, what have you learned from that? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Semifinal.

Q.   Semifinal, yeah. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, well, we haven't played against each other so many times throughout our careers.   He still is a young player, but definitely experiencing the best season of his life.   He has won, I think, four titles if I'm not wrong.   Played final of the US Open. 
So he showed that he can win against anybody really.   He's all‑around player and very, very quick.   One of the quickest players on the tour.   Very aggressive.   Very solid from both forehand and backhand side.
So not much flaws in the game.   I think he has improved since he started working with Michael Chang. 
Well, it was different conditions in NewYork.   Was a little bit windy.   Just didn't play on the level I wanted that day, but credit to him for playing a great tournament and reaching the finals in NewYork.
In the other hand, now I tried to take some things that I did wrong.   I take the best out of that match and use it for this one today.   I talked with my team.   I prepared myself well.   I analyzed his game and what I think I need to do, and I think I achieved everything I wanted today.

Q.   You obviously have great focus on the court, but this week with all that has gone on in your life the last ten days, are there moments where you're thinking about your wife or your kid while you're actually playing on court?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No.   No.   I have been playing tennis so many years and played so many matches that, you know, you're getting into that zone when you are the court where you don't think about anything else but the match.
I'm glad it's so.   My wife understands it, as well, and she supports this kind of approach.   When I'm on the court it's all professional.   It's all business.
But of course before, after the match, I try to be involved, you know, in the life as a parent as much as I can.

Q.   A lot of players say they don't take a lot of pleasure to play against a player like Raonic because he serves so well and there is no rally.   It's too difficult to return.   Considering the fact that the return is probably one of your best strokes, do you take pleasure from that? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I do rely on my return, and it's one of the elements in my game that has served me well throughout my entire career.   That will probably be a key shot tomorrow, trying to get as many returns back in play and get into the rallies with Milos. 
But, again, it's easier said than done.   I also don't think it's very pleasurable experience when you're playing against somebody who serves 220, 230 kilometers regularly.
But, again, I played against him twice this year on clay though in different conditions.   Indoors now hard court I think serves ‑‑it's more suitable to his style of the game rather than clay. 
But, again, I haven't dropped a set.   And I feel confident about my game as much as he does about his game, so it's going to be definitely a good final.

Q.   I'd like to ask you about the finals in London, what you expect, and considering also the absence of Rafa Nadal. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I wouldn't like to talk too much about London now.   I will try to focus on tomorrow's match, and then I will speak about London. 

Q.   Obviously there is not a lot of talk in the last five, six years about the sort of Golden Age of tennis that people consider it to be now with you and Rafa and Roger.   Having played Kei and about to play Milos, do you think these guys will be able to keep up that level, or will it be just sort of a different generation, different era, and people will have to accept in the next few years?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, we're about to see what's going to happen.   If I think that they can‑‑ that they have ability to be consistently successful throughout the year and be contenders for major titles, and, you know, top spots of the world, yes, they do. 
I mean, they have shown on several occasions, especially this year, both of them, that they can challenge and win against best players.   So they deserve the respect and they are still ‑‑well, they're not that young anymore.   They are already mid‑20s. 
I think they have established themselves as top 10 players and they understand now what it takes mentally also to be out there.
But we all know how competitive tennis nowadays is, and it's not about one or two months of good results.   It's about the whole year of good results. 
So in order to, you know, compete for the top spot of the world.   We'll see.   They both have ‑‑they have different games, but they are both very, very strong, great quality players, and we will see what future brings.

Q.   You are in pole position for the year‑end No. 1 spot.   You're now a father.   You're in great physical shape.   Would you say this is one of the best periods of your life?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, definitely.   I try to cherish every moment that I experience on the court and also off the court. 
Off the court especially this year, my private life with getting married, becoming a father, it's been an incredibly joyful year for me.   So I can't complain.   In contrary.   I'm enjoying every moment of it.
