N. DJOKOVIC/J. Del Potro
4-6, 7-6, 6-4
(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)
Q. Saved two match points, what made the difference in the end?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Luck in the decisive moments in the second set tiebreak.  He was playing really good.  I tried my best obviously all the way till the end.  I lost probably the positioning of the court over him.  Towards the end of the first he just started hitting the ball really well from both corners.  Also backhand side, backhand down the line.  He was playing really well.  Gave me a lot of trouble.
But I never lost faith I could come back to the match.  One break of serve, mini break in the tiebreak when he was 6-4, more or less open forehand that he was making the entire match, that's all it took for me to come back.
Missed a couple crucial points in the tiebreak.  Also breakpoint third set, quite easy forehand.  That's what happens.  That's sport.  I'm just really pleased to overcome.
Q. The focus is going to shift to the semifinal now, David Schwartzman awaits.  A small guy but big fighter.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Let's think about that tomorrow.  I'm glad for Diego.  A great guy and player, but I'm just going to recover first.
