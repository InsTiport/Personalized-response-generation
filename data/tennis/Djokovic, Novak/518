THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Hi, Novak.   Very, very quick match today, and some people were saying it almost seemed like a warmup for you.   How did it feel from your end down on the court?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's an official match, so I cannot say‑‑ even though the scoreline says it was quite straightforward, it's still it's never easy.   You need to work for your wins and points.   
That was kind of the mindset I had today before I came to the court.   I wanted to just play from the first to last point committed and just aggressive, and I did well.  
   
 Q.   You've been playing really well since you hit the grounds here.   What is it about Cincinnati that feels good for you?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I played four times finals, so it's been one of the tournaments where I've performed well actually in the last five, six years when I've been coming back to this tournament.   
Never managed to make the final step, and hopefully this year I can do so.   I have an extra motivation and an opportunity to make history in this tournament, so I'm very inspired to play well day after day.   
Of course, there are still adjustments to be made, but I'm playing better as the tournament is going on.  
   
 Q.   Your next opponent is John Isner.   What are your thoughts on that?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's going to be very difficult match for both of us.   I mean, he's one of the biggest, if not the biggest, serve in tennis at the moment in the world.   
With his height, he can place it anywhere he wants in the box, and it's what makes a lot of pressure on the opponent.   So I need to return well tomorrow and try to get as many balls into play and again serve well.   
So it's a big ask, but it's not the first time I play him and I know what to do.  
   
 Q.   Would you rather have played Raonic instead?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I'm playing Isner, so I'll focus on him.   
Thank you.
