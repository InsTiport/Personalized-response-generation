  N. DJOKOVIC/S. Querrey
6-4, 6-0

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Seemed like another very composed performance from you. Can you talk about how you played. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Sure. When I found out that I'm playing against Sam instead of playing against Gasquet, it was certainly a better draw for me considering the fact that Sam is not a clay court specialist. 
 And today I was in control of the match most of the time. I didn't face any breakpoints and I was really comfortable on my serve. In the other hand, I had a lot of opportunities the first set I didn't use. But in the end I managed to break him and then hold the serve. After that, it was more or less routine. 

 Q. Do you have to adjust when you're playing someone who isn't a clay court specialist? He must look very different to most people you play on clay. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, true, true. You always, of course, try to prepare the tactic according to the opponent you are having that match. 
 Today I knew that I'm gonna be facing a big server, so I needed to be really focused on my returns, just wait for my chances, try to open up him a little bit more, try to open the court and then have the opportunities to finish with the winner. 

 Q. It seemed quite easy. Are you ready for a big clash now? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, I'm ready. Physically I didn't spend so much energy in these three matches. Mentally it was exhausting. But, anyhow, I cannot complain about long matches and long points because I didn't have those. So I can say I'm ready, you know. 
 I just need to try to be myself tomorrow. Even though I'm playing the first player of the world, I played him many times. The only time we played against each other on clay was here two years ago, and it was three sets, tough match. 
 So I think I have a good chances. I showed enough quality throughout all the tournament this year. We'll see what happen. 

 Q. Do you think the fact that it's on clay makes the job slightly easier in any way? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it might be. But looking at his match today, you really don't try to think in the way that you have advantage if you play him on clay 'cause he plays a great tennis on clay, as well. He grew up on clay basically. 
 He didn't have as much success on clay, as much as he had on hard courts or grass. But, still, he is No. 1 player of the world. He played two finals of French Open. He won Hamburg. He was more or less everywhere in the final. 
 So for sure he's No. 2 in the moment on this surface. 

 Q. Were you surprised by his reaction today? As you said, he played a big match against Nalbandian. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: He played a fantastic match. It was really impressive. I watched a little bit. Even Nalbandian had a great performance. But, you know, when you have such a great performance and you lose 6-2, 6-2, second and third set, your opponent had to be really, really great.
