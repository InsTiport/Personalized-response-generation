N. DJOKOVIC/R. Bautista Agut
4-6, 6-4, 7-6
(Transcribed from audio.)
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Roberto has caused you some problems in the past, but you really had to dig deep for that one today.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Very strange match, I must say.  I don't know how I won it, to be honest.  He was the better player.  I just didn't feel good on the court at all in any aspect of my game and the body, but somehow I managed to pull this one through.
Q. How do you tackle a player like that who moves around the court so well?  You tried things like keeping the rallies short but he seemed to have an answer for everything.  How do approach a guy like that tactically?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   It's a balance between the patience and kind of control the aggressivity, if you want to call it.  When you have a chance, you have to go through it.
You have to not only move him around left and right but forward, backwards, you know, kind of mix up with the pace and spin and depth.  You just have to put a lot of variation in the game.  He's a very consistent player.
Q. You are into your seventh Western & Southern Open final.  Milos Raonic awaits.  You have an unbeaten record against him, but he's been playing some terrific tennis this week, hasn't he?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yeah, I mean, huge serve.  He's playing well.  He's confident.  Let's hope for a good final.
