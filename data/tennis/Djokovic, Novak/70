N. DJOKOVIC/K. Edmund   
7-6, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  It was a tough start, but slowly you began to play better than yesterday. Were you feeling better than yesterday too?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I was, I was. I was feeling energy-wise better and felt more alert, just more strength, more energy, more speed.   
I didn't play so well, I think, from baseline in the first set. I served well. That got me to the tiebreak. I didn't use couple of set points and 6-5. Got to tiebreak. Was playing solid, and that was very close, you know, obviously decided in one or two points.   
Second set was the best set I've played so far in the tournament. Finished off with a winner, finished off with amazing return game. So of course the sensation is very positive.   
And I'm convinced that I'm headed in the right direction so that tomorrow will be even better.   
 Q.  You are one of the most efficient player under this conditions, but especially in indoor. Can you talk about the way that you adapt your game on indoors? Do you play the same on grass or do you do little adjustment?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You do make some adjustments, of course. The conditions are different on every surface. Everywhere you get to play, you know, ideally you have couple of days of training and adaptation to the surface and conditions because usually the ball bounce and the speed of the surface is something that affects your game greatly. So you kind of have to figure out what is the best strike zone, so to say, you know?   
And indoor conditions have been, as you mentioned, very successful and suitable to my game. Throughout my career, I played really well both in Paris and London. I don't know whether there is any other particular reason. I think it's just suitable to my game.   
Maybe because I'm also trying to find another, so to say, drop of necessary energy to finish off the season in the best possible way. So mentally I'm, you know, obviously as everybody else, but I'm talking for myself, trying to push myself even harder to really make the finish line, you know, as best possible.   
 Q.  Talking about tomorrow, can you get into his head a little bit? Because he proved a tricky one for you, Stefanos.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You know, we played a couple of times this year, one on clay in Madrid finals and I lost to him in Shanghai. I was a set up and close second set. I couldn't finish it off, and the match was turned around. I think I lost four, five games in a row, end of second, beginning of third, and that was enough for him to hold his serve.   
Obviously he's one of the best players in the world. He's already established player. You know, he's all around player, plays very well on all surfaces. He has great working ethics, very dedicated.   
And, you know, let the better player win, I guess. I'm hoping that I can start off the match as well as I did in Shanghai but also kind of keep going to the end.   
 Q.  After you won, you gave a very determined look quickly to your box. It's only a third-round match, but was that because you felt that you proved something today or something had worked in particular or was there a reason for that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It was because my coach told me I don't have a great return. So finishing off with a return winner, I kind of gave him a look. No. I'm joking. (Smiling.)   
No. It was just, you know, obviously a kind of determined look that was positive, in a way, you know, this is great to finish the match in style and to feel the way I felt in the second set. That was about it, really.   
You know, I have not felt the best yesterday. I have not played my best yesterday. So of course I was hoping I can do as well as I did in second set. The look was about that, basically.
