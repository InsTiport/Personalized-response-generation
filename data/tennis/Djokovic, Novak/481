N. DJOKOVIC/S. Wawrinka
  6‑3, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   The match tomorrow is the best way to end the season, the No.1, the No. 2. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, we both had a great seasons, especially him.   He finishes No.1 of the world deservedly.   Of course, whenever we play each other, it's a huge challenge and we want to win. 
This is the probably most competitive tournament that we have after Grand Slams in our sport, and we both want to crown this season in the best possible way and end it with a title. 

Q.   You just mentioned ending the season with a title.   You almost mentioned in the on‑court interview, you have two big matches coming up this weekend. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Absolutely. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about that and how you're feeling about it.   You've played every possible match in Paris, here.   Is that ideal preparation?   Is it too much time on court?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, the season has been long, but I cannot complain because this is something I was very aware about when I was preparing myself for the end of the season.   I knew I'm going to have back‑to‑back weeks playing on a very high level against top‑10 players, then coming into Belgrade trying to win with my teammates for our country a second Davis Cup title. 
Of course, is going to be very physically and mentally demanding for me to be able to perform my best next weekend.   But it's one of those unique opportunities that you are looking forward to.   God knows if we are going to have another chance to win the Davis Cup final at home.   Hopefully we can have Janko ready to play, and that would be great. 

Q.   Rafa won the tough matches you had in Paris and New York.   Would winning tomorrow in any way make up for that?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   After the US Open final, I haven't lost a match.   I'm trying to take a lot of positive energy out of this confidence and out of this run that I had.   I won against him in the finals of Beijing in straight sets and I played a great match. 
I liked the way I improved in our matches.   I like that I changed a few things that allowed me to win against him.   That's something that I will definitely try to use tomorrow. 
He has immensely improved on hard court.   Comparing to all the other surfaces in our sport, this is probably his least preferable, but not this year.   This year he has had incredible success.   He's more aggressive.   He's using his serve better. 
Of course, no clear favorites in the final tomorrow.   It's always expected that we go the distance.   Let the better win. 

Q.   Next year you and Rafa have built a pretty big lead up in the points, and you'll be battling for No.1 the first few months of the season.   How important is this match for you tomorrow as far as the subtle shifts in the balance of power we see? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, doesn't matter which tournament that we play, whenever we play each other, especially in last few years, there is a lot on the line, and there's so much to play for.   It's a huge motivation for both of us to win against the biggest rival. 
We played close to 40 times against each other.   As I said, it's very tense.   We push each other to the limit. 

Q.   Could you talk about what kind of tactics you need to employ and be successful with in order to win tomorrow. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, first of all, I hope that I can carry today's performance in tomorrow's match because this was the best match so far this week that I had.   I felt great on the court. 
Of course, the high percentage of first serves and being aggressive on the court, that's something that is a must in order to win against Rafa.   I know that.   I will try, obviously, to use that experience of playing him this year on such a high level in different occasions, last couple of years, in order to win the match. 

Q.   Before the tournament started, Rafa said you were the favorite.   When you heard that, what did you think?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I haven't heard that. 

Q.   You've heard it now. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Thanks for telling me (smiling). 
Look, you know, I just try to keep my thoughts on what I do.   You know, it's everybody's choice to pick who is the favorite.   Of course, not going to say I am the favorite because we are always trying to switch the roles of the favorites wherever we go.   It's part of the sport.   It's normal. 
Look, we are both having a great season this year.   This is probably the best possible final we have here in London.   We'll see what happens tomorrow. 

Q.   Can you say again how much the defeats in Paris and New York and losing the No.1 slot have hurt you and how, if at all, you've used that as motivation in this winning streak you've had?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I think I overcome this already because I bounce back in a great way after US Open defeat.   Over 20 matches won.   I won against him also in the finals of Beijing tournament.   It's already behind me. 
Of course, there were a couple of losses against him this year that were very disappointing for me.   But I'm already on a different roll now and feel good about myself.   I'm going to try to use that confidence for tomorrow.
