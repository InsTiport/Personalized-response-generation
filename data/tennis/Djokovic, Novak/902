   THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Novak.   
  
  Q.  How was Centre Court without the roof?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  It was a new experience.  It was a fantastic experience to play on the Centre Court at such a great event.  Of course, it's going to help me out in a positive way in the future.   
 I was lucky to have a pretty good draw for the first round.  Starace is not the kind of player that likes to play on grass so much.  Although I have to say I was really surprised with the speed of the court.  It was really slow.  The balls were getting bigger.  It was not expected.  I expected a bit faster court.   
  
  Q.  What about the wind?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  I think it was okay.  It was not so bad.  Now they put away the roof.  The court gets more sunshine.  The court gets more wind.  A lot of different things are involved.  The conditions were okay.   
  
  Q.  I saw video footage of you talking to Figo in Rome.  Were you discussing your week in Portugal?   
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  I did discuss a little bit about Portugal.  For me it was a great experience to meet a football legend.  I'm a big fan of the football, all the sports.  I was lucky to be in the same hotel with the Inter squad, players.  I met all the players from Inter.   
 It was great to speak with Figo.  We talk about Benfica.  He told me he was playing for Sporting.  It was okay.
