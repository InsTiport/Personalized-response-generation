D. MEDVEDEV/N. Djokovic   
3-6, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  He started changing his tactics, going bigger midway through the second set.  How were you attempting to cope with that at that point?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I thought I played really good match.  Yes, maybe in those games, especially in the third set when I was broken, at 1-All I could have done a little bit better, but, I mean, when someone serves 128-miles-per-hour second serve and doesn't make too many doubles faults and goes for every shot, I mean, you just have to put your hat down and congratulate him.   
I mean, he has played amazing tennis from 4-3 in the second set.  Not much that I could really do.  I mean, I tried to return his serve.  And when I had my racquet on the ball I was returning also his serves, but you can't really predict someone or prepare yourself for someone serving that big second serve consistently from 4-3 to the end of the match with making maybe two double faults out of God knows how many serves.   
Well done.  I mean, he definitely has a lot of confidence.  When you have so much confidence, then obviously you allow yourself to go for these kind of shots.  I congratulate him.  He deserved to win the match.   
 Q.  He's won a ton lately.  Finals at Washington, Montreal, and now here.  Do you think he could be ready to win the US Open?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, look, you know, he deserves to be in the mix, certainly, with all his results.  He's working his way to top 5 of the world.  He's definitely one of the best players in the world at this moment.   
He deserves to be in the contention for the championship in New York.  But again, it's best of five.  It's two weeks.  It's Grand Slam.  It's a different environment, different experience.  It just takes, you know, much more, I think, than just your game.  I think it takes patience and ability to know how to deal with all the off-court things, the importance of a slam.   
He's been doing well, you know, in most of the tournaments.  Slams, he still has, you know, yet to break to the last, so to say, 8 or last 4 of the slam, as is Zverev, for example, you know, who is again an amazing player, struggling in Grand Slams.  Because Grand Slams are just different tournaments, you know.  They have so much challenges on and off the court for a tennis player.  It messes up with your mind at times.  But that's why, over the years, you know, you gain experience that helps you.   
 Q.  Tactically you were going down the line quite a lot in the extended rallies rather than just going crosscourt.  I wonder if that was part of the game plan.  Did things shift as the match went on?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I thought tactically I was doing really well.  I mean, I had some breakpoints second set.  You know, I was one shot, one point away from taking a break in the second set and maybe taking the match in straight sets.   
I thought I was mixing my serve very well.  You know, you can't do much really if 30-40 comes up with two aces.  Second set then 3-All, Love-30 he comes up with  ace second, ace first, ace second.  What can you do?  It's one of these things that, one of these kind of situations where you just have to accept it, and I don't think I have done too much wrong, to be honest.   
I'm very pleased with the way I have played entire tournament.  Obviously it hurts to lose a match.  Of course it does.  But at the end of the day, I'm positive about my game.   
 Q.  In your previous two matches with Daniil they were really long rallies.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  Today, as you said, he was impressive.  Have you seen as much adaptability in any of the young players than this?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he certainly improved since Australian Open this year.  His forehand is better.  His movement is better.  I mean, his serve was always big.  You know, again, I did not experience this too many times in my career that someone goes so big on second serve and just serves two first serves basically for extended period of time.   
That's one of those things where you just, you know, take your chances.  I don't think I can kind of say that he improved his second serve.  You know, he was serving two first serves from one point of the match till the end of the match.   
But before that, when I could take my chance on the second serve, I was doing pretty well.  But there is certainly an evolution in his game and improvement.  He's going in the right direction, and it's why he's doing so well.   
 Q.  Daniil went big with his second serve.  You have gone big with returns and other shots in your career, as well, big stages and big moments.  Why do you think it's hard to bring that more often?  Apparently it works.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, you see only when it works, or actually you remember when it works (smiling).  But then probably works one out of maybe five times.   
I mean, I can't speak on behalf of the other players.  I mean, it's just sometimes it does work; sometimes it does not.  It just happens in the moment I guess you're able to follow your instinct and read the serve of your opponent and just be in the right balance to hit the shot.   
It's not always easy, especially when you're returning.  But when you're serving, obviously you can take more chances, but again, you need to feel well.  You need to feel well with conditions, with balls, with the percentage of your serve.  Everything seems to fit in quite well today.  That's why he took his chances and  rightfully so.  It worked.   
 Q.  Last time we will see you before New York.  Curious what you're feeling about how prepared you are for the US Open.  What are your plans between now and your first round there?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, as I said, look, I see mostly positives really in my game.  Today I did lose a tennis match, but I didn't do too much wrong.  I lost to a player that was playing amazing, so I'll take that and I'll move forward to New York and have a good practice week.   
Then, of course, get myself ready for the Open.  I love playing in those conditions there, center court.  Gonna go to fight for a title as everyone else does, and I like my chances.  I mean, I feel good, and I look forward to it.
