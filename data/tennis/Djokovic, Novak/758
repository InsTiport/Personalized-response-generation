R. SODERLING/N. Djokovic
  7-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. It's obviously been a very grueling few weeks for you. Did That rather show up today? Running on empty a little bit, perhaps? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, well, I didn't enjoy playing today's match, that's for sure. He was serving really well. All credit to him. 

 Q. How tired are you? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Very. 

 Q. Do you believe you can pick yourself up and be ready for your Nadal match? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know. I will see. 

 Q. Do you think the late finish you had against Davydenko affected you today? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't think so. No, not that much. 

 Q. Thinking about this year, which do you think you played too much? Was your tournament too much? Which moment of the season was too much for you?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't think I played too much. I just played very solid in all the tournaments that I was committed to play. 
 So I played all the tournaments that I had to play. I played them all. 

 Q. Is it only fatigue of the year or is it something special today? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's just fatigue of the whole year. 

 Q. It's something you've discussed at length. I know it's difficult now, but in terms of calendar, you're in a position of responsibility on the Tour. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know. I prefer not talking about it now, because I don't feel like. 

 Q. How well did Soderling play today? Are you surprised how impressively he's come into this tournament?
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he has nothing to lose. I think it's his first Masters Cup. He won four straight sets and absolutely deserved to qualify for semifinals. I think he's the best player so far in the tournament.
