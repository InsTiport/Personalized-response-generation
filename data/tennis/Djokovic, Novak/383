N. DJOKOVIC/M. Klizan
  6‑0, 5‑7, 6‑1

Q.   What happened there at 5‑4 in the second? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Credit to Martin for battling and making me playing extra shot.   It was pretty different game in the second set than it was in the first.   I obviously felt great in the beginning of the match, and then in the opening three games second set I made two double faults and kind of got him got into the match. 
Well, I had many opportunities to serve for the match at 5‑3, but just didn't find a way through to finish off in straight sets. 
Again, credit to him for playing well, fighting.   I did drop the level at the second set, but, you know, in the third I managed to bounce back and get a win.

Q.   What did you tell yourself at the start of the third?   The momentum had changed. 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, I have been in these particular situations before many times in my career, and the experience obviously helps just to regroup and find a way.   It's always finding a way. 
Sometimes it's the way it goes.   This is sport.   It's difficult to play from the first to the last point the way I played in the first set.   I knew he was going to start playing better once he gets into the match, once he feels the, I would say comfortable, finds a comfortable feeling on the court in which he doesn't play that often. 
It's the first match on this tournament.   It's always tricky playing against a quality opponent like Martin.   I knew that. 
I did lose that concentration and intensity that I had in the first set in the beginning of the second, and I paid the dividends.
But luckily for me I managed to find a way.

Q.   Was your expectations going into the match and throughout the match the same, or you thought it might be higher in a difficult period and it wasn't? 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I expected a tough match.   I knew that he has nothing to lose and he is very solid from both forehand and backhand angle.   He can hit shots very well.
He's a bit unpredictable player because he can make a lot of unforced errors, but in the other hand he can also make a lot of winners and make you play. 
So second set, especially towards the end, he played very well.   He was attacking my second serve and dictating the play. 
But as I said, I managed to find a way.   Started swinging a little bit more in the third and played well.

Q.   You said experience was a big factor in getting you through that.   Is it still a method in stopping yourself from getting frustrated when you're so close to winning the match?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I was frustrated, no doubt about that.   And every athlete goes through ups and downs and various emotions during the matches like this, and it's important always to regroup and maintain that self‑belief and composure, because that's something that always gives you a W, which you are looking for.

Q.   (Regarding next opponent.)
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I haven't seen him play much.   Last couple years I know he struggled with injuries, but I remember him in junior days.   Very talented player, and another player that has nothing to lose.   Is going to be one of his few matches that he played on the center stage. 
I've got to be going out on the court and playing the way I played in first set and third set, and I think I have a good chance to win.

Q.   (Regarding the weather and the crowd.)
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, the crowd was great.   You feel the great vibe about tennis here in the city.   Very international crowd.   A lot of Latin American people.   They are very emotional and they love to get involved. 
So for me, it's very enjoyable to be spending every moment on court.

Q.   After the second set were you scared that maybe the level might be harder as he got into the game?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Honestly, I just felt that I would definitely elevate my performance as I start third set.   I felt under pressure last couple games second set.   I got a little bit tight.   As I said, he dictated the game from the groundstrokes. 
I knew I was going to come back and start playing better.   I have been into these particular situations before, and that helped.
