THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Have you noticed the renewed aggression in Roger's game? How do you go about handling that here of course and in New York?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I think he's more aggressive here than in any other tournament because the surface and conditions allow him to play very fast. He generally copes well with the fast balls, fast game. He likes this rhythm.  
I don't too much. It was right tactics for him. I knew coming into the match he was going to be aggressive. No question about it. So I tried to handle. I've done well until the tiebreak first set; after that, he was just the better player.  
Made some double faults, dropped my service game. The way I played this week, it's great I managed to reach the finals.  
   
 Q. Talking about the tiebreak, it was a very close match and he took the tiebreak. You did double fault three times your first service game after that. Were you still hanging onto the breaker a little bit at that point?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Not too much. He puts a lot of pressure on your second serves and comes in. Yeah, just lost the rhythm on my serve completely second set.  
You know, couldn't capitalize on the opportunities. Maybe I didn't have break points, but I had couple times deuces, 30‑all.   
Just unfortunate in those moments.   
   
 Q. Was the stomach pain from yesterday a factor today?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No.   
   
 Q. How tough was it to just go into a match, another final in Cincinnati, and come up here as the runner‑up?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, it's sport. You can't win all the time. I won many matches this year. Of course it's disappointing at this stage to reflect on the match. Could have done some things better, but I lost to a better player, no question about it.   
I have to deal with it. US Open is behind a corner, and I have to already turn the next page. Hopefully I can do well there.  
   
 Q. You hit a couple returns pretty much right at the service line. I was wondering, you played him 40 times before and he hasn't done that much. What did you make of that strategy?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: He's very, very aggressive on his‑‑ when he's returning second serves he was trying this week something new. I have no comment about it.   
   
 Q. I'm sorry if you already answered this one, but how much did you want to win this one considering you won all the other Masters 1000?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Of course it was playing an important role in my approach to this tournament. Does every year for last couple years.  
This year I got to the finals, step closer. Let's see. I'm going to keep going, keep fighting to make the history.   
Obviously it's a great incentive and inspired me to come back and play my best tennis.  
   
 Q. You played Roger many, many times over many, many years. How does the Roger you played today compare to the Roger from other days?   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As I said, he plays more aggressive here. The surface and conditions here play in his favor very much so.  
I find it easier to play against him in some other tournaments than here. That's all. He's very good on this center court. He's more confident each year.   
   
 Q. Sixth game of the second set, long game, you held off three break points. Did you get the feeling that you were able to come back? We've seen you do it so many times.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, yes, next game I was close. I think couple of points, long exchanges, and deuce I challenged call. Was just a little bit wide. I went for backhand down the line.  
That's what happens. One or two balls can really decide the match or turn the match around as well. It wasn't to be this time.  
   
 Q. Going into New York how are you feeling with two finals of Masters events and a lot of matches?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes, a lot of matches, that's a positive. Played a couple good matches and couple not‑so‑good matches. Still not very happy with my form and with my game, but I have a week to work on it.  
Conditions in New York suit me a little bit better, so I look forward to it.  
   
 Q. What about the elbow? Is that okay?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Luckily that's gone. It's fine.
