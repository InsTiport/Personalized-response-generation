N. DJOKOVIC/A. Mannarino
7-5, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations on your 800th win.  What does this mean to you?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's a milestone, and of course it's a great achievement.  Every achievement is a great achievement.  I should be happy for it and proud of it.
You know, when you work all your life for something and then you get awards for it, of course -- and of course also throughout your career, you're enjoying the process, as well.  It's obviously very positive and I'm thrilled.  I'm grateful, as well, as I'm able to play so many matches and to win so many matches in my career.
It's still the sport that I love with all my heart.  I put in that heart every single day, and, you know, I'm just very glad to be able to play semifinals here after, you know, Rome and Roland Garros tournaments that went pretty well for me.
But before that, it was a struggle with surgery and elbow and up-and-downs and trying to figure things out and get that consistency in the game.
So I'm really glad that I was able to play the way that I did in the first three matches in this tournament, and hopefully I can keep it going.
Q. You have spoken before, saying you'd like to play until you're 40.  Do you think it's conceivable...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: 50, 60, 70.  I don't know.  And I don't want to put any limit or any number to it.  (Smiling.)
I will play as long as I feel like playing and as long as I have, you know, support from up there and from down here, you know.  So hopefully I can have many more years, because I truly enjoy playing this sport.  Of course it's not every day delightful to hit the tennis ball.  There are days where maybe you feel less like playing, but you go through them, and we all are people and we all go through various emotions.
But we learn from it, and, you know, I'm just grateful because I'm able to do something that I really truly love and enjoy and be successful in.
Q. If you were to play that long and get to 40, that would be another nine years...
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Who said 40?  I said 50.  So it's 19 years.  I have plenty of time to make couple more wins (smiling).
Q. What I was going to ask is if you were going to play for that sort of long, at what sort of rate will you need to keep winning at to keep the desire to keep playing?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I really can't answer that question, because, you know, I don't think that much ahead, especially when it comes down to tennis.  And at this moment, under the circumstances, I have to be trying to stay in the present moment as much as I can and get the best out of it.
You know, there were times when I was thinking and questioning everything when I was injured and going through surgery process, but, you know, everyone has those moments.  Everyone has, you know, doubtful moments.  Everyone has moments when they are feeling like everything goes their way.
So that's life.  You know, life comes in cycles and teaches you lessons.  Whether you're going to learn them or not, it solely depends on you.  My perception is that, you know, the strength comes within and longevity comes within as much as I, you know, pay attention to the self-awareness and self-care in every aspect of that word, you know, that much of results I'm going to reap.
I don't know.  As I said, I don't like to put any numbers on how long and when it's going to end.  I would rather see things, hey, I'm playing, I'm playing great, back again, I'm 31 on the paper, but I'm 19 in the real sense (smiling).  I just love to keep on going and see where it takes me.
Q. Are you getting excited about the match tonight?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Very excited, yes.
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about does the rivalry you have with the two Swiss tennis players, Federer and Wawrinka, how does that compare with tonight's match?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm sure there is going to be a lot of texting, private texting and social media texting between all of us tonight.
Well, I mean, it's pretty big match for both nations.  Switzerland has had a great success, you know, lately in football and very solid team.  Serbia is just assembling a young team that really is creating a wonderful synergy, and they have played really well first match.
It's big occasion.  World Cup, football is the most popular sport on this planet.  We all follow it.  We all support our nations and teams.
Tennis rivalry has nothing to do with this match tonight, but I'm sure that we are all going to be very excited to see every minute of it.
Q. Can you tell us who is going to win and why?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: You know the answer to that question already (smiling).  I know you would like Switzerland to win, but of course I want Serbia to win.
Q. What are you expecting from the match tomorrow, either Chardy or Tiafoe?  What are you expecting?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, Chardy has been playing really well on grass this year.  He won Surbiton challenger.  I followed his results.  He played finals 's-Hertogenbosch, I think.  He's won many matches so far.
I think being able to play that many matches and win in a row, you know, builds confidence, especially on this surface that we don't have a long season on this surface.  So, you know, he got plenty of matches under his belt in last couple of weeks.
He is feeling confident and comfortable, as well.  I have seen him play a little bit, Chardy.  He has a powerful serve and I have played him many times also on grass.  Big forehand.
It's semifinals.  Look, you know, you've got to step out on the court whoever you play and play your best, and right now I'm just excited to be in semifinals.  I haven't had too many of those, you know, last 15 months.  So let's hope that I can get a chance to fight for a trophy.
Q. Do you feel you have more clarity on the court now?  You mentioned Rome, Paris, here, you have been winning.  Do you feel you have more clarity?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It's a combination of things.  You know, obviously more matches you win, the better you feel on the court.  It's obvious.  It's logical, as well.
You just try to build the momentum.  Sincerely when I came back after surgery, I thought that it's not going to take me too long to build that momentum, but obviously it was proven to be otherwise, you know.  It took me quite a few months to actually feel, you know, feel comfortable playing again on this level, back-to-back matches and playing consistently well.
Yeah, I'm just very excited to be able to win in straight sets against very good players, you know.  Mannarino is a very tricky player to play against on the grass.  Against Dimitrov I won also comfortably yesterday.
So the level is there.  Now it's a question of, you know, maintaining it and just being in the right state of mind and taking every day at a time and getting the best out of myself.
