N. DJOKOVIC/T. Fritz
6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It looked much better than your first match.  Did you feel like that on the court, too?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yeah, it felt better, for sure.  It was very challenging to play in these kind of conditions.
Taylor, you know, plays really quick and has a big serve and just flattens the ball.  Doesn't really have a clay court game, but he has done well this tournament.
Obviously today we had five, six close games in the first set and just managed to break his resistance midway in the first set.  After that, obviously things went on my side and I felt more comfortable, you know, as I said.
But even though, still one of these days where you just have to hang in there and try to put an extra ball back in the court, and that was enough.
Q. You're getting Medvedev next.  How do you see that going?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, he has improved his movement a lot, I think.  Obviously his results are showing that he's close to top 10 of the world.  He's definitely in the form of his life.  He's had a good tournament so far here, winning quite comfortably in the first two matches and then now against Tsitsipas today.
We have never faced each other on clay.  We have faced each other in a close four-setter in Australia this year.  I know what's expecting me.  I have seen him play.  I have practiced with him many times.  I'm looking forward to it.
