THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Firstly, you drawed your name, then you drawed China.   What is next?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I will try to improve the 'China' one.   I didn't feel that many people understood.   
How was it?   
   
 Q.   Actually, it's wrong sequence.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Wrong sequence?   
   
 Q.   The character is right, but wrong sequence.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I'll make sure I make that happen for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   On the match today, pretty commanding performance once again.   Why is it that you play so well when you play Tomas?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Obviously it's a big challenge when you play a top 10 player.   Tomas is in great form in last couple of months.   It's always difficult player to play against on any surface because he has a very powerful serve and great forehand.   
But, you know, movement today was very important from my side, to be on a very high level so I can try to get into the longer rallies where I find more chances on my side, you know, to win those rallies.   
Played tactically right.   I was putting a lot of returns into the court, making a lot of pressure on his serve.   On the other hand, I was serving well when I needed to.   
Played a great match overall.   
   
 Q.   About tomorrow's final.   You said on court you choose neither Federer or Murray, you don't want to face them.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   They asked me if I want to choose.   I don't want to choose anybody.   Why should I choose?   
   
 Q.   My question is, what are you prepared to do?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I'm preparing for tomorrow's match, whoever I play against, to win.   That's my mindset.   It will always be like that.   
   
 Q.   On Andy Murray, since Wimbledon when he made the final, what have you noticed that has changed about him on court?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   He's a bit more aggressive, I think.   It's obvious on the court.   He goes more for his forehand, you know, which wasn't his strength in the past.   Now this year he's improved that stroke and he's more confident on the court, has more self‑belief.   
He's got the results.   He won a Grand Slam.   
   
 Q.   If it is Andy, does the word 'revenge' come in at all?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I don't like word 'revenge.'   I never like revenge.   I just play tennis and I try to win every match that I play on.   
   
 Q.   You're obviously winning the Chinese crowd over.   Have you thought about maybe incorporating some traditional clothing into what you do?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   No, not really.   I haven't thought about that.   
But knowing the Chinese fans and knowing how creative they can be, I wouldn't be surprised that that comes out on their mind tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   One thing I know, the Chinese love lucky red undies, underwear.   
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I guess that's not an option.  
   
 Q.   I want to ask a question about the big four:   you, Andy, Roger and Rafa.   You have won the past four year Grand Slams except the US Open 2009 and all the ATP 1000 Masters this year.   I just asked the same question to Tomas.   He said it's too tough to win a title.   So what do you think about it?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   What can I tell you?   I mean, the top four guys have been the most dominant.   Everybody's trying to achieve their best.   It's a very competitive sport.   It became more physical and also more mental than I'd say 10, 15 years ago.   
We're taking the sport to another level.   It's very professional.   Every player is trying to stay as healthy as possible and perform his best on major events.   
It turned out to be that the four guys are taking all the big trophies.   It's good for the sport.   I'm very glad to be one of those four guys, definitely.   That's the way it is.
