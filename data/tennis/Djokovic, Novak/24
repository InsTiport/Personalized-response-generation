N. DJOKOVIC/D. Dzumhur
6-1, 6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Your second-round match against Kyle Edmund, what are you anticipating from him?  Has one of the biggest forehands in the business.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   He does have a really good serve and forehand, two really big weapons.  I had some really good matches against him in the past, Wimbledon, tough four-setter a few years ago.  He doesn't feel so much pressure I think playing on the big court.  He actually likes the challenge.  I have a lot of respect for him.  He's a really hard worker, puts a lot of hours on and off the court into perfecting his game.
His results were kind of up and down a little bit, but I think he does have the game and the potential to be in the top 20 without a doubt, where I expect him to be soon.  So it's going to be a tough one.
I'm sure he has not so much to lose in that match.  It's important for me to start off well, the way I did today.
Q. How does the absence of a big-crowd atmosphere affect your actions on the court?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Well, the intensity, it was there definitely.  I mean, I came out, played really well the first set.  Second set I lost my focus, kind of got stressed out a couple times, screamed (smiling).  That's obviously still there, regardless of the empty stadium.  But this is what I bring to the court.  I bring a lot of intensity, energy.  Sometimes my reactions may not be so positive, but I try to bounce back.
It was tough.  I mean, second set, there was a lot of long rallies, and he wasn't missing much so it was kind of anybody's game.
We're all trying to get used to these kind of circumstances, having big LED screens on the side, kind of behind the court.  Obviously seeing the rest of my team and my family and my friends on the screen tonight was a delight.  Truly it was really, really nice.  It brought a smile to my face, kind of motivated me to keep on playing well.
I was speaking with the USTA people.  They still did not clarify and determine when are they going to switch on the screens, whether it's going to be after points, games, sets.  They are kind of testing it out.
I think it was fine.  It was not bothering us players obviously serving or playing.  I think most importantly not during play.  It was fine.  It was not hindering the play.  At least you get a sense that they are with you virtually.
We were trying to make the most out of this situation, obviously the players, USTA, everyone involved in the organization.  I mean, it's definitely not easy.  Everyone is trying their best.
Q. The discrepancy over the serve clock rule, it seemed as though you felt it was being started sooner than it was during the Western & Southern Open.  You weren't aware it was going to be different during the US Open?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   Yes, that's the problem that I have.  I was not aware of it.  No one really brought it to my attention.  The lack of communication is something that worries me once again.  I mean, that's something that really upset me.  I don't mind if someone communicates and maybe asks the opinion of us players because we're the ones who are supposed to play.  But it's going to greatly affect the match.
We've played in the certain tempo, so to say, got used to it during the Western & Southern tournament, which just ended two days ago.  Two days later we have a different rule that was just not communicated to us.  That's something that I found just not acceptable, not fair.  But I guess I have to deal with it, and that's it.
I just think there should be a better job done in communication with players prior to changing things like this.
Q. You'd be kind of hard pushed to find a pundit or commentator who is not backing you for this title.  You've not lost a match this year.  I assume you're feeling pretty confident in your own abilities.  You've been on big win streaks before.  Not new ground for you.  What do you think is the biggest problem for you or any other player when you get on these long streaks?  Where is the moment you feel you're most likely to trip up?  Are you in danger of becoming complacent or overconfident, start feeling kind of invincible?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I can speak on my own behalf obviously.  Every player has a different way of, I guess, approaching these streaks.  I mean, there are not too many players, both men and women, that have had long streaks of 20 plus matches won in a row.  But having had that experience for me couple times before in my career obviously helps because I am aware of it absolutely.  I can't lie.
I'm also not overanalyzing or I'm not overthinking about it.  By virtue of potentially doing that, I would put an additional pressure that I really don't need at this point.  I know pressure is a privilege, pressure is part of what we do.  I try to embrace it.  I don't have an issue with pressure because I'm used to it.
I have had so many matches in my career that I kind of won when I was down, big slams and stuff.  I know what I need to do and how to behave, how to make myself calm and composed and focused on what really needs to be done.
I know it sounds like a phrase, like a clich√©, but I really try to focus on every match individually and really force myself to really be in the present moment.  What do I need to do in order to win against that guy on a given day?  As simple as that sounds, it's very effective, particularly in these kind of circumstances.
Having a Grand Slam with a match every second day actually is favorable I think for me in this particular situation because I get always an extra day in between matches to recover, recharge the batteries - mentally, as well, emotionally as much as physically - then get ready for the next challenge.
Do I want to keep the streak going?  Of course, I do.  Am I thinking about it as a priority number one every single day?  No.  It's there, and of course it's an additional motivation for me.  It actually fuels me to play even stronger, play even better, I think bring the right intensity every match.
Q. Midway through the second set you seemed to be annoyed by something and shouted in the direction of the stands.  Who were you shouting at and what was it about?
NOVAK DJOKOVIC:   I was shouting at my box.  Not the first time, probably not the last time (smiling).  I was frustrated with my game, with some of the shots that I was playing at that time.  Just I guess channeled it out in that way.
That's I guess not always the reaction that I want.  As I said, that's kind of a game and kind of an intensity that I bring on the court.  Sometimes these things happen.
