   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  So how did you enjoy your first night match at Ashe Stadium? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  It was fantastic, you know.  It's a new experience for me and, you know, it was a lot of excitement.  So I was trying to be focused, and I knew it's something new, something else, and playing at the biggest court in tennis.  It was something new and something I never experienced. 
 So it was a lot of people and as a third seed, a lot expectations; I was a favorite in the match.  But for me it was very important to remain calm and just focus on my game. 

 Q.  You've risen so quickly to where you are.  How much adjustment does it take to get used to that? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Well, you know, you always have some pressure, of course.  It's normal that there are a lot of expectations for me.  You know, here especially in the US Open because I made an incredible run on this surface in Indian Wells, Miami and Montreal.  So a lot of people see me already in the last four of these tournaments.  But I'm not trying to think about that too much. 
 You know, I was on the edge to lose the second round.  I played against a great player.  I'm really happy that I managed to recover and be 100% ready for this match, which I was really skeptical about.  After five-hour match can I recover in the first place and be ready, which I did.  Now we are looking forward to next challenge. 

 Q.  Was it important to have an easier match or quicker match tonight? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Yeah, it was very important.  That's why I was from the start really concentrated, and I tried to be aggressive from the start.  You know, Del Potro is a player I never played against, but he's a very talented player, and he had some good results on this surface this year:  He won against Baghdatis, if I'm not wrong, in Miami and here he won against Melzer.  So I knew he had a couple of nice wins, and I knew that he doesn't have anything to lose again. 
 I needed to be myself and to play just my game and be aggressive, which I did. 

 Q.  Was there anything surprising to you about the night match?  Anything that struck you as you didn't expect? 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Well, you know, a lot of things I didn't know about the center court.  I've seen it on the TV and it was a very, very exciting to hear the music between the games and, you know, it was something new.  Here it's all about entertainment, show, and I think the people really enjoy tennis and like it.  There's a lot of supporters.  A lot of people stayed late, and I'm really thankful for that. 
 It's a new experience and it was nothing negative going on.  It's just really happy to win and to experience such a great court. 

 Q.  You had that one exchange of volleys with him.  You were winning that game by a lot, but still you were intent on chasing down all of those volleys. 
 NOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Yeah.  It was a point where -- I think at that point we both tried to be a little bit, you know, funny, I can say in one way, and tried to do some exhibition strokes.  Just make the people laugh and enjoy.
