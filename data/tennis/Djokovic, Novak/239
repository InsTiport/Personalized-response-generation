THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You obviously had a bumpy at times second half of the last year.  With the off-season, title in Doha, beating Andy there, do you feel more or less back on track?  Is it that quick a fix or is it more a process still going?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I feel that already in London, World Tour Finals, I played very well, comparing to the three months, four months before that, where I was, you know, kind of struggling to find that right level in quality of tennis.   
But, you know, I've worked very hard as I guess most of the players in the off-season, trying to get myself in a right state of mind, in a right shape and form.  I couldn't ask for a better start of the season, saving some match points in the semifinals, playing a really exciting match against Verdasco, then the next day against Andy.  You know, thrilling final.  It was great.   
I got a lot of match play.  Arriving to Melbourne, really excited to compete.   
 Q.  You have a quite brutal first round against Verdasco again.  How do you see that one?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, I hope I will not get to the stage where I have to defend match points.   
Again, you know, Fernando is a very complete player on any surface.  In a given day, if things go right, he can beat really anybody on any surface, as I said.  Nadal last year in five sets, he won first round.  He has won against most of the top players.  He's not overwhelmed by, I guess, the occasion of playing on center court.  He has had that experience many times.   
So, again, a lot depends, of course, on how I feel, how he feels.  It's the first match of the Grand Slam.  We both need to start with the right intensity, of course.  We're going to be obviously striving to do so.   
But I'm expecting a tough one, there's no doubt about it.   
 Q.  Can you run us through your coaching team at the start of the season, let us know whether you're thinking about bringing somebody else in.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I'm not thinking of bringing anybody in.  This is the coaching team that there is, yeah.   
 Q.  Marian Vijda?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Yes.  And Dusan Vemic is the second coach.   
 Q.  It's going to be hot in a few days.  Do you relish the heat or do you struggle?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't know still a player that enjoys playing in 40 plus or 35 plus.  It's same for everybody, you know.  It's not easy, obviously.  In the end of the day, that's what you expect.  You come to Australia during the summertime, and the conditions can get quite challenging and extreme.   
But, as I said, you're preparing for that.  Same for you and your opponent.   
 Q.  On the Verdasco draw, people have called it a nightmare.  Do you consider it a nightmare draw or...  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I still haven't had in I nightmares, so I can't call it a nightmare draw.  I just see it as a huge challenge.  I hope I'll be able to deliver.   
 Q.  Do you see yourself as being in sort of a similar position to where you were three years ago, where you're having to reestablish the air of invincibility?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I never had an invincibility, although I thank you for the compliment.  Nobody is invincible.  I never thought of myself as a superior player on the court, even though of course at times I was very confident, I was winning a lot of matches.   
But, you know, knowing how it feels on the court, if you get overconfident, that's why I don't want to get into that kind of state of mind.  I still want to put myself in a position where I'm quite even to other players, fight for this trophy as anybody else, even though I'm defending champion.   
The fact that I've done so well in Melbourne Park the last 10 years of my career basically, it's been the most successful Grand Slam that I've had, of course gives me a lot of thrill, a lot of confidence and excitement to approach it.   
 Q.  Putting aside invincibility, do you feel there's similarities to where you were three years ago?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I can't compare, really, the seasons.  I've been saying this before.  Every year brings a new challenge personally and as a player.  You're just a different, different person.  Every cell in your body every day changes.   
It's hard to really compare any kind of year.  I just see it as a learning curve, as a process of developing into a more mature player, person, trying to get the best out of, you know, the circumstances, the live conditions that you're in in the moment.   
 Q.  The prospect of the seventh record-breaking title, does that sit in your mind, even at this stage?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Honestly, one of the reasons I'm here is to try to win every match that I play on, and eventually the title.  I'm not the only one that is sitting here and talking about the title.   
I love playing this sport.  I love competing.  I came in here as all the other 127 players to fight for this trophy, to enjoy competing.  Of course, it's an incentive, it's motivation.   
 Q.  Is there any specific reason as to why you do so well here?  You do well everywhere, but especially here.  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Well, one of the reasons is probably because it's beginning of the year.  I personally feel, I see many players feel very inspired and motivated to play their best tennis.  They have been through a period of five, six weeks with no official matches.  They recharge their batteries.  They're eager to get back on the court and play the sport.   
It's so early in the season, and we already have a first Grand Slam, one of the four biggest events in sport.  I think that's enough motivation for you to start off the season in best possible fashion.   
Conditions play their role, for sure.  I mean, I love playing on hard courts.  Especially night matches play a bit slower, which I like.  I guess it's a combination of things.   
 Q.  When you announced that you and Boris were going to go your separate ways, Boris did an interview in which he said that perhaps you haven't been working as hard in the recent months as you had earlier on in your career.  Do you think that is accurate?  If so, do you think that has changed now?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Boris and I have had an incredible three years.  I can't be more grateful to him, to our partnership, to our relationship, than I am.  We've had amazing success.  It's all I can say.   
I don't want to go back and comment on anything.  I kept a very friendly relationship with Boris.  We just went separate ways.   
 Q.  Obviously titles, preferably a Grand Slam, is most important to you.  How essential is it to you to get back to that No. 1 ranking?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: As a consequence of the results, if I become No. 1, that's great.  Of course, that's what I want.  But it's not my main priority, let's say.  I really would like to take one tournament at a time and try to win as many matches as possible.  Then, as I said, as a consequence to that, if I become No. 1, I'll be thrilled.   
 Q.  A word of the comeback of Roger Federer.  What do you expect from him?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I don't expect anything, and everything.  With Roger, you can always see a top level and quality of tennis.  I mean, that's what he brings.  He brings this aura of a champion on and off the court.  The sport definitely missed him.   
It's great to see him back, no question about it.  From a colleague/player perspective and point of view and fans, everybody loves to see Roger.  He's one of the most important people that ever held the racquet.  Of course, for our sport it's great to see him.   
 Q.  What do you think is the most challenging part for a comeback after a half-year absence?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: I think he's going to answer that question better.  But the fact he was absent because of his injury, I think that's obviously going to be the concern, maybe, or to see how that's going to play out.   
But he didn't seem to have any issues playing in Perth.  He's fit.  I'm sure he's very motivated because he hasn't played any official tournament ever since Wimbledon, I think.   
With all his experience, talent, everything he has achieved in his life, I don't think it's going to take too much of a time for him to really get back into that kind of competitive zone.   
 Q.  Yesterday we noticed you were blowing your nose during practice.  You appeared to have something with your eyes as well.  Any lingering health concerns at all?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: No (smiling).  It was probably the only time I blew my nose, when you saw it.  I'm a human being, as everybody else.  No, it's all good.   
 Q.  Last year's Australian Open was also associated with some revelations about match fixing.  12 years on, what are your reflections how far the sport has come, where we are on that journey, if you like?  Anything more on that?  
NOVAK DJOKOVIC: Ideally, we don't want to see any kind of match fixing occurrences and situations.  But unfortunately they do occur from time to time.   
I don't think there are too many.  I mean, we haven't experienced too many, even though every time something surfaces, of course everybody, especially media, makes a great deal about it.   
But generally, you know, looking I think ATP and all the authorities are doing a good job in kind of tracking down those kind of potential match fixing matches.  I haven't had chance to see too many cases.  Yes, there are some.  On a lower level, as well, lower category of the professional tournaments.
