ATP:   Novak Djokovic would like to ask for your understanding as he is unable to attend the press conference.   
As you know, he lost his grandfather today just before the match, and it was very hard for him to play.   After he won, he just felt totally exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally.   
Again, thank you for your understanding.
