C. GARCIA/P. Kvitova   
6-3, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The second set was pretty tight.  Actually Kvitova went up 2-0.  Walk us through how you were feeling in the second set.  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, it was definitely very tight.  Like the first set, every game was very important.  She was serving first, so I was down every single time.   
But I know against these kind of players, you have to be focused on your serve, try to be the most aggressive and put the pressure on the return when you have the chance.  Sometimes you will get aces or serve winner.  You just have to keep trying.   
That's what I did very well.  I served better in the second set, I think.  At 5-All, I tried to put some pressure on her and I get some free point.   
 Q.  What time did you go to sleep last night?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: 3.   
 Q.  What time did you wake up?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: 9, unfortunately (smiling).  Even 8, 8:30.   
 Q.  How did you feel when you woke up?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I couldn't sleep more, but I was so tired that I just wanted to stay in my bed.  Actually, I was starving so I went for breakfast.   
 Q.  Once you got onto the practice court today to start warming up, how did the body feel?  Coming off of that match last night, it's remarkable how you played so well.  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Outside of my quads, my back was a little bit tight, I was feeling okay.  I did a good recovery yesterday.  I took some times to do it, even if it was late.   
But, like, my warmup was a disaster, I have to be honest.  It was, like, very bad (smiling).  Like, sometimes you have to take experience from everything.  I know it was going to be difficult.  I was not going to feel the same as the previous matches.  But it's kind of experience I want.  That's why I work hard every day.   
The warmup was very bad, but I did a good preparation just before the match.   
 Q.  Have you surprised yourself at all with what you've done this week?  Wuhan, okay, but to back everything up...  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't want to surprise myself for now.  I will be surprise later.   
 Q.  Could I ask you if Johanna Konta is a little bit clearer in your sights now?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know.  Like I said, I know it's not all in my hand for Singapore.  I don't really want to be focused on it.  It's still a long way, so I just try to be on court, enjoy every minute, walk out, try to improve, and I will see how it goes.   
 Q.  How do you feel going into tomorrow's match against Halep?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, that's the kind of match I want to play, against the top players.  She's brand-new No. 1.  That's a match I look forward to it, even more in the final of a premium mandatory.   
It's going to be a battle for sure.  I played her in U.S., in Canada, a couple weeks ago.  She's a very tricky player.  I will have to play my best to have a chance.   
 Q.  Given the situation (Konta) that we're not going to talk about...  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes (smiling).   
 Q.  ...is your schedule any different from now until the end of the season?  I'm not mentioning that other place that begins with S near here, but just thinking about what tournaments you play next week and the week after.  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I try to be focus on the present for tomorrow's match.  I just try to get my body recover for tomorrow.   
For now I entered in Tianjin.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  For sure, my body and my health is the more important for me.   
If I go Tianjin and Moscow, and I do well, how I will be in Singapore.  The more important is to be healthy and to compete on court.   
 Q.  Do you have a place open to you in Moscow?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know.  I mean, I guess no.  I'm not top 20 or Russian (smiling).   
 Q.  On Simona, as you mentioned, she will go to No. 1 on Monday.  Do you have any kind of reaction to that or thoughts about her becoming the new No. 1?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, she's very consistent through the year, this year and the past year.  She didn't win a Grand Slam yet, but she did some final, and great results in the big tournaments.  I think it's fair that she's No. 1.  We saw it change a lot these last weeks.  It's very tight.  I think it's nice to see a battle for the world No. 1.   
No, I mean, I'm happy for her.  Everyone on tour work very hard to achieve their goal.  I guess that was one of hers for sure, so yeah.
