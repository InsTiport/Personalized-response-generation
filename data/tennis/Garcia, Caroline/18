C. GARCIA/S. Peng
6-4, 3-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
CAROLINE GARCIA: If you're going to talk to me, I can talk about the next match but no further.
Q. Thinking about the second round -- you see, I'm not talking about the third round -- where would you position your emotions?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It was very different.  I didn't feel as tense as I was in the first round.  Let's say I always have trouble against Shuai Peng.  It was a great difficulty in the third set.  She can do a lot of things with both hands.  I was ready for a very complex match.  I had to impose myself and not to lose too many points.
So I wasn't too tense, but sometimes I had opportunities to finish, and I didn't go for it.  That's the main thing.
But obviously in the third set, the public helped me incredibly.  There was an incredible atmosphere for a second round.  I didn't expect that.  That's what it is.  In Roland Garros you're inhabited by something in both ways.  You go and look for something in a way you have never done.  I encouraged myself.  I was boosting myself as I have never done.
In the same way you're inhabited because you want to do well and you stress.
But the public was incredible, and I felt incredible emotions.  Well, if I could have won in two sets it would have been better, but it was incredible, still.
Q. I'm not going to ask any questions about the third round.
CAROLINE GARCIA: You can about the third round.  It's just not the following.  That's it.  About the next round you can.  But I don't want to know what's going to happen in two rounds.
The next match I don't mind.  But I don't want to know if I win who I will play, because sometimes I'm asked questions...
Q. Well, then, like Gasquet, you had the winning ball in the end.  Is it some superstition?  Does it reassure you?  Is it like when you do your shadows, or...
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know if it's superstition.  But it was, Well, I like this ball.  You served well.  Let's recover it.  I'm not sure it's a superstition, because I don't do it all the time.
But from time to time, at the end of a set or in hot moments, I ask for the same ball again, because it enables me to focus.  It may sound a bit stupid but I do it from time to time.
Q. Next round you're playing Begu.  I know you always have big matches against her.  What is complicated about her?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Well, she's solid on both sides.  She spins her ball.  There is always some trajectory in her ball.  She has a service which is difficult to read.
She's tall.  She's powerful.  I don't know.  Every time we have incredible fights, one against each other.  She's rather good on clay with her lifted balls, lifted spins.  I haven't played her for a while, but it's going to be a nice duel for this third round.
Q. You say that the public helps you.  You found some forces, some strength.  But you get up in the morning saying, Well, I'm in Roland Garros, I feel stronger?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It's not the first thing I think about when I get up in the morning.  Roland Garros does inhabit me, but it's not the first thing I think about.
But it's true.  It's a pleasure to be here in Roland Garros.  I dreamt about playing here when I was young.  Today I'm here.  I go to the Stade Jean-Bouin to practice for the next match, so it's a pleasure to be here and to live these moments with my qualities, with the game level I'm producing, I have been producing over the past few weeks.  I may have an opportunity to go further than before.
And with the support of the public, which has always been with me but even more now, so I try to catch their positive energy.
Q. The wave, can it be a two-sided thing?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It has been in the past.
Q. You didn't look at it.  What happens when there is a wave?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Well, you can feel it.  You can feel what comes out of the public, the support.
But I grew up since 2011.  I know I have to remain focused on myself.  But it's positive for me.  It's also important for -- I try not to watch it, but you can feel the vibrations, obviously.
Q. What happened when you were 3-3 in the second set?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Nothing.  Total blank.  I dropped three games.
I don't know what happened.  We changed balls, and when I was hitting, there was something missing.  There was no intention.  This little thing that made the ball dangerous was missing, and she organized her game.
It's not like I forgot to hit.  I forgot to put an intention behind that and I dropped three games and I ended up in the third set.
