C. GARCIA/Y. Duan   
6-1, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: We will talk about any questions but nothing about after the second round, okay?  No other matches ahead of that.   
Any questions in French?   
 Q.  If we just look at the score, we get the impression that it was very well expedited.  If we look at it more closely, we realize it wasn't the case.  How did you approach the match, the first set games?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: There is no surprise I was a bit tense, a lot of frame, a lot of faults on my forehand.  I got a break right away, and when we were 1-All on my serve, I had several break points, and I wasn't playing extraordinarily.  I couldn't feel the ball, I was tense.   
But I managed to still win the game by doing simple things and taking all her unforced errors, and this helped me cool off.  And then for her it was more difficult on the next game.  I took everything, tried to take everything she could give me, really, and to do whatever I could, giving in very few points, being as precise as possible, and being focused.   
 Q.  People are expecting you here.  Did this increase your pressure the beginning of the match, or is the first round always complex for any French person in Roland Garros?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't think this increased my pressure, but it's true that in Roland Garros sometimes we are under more pressure than in another Grand Slam.  Since this morning I have been a bit tense but not extra tense.  I tried to manage it as best I could.  And she's got a special size.  I had the impression I had a giant on the other side; so it wasn't easy to start, even with pressure.   
Two or three times I hit with the frame, and I got a break right away.  I did what it took to win, even if it took me more time, I was ready for this, and I was able to overturn things.   
 Q.  In this case, what did you use?  Breathing?  We saw you do a lot of specific gestures of movement.  How did you manage it?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: This is may sound stupid, but breathing helps you a lot.  And also my father always tells me to make special movements, even when I'm not tense, movements, rhythm.  I try to use that, especially for the forehand.  I was a bit late on it, so I had to get better organized.   
It wasn't very high level, but it was a match where you had to be solid.  I had to play a good match, and I managed to do it.   
 Q.  The conditions are rather complex.  It rains.  It stops raining.  How do you like heavy clay?  Do you like it?  You don't like it?  Or you say, I don't care?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Well, I say, Never mind.  It's not my choice.  I play with what I have but it's true this morning it was rather funny because we played almost under the rain, so the conditions were different, and this afternoon we had some sun.  It was better.   
But as the courts are covered, they still remain rather quick even though we may have played under the rain at the beginning of the day.   
But it still remains quite quick as a surface.   
 Q.  You played on the Suzanne Lenglen Court.  Was it a request from you?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes.   
 Q.  This Suzanne Lenglen Court was refurbished last winter.  It's a bit deeper.  Does it change your perception?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I didn't notice.  I saw they had changed all the seats.  It's much lighter.  It's a great court.   
But the extra space didn't mark me.  I don't see the difference, I guess I don't play very much behind the line.
