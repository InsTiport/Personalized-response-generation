6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You had to work pretty hard for that, didn't you?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah.  I mean, you always have to fight very hard and work hard against Andrea.  She is big fighter, always trying to come back in the match.   
It was very difficult conditions, very windy, sometimes more than yesterday.  So always have to be ready for the ball.   
Yeah, sometimes was not very nice tennis, not very rhythmic, but you have to stay focused and, yeah, just keep your tactics on.   
 Q.  When you talk about the conditions, does that make you actually focus harder or does it make any difference?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: No, I don't think -- I mean, it's very windy sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other one.  You just have to be ready to play every ball and trying to, yeah, to be accurate or where you want to play and be aggressive still.   
Yeah, it was sometimes, like I say, not very good, not like a lot of unforced errors, but, yeah, just have to keep focused on what you want to do.   
 Q.  Your play was very fast and agile.  Is that also taking lots of energy from you for future games?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, it's always better to keep energized for next round.  Yesterday was very tough match against Carla and very tough to wait for like three hours.  You are burning a lot of energy.   
It's good today was a little bit lighter.  But I still have doubles later today.   
Yeah, I'm still young, but I need energy (smiling).   
 Q.  Given your current form and with what you come to do in this tournament and the fact that the top seeds are not in...  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Oh, I'm not the favorite yet, eh?  You know that?   
No, I mean, there is maybe no more seed but there is still very good players:  Ivanovic, Strycova, Svitolina, they are good and everyone can win this tournament now.   
But, yeah, you have to stay amble and know what you are doing the best, do it and give everything you have and just see after the result.   
 Q.  Your first premier WTA semifinal.  Good start of the year?  Fed Cup?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, it's good start of the year, but, like, I was in Perth, I won three matches but doesn't bring me back any points.  I won two singles in Fed Cup, but same, doesn't give me any points.   
Yeah, it's good now that I won some matches on the WTA Tour, and yeah, I got a lot of confidence.  I know my game is here, but you have to do another match.  It's never easy so it's good when everything come together.
