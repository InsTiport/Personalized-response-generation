S. WILLIAMS/C. Garcia
  6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You have played a bunch of matches against top players already in your career.   This was one of the closest ones so far in your career.   How did you think it went today?   How do you feel the match went for you?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No, definitely I play a good match, but it was not like ‑‑ you know, it was not like I played the best I ever play.   This time I did a lot of work and I'm growing in my game and growing in my head, also.
It was a good match to play and it was good test for me because she's good player and she's always fighting a lot.
No, I'm happy what I did but still disappointing because I didn't win, but it's good match.

Q.   Do you like getting to play these players a lot?   You played Serena a few times; you played Sharapova; you play the big players a lot. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, but it's always nice to play against big player.   You are working and practicing to play this match, because it's in this kind of match you can learn more.
Yeah, it's good, but next time I prefer to win than to lost, because in your head it's always more trust to win.

Q.   Are you the type of person who's going to lay away tonight and think, If I had done this on this point, this on this point I would have won?   Will you replay it over and over?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   I don't think I will play over and over, because I miss some little thing, but it was not like easy shot or I make double fault at the wrong point.
It was very tight match, and it was like she miss, I miss sometimes. 
But each time I miss I try to forget it, so I don't remember (smiling). 

Q.   So did you learn anything today?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Sorry? 

Q.   Did you learn anything?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   For the moment, I don't know what I learn and what I didn't learn, but I keep fighting during all the match.   Everything I was doing during the previous match I arrive to do it today,   so it's good for me.

Q.   At what point during the match did you feel the most confident, where you felt there was a chance where you could really maybe take the lead?   Was it that first game of the third set where you were up 30‑Love and you really had a chance?   And then you almost broke her that second game?   That seemed like it was an opportunity and maybe you could have gotten on a run there in the third set.   How did you feel?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   During all the match I feel I was not too far and I can go over her.
So since the beginning of the match I feel that I was, yeah, close to her.   I was not like 20 meter of each ball.   My serve was good.
So, no, I trust myself to do it and just play and always fight.

Q.   Was there a certain part of the match you felt the best, though, a moment where you said, I can do this?   I got it?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Well, the first time I broke her it was the first time in three match, so it was good.

Q.   So that was the moment?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah.   Well, it's always good when you arrive to broke someone like Serena because she have big serve.
But, no, when I start to play good and to broke her and to win my serve, it was good.

Q.   A lot of players are intimidated by Serena from the beginning of the match.   You can see the intimidation and people are timid and maybe don't play their best against her.   You didn't look at all intimidated by the opponent.   How is that?   Or were you and you just hid it well?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   It was my third time already, so maybe she was a little bit smaller than the previous one (smiling). 
But, no, I just try to forget it's Serena Williams, to forget that she won how many Grand Slams, and just be me and just play. 
And if I want to win a match like this, I have to play and don't think of my opponent, what she is doing in the past, but just be focused on what she's doing now and how I play now.

Q.   What are your goals for the rest of this year?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Keep working, keep doing matches, keep winning.
I know I will have some other match like this, and I have to improve and win this kind of match.

Q.   After you played Sharapova in the French Open, Andy Murray said he thought you'd be No. 1 someday. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah.

Q.   I'm sure you've heard that a lot. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah (smiling). 

Q.   What do you make of that?   Are you happy he said it or is there more pressure?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No.   I'm happy that he say this because he know tennis a lot.
So it was a good motivation for me, but maybe three years ago I was too young to understand to arrive and to arrive to work and live with this. 
And now I'm older and I grow in my head.   Just don't care of what people say.   I just care of what my family and my team say and what I say about myself.

Q.   But at the beginning it was hard to... 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yes.   I mean, everyone was talking to me about this, not my match, how I play.   Just, Murray say you will be No. 1.   And I was like 150 in the world, so it was not easy when you're like 17 years old and you are like nowhere and someone will say you will be No. 1.
  I'm happy he say this, because it's always good comments from someone like Andy.

Q.   Have you ever met him?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Sorry? 

Q.   Have you ever met Andy?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Just like this (smiling) (Casual gesture).

Q.   How did you get started in tennis?   What's your background with tennis?   Is it a family thing, or you just played it on your own?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   My parents was just playing for fun, and when I was young I start to play tennis.   Like I did some basket or whatever because you have to do sport when you are young. 
After I continue to play tennis.   Traditional, I mean.   Nothing special.

Q.   Your father still coaches you?   Your father is your coach?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah.

Q.   I saw AmÃ©lie Mauresmo was here watching you today.   She's beaten Serena before.   Did she have any particular advice on how to play Serena?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Couple of people told me how to play her.   I mean, she have always good advice for us, so we all trust her a lot.
Yeah, she beat her in the past, but now she's watching us to play her.

Q.   What are the tactics against Serena?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   To play long in the middle (smiling).
