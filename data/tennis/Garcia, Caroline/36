C. GARCIA/M. Brengle
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you summarize your own game today?  How would you critique yourself today?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I would say I served very well, and it definitely helped me to get some free points.  From the baseline I tried to be very low on my legs, because she was playing very low.  It was very difficult.
But I had to be very aggressive and put the pressure on her the most that I can.  I think I have been able to play very solid through the match.  It could be maybe a little bit better in the return, but it was not easy.
Q. So it was a difficult opponent to you today?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, she's a tricky player.  She's different than everyone.  She was serving very slow, but it was difficult to attack because it was low and slice.
Yeah, from the baseline, backhand come very fast.  Her forehand, it's not as good as backhand, but on grass everything is difficult.
Q. There has been a bit of criticism about the quality of that court, in particular.  How did you find it today?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I think to play on first match definitely helped.  My previous match I played over there on fourth match, and I thought the court was very bad for second round.  Today at 11:30 was okay.  It was nothing to say.
Q. What is it in particular that's difficult about it?  It's quite slippery at the back, is it?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, yeah, it can be slippery, but you have to be careful.  It's still grass.  I think every single court of grass court is difficult.  You have to be careful every single time.
But for sure to play at 11:30 was a big difference than the previous match on Court 18.
Q. Is it just something that just happens with grass?  It just wears away?  There's nothing that can be done in your opinion?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, from my experience, everything all the time, the more the draw goes, the more the courts are bad but it's like this.
Some people say it's slower.  I don't know.  But from my experience of today's match, it doesn't bounce at all (smiling).
Q. You may well play Jo Konta next if she wins.  You know what it's like to play under the pressure of a home Grand Slam tournament, back in France at Roland Garros.  What is it like to play with that pressure of the home crowd?  Because that's probably, if Jo gets through, that's what will happen to her.
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, there is a pressure and there is also the support.  Doesn't matter what you are doing.  They are behind you and they are supporting you.
Sometimes they give you more energy to go through some problem on court for everything.  I don't know.  I mean, her previous match was very complicated and very tough against Vekic, but I haven't seen any matches so I don't really know how she's playing or how the other one is playing in this tournament so far.
But for sure, if she's winning today, would be a very difficult match for me.
Q. Generally do you find that it's more a positive to have all the extra home support rather than the expectation being on you?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I'm not going to say it's positive every single time.  French Open has been difficult for me in the past, but I don't know too much how she played in the past years here, so I don't know how she react to everything.  But it can be difficult, but it can be also a lot of help, for sure.  You just need to know how you have to manage it.  It depends of everyone.  Is different for everyone.
Q. Do you know her personally?  Have you played against each other before?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, we did play in U.S. this year.  It was 7-6 in the third.  She's a great player, great serve, great forehand and moving, wanting to put pressure on the other one.  It would be very difficult.
Maybe I will play on Centre.  That's nice, actually.  I haven't played.
Q. Haven't played before?  Okay.  On your tournament so far, I mean, this is the furthest you have been at Wimbledon so far.  What do you put that success down to in particular this year compared to years past?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I mean, I don't know if there is one point in particular, but I just try to stay very focused on myself, on every match, and just focus on day by day.  I served pretty well for these three matches so far, so it's very important for my game.
I just try to play very low on grass courts and try to move more to the net, and for now it's working.
