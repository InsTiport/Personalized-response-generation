6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk just a little bit about what the transition was like leaving New York, the US Open hard courts, and sort of transitioning back over to clay so quickly, both here and for the French Open?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, it's definitely a few days to adapt yourself, and conditions are different.  Actually, I was surprised because it's very hot here in Rome and less humid, so the sensations are definitely different.  But it's very hot, and I think the clay are very good here.
During the month before US Open I was practicing on clay court, so maybe I was able to adapt a little bit easier, but, you know, matches are always different.
Yeah, a few days, but it's the same for everyone so you just adapt yourself.
Q. Do you think the fact that Roland Garros obviously and the Italian Open are being played in the fall and not the spring, is there any difference in the court, the balls that you have noticed, even though it's so hot in Rome right now?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Actually, I was expecting temperature to be lower, so I think it's even warmer than when we play in spring for now.  For sure, like more than 30 degrees every day.
I think the clay can be different, because normally in April it's a little bit cooler the months before, and now it's been probably like four months very hot on the court, so I think it's probably drier and faster.
