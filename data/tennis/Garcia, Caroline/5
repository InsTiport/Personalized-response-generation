A. BLINKOVA/C. Garcia
1-6, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. In the third set you were leading.  How come she came back?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It's true that I was leading 3-0 and then 4-1 and then I didn't score any game.  Well, what happened?  Nothing happened.  She played the match.  And then today things didn't go well for me.  I didn't manage to go all the way to the end of the match with the correct level of tennis, and she won.
Q. Did you at any time feel that things went tipping over?  Because until 3-0 in the third set you were hitting well.  Ball was okay.  And we didn't see this moment come.
CAROLINE GARCIA: I know how I hit the ball, and I can tell you the ball was not leaving the racquet as I wanted.  My game was not the game I wanted.  And it depends on maybe on the level of knowledge you have.  But my ball didn't leave the racquet.
Q. Why was this?  Because it's in Roland Garros?  Do you have any explanation?
CAROLINE GARCIA: No, no specific explanation.  Some days are just not a good time.  Your timing is off.
It wasn't a good day for me.  I wasn't efficient on the court.  I didn't have the right intensity.  She played a good match.  She put pressure on me.  She tried to attack.  Good backhand, changing directions, and I wasn't up to her level, both in the intensity in my shots and physically.
Q. Marion Bartoli this morning was commenting on the results here, women in Roland Garros, saying that there was a change in policy, and that the policy didn't come from the clubs and that there was not a sufficient pool of players to have champions.
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know what you're talking about.  What would you like me to say?  I don't know.
Q. It's the first time since 1986 that there is no French player, woman French player in the third round.  What can you say?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It's this thing that journalists tend to say.  You have your figure and is your metrics.  That's all I can say.
Q. What is uppermost in your mind, sadness or lack of understanding or deception?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Well, sadness and I'm disappointed with my result for this French Open.  But I'm not going to completely challenge everything.
Obviously this defeat hurts, because I wasn't able to fight as I wanted on the court.  Today was not my day.  It wasn't my thing.  Obviously I want to learn and continue progressing.
Q. You say you want to learn from your defeats.  Have you managed to progress after this kind of failure in the past?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Well, not sufficiently, obviously.  Otherwise I wouldn't be here today.  But some defeats teach you more than others.
