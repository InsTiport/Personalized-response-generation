E. MAKAROVA/C. Garcia
  7/5, 6/3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was the match today decided by those two set points you had at 4‑All?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No, I don't think so.   If I can serve better and return better it will decide the match, not the two set point. 
She serve well on these two, so not depends of these two balls.

Q.   How positive do you feel of the results you've had here, the run you've had here?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, it's good.   I get third round for first time, and I'm very happy right now about this. 
I will get a lot of confidence when I really can watch what is good in this tournament for me. 
After I look forward for the U.S. tournament.

Q.   With your game, do you think you can be very successful on grass? 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   I don't know if I can be more successful on grass than the other surface, but always take me a lot of time to adapt my game for the grass.
If I can serve better, of course I can play better on this surface.   But sometimes my forehand don't push too much the opponent on the grass.
But I do some adaptation and then it go better.

Q.   Can I ask you about Andy Murray's tweet saying that you could be a No. 1?   I'm sure you've been asked about it before.   Did it put pressure on you?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Three years ago it did, but now it's fine. 
It was good for someone like Andy say that about me.   But three years ago I was‑‑ I couldn't play with these kind of things.
It was too much, I don't know, stress and expectation.   It take me time to grow, and now it's okay.   (Smiling.)

Q.   Did you ever talk to him about it? 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Never.

Q.   So you felt that expectation came too early for you?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah.

Q.   But now you've grown into it?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah.   After three years it's okay.
