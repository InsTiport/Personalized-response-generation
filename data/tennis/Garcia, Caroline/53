THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   A very good win for you today and coming back from 2‑5 down, match points. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Two or one? 

Q.   2‑5. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Oh, yeah, yeah.   Sorry, yeah.

Q.   Talk about how you were able to turn that match around. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   It was very tight all the way to the end.   And 5‑2 I was still just one break.   I know I could do it, and I still fighting and play aggressive and do what I do the best.   First thing I won my game at 5‑2, so it was big things. 
Then I just try to do it and continue to put the pressure on her.   And after, just play on few balls and you never know what can happen.   So it's always very tight. 

Q.   The last few months your results haven't been maybe as good as the beginning of the season, so can you explain it or is there any particular reason?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   In season it's not always going the way you want, so sometimes it's very good, sometimes it's disappointing one.   Always have to train a lot and always keep confident in yourself, so that's what I did these couple of weeks to continue. 
I spoke a lot with my dad, was always here to say the right things for me.   So sometimes I have bad days, but after I have good mood and I know I can do it. 

Q.   The first question is was the games hot for you?   Was the game hot for you? 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   The weather or... 

Q.   Anything.   The weather and Venus Williams. 
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Okay.   Yeah, it was like you say, very hot, you know, in the game.   She's a great champion and she never give up.   She always‑‑ sometimes when she do some mistakes she will always keep fighting.   She have only one game, aggressive, and she always try to do it. 
She serve very well and very fast also, so you have always to be focused.   If you lost a little bit confidence it can be very fast.   Every point it's important, so, yes, it was difficult.   And, yes, the weather is hot and humid (smiling). 

Q.   Wuhan Open, how much do you know Wuhan?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yes, it's amazing tournament for the first year.   Everything, it's almost perfect.   Great organization, and I was surprised that there was a lot of Chinese in the crowd on the center, so it's great. 
They are great fan of tennis, so it's good for us, court is crowded, better than when it's empty.   So it was nice day.   And, yeah, the court, it's huge like always in China.   So it's great for us that there is tournament like this. 

Q.   How do you find the speed of the court?   How do you compare it to any other court?   Fast, slow?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Normal.

Q.   Normal?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, not too fast, not too slow.   Perfect.
