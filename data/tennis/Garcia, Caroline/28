C. GARCIA/E. Svitolina   
6-7, 6-3, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  From 3-5 down in the third, what changed?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know (smiling).  I mean, it was so many up-and-down in this matches, a little bit like the one we played in Beijing.  I mean, I know in the last set she serve very well, up to until 5-3, and then no first serve.   
So I know this was my chances, so I went for it.  I tried to be even more aggressive, tried to use down-the-line, and I was more and more accurate and I went for it on the good shots.  I was patient on the long rallies, and it makes the difference.   
 Q.  Obviously it's your first time and we have seen before that some people can get a little bit edgy.  How do you feel you have combated your nerves here, especially after a tough first set?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I cannot say I handle it very well.  Everyone saw it.  I didn't handle it very well (smiling).   
But, I mean, it's like this, and I tried to improve this part of myself.  I play with my emotion, and sometimes it was just too much.  I was just, like -- the loss of the first set was very difficult because I had some chances and some set point, but, I mean, sometime you have to just let it go and keep going.   
 Q.  I mean, what was the trigger?  Why did you get so emotional on that changeover?  What were you feeling?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: I don't know (smiling).  I mean, I was fine.  I mean, I was pretty frustrating about the loss of the first set, and I was trying to come back and just forget about it.   
I don't know.  My dad came, and I don't know what we talk about.  I just, like -- it just went all out (smiling).   
So, you know, sometimes -- I know I can do kind of things like that, and sometime it just relieve the pressure.  I had nothing to lose anymore.  I was down and I was just -- I just wanted to keep improving after that.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to get a win here?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Definitely means a lot.  Like, a few weeks ago I was not very expecting to be here, so the preparation was a little bit complicated.   
I was trying to do my best.  But, I mean, on court I was obviously feeling nervous, but I'm very happy that I kept working out yesterday, get myself prepared better.   
Today was such a battle, so I'm very happy to be through with a win.   
 Q.  Your dad gives you a lot of information.  My French is not as good as it should be, so I struggle to keep up.  How do you take it in?  What can you take in in that short space of time?  Because he gives you a lot.  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, the time goes so fast.  He want to help me the most he can, and sometime he give me information -- if you ask me right now what did he say, I can't remember at all.  But, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes.  I mean, he try to give me the most info he can, and I try to just listen and try to, yeah, make (indiscernible), and sometimes it's more mentally or not especially always on the game, but just, like, to keep my rhythm and my way on what I want to improve.   
 Q.  You can obviously still qualify for the semis.  You can even win the group, apparently.  But going into the final round and obviously playing a very tough opponent, what are you thinking?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Right now it's kind of difficult for me to think about anything else.  I just want to go in my bed.  I mean, she played some great two matches.  It was fast.  No one was expecting this kind of match today against Halep.   
And, I mean, she has experience.  She already came here in Singapore, and, I mean, it's a great match for me to play and it's another player who is moving well on court, giving few free points.   
So I just want to recover very well and be ready for my next match.   
 Q.  You hit quite a few shots today that had the crowd...  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Did you see the backhand one hand?  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  I was going to ask you about it.  Was your favorite the one-handed backhand or was the weird scoop forehand thing...  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, this one I always missed it, this forehand.  I did it today.  And the one-handed backhand, I was like, trying to be so much like careful, and I made it.  But it was, like, so many great rallies.  I went couple of times to the net, but I got passed so many times.  But I kept trying, and I did it.   
 Q.  Have you ever hit a one-handed backhand in a match?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: What?   
 Q.  Have you ever hit one before?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes, one.  It was a winner.  So it's my second one.  I'm pretty proud of myself (laughter).   
 Q.  What do you feel that you really learned about yourself in the last few weeks?  Do you feel like you proved maybe things you didn't know about yourself before?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of things help me to learn about how I was working on court and outside of the court, and I learn I know myself better.  I know that sometimes I got emotional, so I work on it a lot outside of the court, and it definitely help me.  Like, sometimes today I was getting stressed, so I was getting down, but I remember the good things I can do and why I'm here, so I just remember the good things and I keep improving.  I just forgot the most I can about outside of the court.
