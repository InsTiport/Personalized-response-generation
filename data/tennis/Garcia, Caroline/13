C. GARCIA/J. Konta
6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You have had some tough matches against Johanna in the past.  What do you think was the difference today?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, for sure, we had such a great battle in the past.  Today I was expecting a battle.  I was ready for it.  I know it could be difficult to break her, so I was really on my serve and really taking every opportunity I had on the return.
And I think compared to the previous matches we played against each other, I returned better today.  I was able to read her serve a little bit better.
You know, when she was getting in control, I was just trying to really be on the ball every time and play deep.  I think that's what I did good today.
Q. It was so hot out there today, of course.
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah.
Q. How were you able to deal with that?  You really dominated most of the match.  How were you able to do that, despite the weather?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, of course, the weather was difficult, but it was difficult conditions for everyone.  You just have to try to get yourself ready the best you can.  Just wait in the cold.  And you know it's going to be tough outside and you can't complain.  It's the same for the other one.
So I was just ready for it.  Yes, that's what I wanted, to be dominant on court.  And it was very important, because Joanna is very dangerous player, first round, especially.  So I was just ready for it and I went for it.
Q. Up next you have Monica Puig.  So it's a little bit different since you have never beaten her.  What are your thoughts about possibly getting a first win against her?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, we played last week in New Haven.  It was not a very good match for my part.  She was coming from quallies and she was playing good.  She has confidence, so I have to play my best match like I always need to.
Of course, the match against Johanna today is going to give me confidence and I will need to play as good as today for to beat her.  Maybe Monica, it's going to be a nice match to play, for sure.
