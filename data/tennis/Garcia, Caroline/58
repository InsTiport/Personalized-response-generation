THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Congratulations, Caroline.   Good match.   Did you feel from the minute you got out there that you were ready to play and feeling good?   
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No, since this morning I feel good and just happy to play.   My goal was to just play my game and enjoy to be here.   
I have nothing to lose and just a lot to learn to play this match.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   You seemed to have a lot of confidence, and also seemed to pick the right shots at the right moment pretty much throughout the match.   
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, since now two months I try to fix my game to do more of the same and just keep going.   This way I can play the best tennis.   I have, so...  
And the win will come with (indiscernible), so now it's more clear in my head, and I just keep going.   
   
 Q.   This was your first match playing Fed Cup.   Were you nervous at all?   Didn't seem nervous.   
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No, I was not nervous.   I was just happy to play.   It was great for me to play this singles here.   So, no, I was just happy to just play.   
   
 Q.   And just one more:   You have not ever played Sloane before.   What was it like?   Did she play like you anticipated, or what was your thoughts on the match?   
CAROLINE GARCIA:   No, I never play against her.   I just practice once.   
I know a little bit how she was playing and I was expecting, but it's always difficult to anticipate in a match like this.  
No, sometimes she ‑‑ the ball can go very fast and you have to be ready to bring this one back and wait for another one and when you have a chance, go for it.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any more questions in English?   Okay, French questions.
