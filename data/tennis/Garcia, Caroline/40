C. GARCIA/C. Paquet
7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. So compared to the first round, sometimes you felt a bit tense.  Was it because you were playing a French player who is not ranked as high as you are?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes.  It was very different indeed.  I was a little nervous.  I was not able to hit the same way I was able to hit in the first match.
But it's nothing compared to the previous years at French Open here where I was very tense.  I don't think I was perfectly lucid in terms of, from a tactical standpoint.  But I think I was able to fight hard.  Especially when I really needed to, I was able to be a little more aggressive.  And at the end, it makes a difference.
Q. Did you look at the other matches and how the others played?
CAROLINE GARCIA: I have not looked at anything, and I don't want to know.
Q. Your next opponent will be Su-Wei.  What do you think about this next match?
CAROLINE GARCIA: It's a bit of a surprise.  She defeated Konta, so she's a good player.  She plays very differently.  Sometimes you get the impression that she plays and she walks.  I know it's not going to be an easy match.  She's not a top seed, but I know it will be a tough match.  I know I will have to use my strengths and my forehand.
Q. Could you tell us a few words about Court No. 1?  It has its own unique atmosphere, right?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes.  I like it.  I have played there several times.  Two French players playing each other on Court 1 made sense.  It's a bit like an arena.  It's round.  I like the atmosphere, and sometimes the French players have really made history there.
I think Court 1 is going to disappear, right?  That is so unfortunate.  But, you know, I'm sure there will be another court, and I'm sure it will have a great atmosphere and it's a new chapter of the French Open.
Q. So you're in the third round, which you have not been able to do so far at the French Open.  Is that an important milestone for you?
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yes, it is.  It is.  This is a Grand Slam tournament.  I have done it before.  I have never done it here at Roland Garros.
After a few difficult weeks, I'm really happy to be here.  I'm combative.  I'm absolutely determined when I'm on the court.  And as I said after the first round, I really am enjoying playing.  I'm not trying to think too much about the score.  I'm trying to fight each match really hard, and that's what we train for, you know.  And the day of your match, you want to feel good on the court.  Even if it's warm, even if it lasts longer than you wanted.
