 Q.  Caroline, you have withdrawn.  Can you give us a reason why?  You're not feeling well, or what are you feeling?  
CAROLINE GARCIA: Yeah, I played Fed Cup this weekend, and I arrived this morning very early, and when I warm up, I feel pain in my left quads.  I was not feeling comfortable with it, and it was getting worse through the practice.   
So I think the best decision for me was to withdraw from Doha, and I had to play, like, in one hour and it was too short to make any recovery.
