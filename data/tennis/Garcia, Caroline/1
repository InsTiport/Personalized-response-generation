  N. OSAKA/C. Garcia
 6-2, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Bad luck today, it was a tough match.  Can you give us your thoughts on how you think you played out there.
 CAROLINE GARCIA:   Yeah, it was a tough round for sure, and Naomi is one of the favorites of the tournament, but I was ready for the match, and I wanted to give my best, and I think that's what I did.
 You know, I walked in there and I believed in my chances and I fight, but I think today is the difference between her serve, my serve return; it's too much different for a match like today, for me to be able to be closer at the end.
