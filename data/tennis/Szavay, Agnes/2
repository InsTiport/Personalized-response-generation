6-4, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You saved two match points there. Looked like you might be able to turn the match around. How much confidence did you get saving the match points?
 AGNES SZAVAY: Not much. Well, I just tried to stay in my match and tried my best. But she played well. She could finish the match. 

 Q. What was she doing well out there? 
 AGNES SZAVAY: Well, she didn't miss the ball before me. She was serving well. I think she has a great slice which I couldn't really handle and I was missing a lot. Couldn't move really well. 
 I don't know. She was good today I think. 

 Q. Her style of play is a little bit different from most top players. Did you find it more difficult to get a rhythm against her?
 AGNES SZAVAY: Well, definitely Errani was also not the player who usually play like flat and just hits the ball. So I also had little bit different in the first match. 
 But, yeah, she's definitely a great player. She's mixing the game very well, so it's tough to play against her. 

 Q. Watching the match, it sounded like you had a lot of support in the crowd. Could you feel that on court at all?
 AGNES SZAVAY: Well, yeah. I really like to play here. People likes me a lot, probably because I played well last year. So it's always good to come back. It's a great tournament. I really enjoy to play here. 

 Q. After last year's great run, how disappointing is it to lose relatively early this time around?
 AGNES SZAVAY: It's not all because I played final here. I just wanted to play my best tennis and wanted to win this match very much. But, yeah, she was better today.
