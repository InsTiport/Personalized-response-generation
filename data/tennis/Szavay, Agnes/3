   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  Other than the result, what was the difference in the way you two played the first set compared to here and New Haven? 
 AGNES SZAVAY:  Well, she played a lot better than there, I guess.  She already know how I play and she start to play another game.  I didn't play as good as I played there, so that's of different today. 

 Q.  Obviously not the result you would want to do, but are you pleased with your performance as far as you were able to get this week, or last week and into this week? 
 AGNES SZAVAY:  Well, I played this tournament not bad.  I mean, I played good my matches.  I made some mistake with the tactic and I couldn't play my best game, so last week was much better. 
 I was more fit and I was just in a good shape and that's it. 

 Q.  Describe the way she's playing right now.  Is she in your estimation playing top-tier tennis?  I mean, is she going to be very hard to beat? 
 AGNES SZAVAY:  She's playing really, really good now.  She has a good chance to be in the final I guess.  She has everything, like serve good, big forehand.  Big, big forehand and backhand also good.  She's tough mentally, so I think she has good chances on this tournament. 

 Q.  When you say you played the wrong tactic, what tactic would you say you tried that didn't work exactly? 
 AGNES SZAVAY:  I played too much to her forehand.  I should play next time a little bit more to her backhand, especially when it's important point or when I'm attacking and going to the net.  It's much better to attack to her backhand and then go to the net instead of the forehand.
