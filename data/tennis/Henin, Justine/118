THE MODERATOR:  First question for Justine, please. 
 

Q.Would you look forward to playing a match with Maria Sharapova?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Oh, I don't think too much about that right now.  I just came off the court.  To ask about a match tomorrow before, or an "eventual" match with her, it's still very far from that.  I just try to stay focused on what I have to do.  I'm so happy that I can play again.  I won today, so it gives me confidence.  I'm just trying to stay concentrated on my next round tomorrow. 
 

Q.Would you say that there are more good players now than two years ago?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Oh, I think that tennis, the women's tennis right now, is very strong.  There is a lot of competition.  I think it's very hard to say which player is the biggest favorite in any tournament.  It's very hard, because we all play very good tennis, and I think it's mentally that there is difference at the end. But I think we can see new faces, young players.  That's very good for tennis, and I love that.
