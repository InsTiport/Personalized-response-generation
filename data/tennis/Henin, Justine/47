   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  How did you play today? 
 JUSTINE HENIN:  I don't know.  I don't have a lot of things to say about that match because there wasn't a lot of rhythm.  She was serving pretty hard, pretty good, but did a lot of mistakes. 
 I just did a good job.  Generally it's been positive.  I didn't serve that well.  I was a bit concerned the last few days with my shoulder.  It's getting better, but still a little bit scary. 
 But, no, I'm glad to win that way.  Nothing special today. 

 Q.  How did it feel just being back here on Arthur Ashe? 
 JUSTINE HENIN:  Yeah, it's a good feeling.  I had a chance to practice yesterday with Jankovic on the stadium.  It's different.  It's big.  It's huge.  You need a little bit of time to get used to it. 
 But it's a good feeling.  It's a court that brings me a lot of good memories - good and bad memories.  But, not so different this Grand Slam from the others.  I'm feeling good. 

 Q.  Some people thrive on this atmosphere, others don't particularly care for it.  Where do you fall? 
 JUSTINE HENIN:  It's not my favorite Grand Slam.  I have to agree with that.  It's so, so different.  Different country also from Europe.  You need to get used to it.  There are places where you feel a little bit better. 
 Here for me it's maybe a little bit more difficult.  It takes a lot of energy, I think, this tournament.  It's also the last Grand Slam of the season, last chance to do well in Grand Slams.  So you can feel the tension probably a little bit more. 

 Q.  Do you think it's also the most difficult to win? 
 JUSTINE HENIN:  For me, Wimbledon is pretty tough.  No, it's probably one of the -- maybe the most difficult to win because, like I said, it's the last one.  It takes a lot of energy.  Crazy New York.  Yeah, there is a lot of attention.  It's a big show here.  It's different.
