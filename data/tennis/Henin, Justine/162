MODERATOR:  Questions for Justine. 


Q.  You showed in that match that you take every point seriously.  Obviously, it's the only way tennis does work.  How do you think that will work against Lindsay for your next match?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  It's going to be important that if I want to win the match, I have to be focused on every point like I did today.  I just tried to play today like I will have in the next match because I will have to be aggressive and I will have to be focused on every point for sure.  So it helped that today I did it. 

Q.  This was your first match with Katarina Srebotnik. 

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, first match.  I was a bit nervous before the match because I didn't know her at all.  You know, she's almost in the Top 30, so she's a good player.  At the beginning of the match, she was hitting the ball very good, just tried to be aggressive.  She did well in the first games, then took me two or three games to be in the match, then I played really well after. 

Q.  She did look a threat for a while.  Were you worried?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  But I wasn't worried at all, no.  I said, "Okay, just play your game and it's going to be fine." 

Q.  In Lindsay's press conference they dredged up what happened in Zurich when she had an injury.  You suggested she wasn't injured.  Will that be on your mind?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, not at all.  Zurich is very far away from now.  It wasn't the same conditions as now.  It was another match.  I hope it's done.  I'm sure it's done.  In two days, it's going to be totally different, and I hope I can win for the first time against her.

Q.  Have you spoken to her about it? 

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, no, never.
