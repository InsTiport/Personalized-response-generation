THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Headline in one of the papers today, "The battle of the backhands."  It's a little bit more than that, isn't it?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think so.  I hope so.  No, I think it's going to be a good match, I hope.  It's very interesting.  Very happy to play Amélie because I think it's going to be a tough mission for myself.  But I really believe in my chances.  She will have great motivation, for sure, to get her first Grand Slam title.  But I do have mine, and I hope it's going to turn a good way.  
 
Q.  When do you start to focus really on the match?  Have you started now or do you wait?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Really, no, I think that today I just have to take some time to recover and just leave my spirit a little bit free of all this pressure and everything, and just get ready tomorrow in my warmup.  I will have time to think of what I will have to do during this match.  You don't have to think too much about that, you just have to be focused on something else.  It would come easily tomorrow morning and maybe this night already.  
 
Q.  What do you focus on?  What do you do to clear your mind of the distractions?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I have my own routines.  But I did hit the ball today for 45 minutes.  I'm going to have a massage.  I'm going to go to my room and watch some DVDs, listen to some music, call home, you know, do these kind of things that going to make me feel better.  
 
Q.  Your husband is not on a plane heading towards here?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, he's home.  
 
Q.  You've been there four times before.  Does it get any easier or do you still get nervous?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, I think it's the same kind of feeling.  Even if I know that maybe I have to use a little bit this experience, it's from the past.  I just need to stay focused on what's going to happen tomorrow.  Every situation is very different.  It's very hard to predict anything.  You don't know what to expect.  You try to use your experience, but a Grand Slam final is always something very, very special.  It's a different kind of atmosphere, different kind of tension.  You feel it.  It is different.  But for me, I'm as nervous as I was for the first one.  It's great because I need that if I want to play well.  
 
Q.  The fact that you've won, does that give you any advantage over her?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Like I said, every situation is different.  Tomorrow, it's going to be 50/50 because both of us, we want this title, and that's it.  I think both of us, we have a great game.  We going to do everything we can to win this match.  What happened in the past doesn't matter any more.  It's going to be different tomorrow. 
 
Q.  You've played seven times.  There's really no secrets in the games. 
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, we know each other pretty well.  We played each other a couple of times.  I think there are no big surprises in our game for the other.  It's going to be interesting, for sure.  
 
Q.  Only one of those seven I think was on Rebound Ace.  Does that make any difference?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, I think it was in Sydney in 2004 in the final.  But I think the surface is pretty good for both of us.  I think it doesn't make a big difference.  
 
Q.  Did you watch much of The Championships?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No.  I didn't watch any match at The Championships.  I was there for one night because I had to do a couple things, but I didn't watch anywhere.  
 
Q.  When you saw that she won, were you surprised or did it confirm something to you?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I was pretty happy for Amélie because she deserved that victory.  She's a great player.  I have a lot of respect for her, so I was pretty happy.  She was waiting for that such a long time and she got it.  I wasn't very surprised.  She has the game to do it.  Good for her.  
 
Q.  You seem to be proving that somebody can come into a Grand Slam without a whole lot of practice matches and win.  What incentive would someone of your caliber have for playing week in, week out on the tour any more if you can come in and win a Grand Slam coming in cold?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, I'm surprising myself a little bit for sure after such a long time off.  I think I have for sure more experience than I had still three years ago.  All the injuries, the illnesses and everything, I really enjoy my game now.  That's probably the biggest difference because I feel very lucky to be healthy and be back on the courts.  I wasn't sure that I was going to be able to play this tennis as I did since I arrive here in Australia.  I'm very happy the way I came back.  But it's just one step.  It's not the end, you know.  The season is very long.  I hope for healthy season that I can play all the tournaments I want to play.  We will make conclusions at the end of the whole season because for me it's been very hard last two years and now I want to play.  I do long-term plans, and I hope it's going to be fine.  
 
Q.  When is the last time you felt so good physically and mentally?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  It's very hard to say.  But in the last two years I never felt as good as now.  Even if I played well in a couple of tournaments, I wasn't feeling physically as well as I am feeling right now.  When physically you're feeling well, when you're feeling healthy a hundred percent, then mentally you're feeling stronger.  Doesn't matter of the result of tomorrow.  It's the way I am feeling right now.  It's great because I hope it's going to stay for such a long time now.  
 
Q.  Do you appreciate the opportunity to play when you have to take long periods off?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  It's great, yeah.  I love this kind of atmosphere.  Yesterday was amazing crowd.  I feel that I missed that so much in the past few months.  I just feel very lucky.  That's why I'm playing tennis, because I love to play in this kind of atmosphere, on big courts, good crowds.  That makes me feel very special.  
 
Q.  Have you spoken to Kim?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, I didn't see her. 
 
Q.  Do you think in a certain sense, what happened to you with the injuries, you're training smarter rather than harder and longer?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  We try to.  It's not always easy to do the smart things and to take the smart decisions.  I know that my body was tired still a few months ago.  Probably I had to change a few things and work a little bit more on the prevention, on my recovery, because I think recovery is part of the workout.  I think it's very important you take time to get relaxed.  You have to take it easy sometimes.  I think I work pretty hard - differently than in the past.  Yeah, it's another way to see the future now.  I think I took the right decisions.  I have no regrets about that.  
 
Q.  Did Carlos kind of spell out a new game plan to you or did you come to the realization together?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think that we always, both of us, we want to improve, for sure.  We always want an evolution in my game.  We always try to make me much more aggressive, stay on my baseline.  That's the way I'm going to play for a long time.  I'm not going to play for five more years if I stay far from my baseline.  I have to think that it's the way I have to play in the future, for sure.  
 
Q.  Is there something you do away from tennis that you think really helps your tennis game?  Do you play ping-pong for your hand-eye coordination?  Anything help your tennis game?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, except playing tennis and do my workout.  I don't do any sports because I want to do something else when I'm not playing tennis.  I played a lot of ping-pong when I was younger, but I don't think it does help.  
 
Q.  Are you still skydiving?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  When I'm on the tour, when I have this adrenaline on the courts, I don't need to do skydiving.  It's just when I'm off the courts, when I need to find something else.  But not any more right now.
