THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Justine, please. 


Q.  Can you talk about 4-all in the second set.

JUSTINE HENIN:  It was 30-love on my serve.  I was playing well.  And then this point, she played unbelievable on this point.  I was to the net, I went.  I tried to take my chance, and she was really aggressive.  She played a great match.  She was solid, regular and it was a high level.  So I think that, yeah, she was a little bit stronger than me. 

Q.  Did she surprise you in some way after the Berlin final and after the fact that she was injured? 

JUSTINE HENIN:  I think that she played  -- maybe she played a better match today, because she didn't make a lot of mistakes.  And, like I said, she was very regular and she didn't give me a lot of chances to come back in the match.  So she was very strong, and I was just a little bit maybe under my level that I played in Berlin in the final.  But it was a tough match.  And she's, like I said, she's a great player, a great champion.  And I think that's normal.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.  Today she was simply better than me. 

Q.  Is your leg going to be any problem for Roland Garros?

JUSTINE HENIN:  No, it was fine during the match.  I was in confidence with physically.  So no problem about this. 

Q.  Would you have welcomed a rain delay this morning?

JUSTINE HENIN:  No, you know, we are tennis professional players, and I think that's not a problem if it's raining.  We played on time, and I had the possibility to warm up.  But I was a little bit afraid that it's gonna be later, finally.  We could play.  So that's better.
