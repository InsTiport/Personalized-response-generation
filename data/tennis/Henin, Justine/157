MODERATOR:  Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen, Justine Henin-Hardenne.  
 
 
Q.  How do you feel that went for you today?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think I'm pretty happy just first that I can play, it's the most important thing, being on the court.  Then the second issue is that I won.  I think I was happy with the way I played - not only the game, but just the attitude.  I kept fighting in the first set.  She was serving well.  I just said, "Okay, you have to keep your serve and try to be a bit more aggressive on the return."  I did and I won the match. 
 
Q.  Injury problems?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  My injury problems is still bothering me, for sure.  It's sore and painful.  But, I mean, when I'm focused on the match, I can forget it a little bit more.  It's just in the change of ends that I can feel it, so it doesn't matter. 
 
Q.  Two fingers on the left hand?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  So your toss?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  My toss, especially in the backhand, sometimes the shock.  So, yeah, it depends.  But it's okay.  I have good tape.  You know, I'm pretty happy that I could play today.  I think I'll be ready in the next round, too. 
 
Q.  Have you given thanks for being a one-handed backhand hitter?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yes, I'm very happy about that right now. 
 
Q.  Do you think it harms your overall chances at all, the injury?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think, you know, my only problem is that if I can't be focused a hundred percent on my match, I just don't want to play.  So today I could be focused, I could forget my injury, and then I'll try to do it in my next match.  It's very early to talk about the future of the tournament.  I just want to be  -- my next goal is going to be my next match, that's it. 
 
Q.  Did you catch any tosses today? 
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No. 
 
Q.  Are you generally getting the ball where you want on the toss?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah.  Usually I could do whatever I want.  I serve pretty good.  So, I mean, it didn't bothering me a lot on my serve.  It's just sometimes on the backhand.  It's okay, I'll be ready. 
 
Q.  You talked a little during your acceptance speech in France about how this is for all the smaller players.  Do you sometimes wish that tennis had not gone toward more big players?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think tennis is great like it is right now.  I think it's good to have different kind of games and different kind of personalities in the Top 10.  Tall girls, girls like me, I think it's great to have this differences.  So I'm pretty happy.  I think women's tennis is great right now.  We don't want to change anything. 
 
Q.  What do smaller girls have to do to compete?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think I can compensate  - I can be powerful when I want, I can be fast and quick on the court, I can move well.  On grass court it's very important.  But I believe in my chances, that's the most important. 
 
Q.  You obviously got some pretty good support in the French, if you can look at it that way.  Presumably you don't expect to get a similar support here. 
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think, you know, Wimbledon is very special for me.  I think I had great emotions here in the last two years.  I think that the crowd here is so respectful.  I mean, it's great crowd.  I like playing here.  And I think I'll have great support, too. 
 
Q.  You don't think we'll see a repeat of the scenes from the French Open?
 
JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  It's a different crowd.  This crowd is very respectful for the players.  I have a lot of respect for them.  I think they know tennis pretty much.  So probably it's going to be a little different, but I hope I'll have this kind of support I had at the French.
