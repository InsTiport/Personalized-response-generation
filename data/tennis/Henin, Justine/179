THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You had some problems at the end of the second set?  What happened? 
 
JUSTINE HENIN:  I played a really good match until, yeah, 6-2, 5-2.  And then maybe I thought the match was over too early.  There was a little problem at this time.  But when I saw that she could come back at 5-all, then I served one, and finally I won 6-4.  So maybe for me it was finished too early.  But it's okay, the victory is the most important.  
 
Q.  Do you want to win again, like in Berlin?
 
JUSTINE HENIN:  Oh, I think that all players want to win all tournaments.  So that's a big problem (smiling).  No, for sure I want to win my next match.  That's the most important for me.  I will try just to be focus of the match of tomorrow.  Then, you know, in tennis you never know what can happen.  Then I will try to give my best and give 100% and play my best tennis tomorrow.  And then we will see what's going to happen.  
 
Q.  Did you hear that Martina Hingis has a problem and might have to pull out of the French? 
 
JUSTINE HENIN:  I just heard it this morning, but I don't know anything about this.  So no comment.
