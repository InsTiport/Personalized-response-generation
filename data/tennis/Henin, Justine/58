   THE MODERATOR:  Justine Henin for you.   
  
  Q.  You obviously recovered well enough from Saturday.   
 JUSTINE HENIN:  Hopefully.  No, no, it's been tough because I couldn't hit yesterday and only 10 minutes this morning, then in a rush a little bit in the afternoon 15 more minutes.   
 The grass is slower here than it was in Eastbourne I thought.  I needed a little bit of time to get used to the surface.  It's not easy to come for a tournament and forget about it and get ready on the next one, especially for a Grand Slam.   
 But that's what I wanted to do.  I have no regrets about that because that gave me a lot of confidence.  I just needed a few games to get used to another rhythm.  The day has been long also.   
 Yeah, it's good to win this way and that we could finish tonight.   
  
  Q.  The score doesn't really show it, but she played well enough at times to give you a decent challenge, didn't she?   
 JUSTINE HENIN:  Yeah.  Especially in the beginning I didn't push her that much, but my first-serve percentage was pretty good, I thought.   
 Yeah, I wasn't in a good rhythm in the beginning in the rallies.  I was too far from my baseline.  At the end I was beginning to feel much better on the court and try to come a little bit more to the net.   
 But it's a first round; it's never easy.  It's always good to win easy in two sets.   
  
  Q.  Your doctor was quoted today in a Belgian newspaper saying you could be forced to quit tennis in a couple of years through injury.  How true is that?   
 JUSTINE HENIN:  No, I think it's been a little kind of mistake in that.  No, it's been a mistake in the paper I thought.  But, no, it's going to be in four, five more years, I don't know, three more years.  Depends of my injuries, but not in two for sure.
