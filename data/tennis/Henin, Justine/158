THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Justine, please.


Q.  You fought back very well in that first set. 

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Uh-hmm.

Q.  Did that have an effect in the second set?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  It's hard to say.  I mean, I just played so bad at the beginning of the match, then it was hard after to, you know, to start the match at 4-love.  I didn't play my best tennis in any game of the match.  So it's hard to play like this win and this kind of match.  Chanda played well and I think that it was tough for me today. 

Q.  Is there any part of your game you were particularly disappointed with?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, I think that, generally, I didn't play the game I wanted to play and I couldn't be aggressive, I couldn't move well.  I felt without energy, without any power.  I don't know, it's one day like this.

Q.  Had you been feeling ill before the match?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No, I was feeling good.  I was hitting the ball very good at the practice but, you know, the match is different.  Maybe I was a little bit nervous, but I don't think that's the reason.  I think that, yeah, I couldn't play like I wanted. 

Q.  Did you feel Chanda wasn't allowing you to...

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Chanda played well, for sure.  She beat Mauresmo in the round before, then me.  I think that she's in good shape.  She didn't miss a lot of things.  It was a little bit windy, too.  It was hard for me to return her serves.  They weren't very strong, but I did a lot of mistakes on my returns.  But I think that, you know, she played well.

Q.  I know it's hard to tell from today, but has she made a big jump?  Is she much better than she was?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  For sure, but she's very solid and she's there for a couple of years.  She has a lot of experience.  She's great player, so we know, everybody knows that she can win these kind of matches.  Being in the semifinal is not a big surprise because she can play really, really well.
