THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Can you take us through what happened when the referee came out?  Did he actually tell you he was calling it off?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  No.  I mean, he said we were going to wait a little bit more, and they knew it was going to stop.  It was a little bit frustrating, two or three times I had to stop.  But it's okay.  We finally played.  It's late.  It's okay.

Q.  Did you have to argue with him and say no?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I said to him, "Just take a decision."  It was late already.  It was almost 10:30 when we started the match.  But they knew the rain was going to stop.  So, I mean, we just had to wait a few more minutes.  The crowd was great, so it was a fun experience.

Q.  Did you have fun watching?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, it was fun.  Before the match, it was good.  I was very relaxed.  You could see the way I played, so that's good. 

Q.  Later on when she started winning games .

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  Yeah, she served well to come back at 5-1, and then the crowd was getting excited a little bit, was behind her 100 percent.  They wanted more tennis.  It wasn't so easy, but finally, yeah, I lost a bit my aggressivity at the end of the match.  But finally I came through, so that's good news. 

Q.  Your first time through to the quarters here?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  First time, yeah.

Q.  How do you feel about that?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I'm happy.  You know, I want to just try to play my best tennis and we will see.  I'm in the quarters, that's great, but I want more.  I just do my best and we will see.
