THE MODERATOR: Questions in English?

Q. Today was very windy. Did you worry about that wind?

JUSTINE HENIN: Yeah. It was, I think, really bad conditions for me because I don't have
any experience in this situation. To play in the center court with a lot of wind, it's not
easy. I knew that in the first set I was -- it was really difficult for me. I have
contacts, you know, and with the wind, it was awful. Yeah, it was difficult. 

Q. Can you talk about the difference in playing good players like Kournikova or Top 25
players - not her specifically - versus playing players like Davenport? What makes those
players better?

JUSTINE HENIN: I think that Davenport doesn't miss the point when she has to win it. So
when it's close, when the match is close, she plays well. And against Kournikova, I could
play not very well and I won. But today, it wasn't the same.
