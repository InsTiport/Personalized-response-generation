MODERATOR:  Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Justine Henin-Hardenne. 


Q.  Just your thoughts on your victory today. 

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I'm pretty happy with the way I played, with my attitude.  I think that, you know, playing Alicia Molik was a tough test for myself because she was serving so well.  I broke twice in the match, on the important games.  I think I served pretty good.  I went to the net.  I just want to take my chances and it worked pretty good.  I'm very happy that finally I found my game today.

Q.  You've played Alicia three times now.  How do you see her game improving, say, from last year in Belgium?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  She's improving a lot, you know.  Especially here at Wimbledon, I think the grass is probably one of her best surfaces.  And, you know, she's serving great.  She's tall.  She has many things in her game, yeah, to win these kind of matches.  I think she's getting more regular in her game.  I think she will still improve in the next few months. 

Q.  How is your hand injury?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I think it's not going better, but it's not going worst (sic).  You can see in this way.  Today I fell down again on it.  Probably it was getting more painful a little bit.  But that's okay.  I just try to stay focus on my tennis, try to forget this, and let's play. 

Q.  Do you think it could be a hindrance for the second week?

JUSTINE HENIN-HARDENNE:  I mean, you know what, I don't think too much about this.  I'll just try to be focused on my next round on Monday.  That is the most important for myself.  And I think that now I'm getting used to play with the tape and everything and I'm getting more comfortable.  So I think it's not going to be a big problem.
