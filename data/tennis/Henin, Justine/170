MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Another easy win. 
 
JUSTINE HENIN:  Yeah, it's nice that I won finally a first match in a Grand Slam easier than it was in Wimbledon, the last tournaments.  But, yeah, I'm pretty happy.  To win 6-1, 6-2, it's important to be fresh mentally and physically for the rest of the tournament.  So I am pretty happy. 
 
Q.  Did you like her lilac dress? 
 
JUSTINE HENIN:  Yeah (laughter).
