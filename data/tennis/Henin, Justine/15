J. HENIN/D. Cibulkova
  6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. Can I have you talk about I guess the way it finished? 5-2, 30-30 there was a call that looked long, and then from there it seemed to have got a little tighter. 
 JUSTINE HENIN: Well, I mean, I don't want to talk any about the end of the match. I mean, that ball was out. I mean, it doesn't matter. It's only one point in the match. 
 So I got maybe tense a little bit at the end of the match. It was quite humid today. It was very, very humid out there, and the conditions, yeah, weren't that easy. 
 And also I played in the night two days ago; I have to play in the day today. That changes a little bit the rhythm.
 But generally I've been trouble in both beginning of -- I mean both sets at the beginning of the sets. After that, I just had what I had to do. She played a good rhythm, played a good match. There was ups and downs. 
 I've been able to come into the court, but probably not enough. But when I had to do a good job, that's what I did. That's okay. 

 Q. What was most troubling to you about her game?
 JUSTINE HENIN: Well, she plays well, you know, she runs a lot, and she has pretty good backhand. She's a real fighter.
 I mean, she has a strong personality, and it was the first time I've played against her. That's never easy to play someone you don't know. So that was something new for myself. 
 But, I mean, I was glad about my reaction in both sets to come back. And especially after a good win two days ago, it wasn't that easy today, but I'm glad I'm in, you know, in the last 16.
