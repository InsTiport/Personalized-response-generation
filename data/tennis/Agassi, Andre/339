Q. What's wrong between you and Monte-Carlo here, because every time you come here, it's looks like you are not in your best shape?
 
ANDRE AGASSI:  It's an early tournament, you know. It's very heavy conditions.  It's not suitable, I mean, for my style it's dangerous to play your first tournament, and it's tough against a good claycourter.  Paris is a little quicker, a little better for me.  It's a tough tournament, a lot of good players. 
 

Q. Is it hard to adapt coming from the hard courts of America?
 
ANDRE AGASSI:  Yes, it's very difficult.  Movement is everything, and if you don't move as well as the guy you're playing, then you've got to hit bigger shots, low percentage.  It's just very difficult. 
 

Q. What is your claycourt schedule before the French?
 
ANDRE AGASSI:  Hamburg. 
 

Q. That's it?
 
ANDRE AGASSI:  Yes. 
 

Q. How did you feel about the reaction of the crowd?  The crowd was a little disappointed, obviously.
 
ANDRE AGASSI:  Yeah, almost as much as me.  You know, you go out there and you try; you get your ass kicked; they expect you to do well; they want you to win, it's disappointing.
