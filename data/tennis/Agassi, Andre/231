 GREG SHARKO: Let's start with Andre.  
 
Q. Your impressions of the young guy?
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: Real good. It's always difficult when you play somebody the first time
because, you know, you don't know how well they're playing, basically how not well they're
playing. I mean, I like his game. I think his game can really develop. He certainly can
generate a lot of pace on the serve. He has a big forehand. His backhand looks like
there's a lot of room to improve. It's not his best shot now, but it has a lot of room to
improve. He moves pretty well. 17 years old, you don't know how somebody can develop. He
certainly will have a look at the basket to get a lot better. 
 
Q. I think a lot of American tennis fans are hoping for the first time we really have
somebody who might be another Agassi, Pete Sampras, whatever. Is he too young to put that
kind of pressure on right now? What would you tell American tennis fans about him ?
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: I mean, tell them to be thankful that in a two-year period there was me,
Pete, Courier, Chang, Todd Martin. I mean, that's quite a group right there. I say,
"Drop your expectations and count your blessings." It's a hard standard there. 
 
Q. You said you like his game. Do you remember when the first champion said he liked
your game, how you felt? Gonzales commented on you.
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: I think the only really nice comment I got was from Wilander. I played
him one time when I was 15. He gave me some credit.  
 
Q. Nobody else? 
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: First time I played Connors, I beat him, and he didn't give me credit.
McEnroe said something about my hair. Lendl wasn't too positive either. I know what that
felt like.  
 
Q. Sorry I brought it up. 
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: No problem to me.
