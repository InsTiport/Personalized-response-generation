"I'm so proud of this team and the way they left their hearts on the court. I
really wanted this. I'm happy for Chris. I'm happy for John, who believed in us the whole
time. It's going to be a sweet ride back. I'll never forget it."

"You have to have the experience to get a lot out of it. You feel so proud for
your country and your teammates. I don't know what Pete would have gotten out of it. It's
an individual thing."

"That's too far ahead of time for me right now. The way I'm feeling, I don't think
I can name any of the players on their team."
