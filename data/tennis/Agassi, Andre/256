 Q. The way he was serving today was really unbelievable. I think until the first
breakpoint you only had four points on the serve? 
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: Yes, and it is very difficult when he serves that well. It is very
difficult. 
 
Q. Lack of rhythm in your return or not moving as well as you wish?
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: No, I think he served very well. He is a tough guy to develop rhythm
against, so you can go sometimes two, three times not having to hit one shot and then one
game you have to hit four good ones. It is just difficult. It is difficult. He played
well. 
 
Q. Are you satisfied with your own game, service games? Seemed like you were struggling
with your first serve sometimes.
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: He puts a lot of pressure on you to make your first serve. Sometimes when
you have to make your first serve, you start steering it a little bit too much and you
don't hit it; you have a little bit of consistency. But he played some good games to break
me. He only had to break me twice. 
 
Q. I would imagine you still feel a bit tired as well playing a lot of tournaments; it
is not easy?
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: I wasn't tired, just, you know, just never found a good rhythm. 
 
Q. Is he the guy to beat in this tournament?
 
 ANDRE AGASSI: You know, I always consider him a guy to beat because if he is playing
well, it is difficult for anybody. He obviously did well here last year so he likes the
court and yeah, I think he is going to be very difficult to beat. Probably one of the most
difficult.
