 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How would you categorize your play out there today, being in a Masters 1000 main draw first time and playing against a quality opponent?
 SHINTARO MOCHIZUKI:   Yeah, it was amazing to be there.  I mean, I won two matches in quallies.  I was confident about the match, but he was keep hitting big and, yeah, he was a lot better than me.
 Q. Playing in a tournament like this and getting through the two rounds of quallies and into the main draw, what does this do for your confidence going forward, especially so young in your pro career?
 SHINTARO MOCHIZUKI:   Actually, I think I was playing, like, well.  I was there.  And like the score was 3 and 3, but I believe I can play like I have a chance to beat them, like beat those guys.
 I really look forward to what's coming in the future.
