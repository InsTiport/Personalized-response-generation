Q. Can you tell us a bit about the match?  Did you feel comfortable out there? 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Well, I think that I played pretty well in the first set, then she picked it up in the second. But it was only one break.  Then the third was two breaks.  I think we both played hard.  She really wanted this title.  And I really wanted this title, too.  So it was just a matter of who played a little bit better in the end.  I got an early break, another break, so I was happy. 
 

Q. What is missing to be No. 1, and when are you going to become No. 1?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think maybe I just need to win a little bit more to be No. 1, basically.  I have to concentrate on getting better, being more serious.  I'll get there.  I haven't been around too long. 
 

Q. Is your sister going to be No. 1 and you No. 2, or  your sister No. 1?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  If I don't work hard, I'll be No. 2.  I'll have to get really serious and start lifting some weights or something.  Something.  She's good. 
 

Q. Have you got any idea what you're going to do with all that money?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I'm going to put it away.  I have to pay taxes, too, you know.  It's not all mine. 
 

Q. When you're playing out there, are you thinking about the money at all?  Does it ever come into your mind?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, not -- no.  It's a nice bonus for winning, basically.  I think before you come to the Grand Slam Cup, you say, "This is a great tournament with a great prize pool."  Generally when you're here playing, you're generally trying to win your matches.
