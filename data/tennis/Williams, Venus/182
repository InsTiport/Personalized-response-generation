THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Welcome back.   You must have been pleased with most of the things that you did in difficult conditions today.   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, chilly and windy and, you know, it's winter in the desert, so the weather can be, you know, a little up in the air.  
But I was just happy to keep the errors down.  
   
 Q.   You served pretty well and you hit the ball pretty well.   What else pleased you about the performance?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, like I said, unforced errors for me are always a key.   Keeping them down makes my life easier.   The matches are cleaner, and it helps me win in straight sets.  
So that's my goal this week.  
   
 Q.   I also like the outfit.   Is that your design?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   I always wear lemon.   It's our new floral print.  
   
 Q.   The name?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Fiore.   
   
 Q.   Fiore.   When you come back to somewhere where you have done well, you won WTA Championships here, I think, does that help?   Is that in your head when you come?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I had a lot of memories here, you know, playing in the finals two years in a row, and actually I don't think I have been back since 2009, was it?   Something like that.   
So I definitely want to build on that success that I have had those years, even though it's like four or five years later.  
   
 Q.   Could I ask you a Mandela legacy question?   I know Serena was considering applying the Truth and Reconciliation idea to your terrible experience in Indian Wells.   Do you have any sort of thoughts or feelings about that that you could share about whether it's ever likely that you'd go back and whether you'd apply his legacy to that?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I really think she's given more thought to it.   I haven't given any thought at all to anything.   
   
 Q.   Would you think about it at any time, do you think?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, if Serena thinks about it, we like to copy each other, but I haven't given any thought at this point.   
   
 Q.   Where do you find the motivation to go on and go on?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, I love tennis.   I'm still young.   You can't do it forever, so while I can, I'm going to.   When I can't, I'm not going to.   That's pretty much what it is (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Is Serena an inspiration for you?   Because she came back after illness.   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Serena is an inspiration not just for me but I think for every woman in the WTA and for so many more men, women, and children that aren't playing tennis.   So just around the world she's an inspiration.
