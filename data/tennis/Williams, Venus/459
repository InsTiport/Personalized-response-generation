THE MODERATOR:  First question for Venus, please. 


Q.  After this event, is there anything tournament you are interested in that has to do with Central or South America?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, there's one tournament in Bahia, and I hope to go.  I really would love to.  But at this point, no.

Q.  Not at this point?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.

Q.  How do you feel being the winner today?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I love winning.  But of course I would have loved to have won with winning the whole match and not by retiring.  But sometimes that's how it is. 

Q.  Do you feel confident that you and your sister are going to be, for the next few years, on top of the circuit?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think as long as we work hard and as long as we're healthy and not injured, we'll be on top. 

Q.  What follows after the NASDAQ? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  On April 6th I'm playing in my mom's charity event in Delray Beach.  And after that I'm playing in Jacksonville, another tournament. 

Q.  So the next tournaments are going to be here in the United States basically?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, yeah.  My next two. 

Q.  After that, is there anything that has to do with Europe or another country?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I'm playing in Europe until July, so all of my tournaments will be in July  - all clay court tournaments.

Q.  On those trips do you miss home? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I do miss home.  But I don't eat so much candy in Europe.  They don't have what I like.  I'm in great shape when I'm in Europe (laughing). 

Q.  I wish you the best of luck. 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Thank you.
