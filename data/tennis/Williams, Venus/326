   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Particularly considering that your sister won earlier, is this extra disappointing?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm always happy for Serena to win. It would have been obviously very exciting for me to win, too, but just didn't happen.   
  
  Q. Looked like the conditions were a little bit tough out there, Venus. I know you're very used to playing here but it looked like the balls were sailing and wind was swirling; was that a factor?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, it wasn't -- it can be worse here. I was actually pretty happy with the conditions.   
 I definitely don't blame any conditions on my loss.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about your performance tonight? You looked pretty frustrated out there obviously by the end.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she played well. Just felt like I stepped slow and a little bit, little bit off. I just didn't have the answers today, and she played well.  
  
  Q. What was your coach's advice between sets?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't even remember now. Yeah, I don't know.   
  
  Q. Is it helpful, or does it make it more difficult?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, it's helpful. I prefer to be on my own out there. I like the soloness of it all, if that's even a word.   
  
  Q. Did you talk to Serena after her match?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I saw her. I told her, Good match. I was happy for her and proud of her, and she was playing the way she can play.   
  
  Q. Have you talked to her since yours?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.  
  
  Q. What did she say?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: She just said I played well. I definitely feel like I did a lot of good things, but I just had some plays that weren't so good, and sometimes it makes a difference.  
  
  Q. How disappointing, not to get a chance to play her here again.  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, when I play tournaments I want to win the tournaments, so it's not about who I get to play. It's about me getting the title, so that's my ultimate goal.  
  
  Q. Venus, where do you go from here? How are you approaching clay court?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm going to play Amelia Island and Charleston, so I have some tennis left in the U.S.  
  
  Q. What are you planning to play in Europe before France?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Rome. In Rome.  
  
  Q. Do you think you were pressing at all a bit out there, maybe because you knew there was a possibility of playing your sister?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No. No, I don't think I'm -- I was pressing. I play an aggressive game anyway. I think I had more winners. I think I had a very good first serve percentage, but I just -- I just made some plays at the wrong time, and that's just how it was. It was close.
