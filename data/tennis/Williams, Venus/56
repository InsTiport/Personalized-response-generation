THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What gives you more satisfaction, battling back like that or winning far more easily?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: A win is a win.  That's all I can say.   
 Q.  How do you think you survived that one?  What made the difference?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not sure, really.  Just maybe a little luck.  Who knows?   
But I'm on to the next match now.   
 Q.  What were you thinking on that last match point?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Try to win the point.
