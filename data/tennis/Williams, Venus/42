7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I wanted to ask you about coming back in the first set.  Was there some moment, some cathartic moment?  What happened there?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Obviously she was playing well.  She didn't play like the No. 54th ranked player in the world.  It was really only one break, so getting that break back was huge.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about what it means to play here.  Obviously it's the last year.  This is about as close to a home court as can be for you.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, the tournament is still going to be in the backyard, South Florida.  I'm happy about that.  Mostly I'm just focused on the event.   
 Q.  You seem to be into doing a dance now when you win.  Talk a little bit about that.  You got the moves.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: They basically begged me to do the dance.  I didn't want to.  I said no, but they announced it anyway.  It's not that I was trying to dance.   
 Q.  Do you not like doing it?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I love dancing, but I just want to focus on the tennis on the court.   
 Q.  Talk overall about how you're feeling about the next round.  I don't know if you've played that opponent before.  Have you looked ahead?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I do not believe we have played.  I will have to win the points, as usual.  There is no secret to that.
