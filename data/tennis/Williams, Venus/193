  THE MODERATOR:   Venus has unfortunately to withdraw from the tournament with a lower back injury.   
   
 Q.   When did it pop off?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, just yesterday I was having some pain, and then just wanted to see how I felt in the warmup.   Just, you know, not able to play today.  
   
 Q.   Tougher to have to withdraw from this being it's so close to home for you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   It's really disappointing.  
You know, this is just the kind of tournament that, you know, you want to play well at.   But, you know, I have faced disappointments in my life and my career.   It's not the first; probably not the last.  
Just have to get through it and stay positive.  
   
 Q.   When did you actually decide that you weren't going to play?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Just after my warmup.   I just realized that I wasn't going to be able to be competitive at all today.   
   
 Q.   You had a pretty tough match the previous round.   Was this any effect from that?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   You know, it's hard to say.   It's hard to pinpoint anything, so I really don't know.  
   
 Q.   What now?   What do you think will be your next event?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, I'm playing in Charleston, so that's really still my goal, to get ready to play there.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any worries that this could go beyond this tournament?   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I mean, that's always a concern, but, I mean, I have dealt with injuries before, you know, in my whole career.   I feel like also I know how to hopefully recover quickly from them.  
   
 Q.   What's your thoughts on the upcoming Fed Cup?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Fed Cup tie?   I don't think the team has been decided yet, so...   
   
 Q.   Are you available?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I'm available.   Yes.   
   
 Q.   It's convenient.   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   It's convenient?   Yeah, I played both ties in Delray, so...   
   
 Q.   I wanted to ask who would have been your opponent today, Sloane Stephens.   She's been compared to your sister a lot.   What do you think of those comparisons, if you have any thoughts of her going forward?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, I think, you know, Serena is an unbelievable player and a legend.   If anyone has the opportunity to be compared to her, you know, it's definitely a good sign.
