Q.  What was the injury?

VENUS WILLIAMS: It was the knee area.


Q.  Left knee?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes.


Q.  It seemed like you dusted her off really quick after you got treated.  Was it feeling better or you wanted to get out of there in a hurry?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Both.  I really just wanted to get out of there in a hurry.  I didn't want to prolong my stay. The fans would have enjoyed it,  But I wouldn't have.  So, I think I had the momentum also after I came back to 4-3. Things were going pretty good at that point.


Q.  You lost that, like a major long rally about three, four strokes and -- but yet you really held it together and won that game.  Was that a turning point in your mind?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I guess I did - I don't actually remember that.  Points are very important, but you just can't let one point decide the rest of the set or the match.  You  should still stay in there.  That is what I believe.


Q.  Do you think your knee will affect you tomorrow or the next day?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I think that everything is going to go well for this tournament.


Q.  Did you feel real strong out there today?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I felt pretty good out there today. I don't think I was hitting anywhere near as well as I can. But I believe I can raise my level and I believe that even if I am playing badly, I still know how to win.


Q.  Back to the knee.  Is it a sharp pain or just kind of what do you think it is?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't think I should go into any detail.


Q.  What were some of your weaknesses tonight?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Inconsistency.  Sometimes I was missing some forehands and my serve wasn't where I wanted it to be.  I believed I had to make some corrections if I want to continue to win.  If I don't -- but I think I want to win.


Q.  How does your future of this tournament, how does it look?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think it looks very well.  The same round that I was in here last year when I was dismissed.  But I think that this year will be a little different. 


Q.  In what sense?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm a smarter player.  I'm a better player.  I know a lot more things, I feel.  I think I still have a lot to learn.  But things are much more different than what they were last year when I was sitting in this chair.


Q.  Were you aware that Serena had won her match before you took the court?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Quite aware.  I got here at 6 o'clock and I watched the television from 3-Love, 15-Love.  I was like, well, it is too late.


Q.  Do you feel more comfortable playing so close to home than in a foreign country or, you know --

VENUS WILLIAMS: Do I feel more comfortable?


Q.  Yeah, because you are really playing in your backyard, very close.

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think it is very nice that I can play here.  If I decide to, I can go home.  And there is a lot of people here who live in Florida.  Every time I go overseas, all the television and papers carry things about myself and Serena.  So everyone here really knows us and feels close to us.  So that is real good.  It is like a home crowd.


Q.  Knowing Serena won, especially that she beat Spirlea, did that pump you up?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I knew she was going to win.  I was  real happy that she did win.  But I thought she would win.


Q.  Looking forward to meeting your sister somewhere down the road in this tournament?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I would hope that we meet because then it would mean that we both did not lose.


Q.  They'd like to know who your favorite tennis player is All-Time, male or female and why?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, Serena and I have arguments over this.  She has her own favorite player.  I don't think she has a favorite player anymore.  She is going through some changes.


Q.  What was it?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I myself?  Well, I think you would have to ask her.  I, myself -- Serena doesn't like my favorite player.  And I think that since she didn't like my favorite player, I can't like him anymore either.


Q.  You are your own person?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I know.  But we have to agree, and that is just the way it is.  I can't help it.  So I am reluctant to say.


Q.  Who was it?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't think you all want to know.


Q.  We do want to know.  Now you teased us.

VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't think you would ever guess.


Q.  Is it an old one or new one?  European or American? 

VENUS WILLIAMS: European.


Q.  Bjorn Borg?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.


Q.  Active player or former player?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Active.


Q.  Arazi?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Isn't he African.  I like him a lot.  He does a lot of tricks on the courts.


Q.  Boris doesn't play anymore obviously.  Ivanisevic?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.


Q.  Are you going to tell us if we guess?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I will.


Q.  Has he ever won a tournament?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I am sure he has.


Q.  He is a Top-10 player?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.


Q.  Then there is a lot.  What country is he from?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Do you know, Dave?   Mom, do you know?


Q.  How about some initials?  Do you have a crush on this guy or you just like the way he plays?  Which is it?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, no, I like the way he plays.


Q.  You have got to give a couple more hints.  We give up.

VENUS WILLIAMS: Can you think of anything?  I am not  giving any hints.  You can give some.  Do you know?


Q.  What does it rhyme with?   What are the initials? Say the country.

VENUS WILLIAMS: I will not say the country.


Q.  Byron Black?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.  You want to know the first initial?   M..

VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes.


Q.  I call him lirch.  Now you have got to say why.

VENUS WILLIAMS: I just like the way he plays.  It looks like he is not even trying sometimes.  And, that is how it looks to me.  It looks effortless, sort of.  Sometimes I don't look effortless.


Q.  You made us work for that one.

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, she worked for that one.  You guys would never have guesses?


Q.  We would not have.  If Serena doesn't like your choice, who does she like?

VENUS WILLIAMS: You have to ask her.  I don't know if she will agree and tell you.
