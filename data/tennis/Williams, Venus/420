THE MODERATOR:  First question for Venus, please. 


Q.  Does it cushion the disappointment a little bit the way you fought at the end at least? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  It's always disappointing to lose but, you know, I think she played real well and stayed in there.  You know, she hit a lot of good shots. 

Q.  Do you think you underestimated her at all?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I had a pretty good start.  You know, it's impossible to win every match.  I tried.  But I couldn't seem to get the ball to go in today. 

Q.  Was wind a huge factor? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  The wind?  No. 

Q.  How well do you think you played? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  So and so.  I think that if I played really well, then there was a really good chance that I would have won the match for sure.  But more than anything, I think, you know, she played some real good tennis. 

Q.  How close did you feel like you were to digging out of that hole there at the end? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I definitely felt that if I could have won a game or two, you know, I would have had a nice chance to get back into the match.  And, you know, all I can do is just give her some credit for playing well. 

Q.  You saved eight matchpoints.  Were you thinking, "I can definitely do this" by that point, at that point? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Well, I always felt that I could do it until I ran out of time.  Then, of course, this is the end, so all I can do is just prepare for the clay court season now. 

Q.  How do your knees feel?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Feeling good. 

Q.  Was Serena here watching you?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't think so. 

Q.  How different is she than when you've played her in the past?  She's obviously bulked up.  Is that noticeable in her game?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think she's the same. 

Q.  What is your clay court schedule? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Just going to go over to Europe in the beginning of May. 

Q.  So nothing here? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  No. 

Q.  But Fed Cup? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yes, I am in Federation Cup.  

Q.  You lose so infrequently.  Is it a little shocking to yourself when you do?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Sure, because I'm not preparing to lose when I'm on the practice court or in the match.  I'm not playing to hope to win; I do have the expectation, of course, that the match will be a win for me.  More than anything, I think, you know, once I have a loss, then I'm able to go out and work harder.  So it's just back to the drawing board. 

Q.  Do you go back to work now at the design firm, or do you hang around and watch Serena? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I'm going to practice, pretty much. 

Q.  Can you enjoy a match like that?  I mean, obviously it's more enjoyable if you're winning.  But a match where you really have to fight, someone's making you play better and better as the match goes on, can you enjoy that? 

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Sure, I enjoy to compete.  That's the whole thing of tennis.  If you don't like to compete, then it's not a good sport to be in.
