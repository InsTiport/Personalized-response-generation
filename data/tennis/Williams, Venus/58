S. STEPHENS/V. Williams
6-1, 0-6, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your opponent gave you a standing O when you left the court and said she was honored to share the court with you.  What are your thoughts about that third set between the two of you?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was definitely well competed.  In the end, she ended up, you know, winning more points than I did.  That's what it adds up to.
Q. How would you describe the way she played that third set and the challenge you had?
VENUS WILLIAMS: It was definitely a contrast of play.  You know, I continued to play aggressive and continued to play the kind of match that it takes to win.  Just made too many errors there at the end.
Q. In the course of the all-American semifinals, so many compliments have been paid to you by people who oppose you.  I know this loss must be tough, but these American players who hopefully will represent a long, you know, lineage of great American champions, is there any consolation in that?
VENUS WILLIAMS: What does that mean?
Q. It means that players that are in semifinals attribute a lot of it to you.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, to be honest, I'm definitely here to win my matches, not for consolations.  That definitely sums it up.
Q. Do you feel good as an inspiration, these younger players, the fact they say they attribute a lot of their drive and motivation to your accomplishments?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, it's definitely wonderful to hear.
Q. What made the difference?  First set, what gave you a tough time?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I just wasn't playing well.  I just wasn't playing well.  Those are moments where you have to dig deep and figure out how to get the ball on the court and have a big game.  I can't be tentative and try to figure out how to put that ball in.
I figured out a lot, but she played great defense.  I haven't played her in a long time.  Clearly she's seen me play many, many times.  I haven't seen her play as much.
You know, it's good to play against players and you get the opportunity to understand their game a little more.
Q. There was a physical third set, running in and out of the corners.  How much of a toll did that take toward the end?  She seemed to step it up in that one return game quite well.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she played well.  I mean, there was nothing I could do about those shots.   Like I said, I played aggressively, and, you know, played the best point I could, and then she played a little better.
Sometimes you get the luck and sometimes you don't.
Q. You have said many times you don't like looking back.  You like looking forward.  What do you see in the near future for you based on how well you played this year, making it so deep in all four majors?
VENUS WILLIAMS: What do you mean?
Q. What do you see in your near future?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know.  I will continue to play tennis.  It's nothing complicated.
Q. How would you describe the year that you have had?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, definitely much more wins than losses, and a lot of great competition and a lot of learns from the wins and losses.
Q. What do you take out of your slam season?  It's been remarkable and obviously you have racked up all the wins.  Do you walk away frustrated?  Do you walk away thinking this was a dream slam season, somewhere in between?
VENUS WILLIAMS: For me, it's about putting myself in the position all the time to get the titles, and that's exactly what I did.  That's all I could do.  So that's the point of being here is to put yourself in position to win.
