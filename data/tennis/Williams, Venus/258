V. WILLIAMS/S. Kuznetsova
  6-2, 6-7, 6-4



 Q. So you've won a tough match tonight to keep yourself alive. You still have a chance of defending your title. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, definitely. My first two matches were close. You know, one point here or there, I could have three matches instead of one. 
 I guess that's the beauty of round robin, just win as much as you can. 

 Q. And what do you think made the difference tonight? You seemed to get off to a good start and then... 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, the last couple matches I tried to learn from my mistakes. When I make a mistake, I try to learn from it, instead of be frustrated by it. 
 You know, it can get a little frustrating going into a match Love-2. But I definitely stayed positive. 

 Q. Looking ahead tomorrow, will you watch the match or... 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm just going to stick to my regular schedule preparation and, you know, I'm sure they both want to win. 

 Q. They both still have a chance, as well. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah. 

 Q. That's probably quite important. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Exactly. 

 Q. You still have your doubles to come at the end of the week. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, so I'm getting ready.
