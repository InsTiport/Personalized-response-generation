C. GARCIA/V. Williams
  6‑4, 4‑6, 7‑6

Q.   Not an ideal match for you, but just tell us your overall thoughts on the match and your opponent today. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, Caroline played well.   Just was so close. 
I really enjoyed playing Wuhan, and the audience was really engaging.   I really appreciate the support and looking forward to next year.

Q.   Moving forward, obviously now you will play Beijing.   How are you generally feeling?   You played a lot of matches recently. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely a lot of matches.   You know, I have a chance to rest a little bit before Beijing and just go from there.

Q.   And lastly, any sort of thoughts on Wuhan?   Obviously a brand new tournament.   How do you find the facilities, the city, the atmosphere, the fans?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, a lot of people in the United States don't know about Wuhan, but I think this will bring a lot of world attention on the city and it deserves it.
