THE MODERATOR:  First question for Venus, please. 
 

Q.  How did you play today?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think I played a lot better and a lot more controlled especially compared to yesterday.  I think I was able to serve a lot better, too.  So it's probably  -- as far as that aspect, I was really happy.  
 

Q.  Was there anything that you did yesterday in particular that you, you know, that you felt  --?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I just made a lot of errors yesterday.  I wasn't hitting out on the ball as much as I would normally.  But a win is a win.  I got the win yesterday and that's why I was able to come back today.  
 

Q.  Do you look ahead to the next match?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.  At this point, sure.  But I'll just be getting ready, preparing and most of all thinking about what I'm going to do.  
 

Q.  Do you have tendinitis in both knees?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS: I guess I have different problems in both knees, but... Hey, it's part of life.  It's part of playing sports.
