THE MODERATOR:  First question for Venus, please. 


Q.  On that article that was in the paper, do you have any comment on it about what they claim, racism and all that junk?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I, uhm, did not see that article.  Nor do I read the papers, especially during tournament time.  But I don't think racism is junk at all. 


Q.  Your dad talked about racial taunts that he heard, I guess, before the final involving Serena.  What were you aware of?

VENUS WILLIAMS: As far as what?


Q.  What did you hear? Did you hear the same kind of thing?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I heard whatever he heard. 


Q.  Which was what?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think you already know. 


Q.  Is that a distraction, when your father's outspoken about stuff like that, or is that important for him to air his point of view?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think it's important for his point of view to be heard if he wants to speak.  And as for me, I'm here to play tennis and that only.  That makes me happy enough.


Q.  It's not a distraction?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No. 


Q.  Have you considered if you're going to go back to Indian Wells?

VENUS WILLIAMS: It's a year away.  Hopefully I'll be healthy enough to just be playing.


Q.  So you would go back there?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Only if they want me.


Q.  Did you think the booing was racially motivated?

VENUS WILLIAMS: What do you think?


Q.  I wasn't there. 

VENUS WILLIAMS: I can't say.  I mean, the questions are redundant.  It's already ten days ago.  Whatever happened, happened.  I can't change it.  There's nothing I can do about it. 


Q.  Talk about your match today.  Obviously maybe a little tougher than you might have expected?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I had some up and downs, my balls were flying.  I couldn't always keep them in.  I had to resort to other measures.  Hopefully I'll play a lot better tomorrow.


Q.  Health-wise, how are you feeling? Do you feel like you're back on track?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm feeling good.  I'm doing my best.  Today, I think I could have made the match a little shorter so that wasn't good for me as far as on my knees.  But I'm going to go home and ice and do everything I can so I won't be stiff tomorrow. 


Q.  Do you have enough to get to the finals and win?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I hope so.  It's the quarterfinals already, and I think if I get a win tomorrow then I'll have two days off and that will be good for me. 


Q.  How's your love life?

VENUS WILLIAMS: (Laughing.) I'm not on the market.  I'm not on the market.  I'm taking my ticket away, I stepped out of line.
