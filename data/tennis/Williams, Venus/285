 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. So it's another chapter in a book. What was the theme for you this time?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, it was a well-fought match. I definitely would have liked to get a few more points off my serve. You know, I think my serve wasn't going as well as I wanted today. But she brought a lot have balls back and played tough.   
  
  Q. When did you guys last hit together?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't keep track.  
  
  Q. Was it in the past couple days, or has it been a week?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't keep track.   
  
  Q. Now it's going to be on clay. What are your expectations about the clay season?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Always expect to do well. Each tournament I go to I'm going for the win.  
  
  Q. What about the French Open? It was a bit disappointing for you last year.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I had some issues last year. That was last year.  
  
  Q. It's completely different?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Totally.   
  
  Q. How did you feel you played tonight?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, I think I had some errors sneak in sometimes. That doesn't help.   
 I did the best I could today. I'm just looking to do better always.  
  
  Q. Did you feel like the level picked up in the third set from both of you?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think so. But in any third-set match the stakes are higher. You know, at that point it's winner take all. So, yeah, it's always good.  
  
  Q. Trouble with your serve today. You gave her lots of breakpoint opportunities.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, my service games didn't go exactly the way I wanted today.   
  
  Q. Are you still surprised by the way Serena plays?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: She's a great player, so I expect her to play great.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like she's able to go through like a dry spell, three, four games, and she could just, when she knows she's in trouble, she has that switch she can just turn on?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, she plays well always. I mean, I like to think if there's three or fours games where she doesn't play as well, maybe it has something to do with me if I'm playing her at that moment.  
  
  Q. What would you do differently against her? Anything?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, it's still so close to the match. I'll definitely have to think about it. I'm sure we'll play again. I'll make those adjustments.  
  
  Q. You two going to hang out tonight, dinner, late snack?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: It's almost midnight. It's not hang-out time.   
  
  Q. Is there any sense that even though you lost, you enabled her to retain her No. 1 ranking?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm really -- even though she's my sister, I'm still here to win the matches. You know, I can't give anyone anything.   
 So I'm disappointed that I lost tonight, whether or not she kept the ranking or not.   
  
  Q. How would you gauge the final now between Serena and Victoria? Obviously you've played them both.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, Serena is -- obviously Victoria is talented. But, you know, Serena -- yeah, Serena is Serena.
