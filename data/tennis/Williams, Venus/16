V. WILLIAMS/Q. Wang
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You appeared to be enjoying yourself today.  What aspects of your game did you enjoy today?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think just the focus today was really there.  That was great.
My opponent, she also played well, too.  It was nice to be able to have answers for her play.
I guess I had some fun on the court, too.  Some of those calls...  I don't know.  You never know which way it's gonna go.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.
Q. Have you spoken to Serena since you've been here?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.  I think she would love to be here, too, to be honest.  I'll advise.
Q. You've got Ash Barty in the next round.  She's just come off a great clay court season.  What are your thoughts going into that one?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she's playing well on the grass, too.  It's not easy to get to these quarterfinals.  No match is easy.  So I'll have to have a feel for it tomorrow and see what works.
Q. One thing that I was really impressed with about your match today, the first set, that volley that you were able to stretch for was probably one of the best volleys I have seen.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Thank you.  I don't know how that happened, honestly (smiling).  It was, like, I have long arms.
Q. Jo Konta was in here talking about having a dog with her.  He makes her feel better.  Have you met Konta's dog?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.
Q. Any comment about dogs?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I just met him yesterday, and she's always been actually really kind to my dog, always comes over and says hello to Harry.  I think she and Harry have their own little relationship.  It's pretty cute.
My dog actually doesn't like tennis, doesn't like balls.  So he really likes me for me.
Q. You have changed a few of your routines this year, coming here.  You usually go home after Paris.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I really usually can't wait to get home and I just want to get off the road.  I don't even play that much.  I have never played as much as my contemporaries.
I'm just excited to be on tour and enjoying every moment.  It feels like an adventure.  I don't know.  Next year I'll do the same thing.  Maybe I'll start even earlier.  Stay a little longer.  Who knows?  We'll see.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
VENUS WILLIAMS: I wanted to play.  I just wanted to play.  That's all.  I wanted to be on court.
