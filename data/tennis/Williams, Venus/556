Q.  How did you turn that match around in the second set? 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I tried to apply different strategy by lifting the ball up whenever I could.  For sure, if you lift the ball, it's too short, most likely a winner will be hit.  That's what I tried to do.  I just kept trying to keep winning the points, just for every point. 
 
Q.  What happened with your leg today?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  A lot of things.  Can you be more specific? 
 
Q.  You had the trainer come out.
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, that was for my calf the first time. 
 
Q.  What about the second time?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  That was for my thigh more or less. 
 
Q.  Was it cramping because of the heat? 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No. 
 
Q.  How much did it bother you?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  It bothered me to the point where I needed medical attention. 
 
Q.  Can you tell us when the injury first happened?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  It was sometime during the second set.  I really can't remember the exact order.  I don't know. 
 
Q.  Did you sense the crowd yelling?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  You have some fans out there that are pretty good,  but then you have to be tough on yourself, too. 
 
Q.  How much did the heat bother you today?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I was warm enough to where I was still able to move.  I didn't run for everybody ball like I did last night. 
 
Q.   (Inaudible) the other?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Not too much.  I think there's a slight difference, but nothing too drastic. 
 
Q.  Do you remember when the injury occurred?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I was up 3-Love, but it was only a break.  So if I wasn't serious, I wouldn't win the match.  I guess I wasn't serious. 
 
Q.  What about your second serve?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, my second serve I think is a  little better.  For sure, you need to have a good second serve.  I step up there and try to hit it sometimes. 
 
Q.  Any reason why you had so many problems with your first serve?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't think I had problems; I just don't think it was as good as yesterday. 
 
Q.  How tough was Lindsay?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  She's definitely improving herself over time, just like everyone else in their right mind.  You can't stay in the same place.  That would be no good. Others will come and pass you. 
 
Q.  I this a new injry?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, never really had that before really.  Definitely muscular, nothing more than that. 
 
Q.  Do you think this will affect you for the US Open?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't think so.  I think I'll start with a stretching routine, things like that, get myself back in shape. 
 
Q.  Do you think this will affect you for the following California tournaments?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't think so.  If I found that I would have to pull out, of course I would look into my health first. 
 
Q.  What tournaments are you playing and what is Serena  playing in California?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I've only booked one.  Serena is booked on the next one.  I'm playing San Diego.  She's  playing the LA, the Acura. 
 
Q.  You've said you've had a lot of good matches with Lindsay.
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Definitely a lot of good matches. I'm coming along.  We're the top American players right now.  Definitely getting myself together set by set.  I'll have to have some better results in the future. 
 
Q.  You've lost to her four times.  What makes her such a tough opponent?  What does she do?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Well, I just think that she keeps the ball pretty deep.  She also has some pace on it, pretty consistent player over the years.  Like I didn't play her before '97.  I didn't play her before when she was younger. I just played her when she really started stepping up her game. 
 
Q.  Can you tell us something about the painting lesson?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I didn't really learn how to paint.  I don't think I'm an expert.  I had a new beginning. 
 
Q.  What do you mean by having to get serious or I wasn't serious?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think that's just like one of my favorite words basically. 
 
Q.  What is your ultimate goal at this point?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I try to be serious no matter what tournament I play.  When I get to the Grand Slams, I for sure try to bear down and go for every point.  This year I  really haven't advanced past the quarterfinals.  I think I'm doing it a lot better than what a lot of the other players did when they started. 
 
Q.  And the Olympics?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, yeah, definitely, next year. I'm going to have fun.  I'm going to just have all the fun I can have with Serena, together, play some tennis at the same time. 
 
Q.  Doubles?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Serena and I? 
 
Q.  Yes.
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  We play doubles.  Serena has opportunities.  We have ourselves together.  We have a small ranking. 
 
Q.  Have you reflected on the Wimbledon match with Novotna, some of the things you learned?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  That was like four weeks ago. That's old. 
 
Q.  Have you thought about it, what you might have taken away from it?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I just think that maybe I played the points too fast.  I should have just slowed myself down.  But other than that, there's nothing that can be done about that.  There will be another opportunity next year for another 128 players.  
 
Q.  Are you pleased with your performance overall?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I guess so.  For sure I wanted to have a better result, but that's not available now.  Move onto the next tournament and just work. 
 
Q.  The first set, you came out not too sharp.
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't think so.  I think I had some opportunities but wouldn't capitalize.  I don't mean couldn't, I mean wouldn't.  They're different.  For sure, it's a step I can make in the future. 
 
Q.  After the second injury time-out, did the court burn you?  Was it very hot down there?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  It didn't feel hot.  I was stretching.  I don't think it was hot at all.  No, it wasn't.
