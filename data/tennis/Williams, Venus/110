V. WILLIAMS/M. Sakkari
  7‑5, 4‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. You're a five‑time champion here, yet you were out on Court18, the smallest of the show courts. Martina Navratilova tweeted that it stinks. Did you feel it was disrespectful?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not so much into disrespect. I'm willing to play anywhere, any time. Of course, I was happy to be on the schedule. 
I think if all players have to play outside, all players should have to play outside. There shouldn't be exceptions or any inequality to it. 
For me, no problems playing anywhere. Anyone should play anywhere.

Q. When you say that, you mean both men and women?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Exactly, both men and women. I played many times on outside courts. It didn't matter how many titles I had won or what my ranking was at that time. It didn't make a difference whether I played on an outside court or a center court. 
Like I said, I don't mind where I play. It's just as long as everyone plays on the outside courts, you know. 

Q. Are you frustrated that they have taken a step back getting more women's matches on main courts? 
VENUS WILLIAMS: It's not the ideal schedule for the women. We'd like to see equal amount of matches. We don't want more, just the same amount, that's all. 

Q. Could you imagine a five‑time male champion being on an outside court?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I haven't seen that in the scheduling yet (smiling). 

Q. How good does it feel to win two Wimbledon matches in one day? 
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's not easy out there. Our opponents always play really well in singles, doubles, mixed, any other event that we may be in. There's really never an easy point. 
It's nice to know, okay, I can get through these matches against opponents who are playing so well. 

Q. The other day you said you feel an infinity inside of you. What did you mean by that?
VENUS WILLIAMS: To clarify, I meant that people in general have this infinity inside of them. None of us feel old. None of us feel unable. We all feel able no matter what age we are. Sometimes the body doesn't agree, but... 
At this point my infinity is still agreeing. 

Q. Given that great outlook, what are your most specific, if any, hopes for your tennis future and your beyond‑tennis future?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Tennis future, of course, I want to win. I'm not here to not win. What's the point of being here? It's easier said than done. Everyone's playing well. Everybody plays really well. There's no easy matches. 
Of course, outside the court, I'm already doing what I'd like to do with my life. I'd like to see that continue.

Q. Can you elaborate what your favorite activities are that you're doing outside of tennis?
VENUS WILLIAMS: My most favorite activities are hanging out with my family, with my dog. I mean, when you're on tour, you feel like you miss 66% of your life, two‑thirds of your life, with people you love. It's a big sacrifice. It's a big sacrifice. 
I feel like I've missed more than half my dog's life, and now he's nine. There's a big sacrifice. Of course, that's my favorite thing. 
Of course, in terms of work and productivity, of course, EleVen, my fashion line, and V Starr Interiors. That's more than enough. 

Q. Your success is long running, but today was a big day for a lot of Americans. Where do you see American tennis these days?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Honestly, I haven't seen any result. I've been so busy playing matches. On the court close to four hours today. I have no idea what has happened. 
But Americans have been winning more and more matches, which is a beautiful thing. Especially if you come from America, you love it even more.

Q. The other day you mentioned the 2020 Olympics. I don't know if there was any seriousness to that statement. Do you have an end of the road in the back of your head or you're just continuing to do and play and work hard each and every day?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, no exact end of the road. It's hard to think about the end when you're playing well. I don't have any plans on making any comebacks. So when I'm done, I'll definitely lay it down, try to get a life of some sort. 
If I'm at 2020 and that's part of the plan, then I'll be there.

Q. Do you think for you it's going to be a retirement of you finish a match and you walk away, or you have a swan song farewell tour?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not into a swan song. When I'm done, it will be done, yeah.

Q. You made an interesting comment that you learn the most from matches you lose. You said you learned from your loss to Timea at the French Open. What did you learn from that match?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I learned I needed to win that match. Losing is never fun, but I try to have a good attitude about it, even when you're on the court. You never know when that loss or that win is going to be you. You have to be at least happy for your opponent because they played well. 
I don't like bad attitudes when I lose or anybody else loses. You have to be a sportsman. 
I congratulated her on that match. 

Q. We got emails about a new top executive coming in at EleVen. Were you involved in that decision?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I don't know what's out there, so... 

Q. On the court, when you're walking out to Court18, a court you might not be entirely happy to play on, is it tough to focus on that? Any sense of frustration at all?
VENUS WILLIAMS: To make it crystal clear, like I said, I wasn't unhappy to play on Court 11 [sic]. I just want equality for men's and women's matches. That's what I'm unhappy about. I have no problem where I play. I'll play on the practice courts if I need to. I have no problem with that. 

Q. In terms of your game and your approach throughout your whole career, what do you think the biggest reasons for your great success have been?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. There's never one reason. Definitely hard work. Cannot ever get around it. Natural talent, like, always helps. Thank you, mom and dad. That helps a lot. Self‑belief is so important. That's huge. No matter what, you have to try to believe, even if it's hard.

Q. What natural talents, what set you apart as a player?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I'm 6'1", so that helps. I'm 6'1" and I'm also not slow. So that helps. There are certain things that you never know what your natural talent is going to be. Other people have amazing hands. Everybody has something that they're good at. That's a natural talent. 

Q. Have you been in touch with your mom today, who met Camilla, the Duchess, today?
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I don't know what's going on here. I just know when it's time for me to be on court, I try to be there. Anything else, I have no idea what's happening. 
That's cool. My mom is a cool lady. So is Camilla. 

Q. A little earlier, Madison Keys said she marvels at your serve and always has. What do you think the biggest components of your great serve have been?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I'm 6'1", very long arm (laughter). 
But she has an amazing serve, too. I have so much respect for her and her game. She's such a joy in tennis, a fresh breath of air, such a talent. I enjoy watching her play. I enjoy being on the Fed Cup team with her. That was very nice of her to say. 

Q. Do you plan on talking to the tournament managers about the court situation or do you feel as if you've done that and they're not listening?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I'm sure that the WTA supervisors have done their best to, you know, try to make the schedule equal. But also the All England Club has to have a culture where they want to have equality, as well. They need to want to pursue that. 
I would love to see where we don't have to talk about this any more in the press conference. 

Q. I know you love spending time in Italy. What do you love most in Italy?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think just the atmosphere and the ambiance. Also it's beautiful, so... You can't beat it. 

Q. What is your relationship with Wimbledon, the tournament, if you had to describe it as a relationship like you have with family or friends?
VENUS WILLIAMS: That's an interesting question. I don't know if I have an answer for that.
