V. WILLIAMS/J. Jankovic
  5-7, 6-3, 6-4



 Q. The week didn't start very well, but you're through to the final and with a chance of still defending that title. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I came so close to winning my first two matches. My last match in the round robin, I was just determined to not have Love-3. That was really what it was about. 
 You know, winning a set in every match I played, at least one set, really kept my dream alive.

 Q. You seemed to be struggling a little bit early on, had some treatment. What was the problem and how is it now?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I didn't actually take an injury timeout because I didn't think that would help. I just took the time on the changeover. You know, I just kept playing.

 Q. Obviously having lost that first set, what did you say to yourself? How did you turn it around?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh, I had to stop making so many errors. Usually when I lose, I kind of, you know, hurt myself with the errors. 
 It helped that I was able to bring some down in the second. You know, she kept playing so well, though. 

 Q. One more match before you can defend that title, and the possibility of playing your sister in the final. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes, it's wonderful. I'm so excited. It's the way I wanted to end the year.
