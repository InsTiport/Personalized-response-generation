V. WILLIAMS/S. Cirstea
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How well do you think you were striking the ball in that match?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it felt good out there.  Just trying to work the point, do what it takes to win the point.  I haven't played in a long time and just get used to the court.  So yeah.
Q. How quick does it take when it's been a while since you have been in a match to kind of get back into a rhythm?  Is it a set time or a few games or minutes?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, definitely.  It takes me a few games, a few matches before hopefully you get it where you want it to be.  But you could have played a lot and then not have your best match.  It can go either way.
Q. You were really efficient in that first set and then she put a lot of pressure on you right at the beginning of the second set.  How did you regroup or focus to put your foot on the gas?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I had a lot of opportunities in those games I lost, so I knew I was putting myself in the position to win those games.  I think not getting down double break was super helpful for me.  She played well in that game, but I was happy to get it and keep it close.  I think that made a difference.
Q. If Serena does prevail, you'll of course play her again.  If you had to say one favorite match you had against your sister, what would that match be?
VENUS WILLIAMS: We have played so many.
Q. Yeah.
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know.  Maybe the first one we ever played.  I never thought about it.
Q. What was that match, Venus?
VENUS WILLIAMS: It was, like, the first one.
Q. Was it --
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't really have a favorite.  Let's put it that way.
Q. I fully appreciate that she's still out there, but if it does come to fruition, it will be the first time you have played her since Melbourne last year.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Since when?
Q. Australian Open.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.
Q. Seems like years ago.  What would your mindset be going into such a match against Serena again?  How would you -- your thoughts on that?
VENUS WILLIAMS: She's playing really well and just honing her game.  When she's missing, it's not by much.  Obviously I have to play better than her and see how the match goes.
Q. How did it feel?  Did you watch her match?  What were some of your emotions getting to see her back on the court again?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, she looked like she never lost a step, really, and was controlling the match.  Her opponent played really, really, really well, to be honest.  Probably produced maybe the best tennis of her career.  For Serena to win against someone that inspired and free is a great, great way to come back.
Q. You have talked about notepads and preparation.  It's been a long time since you faced your opponent today.  What was your preparation like?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Really just trying to see what happens.  That's it.  People change.  It's been a long time.  See what happens.
