An interview with:
VENUS WILLIAMS
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Which part of Madison's game do you see as having improved in the last year or so?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Obviously she fights really hard.  You know, she really does everything well.  Hits great off the forehand, the backhand.  She's improved her movement a lot.
Yeah, just solid all around.
Q. You came back in the second set.  In the third set, what do you think was the difference?  She elevated?  You struggled to maintain?
VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, it was only a few points here or there.  I think it just came down to holding serve and get a break.  I just didn't get any breaks in that set.  It would have been nice to get an early break or a break in the middle of the match.
Q. Are you an introvert or an extrovert and does that affect your play at all?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm somewhere in the middle.
Q. An ambivert?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Maybe.  Whatever that is.  I haven't heard that one yet.
Q. Do you draw energy from the crowd or are you focused in the moment?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm pretty focused.  But it's always nice when the crowd is there with you.  You feel like, wow, you can't let them down.  You definitely feel energy from that.
Q. I have to ask about the serve.  Obviously it was slow again today.  What do you think you have to do to get it ready for Rio?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'll do everything I can to get ready for Rio.  I mean, that's my plan from this very moment onwards.  I'll do my best to be my best then.
Q. Are you looking forward to having a few days off?  Will you have a few days off?  Will you put the racquet down a little bit or is it too quick of a turnaround?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, tomorrow.  But I think by Saturday I'll be back after it and stuff.  I'll be excited to be on the court.
Q. The Olympics, is it a big deal as an American to be there or is it just another tennis tournament from your viewpoint?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think all the Americans that are playing are pretty excited about it.  Everybody is pretty ready and pretty pumped.
Q. When you think about the Dream Team, or, for a Canadian, hockey, a huge deal.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, I agree.
