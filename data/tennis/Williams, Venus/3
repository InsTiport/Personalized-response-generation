K. MUCHOVA/V. Williams
6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Despite the loss tonight, what are your thoughts about what's ahead for you given your coaching change and the adjustments to your game?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's been a really fast-paced summer.  Just having to start very quickly in every tournament with really kind of no room to breathe or adjust during the tournament.  That's been a little bit tough.
To be honest, I'm really happy with my game.  I don't think I played badly tonight.  Just needed to start faster than what I did.  I'm pretty happy with how I played.  She just played a little better.
Q. Talk about your continued passion for tennis at this point in your career.
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I love this game.  I'm good at what I do.  It's easy to stay motivated and excited about doing something so amazing.  Not many people get to do this.  Really fortunate and blessed to be someone who has gotten a chance to do it.
Q. Talk about tonight's match and what you considered the key points in that match.
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, staying aggressive, serving well.  I think we both served pretty well.  I think I made just more unforced errors than she did.  Just having some better shot selection.  That comes with playing your way into the tournament, those sorts of things.  Just ran out of time today.
Q. You talked about having to work through the quick transition all summer long.  How hard is it going to be to now head to the clay at Roland Garros, maybe a warmup event?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's going to be another quick transition, as well.  But I look forward to a few days off.  It's been a lot of work.  Looking forward to just having a little bit of a rest before the clay courts.
Q. What do you have to do tactically to adapt your game so quickly to the red clay?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I don't know.  I'll talk to my coach about it.  I haven't even thought about that yet.  I'll think about it in the next few days.
