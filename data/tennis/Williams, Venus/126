THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Congratulations on the final. The way you played here so far and the consistency you showed at the very end the year, how much of that pleased you and how much it built for next year and years to come?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Of course I want to end the year on a good note. The quality players here has been very high. I haven't had any easy matches, even today. She played really well and put up a good fight.  
So I'm very happy to have high‑quality tennis against players who are such high quality.   
   
 Q. What would you say is the biggest difference between you playing right now ‑ in your game today ‑ than, let's say, a year ago? Is it the starts are coming quicker? The recovery is better? More consistency?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I feel better. When you feel better you play better. That's pretty much it.   
   
 Q. Just in terms of today's match, being able to get the fast start and jump on top of her, what is it about her game that you felt like you were able to impose yours against?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, against her I have an opportunity to dictate, and of course she takes her opportunities as she can as well.  
If you hit a short ball she figures out how to hit a winner, even though she doesn't have maybe the same power as some of the more powerful players.  
So it was just about not making a lot of errors. That's really when the trouble starts for me against a player like her, the errors and kind of getting them into the match.   
Even in Wuhan I had a 3‑Love start and I stopped playing‑‑ I didn't play as well for the rest of the match. Today I tried to really reverse that and play more consistently and aggressive at the same.   
   
 Q. Your opponent said just now she might not play maybe two more years; only one year for her. At this time of your career as a player entering your 30s, do you feel like you need extra motivation by doing extremely well in some of the tournaments, big ones?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think when you're in your 30s it's about playing well. You've had the career; you've played a lot of years; so if you're still playing well, that's the motivation. The fact that you still can challenge for titles and that you're still the one to beat.  
So at this point in my career I've never felt like I walked on the court and I wasn't the one to beat. I never felt like my opponent hasn't had to play extremely well to get a win.   
I think that's what it's about when you're in your 30s.   
   
 Q. We don't know who you're going to play tomorrow, Pliskova or Svitolina. How much do you know about each of their games?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I have never played Pliskova; I think I played Svitolina maybe a couple times.  
I'd never really seen Pliskova play before the other day. I watched a little bit of her playing. So that was a new experience, to not have seen someone in the top 20 play before.  
So clearly they both have different game styles. Regardless, it's about going out there and executing my game the best that I can. That gives me a good chance.   
   
 Q. I know you've been over here, but have you heard anything about this whole thing about the cell phone with your sister back home?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes.  
   
 Q. What's your reaction to that?   
VENUS WILLIAMS: She's the stuff heros are made of. I mean, everybody has that experience where your phone gets lifted. I just hope I never find myself in that situation where I have to go and be like her.  
But I hope she never finds herself in that situation too. Apparently it's world news now from what I heard.  
It's relevant around the world. Your phone.   
   
 Q. I have an off‑court question. Yesterday I visited the player zone including the player restaurant, lounge, and gym. They are close to one another. What do you think about this setup? What are your comments about it?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Great setup. Really happy. It's easy. You know it's a good setup when you don't think about it.  
Good job, Zhuhai.
