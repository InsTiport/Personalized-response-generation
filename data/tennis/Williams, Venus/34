6-2, 6-7, 8-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Showed a lot of guts out there today.  How did you see the match?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, just ran out of time in the end.  She played really well.  You have to win the last point, and I didn't succeed in that today.
Q. Has there been any common denominator to the slow starts in your matches here?  You dug a hole in this one, and almost pulled it out again.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, the third set was really competitive.  It was just toe-to-toe there.
Q. The first set, what was the key do you think to the slow starts in all three matches so far?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, probably just too many errors.  But my opponents also played well.
Q. Is the overwhelming emotion disappointment?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Of course.  The plan is to go out and try to win the matches.  You just go out and regroup afterwards.
Q. Do you have a bit of pride in the way you fought your way back time and time again?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.  You know, I think she was just a little bit luckier than I was in the end.  Sometimes it takes luck and skill.  You know, she definitely deserved that one.
Q. What do you think the role of luck is in our sport?  Let courts, scheduling, lots of things.
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't really think about that.
Q. Are there any thoughts of what next, whether you'll be back here next year?
VENUS WILLIAMS: No.
Q. What does the opportunity to compete here at Wimbledon mean to you?
VENUS WILLIAMS: It's an opportunity earned.
Q. How far will Serena go?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Hopefully just round after round.  That would be awesome.  Looks like she played a great match today.
Q. Do you think we will see you next year here, Venus?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.
Q. Seems like the fire is still there.  We could see on court the passion you have for the sport still.
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.
