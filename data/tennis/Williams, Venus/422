THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Venus, please.  
 
 
Q.  I loved watching you play today. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Thanks.  
 
Q.  You were running so well. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Thanks.  
 
Q.  Do you enjoy coming in on the short balls? 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I think it's a key point to playing good tennis.  More than anything, when I'm out there on the court, I just try to say, "Play the ball," and just play tennis.  A lot of times that includes getting up to the short ones. 
 
Q.  You do that awfully well. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Thanks. 
 
Q.  Is it your combination of short followed by the overhead or the other way around?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Well, I guess I'm quite good at that because of my height.  I can kind of reach all the balls with ease, it's a real blessing.  
 
Q.  How hard is it not to look ahead a couple matches? 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, I haven't really even seen the draw yet.  I haven't really been around.  I kind of get here for the match and play.  There's no draws up in the locker room, and I haven't been up to the players' lounge or anything.  
 
Q.  I guess you'll watch your sister's match tonight?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I play tomorrow.  I think there's another match tomorrow, so I'll actually go and recuperate. 
 
Q.  So that would be three in a row for you?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Uh-hmm. 
 
Q.  I know you were saying two in a row is normal.  Is three in a row normal?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  Do you like that better, do you get in more of a rhythm not skipping a day?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, I don't even know.  I'm just playing when I'm on the schedule.  
 
Q.  I was relieved today you won quickly.  I was afraid the rain was going to interrupt the last game.  When it's this cloudy, does that get into your thinking?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I was just really trying to be real consistent.  The match was going over an hour.  I wanted to really just play well in the games and not lose serve so that did happen.  
 
Q.  You play the winner of the Maleeva-Shaughnessy match.  Can you talk about those two players, your experiences. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I played both of them quite a few times, so I should be ready.  
 
Q.  Anything about their games in particular?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  They're both real good.  I think they've both been Top 20 in the past and probably Top 20 now.  So I'm definitely going to be on top of my game.
