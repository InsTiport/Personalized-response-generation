THE MODERATOR:  First question for Venus, please. 


Q.  You look like you didn't want to hang around out there. 

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, it was very hot.  I didn't really want to make my stay too long but sometimes you do end up staying out there a little longer than what you propose in the beginning.  But today was pretty fortunate.

Q.  Were you surprised, the way Denisa played the first set, especially the first six games?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think she played very well.  I think also I had unforced errors, I was up an early break.  Then she tied it back at 2-all.  We were on serve until I guess 5-4, I managed to get the break.  After that, I played a little better and maybe she was a little bit nervous; I don't know. 

Q.  Now that Serena and Martina and yourself and Seles or whatever are into the second week, the tournament really begins? Is that kind of how you guys really see it?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I guess it is somewhat like two tournaments in which maybe the first week is possibly more dangerous because of you're playing lower-ranked players until you're in the fourth round.  You really have to be on your guard.  The second week is when you really have to be ready to play.  So in both ways, both weeks are very, very important. 

Q.  You play next round Amelie Mauresmo.  You played each other once three years ago, but you have changed your game and she has changed her game.  You have both progressed.  What do you expect of that match?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, we both have come really a long way since then.  She's  -- the Finals of this tournament.  She's really popular in France.  I've won a few titles myself.  So I think that tomorrow will definitely be  -- or whenever I play her  -- will be an important match.  Naturally, we advance to the quarterfinals.  She likes playing here in Australia, I think she likes the surface and I think basically I want to go out there and play my game and be serious and not take anything for granted. 

Q.  What do you know about her, her game?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I know she likes to hit her backhand I guess.  I haven't played her in a while, a long time. 

Q.  Do you prefer playing a player like her, who really generates a lot of speed like the way you do then you can feed off that? Or is it easier to play a player like that as opposed to Hingis, where she mixes up a lot more?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I think anyone likes to have a lot of time.  So I guess someone who plays with less speed, I feel like I have more time.  Today against Chladkova sometimes I felt like I had less time but it wasn't very much of an issue because every player's different so I have to be ready for that. 

Q.  Venus, when you were a kid did you follow the tennis, the stars, the women stars at the moment? Because at that time, the three or four top players didn't have any problem in the previous matches until reaching the quarters or the semifinals.  Today we can see Denisa against you today, Martina had a lot of trouble in the first set.  It's completely different, isn't it?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's different.  I think in that time maybe the players didn't really believe that they could win or have a chance.  But maybe over the years they start realizing,  "Hey, I want a better career for myself.  I, too, want to advance.  Why can't I win?" I think just the whole attitude, not necessarily even like the game, just how people feel about themselves and playing against the top players. 

Q.  (Inaudible). 

VENUS WILLIAMS: It was a protection for me. 

Q.  No injury?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I'm doing okay. 

Q.  Which sort of relationship do you have with the people in the locker room? It's your sister, you, the others?  Do you have someone who you are close to, you can speak with, you can do a practice together, you like, you go out to dinner?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I don't know any players like that.  Not very much. 

Q.  No interest?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, even last year we played nine tournaments so I'm not around a lot.  And I mean I say hello to the girls.  Sometimes we have some conversations about different things, but I don't really know anyone so closely. 

Q.  Somebody spotted you in a record shop this week, is that right? Have you been out buying CDs?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No, that wasn't me. 

Q.  You haven't played with the same outfit today as on the first day.  Is there a reason?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.  I wear the same outfit.  (Shaking her head yes).

Q.  Is black your favorite color?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, blue was my favorite color, but now it's army green.  Green.  So I've moved on. 

Q.  So you would have a new outfit next week perhaps?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know.  It could happen. 

Q.  It looked like you had sewn up the slit across.  Is it completely sewn up now just to make it more comfortable?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  It's the same outfit.  I was always comfortable with it.

Q.  Was it modified in some way?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Modified?

Q.  Like was it sewn up, stitched up?

VENUS WILLIAMS: (Laughing.) No.  It's the same outfit. 

Q.  How many people called you and left you messages and flowers and something like that, how many men?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Not too many. 

Q.  (Inaudible)

VENUS WILLIAMS: It's a good thing.  I can't have my mind anywhere else.  It's too much.  But I think people are shy these days.  It's so tough, you know, people are being rejected all the time and nobody wants that. 

Q.  With the other girls you talk about fashion?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.  Not very much.  Not about fashion, no. 

Q.  What do you think of Martina's outfit with the long sleeve and the short sleeve?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I think that style was out last year.  You know, it was something that was popular from the designers right down to the popular price level.  So, you know, it's something that was in fashion on the runways and now it's on the tennis courts. 

Q.  What classes did you take when you were at school this fall?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Speech.  Science. Many fashion concepts, deals with the demographics of the people you're dealing with, knowing your customer, knowing how to sell your product and your lines, pattern making.  (Laughing.)  What else did I have? Two more classes.  Textiles.  I was very disappointed with my teacher who was so bitter.  And I had fashion history, which was very interesting actually.  Very inspirational.  I would have never known all the things  -- well, school you learn so much.  So I had six classes.

Q.  Have you thought in depth about what you would like to do with this education?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Me?

Q.  Do you expect it to lead to a job in the fashion industry once you stop playing tennis?

VENUS WILLIAMS: I'll have to work for myself, work at my own pace.  But I really don't want to be too busy.  I work hard now and I think that when you have a big business, sure, you can make money and have a dream.  But it's a lot of work.  I don't want to work that hard after tennis. 

Q.  You guys are from Florida.  What do you think of George Bush taking the oath of office today?

VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, boy.  There's a lot you can say on that.  But I didn't vote. 

Q.  You didn't?

VENUS WILLIAMS: No.  I'm not political.  I'm a Jehovah's Witness, we don't really vote.  No matter what happens, we'll be all right.
