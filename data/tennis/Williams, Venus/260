 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Venus, please.   
  
  Q. This is your second defeat. The title seems to be away from you. You were suffering on your serve. What was happening with you out there?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, today was a close match. Definitely would have liked to have won, try to defend my title. But I'm looking forward to coming back next year.  
  
  Q. What happened with you exactly? Your fitness? You were hitting the ball outside.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, like I said, it was a close match. It was close to three hours. You know, I came close to winning. I would have liked to have won.   
  
  Q. Were you happier with the way you played today compared with yesterday?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. In some ways. I mean, I'm happiest with a win, so... That makes me happiest, as far as on the court.   
  
  Q. What are some plus points in the performance?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, in the tiebreak, I think maybe I played one loose point, and that was about it. I remained aggressive. Just kind of by one point, so...   
  
  Q. How about Fed Cup?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Did they announce the team?   
  
  Q. Yes.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Am I on the list?   
  
  Q. You are not on the list.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: There you go.   
  
  Q. Why are you not on the list?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know what, I can't play after that. I just can't. I can't do it.   
  
  Q. Do you think the team will be in a difficult situation without you?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: You know, the team got to the finals without me. So they can definitely win without me.   
 I've given a lot of time to Fed Cup over the years. I'm just unable to play more tennis after this Championships.   
  
  Q. It's a little early to be asking, but if you're to get through 2010 in the shape you want to be, have you got to change anything?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: What?   
  
  Q. To get through next year, the whole season, be in good shape most of the time, is there anything you have to change or do differently?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, there's a lot of things that can be done, you know. You know, that's a solid question. But I'm not sure that I have the answer quite yet, you know.   
  
  Q. You may have heard there's been a lot of talk in the media today about Andre Agassi's book where he reveals he used crystal meth in the '90s, but was let off by the ATP Tour. As someone who has known him, what was your reaction to that and if you were surprised that he was able to get off that easily after testing positive for something like that?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: What's the question?   
  
  Q. What's your reaction to his revelation that he used that in the '90s?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: His book will probably sell. It seems really very interesting, to say the least. But, I mean, what am I supposed to say about Andre's life? I can't say anything.   
  
  Q. Now Serena is No. 1. What do you feel about this result?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's always nice to end the year as No. 1. It's definitely a really good accomplishment, a great accomplishment.
