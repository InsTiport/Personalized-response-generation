V. WILLIAMS/G. Muguruza   
7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What was the mindset going into tonight's match, knowing that it was a win-and-in situation?  Did it make it easier almost kind of knowing it was almost like a typical tournament?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: What happened?   
 Q.  That it was a win-and-in situation.  That if you won, you were into the semifinals.  If you lost, you went home.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: That pretty much sums it up.   
 Q.  But did it affect your mindset at all going in?  You looked pretty intense from the get-go compared to the earlier two matches.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm pretty used to going home after you lose, so I knew what the stakes were.   
 Q.  Was it a little sweet revenge for Wimbledon?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, not at all.   
 Q.  Do the same things make you happy for a win now as they did maybe when you first started?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Ah, a win is a win, whether it's like today or yesterday.   
 Q.  So you feel exactly the same now as you did back when you started in '94 when you got a win?  No change?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Not that I'm aware of.   
 Q.  It looked like the energy levels dropped a little bit in the second set.  How much of it do you think was because of a long match you played against Ostapenko?  And how is the body feeling?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, pretty much I'm just focused on Saturday, trying to win again.  I don't know.   
 Q.  After all your many years of being in the sport, what do you still look to get out of the game?  And what of tennis remains fun for you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Wins.   
 Q.  Which was your most painful loss?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: All of them.  They all were horrible.   
 Q.  The crowd seems to be really behind you, and they get probably the most excited for your matches that I have noticed over the week.  What have you made of the Singapore crowd, and how much have they helped you through this week?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, they have been super supportive.  That's awesome.  I have never had a chance to play here, so to feel that kind of support is just amazing.   
 Q.  If you could eat only one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Doughnuts.   
 Q.  Me too.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I love you (smiling).
