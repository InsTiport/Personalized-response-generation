   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about the match?  What do you think happened there?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I definitely think that I just struggled with my consistency a little bit.  I think I played decent in the first set, but it was definitely about being consistent.   
 I felt like I had definitely some points where I played like I wanted to play, moving forward and everything, and the rhythm, and there were a lot of points where I wasn't quite there.   
  
  Q.  There were a lot of errors on both sides, and double faults.  Was that more the conditions or the tension of the match?  What do you think?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, it's really windy out there, so it takes a lot of options away on the serve.  It becomes a lot more challenging.   
  
  Q.  Venus, it's 5-5 in the third set, and you start your service game off with two service winners.  It looks like you're in control of this game now.  It's never materialized.  You had four game points in there and you couldn't put any of them away.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, she played some good points and hung in there.  I have to give her credit for that.   
  
  Q.  Is there any one of those points that you didn't convert that you really regret?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  There's quite a few points I would have chosen, not just one.  If I could choose, I'd choose to win every point.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel like you played the wrong shot on any of those four points?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't really remember exactly the four points.  It was a long game, actually.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that she won the game or that you lost the game because of the unforced errors?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I definitely had a lot more unforced errors than she did.  And even if I bring those down to half and just have as many as she does, I think the match would go a lot better for me.   
 But the best part is that there's another tournament.   
  
  Q.  Is it more frustrating to lose this way than if you feel like you played well and you lost, but to feel like you kind of gave it away a little bit, does it hurt more?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Well, I definitely, when I step on the court, every time I definitely want to execute.  So for me I'm not satisfied when I don't.  Well, certainly not.   
  
  Q.  Venus, she's been struggling a little bit since the Australian Open final.  You guys haven't played in a while.  How does her game compare to a couple of years ago?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think she's playing very well.  She's on top of the game.  She knows what she's doing.   
  
  Q.  Any evolution in it, or is it the same game you saw at Wimbledon two years ago?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think in order to play on this tour you have to get better every year.  So she most certainly is doing that.   
  
  Q.  Venus, did this feel like a third-round match or a semifinal or a final to you?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  The reality is that it's a third round.  So, yes, it felt like a third round.   
  
  Q.  Are you planning an aggressive clay court season?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I'm playing four tournaments before.   
  
  Q.  Before the French?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  No, three.  Three.   
  
  Q.  Charleston?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Charleston, Warsaw, Istanbul.   
  
  Q.  Rome?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.
