THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How much fun was that?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Let's see.   It was fun.   It was, like, I don't even know.   It was fun.   It was like we just got out of Wimbledon, and we are back at it again.   So it felt really good.   
   
 Q.   Venus, you played really well in singles today.   Seemed like the best we've seen you play in a while.   Do you agree with that?   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, today was definitely seemed a lot more like classic Venus.   I know she's in here, but she has a couple things she's dealing with, so she does the best she can.   
And I'm saying that I do the best I can.   
   
 Q.   We had Serena at one end of the grounds, Venus at the other end, you finished 10 minutes apart, Roger Federer in the middle on Centre Court.   Does it ever strike you that you're playing at the same time at such a marquee event?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, the Olympics are so quick, so you have to play your matches.   Everyone is playing every day.   You never know.   
What a good day for fans between me, Venus, Roger, all the other players that are playing.   It's really such a great experience.   
I can tell when Venus is playing because the box isn't totally full, you know, so you always know that if her match is over, you can see people coming in.   
   
 Q.   A number of athletes keep getting in some hot water over what they're saying on Twitter.   Another one just got kicked out of the games today.   Do you have any thoughts on that?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   What did they say?   
   
 Q.   The one from Greece got kicked out a few days ago.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I heard that one.   
   
 Q.   There's another one from Switzerland.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I heard about the Greece one, so I've been really careful about saying things in social media.   I haven't been on my account too much.   
Hopefully I would be devastated if I got kicked out of the Olympics.   
   
 Q.   Do you think if there's a racist tweet, the person should be kicked out of the games?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think this is a tournament, not necessarily a tournament ‑ what's the word ‑ an event that is for all races and all countries and all, you know, looks and likes around the world.   
You know, I think it's honorable if they had to kick someone out because of that, then they realize there's no color bounds, there's no nothing.   This is just pure for sport.   
You know, that's interesting.   It's definitely not a bad thing.   
   
 Q.   Serena, how do you feel you played today?   Looked convincing out there today.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   I think I played okay.   You know, I was excited to be out there, to play solid.   I don't think I played bad.   
Obviously, I have to believe I can play better or else...   
But, you know, for early rounds, I think I'm playing pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Serena, what is the verdict for mixed doubles?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   Oh, uhm, what is the sign‑in set?   
   
 Q.   11 a.m. tomorrow.   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   We'll see 11 a.m. tomorrow.   I'll keep you guys on your toes.  
   
 Q.   Are you planning on playing?  
SERENA WILLIAMS:   We'll see.   
   
 Q.   Venus, can you talk about your game tomorrow, what can you say about Aleksandra Wozniak?   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   We had a competitive match in Miami, my first tournament back.   So hopefully, you know, I'm a little more prepared for my game since I had a chance to play her this year.   
Obviously, she's talented and motivated, wants to do well in this game, so I have to come out there and play well.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts about playing Vera next?   
SERENA WILLIAMS:   You know, a good matchup for us both.   Wimbledon final rematch.   Tough match for me.   She's playing so well, moving well, doing everything great.   So, you know, it's not an easy tournament.   You have to get out there.   Playing someone tough so soon, it's going to be a good challenge for me.   
   
 Q.   Being here this week, having been at Wimbledon, I guess you follow some sort of routines when you're here for the Wimbledon time.   Have you kept to those sort of routines, gone to the same spots for dinner, shopping for groceries, anything like that?   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, we keep the routine of watching a lot of Olympics whenever we have free time.   I've especially gotten into archery, it's amazing.   Maybe get out there for recreation.   But I think that's mostly what we do, is try our best to participate in the games by supporting the rest of the US teams and celebrating everybody's victories.
