V. WILLIAMS/D. Vekic   
2-6, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was another tough one for you today.  How did you turn it around?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think I just started out slow.  That sometimes happens.   
But she also played well.  You could see that she was super determined and wanted to get every ball in, ran for every shot and just forced the issue.  I realized who I was going to be up against today and just tried to dig in deeper.   
 Q.  At what point did you realize you needed a coffee on court today?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know.  It was what it was.   
 Q.  In terms of your fitness training right now, obviously a couple of grueling matches already, what does that look like for you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, I guess I'll see tomorrow if I get to be playing at 1:00.  I feel like I'm putting out more effort than anybody in this draw right now.  So maybe I'll get lucky and get to play, like, third match or something.   
 Q.  But in terms of your ratio of on-court to off-court, what is that ratio like?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Probably like 50/50.   
 Q.  At this point in the tournament, is it physical recovery or mental recovery that's almost more important?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I'm pretty pumped.  When you're winning, it's fun.  When you're losing, it sucks.  I'm happy to be winning (smiling).  Trying to prevent the losses.   
 Q.  Two days ago you said that one of your goals was to not be as hog wild on court.  How are you with that today, do you think?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know.  What did you think?   
 Q.  I think you were pretty controlled.  The ground game looked pretty good.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I tried.  It's not easy out there.   
 Q.  You have had a lot of tough matches against Simona in the past.  If it's her, how will you prepare for that match?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Get some rest, put the ball in the court, aces, that sort of thing.  We'll see what happens.   
 Q.  Is there a particular Venus Williams unwinding routine that you have at this point, or is it just kind of...  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, just chill with the dog and, you know, it's nothing too specific.  You just keep going and get ready the next day.  Quick turnarounds now in the tournament, back to back to back.  Every player is going to be facing the quick turnarounds now.   
 Q.  As a growing vlogger, I'm curious if there is anything this week in Cincinnati from an aesthetic or filmmaker's point of view that's caught your eye?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I saw laser tag when I was getting off the highway.  Fun.  Maybe I'll get there.  Some cross-training.   
 Q.  What was it like to have Serena in the crowd today?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Super fun.  I mean, she's obviously taking time away from her baby girl to come see me.   
 Q.  She seemed to be very into it.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, she's more than into it, more than into it (smiling).  It's great to have that support.  Obviously the support of my other sister here, too, Isha.  I am never alone, that's for sure.   
 Q.  Who do you think gets more nervous watching who?  Do you get more nervous watching her or vice versa?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Honestly, she seemed pretty calm and chill.  I think she believed in me.  She was rooting hard but didn't seem panicked at all after I lost the first set.  Maybe didn't play the best games at first the beginning of the first and second.  I thought if she can be chill, I can be chill.  Yeah.
