 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. This was your first match in Mason. What did you think of it, and can you assess your performance and your win?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, today I played against a really strong player. She strikes the ball well, serves well, does everything so well.   
 You know, it was good to get a win. I thought I played really consistently and served really well. Technically I was happy with my game, so I actually feel happy.  
  
  Q. You and Serena won the doubles match at the Bank of the West Classic. Do you and Serena plan on playing doubles at the US Open?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Well, we've been talking about it, so it looks pretty good. I think it's gonna happen. We're excited.   
  
  Q. Me too.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes.   
  
  Q. Talk about the delay tonight. You didn't start until about 94 minutes after you were supposed to. Did have that any affect on you?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No, it didn't. No, not really. I'm used to waiting. That's tennis. You don't know exactly when you're going on. I don't know, sometimes I think waiting actually helps me. I get even more clear when I wait.   
  
  Q. You're currently ranked No. 3 in the world. Do you see yourself in the near future pulling for the No. 1 spot again?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I just have to keep playing consistently. You know, that's what it takes to be No. 1, so I'm gonna try to do that.   
  
  Q. The crowd seemed very much behind you today. Did you notice that?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes, and I could tell that was gonna happen, because as soon as I got here, you know, there was so much support just from practice, and it's the evening and everyone is still here.   
 Even online, everyone is like, Can't wait to see in Cincinnati. It's really nice. I love it.  
  
  Q. Have you been mobbed for autographs and that kind of thing?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, but that's -- I'm here for the fans obviously to entertain and try to win and to sign some autographs.  
  
  Q. Did you bring Harold with you in Cincinnati?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yes, Harold is here. He's really happy. We're having a great time, so it's good.  
  
  Q. Does Serena come to your matches normally and do you go to hers?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: When we can. Tonight she has to play tomorrow, so it's impossible. We always try to support each other whenever we can. I enjoy that, and I think she does.  
  
  Q. Is your mom here?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No. Maybe next year.  
  
  Q. Did you notice the scoreboard proposal in the middle of your match?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I did. I tried to look and see them, but I realized -- I was happy for them, but I had to stay focused.
