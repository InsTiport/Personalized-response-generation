WTA:  Questions for Venus. 
 
 
Q.  What happened in the first set and how would you describe your game in general today?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I was playing good in the first set.  I just think Serena played a lot better.  When that happens, there's absolutely nothing I can do, except just lose the first set. 
 
Q.  Your game in general?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I think I played good today.  I don't think neither of us served nearly as well as we can.  That played a large factor also.  I think we definitely served our second serves much better, too.  That's a plus.  
 
Q.  What happened with the serves, to many apple pies at McDonald's?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, it's addictive.  
 
Q.  What's addictive, McDonald's?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, pies. 
 
Q.  Did you learn any other German words when you were here?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No. 
 
Q.  Did you enjoy playing in front of the German crowd?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I like playing in Germany.  There's a lot of tournaments in Germany.  We're always here all year-round, always coming back. 
 
Q.  Do you think this match you played better than you did against Hingis or not the same level?  Hingis seemed more electrifying a match than today. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  She's a different player.  Serena is a different player than what Martina is.  Serena in general is much stronger, runs a little better, hits a lot more power on her shots, has a bigger serve.  She's a different player.  
 
Q.  You laughed after the match, but how is it looking inside you?  Does it hurt or just like normal?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  It's unfortunate that I lost.  But, you know, there will be another chance where I can win, another chance where she can win. 
 
Q.  What are you talking about after the match with your sister?  Anything about the match?  Is this a secret thing?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  Maybe you should ask her.  
 
Q.  Are you sharing the prize money?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  She worked hard for her prize money, and I worked hard for what I have, too.  I'll get my share; she'll get her share. 
 
Q.  What's your mom saying sitting beside and watching you?  Do you think it's hard for your mom to watch you playing?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No. 
 
Q.  One of her daughters is going to lose. 
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  
 
Q.  It's a professional attitude?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah.  It's a win-win situation.  One daughter is going to win.  What's the difference?  
 
Q.  Your tournament record is 3-1 now against Serena, is that right?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q.  When you were practicing with her and playing with her, do you usually win?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  We never play sets.  We just practice.  There's just a tournament record. 
 
Q.  The three times you beat her, did you do anything differently in those matches than you did today?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Neither of us were playing our best tennis in that match.  This is one of the matches we played much better, I would say.  We both were just playing bad the other matches.  I just happened to make one or two more shots than what she did.  
 
Q.  So this was the best match of the four you've played, even though you lost?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I think so. 
 
Q.  And why?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  We were both playing better, both feeling good.  She won a Grand Slam playing nicely.  I've improved my game this week.  We're both playing good.  
 
Q.  Are you worried about her perhaps pulling ahead of you?  She won the US Open.  Does that bother you, your younger sister getting ahead of you?
 
VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  All my results are the results I worked for.  The results she has are the ones she worked for.  We both have good results.  There's always the future.  We'll always be able to take something else for ourselves.
