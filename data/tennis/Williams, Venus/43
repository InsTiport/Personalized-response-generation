THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts about the Miami Open changing venues next year to the Hard Rock Stadium, and what does this stadium mean to you, having won three titles in Key Biscayne?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I have had a lot of beautiful memories here.  The organizers have loved tennis and the new organizers adore tennis, so it's all good.   
 Q.  Just a follow-up to that, with that new venue, what is something you look forward to specifically?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Honestly, I don't know.  Everything (smiling).  Hopefully winning there.   
 Q.  Is it maybe updated facilities, something of that nature?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, as a player, we just want to play the big titles and win them.  That's pretty much it.   
 Q.  You're 37, ranked 8th.  What does that say that you and your sister, Serena, and even on the men's side, Roger, can still play such a high level?  What's that say about longevity in the sport?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't think it's anything we think about.  We just play.  It's really just that.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy the challenge of facing this new generation of players?  What is it about it that still gets you motivated?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I don't think about that.  Nobody does.  People just want to win their match no matter who they play.  That's pretty much it (smiling).   
 Q.  (Question about her sister.)  
VENUS WILLIAMS: It's great.  Always knew she was coming back, so just more like a matter of time.   
 Q.  Given that you live in Florida, specifically about 30 miles from Parkland, I want to know your views about the unfortunate gun shooting and about the march on Saturday to end gun violence.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Of course all the violence saddens me, and the whole violence in the world is heartbreaking.  It's all heartbreaking.
