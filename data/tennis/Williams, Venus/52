THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What exactly went wrong today?  Didn't quite go to plan.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think she played well.  I don't think I played a bad match.  She just played above and beyond.  I just have to give her credit for that.   
 Q.  Do you think maybe you had too many unforced errors?  It was like 28 to 12.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I haven't seen the stats yet.  But like I said, you know, I didn't play so bad, I wasn't missing every shot.  Just didn't work out.   
 Q.  What were some of the things she did better today than the prior four matches?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't remember the last time I played her.   
 Q.  The Open.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, that was years ago.   
 Q.  How was the off-season in terms of your training?  Did you arrive in Australia feeling you were ready?  Did you feel like something was still not competition level?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I mean, I had two tough draws.  You have to get started immediately.  Just not the best luck in terms of, you know, a quick start.  The rest of the year to go.   
 Q.  Disappointed considering last year's finish here?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Last year is last year.  This is, like, a new year.  You can't live in the previous year.  It's impossible.   
 Q.  Were you impacted by the delay at all?  You lost six straight points after the delay.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: No.  She played really well.  I think she started out with an ace, another winner.  There was nothing I could do there.  She just played amazing.   
 Q.  Do you have an idea what your immediate schedule is, what next event you'll go to?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, not yet.   
 Q.  In the media in the United States, in Vogue, it was pointed out and discussed the incredible ordeal that your sister went through after giving birth.  Could you reflect on that, her guts, pulling through, what your thoughts were when that happened.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Serena is definitely a tough individual.   
 Q.  She says when you're having a tough match, it's hard for her because she sees a certain sadness in your face, breaks her heart.  Do you feel that way when she's going through a tough spell?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Of course, I always want to see her win.
