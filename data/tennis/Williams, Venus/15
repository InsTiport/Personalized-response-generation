6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Nobody likes to lose at a Grand Slam tournament, but is it of any consolation to you that you may have lost this evening to a future multiple champion like yourself?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I never thought of that.   
 Q.  When was the last time you played a player of that age being able to play that well, a 15-year-old?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she played so well.  Even all the shank balls went in.  I actually didn't play well.  It was a contrast of both sides.   
 Q.  When were you first sort of aware of her?  What is it like playing someone who grew up idolizing you, who played the game because of you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not really sure about the whole awareness thing.  I'm really happy to see her playing great.   
 Q.  Did you say anything to her after the match?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, just, Well done and good luck, you know.   
 Q.  For some of us, you winning here 19 years ago was the beginning of 21st century women's tennis.  Now you're closer to the end than the beginning.  Do you have any thoughts about Wimbledon, what it's meant to you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I've had amazing times here.  I love it.   
 Q.  What is your prime memory from when you were a teen emerging first on the big stage in Oakland?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: It was very exciting.  It was awesome to do the work and then be able to play.  So it was a great time.   
 Q.  What do you think of her future?  Could she go to the very top?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think the sky's the limit, it really is.   
 Q.  The history of tennis is littered with teenage players who do very well early on but never fulfill that promise.  If you would give one bit of advice to Cori in order to fulfill her potential, what would it be?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Just have fun.  Enjoy life.  That's all you can do.   
 Q.  Serena said Cori reminded her of you, both physically and the way she plays.  Do you sense that as well?  What are her strengths?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she did everything well today.  She put the ball in the court, which was much better than I did.  She served well, moved well.  It was a great match for her.   
 Q.  What is your schedule targets?  What are you going to be doing for the next foreseeable future?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'll be looking forward to the US Open Series.   
 Q.  Any other plans?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: That's about it.   
 Q.  Will you be back playing here next year?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: That's the plan.
