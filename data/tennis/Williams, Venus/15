A. BARTY/V. Williams
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you feel like you had your opportunities there and it was a bit frustrating for you?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, in the first set I definitely had some opportunities there, and once it got close, she really raised the level of her game and didn't do much wrong after that.  She played a smart match.
Q. Obviously today didn't go the way you wanted it.  Your time in Birmingham, have you enjoyed the whole experience?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Absolutely.  I have had a blast.  The only thing that would have made it better was obviously getting a win today.
Q. I believe recently you've followed a vegan diet because of health reasons.  (Indiscernible.)
VENUS WILLIAMS: No, I cheat all the time, so...
Q. You have a few off days?
VENUS WILLIAMS: A lot of off days.
Q. Is there anything you feel like you really miss or do you not cut anything out?
VENUS WILLIAMS: No nuts.
Q. Are there any tracks of music you listen to before you go out to pump yourself up?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Not actually, no.
Q. There has been a lot of talk in the press room today that Andy Murray is looking for a partner in mixed doubles.  Is that something that you would consider?
VENUS WILLIAMS: He hasn't asked me yet.
Q. If he asked you, would you?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't know if he has my number (smiling).
Q. We can arrange something.  Is that something...
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not sure how much Serena's going to want me to play with other people all the time.  It might cause a strain on our relationship (smiling).
Q. It's not the result you wanted today but it is what it is.  Will you look back at this as a plus taking it forward going to Wimbledon?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, I got to play some matches here and got some, you know, rhythm and did exactly what I wanted really.  So I'm pretty pleased.
Q. Will you go straight to Wimbledon or go home first?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I don't have exact plans yet, so I'll figure that out.
Q. Are you looking forward to seeing your sister?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah.
Q. Is it hard to be on the road without Serena?
VENUS WILLIAMS: We're adults, you know.  We can handle it.
Q. Fitness-wise, how is the fitness heading into Wimbledon?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think this is the best I have been all year, so I can't complain too much.
Q. (Question about the main draw.)
VENUS WILLIAMS: As long as you have the ranking to enter, you can be there as much as you want to be.  That's really what it boils down to.
Q. Your thoughts on Barty?  She can go to World No. 1 Sunday.  How do you think her game is shaping up with the grass and possibly being World No. 1?
VENUS WILLIAMS: She's looking good.  Why not?
Q. What was it about her game that impressed you today?
VENUS WILLIAMS: She just put all the balls in.  You have to do that in tennis.  If you don't, then you'll be out, so I have learned.
