THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How are you feeling?  Is it your knee?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, I think she played really well.  Just give her credit for a great performance.   
 Q.  How does playing two days, two matches, the weather, affect your routines on a daily basis?  Are you trying to rest more in between games or watching what you eat in a different way?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it doesn't really happen that often, so there's no, you know, plan in particular.   
 Q.  It seemed like you were trying to fight in the second set.  Did it come down to energy?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think she just played a lot better than I did.   
 Q.  Last time you were here in the press conference (indiscernible) supporting Serena and she was talking about it openly.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: About what?   
 Q.  Serena, when she posted on Instagram about she's been struggling, the reasons why she didn't come here.  A lot of girls have been talking about it.  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm always supportive of my sister.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on Rogers Cup this year?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Oh, I love the tournament.  It's beautiful.  I love Montreal.
