V. WILLIAMS/M. Brengle
  6‑0, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Short day of work today.   You had to have been pretty happy.   Everything clicking right now?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   You know, she's had like a great last 52 weeks.   She's had really great results in the majors.   Definitely playing a higher‑ranked player in the first round is a challenge.   But thankfully everything worked for me. 
I don't think she played badly.   I was just able to convert on the important points. 

Q.   Coming back to Wimbledon once again, do you feel this is the best chance you have to go deep at a major tournament?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   No, I don't really feel like that, no.   I mean, I feel like I have a chance everywhere I play.

Q.   But not better here?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   No, not necessarily.   I just have played better.   But it's not really a psychological state. 

Q.   Have you allowed yourself to look forward at all?   You must know that your sister could possibly be a meeting with her in the fourth round.   How special would that be for you?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, it would be great if I can continue to play well and get there, play next week.   That would be great. 

Q.   Must be 18 years or so since you made your debut here.   Back then, did you actually think you'd still be competing at this level nearly two decades later?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I don't think I thought much at all back then, so... 
I had no idea what I was thinking.   That's the truth. 

Q.   Just on a wider level, there was a time when teenagers were coming through and dominating.   Today you had a love and love.   Tommy Haas, oldest guy in the draw, come through to second round.   Is there a change?   Why do you think there might be a change that older players are lasting longer at the top level?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I don't necessarily have an opinion about everyone else.   I just know that I give 100% every day.   I think that tennis players have the ability to play a longer time than they have in the past, and people are capitalizing on it. 
It's a great job.   It's fun out here.   You can only do it for a little while in comparison to how long you won't be doing it.   So that's my whole thing.

Q.   Serena was saying she actually doesn't like grass.   She's good on it, but she doesn't feel entirely comfortable.   It was surprising to hear.   I was thinking about you.   Is this just a surface you step on and feel comfortable on immediately, love it, or did it take time?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I would still say my favorite surface is a hard court just because the bounce is truer and because I grew up on it. 
So while I think we've both had awesome results on grass, we both probably prefer the hard courts.   It's not saying I don't like grass.

Q.   Do you remember your first‑ever match on grass?   The only time you got a double bagel. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Did I lose? 

Q.   No, you won.   It was in Eastbourne qualifying in '97.   Do you remember what it was like coming over here?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I don't remember that match, no.   I'm sure I enjoyed it. 

Q.   We tend to see a lot of your minions, players wearing your kit.   How do you like to get them fitted into your stuff?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   What minions? 

Q.   Just players who are wearing EleVen. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   We try to pick players who represent being EleVen, have a good attitude, giving your best, positivity is super important. 

Q.   Do you remember being at the Wimbledon ball in 2000 when Pete Sampras had won as well?   I don't know if you guys got to share any moments together, memories of Pete. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   No.   I think he showed up in sweat pants, if I remember.   I don't remember which year that happened.   I think he got there late.   He was probably on his seventh Wimbledon, so it was probably old hat.   By then he probably had enough of the balls. 
When it's your first time, it means a little bit more. 

Q.   As you watch your sister go through this year that's been very special already for her, certainly looking ahead with the possibility of making history, do you share any advice with her?   What does her journey mean to you?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I don't think she necessarily needs any advice from me or probably anyone.   She should be giving out the advice. 
I think we just all try to keep her encouraged.   I think we're all amazed at what she's done really. 

Q.   How would you assess her possibility of achieving this?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Are we talking about a Grand Slam now? 

Q.   Yes. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   I mean, obviously I think it's a pretty good chance.   Hasn't been done that often.   But then again, she's done a lot of things that haven't been done that often. 

Q.   Has Serena surprised you with the last few years?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   No, 'cause I always want her to win.   So for me, it's like magic when she wins, no matter what the circumstances. 

Q.   You guys are back in doubles here.   Haven't played that much lately.   What are you looking forward to doing out there?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   We're looking forward to Rio 2016.   We're trying to get a early start on preparing, start playing some doubles matches, get the hang of it.

Q.   Do you think you're going to play a heavier doubles schedule the next 12 months gearing up for that?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   We're not quite sure, but we're going to try to play, that's for sure. 

Q.   It's forecast to be over 90 degrees later this week.   How strange is that, especially here in London? 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   We'll see how it affects the conditions of the courts.   I've never really played at the Championships when it was really warm.   We'll see how the courts play.
