   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  How did you assess your opening match?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I felt good out there.  Had a lot of fun.  Got to hit a lot of balls, which I felt was good.  I think she challenged me on a lot of points.  She really stayed in there and played a lot of shots, definitely made me play some balls that I wasn't expecting to come back.   
 It was definitely challenging.   
  
  Q.  Plenty of room for improvement as the tournament goes on?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I'm always looking to improve throughout my whole career, so...  I'm looking to get better every time, every tournament I play.   
  
  Q.  There were some errors in the game.  To be expected?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I mean, errors happen.  That's tennis.   
  
  Q.  You walked out there with your own line of clothing.  How satisfying is that to walk out with clothes you designed yourself?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I was a design student.  I'm now a graduate.  It's my field of choice besides tennis, so I'm very proud.  There's a lot of great things coming out with EleVen soon.   
  
  Q.  What about your jewelry, is that your design as well?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  Maybe I'll wear EleVen jewelry the next match.  I didn't have any on tonight.   
  
  Q.  That's not an engagement ring on your finger?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I've been wearing this ring for like four years.   
  
  Q.  You missed the tournament last year.  This is one you haven't won.  Serena did well last year.  Do you come in here with your sights set for some unfinished business?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I felt wonderful about Serena's win yesterday.  I watched every match, so I definitely feel like I was part of The Open last year.  I'm definitely physically here this year so I'm looking to definitely improve on my results.  I've come close to winning.  I'd like to try again.   
  
  Q.  Serena mentioned you were playing really well during practice.  Do you feel like you are, that you're coming into this in really good form?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I felt like I was hitting really well in practice leading up.  I felt she was hitting really well, too.  We always challenge each other.  It's definitely great to be able to hit against Serena Williams.   
  
  Q.  The thing in Madrid that kept you out, what exactly was that?  How are you feeling now?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I never talked much about that, and I still don't.  It's the past now.   
  
  Q.  You're a hundred percent physically?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  I'm definitely doing my best for me, so it's good.   
  
  Q.  We always hear wonderful words by Serena to you and you to Serena.  When you are both in the house, what do you say terrible to Serena that she becomes angry?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  No, we don't fight.   
  
  Q.  Never?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.   
  
  Q.  For nothing?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Huh-uh.   
  
  Q.  C'mon.   
 VENUS WILLIAMS:  Huh-uh.
