P. KVITOVA/V. Williams
  6‑2, 2‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about that third set, kind of a tough one.   You had three opportunities to be 5‑1.   How did it kind of get away?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I think that, you know, obviously I put myself in a great position to end the match, which for me is, you know, the positive that I take out of this match, which is, you know, I put myself in a better position than like the last time we played when I had chances to go up.   So this time I did and I didn't take them. 
You know, she played well.   I have to give her credit for that.   I think I just started to rush a little too much, and I wanted maybe too much of a big shot instead of just kind of working the point and getting the win.
So I think sometimes I approached it with the wrong mentality.   I think I pulled it together, but, you know, she played some great shots.

Q.   It's been a while since you have come to play in the Middle East.   I just wanted to know what was your thought behind coming here and Dubai, also.   You haven't been there since you won it.   Just talk about that, please. 
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I basically had a lot of bad health and injuries and I wasn't able to come.   It wasn't lack of not wanting to be here.   It was just physically not being able to.

Q.   Do you feel fit now, Venus?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, I'm doing the best I can and I work at my game.
I wasn't able to win the match today, unfortunately, but I'm getting better really every tournament that I play.   I realize that I have to pay my dues.   You know, I have to keep getting in these positions.   I haven't played as much as my opponents, so I have to stay out there and kind of get comfortable in those positions and just kind of go at it with the right mentality. 
Today I didn't necessarily go after it the way I should have, but as long as I keep getting in the right positions, I'll convert.

Q.   If you keep getting in the right positions and get the luck that you need with health and other things, what can you still do?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Well, I think this sky's the limit for anyone.   That's the thing.
In life, you have to believe in yourself.   You can't go out thinking someone else is going to believe in you and they're going to do it for you.   For me, I have to fight my own battles.   There is going to be a lot of people who are supportive, but at the end of the day I have to get up and walk on my own.
That's pretty much what I'm doing, and I realize that in the process, you know, there may be some matches that I'm going to want to win that I'm not going to, like today, but I feel positive in general about how I'm progressing. 
You know, I'm in a position that I didn't do anything wrong to be here.   It's just something that happens in life.   I've got to make the best out of it.

Q.   Do you still enjoy it, or are you doing it for other reasons?
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah.   You know, I'm doing it because I love to be in the paper (smiling). 
No, I play tennis because I feel like I'm good at it.   I know I'm good at it.   I have to keep giving myself a chance and just keep going forward.
