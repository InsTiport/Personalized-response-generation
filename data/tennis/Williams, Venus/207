 A. KERBER/V. Williams
  7‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What happened in that first‑set tiebreak?   You seemed to be in command of that tiebreak.   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I mean, I made a few errors, then she hit a few winners.   Things can go quickly in tennis if you don't hold on to it.   
Of course, I was disappointed to lose the first.   Tried hard in the second.   She had a lot of answers.   I mean, she's having a great year.   Have to give her credit for playing well.   
   
 Q.   She has been hitting the ball well this season.   You started to come back.   Was that any bearing in the match today?   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, you know, I think it helps to be able to play more matches, for sure.   I just haven't played that many.   She's definitely played a lot of matches.   
I think I was still getting used to her game.   I haven't really played her a lot.   Being left‑handed, hitting a lot of flat balls, it's a little tricky.   Had a hard time finding a rhythm.   
Now that I've played her, I know a lot about her.   
   
 Q.   What about the braids in your hair?   It's like when you and Serena were young with the beads.   
VENUS WILLIAMS:   This is most certainly the new millennium.   It's fun to do something different.   It's boring to have the same hair every week, so I change it up a lot.   
   
 Q.   What about teaming up with Serena for the doubles, how are you feeling?  
VENUS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, definitely go and prepare and get ready for the doubles, bring my best game to that.
