 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. It seems this season you go slowly but surely. You get much more powerful, precise. Is the Olympic Games your major goal for this year?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, Olympics, I love it here. I love playing with all the athletes. I love the atmosphere. I think the most important part is it's only every four years, so now is the time to really play well.   
 I think I'm coming closer. Quarterfinals now. So it's coming closer every round. It's my dream.   
  
  Q. It was you and a hundred of your closest friends and family out there today. When is the last time you played in front of that few people or had this few media here? Was it hard to create your own momentum and energy tonight?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No. I felt like a lot of Americans were there. It felt really good. I like it that today is a little slow in the press so I can go see Serena play. I'm ready to go support her now.   
 I'm okay with everything.   
  
  Q. As you progress now, being in the quarterfinals, do memories of Sydney start coming back to you at all?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I'll always have the gold in Sydney, so that's obviously a precious memory. But definitely closer is Wimbledon. That's definitely what's in my mind at this moment, just my performance there and what it took to win there, really trying to apply that here.   
 So I definitely take that on the court with me.   
  
  Q. Since you had singles and doubles in a row, is there any effect on your physical condition? Could you comment on your opponent, Li Na?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm really fit. The conditions are good for me. I work hard and I try to play smart. Yeah, I'm very excited about playing Li. I'll keep focused and playing well.   
  
  Q. Can you put in perspective what the gold medal means in comparison to Wimbledon or the US Open?   
 VENUS WILLIAMS: For me it's the same. I mean, to win here singles and/or doubles is the same because it's a gold medal competition. Maybe even more precious. So I think it's right up there for me.   
  
  Q. You have been to Beijing twice. Is there anything that has inspired you on designing clothes or other art forms?  
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I definitely love the architecture here. I think for me it's also inspiring the Chinese characters in the writing. I like the movement. For me it's really inspiring.   
 So I also love dragons. There's so many great Chinese dragons here. So there's a lot I love about the Chinese designs.
