S. HALEP/V. Williams
6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously tough playing against the world No. 1 any time.  How much can you see that match as a measuring stick of where you measure up against a top player?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think she played pretty flawless today.  Only 12 errors.  Unfortunately, I had almost three times as many.  Just needed to keep my errors down.  But she played a great match.
Q. Is it disappointing not to be going ahead to play Serena?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I would just say in general losing is not fun, no matter who you're trying to play next.  So it has nothing to do with the next round or who you're playing.
Q. What were you trying to do to throw her off her flawlessness today?  Can you do anything to interrupt that when she's playing well?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think she hit her first serve really well.  I don't see her go for her first serve very often.  She hit the second serve really well.
I think I just could have played breakpoints a little better.  I was definitely very competitive on every game, but just a few too many errors.  It was still a really good match.
Q. Are you planning on playing anywhere between here and Indian Wells?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not entered in anything.  If I played anything, I would need a wild card.
Q. Fed Cup?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I think that would be fun.
Q. Does that mean 'yes' for Fed Cup?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I'd have to be asked on the team, so...
Q. Have you talked to Kathy?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Hopefully they would have me.
Q. Have you talked to Kathy yet?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Not yet.
Q. Serena is familiar with Simona, as well.  Is this something you would talk to her about, considering she gets her in two days?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'll definitely I guess talk to her.  I don't know if Serena needs my help or not.  If she does, I'll be there.
