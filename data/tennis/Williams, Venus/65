6-3, 2-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Thoughts on that match?  She's had a pretty good year, is back in form.  What did you think of her game and what made it tough for you today?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she just played really well.  She found openings in the court, was super consistent, and she just played really well.  I just have to give her credit.   
 Q.  How did you feel out there today?  Did the heat affect you?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: It was definitely warm, but, you know, we both played under the same conditions.   
 Q.  Thoughts on your form and preparation leading to New York?  Don't have any more matches before the Open?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, that's good.  I'm going to take a break.  Just have a rest and just go big.  That's my plan.   
 Q.  Going back home to Florida for now?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think so.   
 Q.  How much does Sjogren's syndrome affect you on a daily basis?  Do you feel that when you're out there playing -- I mean, did it affect you today?  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I never really talk about that.  That's my thing to deal with (smiling).   
 Q.  Overall you have had a great year, especially in the Grand Slams.  What are your thoughts, expectations, heading to your home slam and the 20th anniversary of...  
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, these courts, Toronto, Cincinnati, are playing super slow.  I don't know how the US Open is going to play.  The court definitely feels a lot smaller with the speed of the court, so I'll see how that goes.  It definitely dictates strategy.  I mean, I'm just planning on being super-aggressive.
