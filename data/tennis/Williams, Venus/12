C. SUAREZ NAVARRO/V. Williams
6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You faced Bianca Andreescu earlier this year, losing to her in Auckland.  Do you mind kind of telling me what you make of her game and what her potential is?
VENUS WILLIAMS: We had a great match.  It was a long time ago and I don't remember that much, but I remember she played amazing.
And she's already won a big tournament, so a lot ahead of her.
Q. Can you talk about the match tonight, it's Genie Bouchard and Bianca going head to head.  In Canada, that's a big deal.  Can you just talk about those two players and what you would expect from a match like that?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I'm sure it's not easy to play each other in the first round being from the same country and playing at home.  So it should be a competitive match.  I mean, Genie has been to the finals of Wimbledon, so she has the experience.
And I can't really say I think much about other matches.  So if you have any questions about me or my match, then let me know now, or else I'll exit stage right.
Q. So tough match today.  Carla is always a tough opponent for you.  What do you think was the biggest difference for you in this match?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she was just extra sharp.  And I played a lot of great points but just didn't put enough in a row.  You know, play two great points and then some points not as well.  And she just really played sharp off every shot.
And, yeah, so she just played well.
Q. So at this stage of the season, you're leading into the US Open and I'm assuming you're playing Cincinnati as well.  So what is the mindset going into the US Open?  Because I know the season might not have been as great as you wanted it to be, but there's still a ways to go.  What is your mindset going into this final part of the season?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Play well.  That sums it up.
