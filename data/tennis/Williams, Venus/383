THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Were you happy with your game?  You didn't seem too happy out there?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I definitely imagined that the score line would be definitely not three sets.  I had a lot of errors out there, but I was pretty much able to pull it together a lot better in the third set.


Q.  Was the wind a factor in the game?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  A little bit, but it's just really important not to think about the wind.  Just really move your feet and get in position. But I think especially on my serve, it wasn't as effective.  It's a lot more windy, I think, on grandstand than on stadium.  I've been a bit sheltered in the last couple matches.


Q.  Did the late start have any effect on you at all?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  No.  I started out 3-Love, but I think that to go up 4-Love I had just a weak game, just a couple of weak games there, and let her get into the match.


Q.  Your sister's match is still ongoing.  You possibly may be playing each other.  Is there anything you can show her that's not expected?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Probably not (smiling).


Q.  Will you watch the rest of her match?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I got to do my cool-down.  By that time, I probably would have missed it.


Q.  Scouting's not really necessary?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  (Laughing) Not necessarily, no.  More than anything, I just want to go out there and play my game, just like I usually do every time.


Q.  It's been quite a while, Wimbledon 2003.  At this point in your career, you never look forward to these matches, but at this point how do you feel about playing her?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I dare to differ.  It's not that I never looked -- we always looked forward to the matches.  Serena and I always had the kind of attitude, we didn't really care who we played as long as we were playing, and that included against both of us. I guess the only setback with playing with each other is that only one of us can win, and we both want each other to do so well that that's the only sad part, I think.


Q.  Also, it's unusual it's not a final; it's a quarterfinal.  Does that take a little bit away from it?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, because we always do so well at this event.  I mean, we had that final appearance in '99.  That was a whole lot of fun.  So definitely not the round I guess we'd like to meet in, but in the end it is what it is.


Q.  Little Sister has had the edge.  Is it time for Big Sister to have a payback?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I definitely, you know, want to go out there and win the match, sure.


Q.  How much are you practicing with each other these days?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  The last couple weeks we've been hitting with each other.  You know, the Australian and stuff like that.


Q.  Because your match was tonight and Serena is still playing, going to be done late, you have to play again tomorrow, it's almost like you're sneaking this one in.  There won't be a lot of hype leading up to it.  Is that something that you like, just to go ahead and let the tennis, you know...

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  I mean, it's not like I read the papers.  I turn the TV on mute.  I'm tired of the "he said, she said."  I've been over it for years now, so...


Q.  At this point is it kind of blase in your mind?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Oh, no, not at all.  Not at all.  This is a match, and I take every single match seriously.  It's my career.  I'm going to do the best I can no matter who I'm playing.


Q.  Most of the competition is between 17- and 18-year-olds, with seniors like yourself and your sister.  Do you think it's adrenaline or just that the competition has gotten better?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I guess the competition's getting better, you know.


Q.  I saw your dad sitting out there watching you during the match.  What does he do during those times when you guys do play in tournaments?  Is he there?  Is he home?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Usually he's not there.  I think he went to maybe one, yeah.  But usually he's not.  He just feels like, "My job's done now.  Whatever happens, happens."


Q.  Your mom has been traveling with you mostly.  Is it because you're near home, is that why dad's here?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  It kind of just falls into shifts pretty much.  So my dad would be with us through Charleston and then probably my mom will be with us through the French.  It's kind of been that way for years and years and years now.


Q.  What do you make of Catalina Castano?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  She's very good.  Seemed like she played at the level that I was playing.  When I played bad, she played better; when I played good, she didn't play as well. So I think she definitely tries to take her opportunities, and that's definitely a sign of a good player.


Q.  Do you think Serena is the best player on the women's tour right now?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  When I'm out here, I couldn't possibly say that someone else is better than me when I'm competing also so...


Q.  You guys obviously are in the limelight a lot.  Are you looking forward to this reality TV show that you are going to be doing?

VENUS WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- I don't know what to say right now about that.


Q.  I think you've had enough reality.

VENUS WILLIAMS:  Yeah, I prefer not to talk about it right now.
