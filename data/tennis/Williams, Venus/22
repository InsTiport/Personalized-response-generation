A. KERBER/V. Williams
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It looked like it was one of those matches where you were doing the best you could with what you had tonight?  What do you think was the difference?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I did the best I could.
Q. In terms of her ability to adjust to what you were doing, did you kind of sense anything there?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, she's won a lot of matches.  She knows how to survive.
Q. Just the run and the success in Indian Wells, what does it mean for you, going forward to Miami?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, I played the best I could here.  So I've got to get focused on the next event.
Q. Are you concerned at all in terms of recovery for the next tournament?
VENUS WILLIAMS: It's all too soon.
Q. You have had a wonderfully successful athletic career, you have a college degree, you have a design business, a large, loving family, lovely home.  You have so many things nobody could ever dream of, yet the other night you said you had no life.  How do you figure?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I said what I said.
Q. In Miami of course they are going to have a new venue.  What will you miss most about Key Biscayne?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I grew up watching the matches there as a kid, went there as a kid and played there as a kid.
But I welcome new experiences, as well.
Q. Considering your connection to the Dolphins, what do you think it will be like playing in an NFL stadium?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I haven't even seen the facility, so I have no idea.
Q. When you play on new courts for the first time, does that affect your practice?  How do you get to know the new space?
VENUS WILLIAMS: If the court is challenging to play on, yeah.  But I think at this level everybody adjusts pretty quickly.
