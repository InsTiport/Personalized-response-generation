   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How is your health heading into the tournament?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, going into the tournament I didn't have, you know, the ideal preparation but, um, kind of just had to mentally be ready to play without having played any matches.
 So, you know, gotten to hit balls in the court and get ready, and looking forward to next week.

 Q. Without Serena in the draw, who I imagine a lot of people have regarded as the favorite if she'd have been here, do you feel this is one of the more open US Opens you've been a part of?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, I guess as a player I don't really think of it that way. I'm just trying to win whoever I play against. It really is as simple as that.

 Q. What were your thoughts when you realized the extent of Serena's injury?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: That, you know, it just gets better soon. 

 Q. What have been your observations of her injury and her recovery process?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I'm not here to talk about her injury. You have to talk to her about that. You're not going to get in with me. Sorry, guys. 

 Q. You said you didn't have the ideal preparation, but what have you been doing to prepare the last couple of weeks?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Just trying to stay in the gym and stay strong that way. Really everything I could do in the gym.

 Q. Is the knee allowing you to move better than it did a few weeks ago?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, absolutely. I can definitely move a lot better now, so it's taking a turn for the better.

 Q. What were your thoughts, if you've seen the Roger Federer video that seems to be a rage on the Internet where he knocks an object twice off somebody's head with a serve?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I never heard of it. It sounds amazing. I don't know. (Laughter.)

 Q. John McEnroe made some comments the other day that basically that women were playing too much for their own good and that's why they're having so many injuries. Do you have any thoughts on that?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No. Actually, I don't. 

 Q. Any thoughts on the season or... 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, if we're talking about the season, I feel like our season is good. You know, we do have two months off and our tournaments are -- the bigger tournaments are, you know, I think planned a lot better than what they were. People do want to play the bigger events. That's good for the players and the fans and the tournaments.
 So when injuries happen or if you don't plan your schedule in a way that's conducive to being healthy, I mean, of course it's bad luck too if you get injured, so...
 But as far as his comments, I don't have any comment on that. 

 Q. Would you consider finding another doubles partner to compete with this year?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No. I mean, this would have been a perfect opportunity to play mixed. I really want to, but I just need to play one event right now.

 Q. Could you quantify what percentage of your full fitness that you feel you're in at the moment? 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't get into quantifying. I really focus on that moment that I've got to compare, Oh, I'm at this level than I was before.
 Because really it's really about being in the moment and playing that point and regardless of if you're where you want to be or not exactly, finding a way to win. 
 So that's pretty much where I'm focused on. It's kind of a more mature outlook, in a way.

 Q. Can you reveal the outfit you will wear for the US Open?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, next week. (Laughter.)
 It's been a lot of fun. People are going to be start looking forward to what I'm going to wear. I had a lot of fun designing it. I mean, I missed getting to wear my summer outfit, too. In any case, it will be a lot of fun.

 Q. How are you enjoying being an owner of the Dolphins? Any predictions for the season?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: It's coming up really soon and preseason has been going solid. Last year we came pretty close to getting to the playoffs. Wow, it's so exciting. I'm just ready for football season.

 Q. How would you describe your level of confidence going into this tournament given your physical status?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: I feel good. I feel good mainly because I've played so many matches in my career that I feel like I can bank on the experience. I know how to hit the ball. I feel like I'm hitting a pretty clean shot right now. 
 Plus, you know, theoretically I've had more rest than everyone. I should be fresh.

 Q. Given your involvement in the tour, did you have any reaction to John McEnroe's comments about women, how they've been able to handle the mental and physical aspects?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: No, no comment.

 Q. What are your thoughts on Wozniacki's game? How would you describe it for somebody just getting familiar with the No. 1 seed here?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she's really improved a lot since the first time I played her quite a few years ago, I think maybe three years ago.
 Really added some power into her game; moves very well; plays smart; really shows a lot of maturity on the court, both with her choice and mental capacity, hanging in there to stay tough.
 Really a nice all-around player who can make anything happen on the court.

 Q. How will it be different on and off the court for you playing at a Grand Slam without Serena being here?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, it happens every now and then one of us will miss one. I mean, it's not the same, and we really miss playing doubles. You know, we definitely don't take that for granted, because now we realize how great it is to win in doubles and to win together, too. 
 You know, next year hopefully we'll both have -- be together and be able to play again hopefully as soon as the Australian Open or Beijing.

 Q. Do you follow Tiger Woods' comeback? What are your thoughts about the way he's handled all of his problems?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Um, I think everyone -- I mean, I don't watch any golf, but I do hear about it. 
 The guy's a great player. I mean, everyone wants to be like him. Everyone in America loves golf, and they want to hit as hard as he does and play the mental game that he does.
 You know, maybe he's had some trying times, but he's a champion. I don't know what he's doing this week, but hopefully well.

 Q. Are you rooting for him?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. 
 I think it's important -- you know, what he does on the course is fantastic, and I think we all deserve to have some privacy in our lives. The way the media is these days it's not easy, but it's hard these days.
