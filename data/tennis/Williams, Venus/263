K. CLIJSTERS/V. Williams
  6-0, 0-6, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How would you compare Kim as a player from four years ago when you last faced her until now?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Uhm, she's still playing really well. Yeah, it was kind of hard to make a comparison from four years ago, because it was really a while ago.

 Q. How would you describe her performance today? What impressed you most, given how long her layoff was and how short a time she's been back?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, she played so well, hit a lot of deep balls. Just played really consistently and aggressively at the right times. 

 Q. How do you explain what happened from the first to the second sets?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I had a really slow start. Just didn't get going. The second set I got going a lot better, yeah. 

 Q. Do you remember ever getting beat 6-Love?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, unfortunately it's happened before. So hopefully it will be the last. 

 Q. Not a lot, I would assume. 
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Not a lot. 

 Q. What do you think was the difference in this match?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think she just played more consistently at the end. I had a few errors sometimes. She just played really well. 

 Q. To what degree were you hampered in this tournament by your leg injury?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, uhm, you know, I wasn't able to play 100%, but I gave my best. 
 Unfortunately, I'm still not in the singles, but I can just continue to recover and get better, and hopefully my next event will be 100%. 

 Q. How much have you had the opportunity to watch Melanie Oudin, and what are your impressions of her?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: She's got a lot of spirit, and she can just keep improving her game. I'm just definitely wishing her a lot of luck in the next rounds. 

 Q. You just met Caroline out there. How do you see her rising right now? How is she developing the last couple months?
 VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think she's in the top 10 right now. You have to play great tennis to be there. She's got so much ahead of her. If she continues to work hard, she can continue to reach her goals.
