E. SVITOLINA/V. Williams
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough opponent to play first up.  You're right off the court, but what are your thoughts?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I thought she played really well and took her opportunities.  I wish her luck in the tournament.
Q. I know it's immediately after the match, but is there anything you think you could have done differently on your end to try and change things out there?
VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty close to the match, so I'll definitely think about it and definitely evaluate it the next day or two.
Q. As the match was going on, is there an inclination to try to switch something up, or you need to do what you do best and just hope it starts to turn your way?
VENUS WILLIAMS: I mean, when something is not working, you do try and change it.  Maybe a few too many unforced errors today.
