THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Was it difficult to concentrate for your match with everything that happened with Bethanie?  Have you heard anything about her?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Yeah, well, obviously it was a very, very tough day.  Yes, I kept in touch not with Bethanie, but with Justin, with the husband, with the coach Adam.
She's doing further tests.  She's in hospital.  Yeah, I will try to visit her as soon as I can.
Q. It feels like there's a floodgate of emotions at the moment.  Is that how you feel?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: It's shocking few hours obviously.  I mean, it's just terrible what happened.  Obviously I'm very sad for her.  Doesn't matter about whatever goals we had.  It's just about her being healthy.
I know what she has been through with the injuries.  Everything was going so well for her.  We've been going, like, we had amazing run.  I'm just, like, really hurt for her that she's hurt again like that.
Q. Were you watching the match?  I saw you go out to the court.
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I was watching the match.  But I was announced for a court change for my match.  I just went to the locker room.  Meanwhile I was walking down, it happened.  I saw it on the TV.  When I saw that she's hurt, I obviously ran to the court.
Then, yeah, that wasn't pretty.
Q. What were you feeling at that point?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Every person who is close to Bethanie was really sad and shocked.  Obviously, it's terrible to see someone in so much pain.  Only thing you can do is try to comfort her.  Yeah, not much you can do.
Q. Do we have idea about the time?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: No idea.
Q. You had to go on court right away.  Was there any way to avoid that situation?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I mean, no, not really.  Shelby is also her good friend.  It was not nice situation for any of us.  Obviously it's been in my mind.  I wasn't playing the greatest.  But, yeah, it is what it is.
Q. Do you plan to see her tonight if you can?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I will try to get in touch with Justin.  Obviously I want to give her support.  Whenever I can see her or whenever she needs me there, I'll be there.
