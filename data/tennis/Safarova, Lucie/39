  6‑2, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be in the semifinals?  
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Great, of course.   Yeah, it's been tough matches, especially yesterday and with the rain all day waiting.   It's not easy.  
But I came really strong in the match today.   I'm really happy to be in the semis.   First time in Canada.  
   
 Q.   Li Na?   What do you know of your opponent tomorrow?   What's your experience and history?  
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   I played her already few times.   I don't think if I won against her yet, but, yeah, she's a top player and playing really strong, strong groundstrokes.  
Well, I have nothing to lose tomorrow.   I will just go there and try to play my tennis, try to take her time away and use my lefty serve, lefty hand, and let's see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   What are you most satisfied about your game so far?  
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   So far?   Well, I think that I win both of the matches serving quite well and putting a lot of pressure and, like, the percentage, I didn't do many mistakes.   So in general, putting pressure and taking the time away of the opponent.  
   
 Q.   What was your reaction like when you saw the rain come this afternoon?   
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   We were actually almost going on, and I was already warming up, and I was like, No way again.   (Laughter.)  
But it's like ‑‑I was just hoping that this clearing will come, and I'm really happy that we finished the match today, because it would be, to play two singles matches in one day, it's really tough.
