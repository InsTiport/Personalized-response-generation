6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Could you first say a little word about your young opponent, Viktorija Golubic, please.
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, yeah, she's a good player.  She's very touchy.  You don't see many one-handed backhands on tour, women's tour.  Her backhand side is pretty good.  She's mixing up with a slice.  Yeah, good upcoming player.
Q. How are you feeling about being back this year and your form at the moment?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I feel very pleased.  I'm happy to be playing here again, and, yeah, I feel pretty good.  The matches are going well.  I'm excited for the next one.
Q. Do you feel you're a marked woman because of what you've achieved here?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I'm taking it step by step, really just enjoying the moment and of course trying to reach the best result.
