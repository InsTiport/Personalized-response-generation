MATTEK SANDS-SAFAROVA/BARTY-DELLACQUA   
6-2, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  Another Grand Slam victory.  Talk about that.  
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Just so everyone knows, we have our trophies here.  We have a little champagne in it.  It's tradition to drink champagne out of the trophy, so I'm going to do so.   
No.  I mean, we played really well today.  We played a good team.  We watched them play their semifinal match.  They beat another good team in three sets, so we were kind of ready with what they were going to bring out on the court.   
I mean, finals day is final day.  I mean, we were ready.  We have been there obviously before.  Casey has been there before.  We played her in 2015.   
But going out, when you walk out on Philippe Chatrier, it's an amazing feeling.  It's a great stadium.  Perfect day to play tennis today.  We were ready.  We were ready to go.   
 Q.  So you have won three Grand Slams in a row, which is pretty good.  I guess you've gotten to know each other more, the two of you?  
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah, it's funny, because we don't even kind of think about it that way.  We are taking it one match at a time.  Really, we kind of enjoy our practice days.  We enjoy our off-days.  We're playing singles, doubles.  I played mixed doubles here.   
I think you just -- the moment is enough, actually.  It's kind of tough to even look back and to the future to what you could do and what you have done.   
But we're really excited for grass.  We're looking forward to Wimbledon.  Lucie, I know, is playing a couple of warmup events.  I'm going home for a bit.  We love playing on grass.  We are going to be ready there, too.
