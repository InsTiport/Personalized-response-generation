MAKAROVA-VESNINA/Mattek Sands-Safarova
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Bethanie and Lucie, you played your opponents before and beaten them before.  What do you think was the difference today?  What do you think went wrong in today's match?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I think it was a great match from both teams.  It was about just I think one point in the first set.  The tiebreaker was very close.
Then I mean, it was just about few points.  It was good fight from both sides.  The other team played really well today.  Served out really well.  Playing aggressive.  We gave our best and unfortunately didn't work out.
But Team Bucie will be back strong again in the next season.  (Smiling.)
Q. Can each of you maybe sum up what kind of season it's been for you in doubles, your proudest moment, your best memory?
LUCIA SAFAROVA: I'm doing the talking today?  Okay.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: No pressure.
LUCIA SAFAROVA: No pressure.  No, it's been great season this year.  We won, what, four events?  (Fist bump/dap)   been in the finals of two, including this one, finals of Masters, which is amazing.
I mean, it's just always pleasure to play with Bethanie.  On and off the court we have a lot of fun.  I think that's the most important.  I know she played today for the No. 1; we didn't make it.
But I'm very positive she will be in the beginning of next season.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: We're going to be tied pretty soon.
Q. Bethanie?
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: What she said.
Q. During today's match, was the possibility you could clinch the year-end No. 1 ranking on your mind at all?  Did that add any extra pressure for you?
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: I knew about it a little bit, but you got to go out and just play the match and play your game.
Q. You guys have only partnered from last year, whereas your opponents were partners since 2012.  How important of a factor do you think a long partnership is and playing tournaments with each other for a long time?
LUCIA SAFAROVA: I think the key of the success of course is to play stable with one partner, and as I said, to enjoy the game, to have fun out there.
I think we are doing great in that.  We are always positive.  With turned a lot of matches we could have lost in the first round here.  We turned around from three match points.  Always fighting.  That's the key of success.
Q. You ladies have won the Grand Slam on three different surfaces.  I think the only one missing is Wimbledon.  Is that the goal for next year, to win the Wimbledon doubles?
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: That's like so far away.  I'm not even thinking about it.
LUCIA SAFAROVA: We're thinking about holidays now.  The one target.  Recover.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Yeah.
LUCIA SAFAROVA: Get ready for the next season.  I mean, I think the first target there is Australia.  We have great memories.  That's where we started and have our first Grand Slam title.
Of course Wimbledon is somewhere there, but far away.  I think we will do our best to get that one, too.
Q. Could you talk about your off-season plans?  Are you finally visiting each other's homes like you talked about for the past two years?
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Are we?
LUCIA SAFAROVA: What?
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: Are we visiting each other's homes?  It's so far away.  We actually haven't decided on our plans yet.
LUCIA SAFAROVA: No, but I don't think you're coming to Czech.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: It's too cold there.
LUCIE SAFAROVA: But it's beautiful.  It will happen.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: I know you have the heated floors in your house.
LUCIA SAFAROVA: Yeah, so you could like walk and be warm.
Yeah, I mean, me visiting B is most likely, more likely than her visiting me.  In the off-season.
BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS: We will make it next year for sure to each other's homes.
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Yeah.
