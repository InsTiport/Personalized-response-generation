C. WOZNIACKI/L. Safarova
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Where do you think you lost the match, in the first set?   What went wrong in the overall match? 
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   I didn't feel‑‑ I didn't feel well on the court at all today.   I was just making way too many mistakes, and I could not get into the rhythm.   Caroline was bringing the balls back.   I was missing.

Q.   How do you see your season from here on?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Well, the start was not very successful.   I was sick.   Then I was injured with my knee. 
And I think I need a little bit to go back home, practice, and I will start over in the States.

Q.   What's the next tournament for you? 
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   In the States, in Indian Wells and then Miami.
