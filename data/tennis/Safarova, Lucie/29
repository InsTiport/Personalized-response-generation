 L. SAFAROVA/C. Suarez Navarro
  6‑3, 6‑2 
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're playing some of your best tennis ever right now?   You look pretty good.   
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   It's been going on for longer now.   I had a really good last season and I've been working hard in the offseason.   So I think, yeah, I'm playing the best tennis that I played so far.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel in control of this match from the start and just keep going?   
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   I felt pretty confident from the beginning.   I was feeling that my game is working against Carla.   And that was the plan, to play aggressive and take her time away because she's very good in defense.   And she can also, from her backhand side, play very strong.   So I was trying to push more through the forehand and be the first one who is taking the point.   
   
 Q.   Are you feeling like now you could really take this title?  
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   I hope so.   I will do everything for it tomorrow.   There is a tough match ahead.   So whoever from those two, Venus or Vika, win, it will be a tough match but I'm looking forward.  
   
 Q.   Looking back on the week, you've had very solid performances but what were the moments where you struggled that were the most difficult for you this week?   
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Struggled, well, I would say that each of the match was a little different.   It was different opponents.   Very tough match was against Makarova, where it was a close threesetter.   But all of the matches were like great players, so I'm really happy to come through all of them.  
   
 Q.   Just looking at this year in general, what goals have you set for yourself?  
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Well, my best so far is 14, so it's always dream to come to top‑10, but it has to click everything together.   So that's what I will try and that's where my goals are.
