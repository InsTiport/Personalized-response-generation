   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  You've never played her before.  Can you talk about what you were expecting and how it was? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Yeah, it was a tough match.  She was serving very well.  I got -- yeah, she pushed me from the service, and it was very close. 
 Yeah, 7-5 in the third.  I had many chances to win this match, but I didn't use it, and I lost. 

 Q.  Can you talk about your feelings right there at the end?  Because you talked before about finding it difficult to know what to do when I match gets close? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Yeah, of course.  Of course I was trying to don't do any mistake there and trying to push her, but she was -- she wasn't giving me any chances on her serve.  And she was going, when I didn't hit the first serve, she was attacking the second serve.  So, yeah, it was difficult. 

 Q.  Has it been tough making the transition?  You went from Wimbledon to Fed Cup on clay and then hard courts? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Yeah, it's what we usually do through the year, so you have to get used to it, yeah, to different surfaces.  So it's not a problem. 

 Q.  So are you feeling completely comfortable on the hard courts now?  You've played about three tournaments? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Yeah, it wasn't bad, yeah. 

 Q.  Are you injured with the leg and everything? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Little bit. 

 Q.  Did it bother you during the match? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  In the third set. 

 Q.  Your boyfriend, Tomas Berdych also lost in the first round in Montreal, so I guess you could say it's not a good trip for you in Canada this year. 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Yeah, maybe next year. 

 Q.  It's going to be better next year? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  Hopefully. 

 Q.  You've been talking a lot recently about the inter-country rivalries like Belgian Henin and Clistjers and now Serbia and Ivanovic and Jankovic, do you look at other players like Vaidisova, and are you aware of their progress?  Do you use that as a benchmark? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  I didn't really understand your question. 

 Q.  Do you compare yourself to Nicole at all and see how she's doing? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  No, I don't do this.  I just concentrate on myself.  We are friends, everything is fine, but I don't really like try to be better. 
 Of course I'm trying to be the best that I can, but not comparing with Nicole. 

 Q.  How about sort of other players your age?  Who do you measure yourself against, if anyone? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA:  I think that Chakvetadze's playing very well.  And Ivanovic, of course, she's hitting the ball amazing strong, so these two players are playing very well.
