L. SAFAROVA/A. Ivanovic
      6‑3, 6‑3

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   Great match.   How do you feel after this great victory for you, second time in the fourth round here in Paris?
    LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Yeah.   I'm excited, really happy, because it's been a long time that I reached fourth round here at the French Open.
    So it was a great match.   I'm looking forward for the next one.

Q.   How did you feel in your tennis today?   Everything was going good for you?
    LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Yeah.   I think I was playing very solid today, and I was not making a lot of mistakes.   I was pressuring Ana into her backhand side and then attacking the forehand side, which was working well.   I was serving decent. 
    So overall the game was really good.   I'm happy.

Q.   From the beginning of the match, you were in your match until the end.   It was okay for you.   Even if you lost one match point at 5‑2. 
    LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Yeah, but she served really good first serve, so I didn't really have the chance to win the point there. 
    I was really concentrated on my service game, and I served it out well.   That was just what I had to do.

Q.   You have a love story with Paris.   You played very well in Coubertin?   Do you remember? 
    LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Yeah, that's true.   I really like the indoor tournament, and I haven't played this year, but I like to come back there.   I like Paris, very beautiful city.   It's nice to visit always.

Q.   Next round?   Svetlana Kuznetsova?   How do you feel about that?
    LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Well, I haven't played her for a while now, and what I remember, we always had long and good matches, so we will see. 
    It's a pleasure to be in the second week of the Grand Slam.   Each match is for me great, and I will just go there and enjoy.
