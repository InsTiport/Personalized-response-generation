Y. SHVEDOVA/L. Safarova
  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Did you learn from today's match? 
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, it was a tough match. She played really well today. She was serving amazing. Didn't really give me a chance.
I don't think I could do anything better today. She was just the better player out there.

Q. You went to semifinal in 2014? 
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Here? 

Q. Wimbledon. 
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Yes, two years ago. Last year French Open finals. 

Q. How different from then and now?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, each year is different, but obviously I had a little break with the sickness and now coming back, playing well and feeling much better and confidence is coming back.
But there is no difference. It's just Slava played the match great today. I think I played well all Wimbledon. It was just bad day today for me. 

Q. I wonder that there are lots of argument about Nike dress this Wimbledon. How was it?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I think it's fine. 

Q. You're okay? 
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Yes.

Q. Is it uncomfortable?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: No, they fixed the problem that they had with it. They fixed it. Obviously it's a little shorter, but we still have the shorts under it so it's fine. 

Q. You are a very experienced player. At some point you have slump or tough time. To maximize your resources mentally or physically, what do you do to overcome that?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, it's in every sport. You have ups and downs. It's all how you think about them and how quickly you can just forget those bad moments and start again from new and strong.
I think each athlete has this and has to cope with it, and I have done it in the past. I think the older you get, the better you take the losses usually. 
But obviously there are some days where you lose very tough matches. It just hurts and it will pass.

Q. Is there any specific behavior?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I don't think so. It's different for each person because you have to find your own best way. 

Q. How about your behavior?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: My way? Well, when I lose a bad match, I like to forget about it, go talk with my friends, maybe go for some nice dinner, just do normal things.
