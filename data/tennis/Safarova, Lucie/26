  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   How proud are you of yourself and the way you managed to back up yesterday's win with another spectacular win?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Very proud.   Yeah, it's not easy because you have so many emotions going on from yesterday.   I couldn't really fall asleep yesterday evening, and then I wake up so early. 
So I was like a little tired in the morning.   But, yeah, the will to win and to be in the semifinals was so big that once I stepped on the court I was just fighting and playing really well.

Q.   Is Paris becoming your favorite city?   Because in 2007 you played the final in Coubertin, beating three top 10 players.   And here in Roland Garros you beat AmÃ©lie Mauresmo; that was also in 2007.   And today this semifinal. 
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   I'm enjoying Paris, yeah.   It's a beautiful city.   I like all the French bakeries and a lot of nice things.   Yeah, I visited throughout the years a lot of like sightseeing, the Louvre and Arc de Triomphe and Montmarte.   It's nice to be here.

Q.   Today how did you manage to play with this wind which was very difficult?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   It was very difficult conditions out there.   The wind was turning and it was taking the ball to all sides.   I just tried to be good on my feet and tried to find the right pace and not going for bigger lines and going for bigger targets. 
It was a battle.   The first set the tiebreak was very close and we had some great rallies.   No, I had an early break and lost it in the second, and managed to keep it together and played strong. 

Q.   Can you explain the buildup, the tournaments you played leading into this, and how it turned out how you played so well when you got here?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Yeah, I think on grass always the first rounds are kind of difficult because obviously you want to do well.   You have a lot of pressure on yourself and you're still getting used to the conditions and everything. 
But slowly if you keep winning one, two matches, you get the rhythm and you feel better and better. 
Now it's about to be healthy and still ready. 

Q.   How would you compare the wind to other conditions you've played in?   On Chatrier there was an incident where part of the scoreboard was blown down and fell on the crowd.   Does it seem like an especially terrible wind today?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   It was pretty bad conditions, really.   I have played in winds.   Especially Australia, can be very windy.   Never experienced such a bad wind in Paris.   I guess it's warming up next couple of days, so the weather change made it.

Q.   Usually when it's this windy the quality of play is not high, but you and GarbiÃ±e in the first set were just amazing.   Did you manage to take it in, like during the first set and after you won the tiebreak and realized just how good of an example of women's tennis you guys were giving?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   It's nice to hear.   Yeah, well, I was trying my best out there today, and GarbiÃ±e was playing well, strong.   I had to keep the level high to be able to beat her.

Q.   What about the semifinals with Ana?   How do you feel about that?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Feels pretty amazing.   It's still coming.   I didn't digest it yet.   First time in semis here in Paris.   I experience it only once in Wimbledon last year, so, yeah, it's nice to be here so far.

Q.   Do you have to make sure that you still realize the goal is to win the tournament?
LUCIE SAFAROVA:   Of course, it's step by step, so I'm looking for my next match.   She's a nice, tough opponent.
Yeah, it will be exciting.
