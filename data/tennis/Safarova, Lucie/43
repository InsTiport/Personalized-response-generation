 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Could you please comment on your match today? Why do you think Pavlyuchenkova managed to win?  
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, she was playing aggressive. She was serving well, and I -- well, I think I did quite a lot of mistakes in the first set.   
 Second set it was good tennis, I think. She just was there better today.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Did you feel nervous throughout the match?  
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: Maybe a little bit at the beginning early, but not then through the match.  
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Where were you more upset? Today or yesterday after you lost?  
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, I think it's more today, because if I would have won the match we could win all the ties, so it was both tough matches, Svetlana and Anastasia. They are both great players. I was trying my best there, but I was the weaker one on the court.  
 I'm sad, of course, because Petra was playing or is playing amazing, so I was really pushing myself. But it wasn't enough.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) People say Pavlyuchenkova is very uncomfortable player to play with. What's so uncomfortable about her game?  
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, she's serving well, and she's playing very flat and very fast. So of course that's the modern game of tennis, and she's very strong on the court.
