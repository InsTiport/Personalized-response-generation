S. STOSUR/L. Safarova
6-3, 6-7, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. You played in the final against Stosur in Prague and won.  What was the difference maybe today?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: Well, it was a tough match there.  It was a tough match here.  I think we played some good tennis today.  I was fighting, did very well in the second set, but lost a little bit beginning of the third set, and then it was just about few points in the game of 5-6.
She played really well today, especially served really well.
Q. I'm a reporter from Canada.  I wanted to talk about your coach from the time that he started working with you a couple years ago till now.  What would you say your progression is?  What did he bring to your game?
LUCIE SAFAROVA: I mean, with Rob we work over three years.  Yeah, we had great results together, and I think I reached with him my best results, obviously last year, and I think that helped my game overall.  He helped me also with being more focused and positive.
So I think in general we are good working together.
