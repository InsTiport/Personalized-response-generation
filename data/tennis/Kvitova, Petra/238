P. KVITOVA/V. Williams
  6‑2, 2‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Petra, you faced three break points that would have given her a 5‑1 lead in the third set.   How did you climb back into it? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, it's nice question.   I don't know exactly what was, so I was just glad that I was still staying in the match with my serve.
Yeah, I mean, she played all out today again, and I really don't remember what's happen.   I just recognize that I'm coming back in the third set, so it was great for me.   I felt more confident on the court and was really fighting hard for every ball.
Yeah, in the end, was just incredible tiebreak.

Q.   You two have played before.   Since she's been sick and stuff like that, how much better was she tonight than in previous, more recent matches?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I know we played in Tokyo semifinal, and I have to say that both of the matches today and there was really great.   Both of them we played 7‑6 in the third, so this means a lot.
Yeah, I mean, she played really well.   Even when she's injured or if she's not playing and then when she come back on the court she's always playing great.   She's a great player, so I'm really glad that I was able to win today.
