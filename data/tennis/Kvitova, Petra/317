 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) One renowned Russian tennis expert said that in this rubber, everything will depend on you, Petra, and not on Svetlana. Do you agree?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: It's really tough to say, because, you know, I played my game in the first set and I made many mistakes, and Svetlana moved very well.  
 I mean, she return really well, and my serve wasn't really advantage as usual. So it was very tough for me to fight and come back in the second set and play actually not really my game but more rallies and more cross and everything.   
 I mean, yeah, maybe it was about my game, but Svetlana played very well.   
  
  Q. Basically how were you able to turn the match around in the third set? What was the key, do you think?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. Maybe after the second set when she had a toilet break, I don't know, I was really like go play and I had to wait a long time for her.   
 And maybe I -- I didn't be like on the court or something like that. So I had to like more play. And when I had 3-Love down, I didn't think that I can still win.   
 My captain told me, It's only one break, so go for it. And 3-1, and the game, and she serving was very close. It was very important game for me.   
  
  Q. (Off microphone .)  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yes.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) Do you think the Czech tennis fans played some role in today's match? They are not that numerous as the Russians, but they did support really loudly for you. Do you think they played a role?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course. We are very happy that they are here and they support all the time, and, I mean, when I lost first set they were there and support me again in 3-Love down still. So, I mean, I had thanks to them, for sure.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You played 21 match indoors this year and you won all of them. Do you think you can ever repeat this result?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. Do you think that it would be more difficult for you to play in such a match against Zvonareva than Kuznetsova?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: I mean, it's really different. They are playing different game, and, I mean, with Vera, we played six times already. So we know each other.   
 This match was really new for us, and we didn't know about her or something, so it was really, really different and it's really tough to say.   
  
  Q. (Off microphone .)  
PETRA KVITOVA: I don't think so that I will play doubles.   
 THE INTERPRETER: The question was: Is she tired, and is she ready to play doubles? And the answer is yes? You are tired and ready to play doubles?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, if Captain told me, You have to play, I go, but I don't think so that he can say.   
  
  Q. (Through translation.) You look very calm on court. Is there anything we can force you lose your temper?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, in the first set I didn't well, so it was the way I have to play in the first set because it was hectic, and I knew that I had to be like more, yeah, more calmed down.
