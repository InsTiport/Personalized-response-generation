P. KVITOVA/T. Paszek
  6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you talk about your game, please. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think that I played so well and really solid.   I didn't have a lot of mistakes.   Yeah, I think that she played very solid, also, but maybe I had a little bit better serve and it helped me in the important things and in important points.
Yeah, I think that I played my aggressive game, which was good tactics.

Q.   Would you say you might be playing the best tennis of your year?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I didn't thinking like this.   Yeah, I'm playing good, but I'm not sure if it's the best tennis in this year.
I hope that it can be better.

Q.   Can you handicap your semifinal, your opponent, and how you match up?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah.   We played already some matches.   I think the last one was this hear in the Hopman Cup.   I hope that I remember something. 
Yeah, a little bit different.   We are playing outdoor in the semis.   It will be much different.   Yeah, I need to play my game again, be aggressive.

Q.   How has the rain been to handle this week?   How have you coped with all of these delays?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I was lucky, actually.   I played my matches normally, and I didn't really have some troubles.   It helped me in the first round, so I'm really lucky. 
I supposed to play at 6:30, so it was just wait one‑and‑a‑half hours.   So I left in the afternoon, so I felt good.
