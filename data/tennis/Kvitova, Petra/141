P. KVITOVA/S. Cirstea
  6‑0, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. That was a very fast start to that match, very quick first set. Did that sort of relax you a little bit?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think that every match is different. Of course, I'm kind of glad how I played, how else everything looked today on the court. 
I mean, every match is different. I really never know what's happening on the court. I'm glad how I played today, how my serve worked today. I think she wasn't a really easy opponent on the grass to play first round. 
After the rain delay, it's always a little bit difficult. But I'm glad how I played today. 

Q. Did you enjoy being on Court18 and how far in advance did you know your match was moving?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I knew it when the schedule came out yesterday. The Court 18 was fine. I had great memories 2011 when I beat Vinci over there. So for me it was fine. I think for fans it was little bit cold. It wasn't really great for them. 
I made it quick. So that's good (smiling). 

Q. Did you realize how fast the first set was? I think it was 15 minutes. 
PETRA KVITOVA: It was? Okay. That's good. I'm glad that I finished before the rain came. That's the better side of that. 

Q. Is there a funny feeling on Court18 because on one side it's higher, smaller on the other side?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it feels a little bit differently compared to other courts. I think that the wind wasn't that bad on that court as on the more open court. That was better from that side. 
I think when you play, you just don't really, like, thinking about the court. So it was fine. 

Q. What time did you find out yesterday matches were called off?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm not very good with the time‑wise. I think was around 5:00 or 6:00 when they cancel. 

Q. Coming back here, then the rain delays, what do you do?
PETRA KVITOVA: I was prepared like to play 11:45 because I knew that Tomas is almost finished. I had to wake up around 8:00, so it was fine. Then I was waiting and waiting. I felt like I was always only eating, so it was kind of funny. 
I did have a warmup twice today. It was fine. I mean, probably I'm kind of the person who just take it how it is, so I wasn't really nervous about the rain delay. We were just laying in the locker room, having fun with the girls. 
Sometimes it's good to catch up when you can't play. We were watching Aga playing on Centre Court. We were very jealous that she can play and not us. So it was okay. 

Q. Who were you watching with?
PETRA KVITOVA: With Belinda Bencic and Jo. 

Q. All the people who were ready to go on?
PETRA KVITOVA: Exactly. 

Q. Was there one moment when you realized you could play on grass? Did you fight it at first? Was there a time you decided that you could be a good player on grass?
PETRA KVITOVA: You know, I remember, like, many people told me I can play on the grass. The moment when I find out was I think 2010 when I played semifinal against Serena. In the quarterfinals, my opponent, which was Kaia Kanepi had three match points or four. I was somehow able to still do it, play good match with Serena. That was probably the time I realize I can play well here. 

Q. Your parents were here today. 
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah. 

Q. Do they get to watch many of your matches?
PETRA KVITOVA: They are not traveling that much. They are almost every year here. Probably they love it. It's nice. They just came with the friends for around four or five days. 
Unfortunately the rain was a little bit interrupting. I hope they enjoy it definitely. My dad and mom was very happy today. I'm glad they were able to watch the first round. 

Q. Are they staying on for future rounds?
PETRA KVITOVA: They should leave tomorrow evening, so I don't know. I didn't talk with them so far. I will. So we will see.
