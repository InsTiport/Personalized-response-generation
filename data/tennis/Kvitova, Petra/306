N. LI/P. Kvitova
  1‑6, 7‑5, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Take us through what happened after the first set.   You seemed to be in control and it slipped away. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, what happened.   No, it's tennis, so it's still up and down.   I mean, yeah, I play very well the first set.   I was first who made the winners. 
And then in the second set, I gave her a lot of chance and she did it.   Yeah, it was really‑‑ after was very tough.   I was a little bit slower in the moving, and she played really well.

Q.   You looked to be tiring out there towards the end.   You've had lots of tennis in the last week or so.   Probably getting a bit much.   Need a break. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, now I'm really tired.   So, yeah, but still, I wanted to win, of course.   During the match I didn't feel any tired or any thought that I don't want to be in the court or play this tournament.
So, I mean, yeah, it was two weeks when I played some good matches.   The next one is Melbourne, so hopefully I will be better and more‑‑ not really tired as now. 

Q.   Do you still think it's been good preparation the last couple weeks for the Open?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so, of course.   I mean, this match what we played today was great for preparation again. 
Yeah, I mean, these two weeks was great. 

Q.   Are there any things that were the same between today and last night?   Both matches you won the first set very easy, and in the second set your opponent came back. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, well, it looks similar.   I mean, in the beginning of the match I play really fast and well.   It's normal that if it's too high, have to come down a little bit.
Yeah, it was the problem.   Unfortunately, I had to win the second set, but I didn't.   So, I mean, it's the life. (Smiling.) 

Q.   When you say it's too high, it has to come down, do you mean the intensity?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, actually, when I play many winners on the lines and then it's close out and something like this, she was better.   You know, it's the tennis.

Q.   Do you think the reason you lost today is because you didn't play your best or she was playing better?   Talk about Li's play today. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, she's No. 4, so... 
I mean, this is where she's playing great.   She had a great last season.   I knew that it will be very tough opponent, and she was.   She plays really, really good.
I mean, she is very well on the legs.   She's great moving, and she's playing really fast.   You never know what it will be, because I was waiting that it's enough, and it wasn't.   We played still long rallies.
Yeah, she's play really well. 

Q.   If you would like to give some names that are top contenders in the Open, will Li be one of them? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so, of course.   Many of us can be in the top, and she's one of us.
