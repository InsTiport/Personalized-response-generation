  6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   When you're serving, you always have the ability to ace at any time.   When you're also returning serve as you did tonight, almost makes you unbeatable.   When you have that combination going, do you feel good about your game?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think my serve, well, it was very well also last night.   I just would like to continue from the yesterday.   I knew what I have to do.   I did it very well. 
I mean, about the return, I always step in the court and try to attack from the return because Sara didn't have like the fastest speed on the tour.   I tried to attack from the return and be the first player who will have the offensive and have the winners because otherwise if I just push to the back, I think that I will moving a lot, and who knows how it will be in the end. 

Q.   Can you talk about Kirilenko. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I played her in the Olympics.   I have to forget the bad things and pick up the good things.   Yeah, I didn't feel very well during this match against Kirilenko in London.   But I know what she's playing.   She will try to attack me, be offensive, serve more first percentage. 
Yeah, I think that I will have to play my game again, similar as today and yesterday, something like this. 

Q.   Do you think the surface is to your advantage versus grass?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Definitely it will be different compared grass court, for sure, because there I didn't return very well on the grass against Maria.   I think here it's not bouncing that low, so I hope that it will be better. 

Q.   You've had an incredible run since MontrÃ©al.   What have you found in your hard court game?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that in the beginning when I was in MontrÃ©al, it was important for me to enjoy the tennis, without the pressure that I had before.   So I tried to enjoy, have the fun from tennis, just thinking about my game a lot.   Then when actually David came, he helped me a lot again. 
Yeah, I mean, the run that I have here in North America, it's the first one.   I didn't have a great result before, so I'm really glad for it. 

Q.   What does it mean to be in the final tomorrow leading up to the US Open?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think that it's great.   I mean, I wanted here to play matches.   I'm in the final.   So that is for 100%. 
Yeah, I mean, in the final, no one want to lose.   So I will fight tomorrow.   Then it will be US Open.   But now I'm thinking about tomorrow. 

Q.   You've played all night matches this week.   You play during the day tomorrow.   Do you have a preference?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I ask (laughter).   In the night, it's not as hot as during the day.   I think tomorrow will be so‑so.   I hope it will be okay.
