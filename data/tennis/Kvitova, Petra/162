A. KERBER/P. Kvitova
      6‑2, 7‑6

    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. You were telling us beforehand how you would have to consult your doctors and everything. When you were wrapping yourself with towels and everything at the changovers, you didn't look 100% fit. How are you feeling? 
    PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know actually. I feel weird. 

Q. Don't we all? 
    PETRA KVITOVA: It's really tough to describe. I was just talking with my fitness coach and I was trying to describe it and it's very difficult.
    I mean, it's just something what I really can't do anything against. My blood test was not the best one so I couldn't really do the one I wanted to be prepared for everything.
    I felt I wasn't able to stay in the kind of good rally what she played. I miss so early. 
    From that time I started to hit a little bit harder and I made some mistakes, so it was a little difficult to find a balance like between rallies and winners and some kind of volleys and anything.
    She still played very good shots out there today, and I am going to try to do my best the next match. 

Q. There is no question of you pulling out and calling in for an alternate or anything like that?
    PETRA KVITOVA: No, I do not think that. (Smiling.)

Q. You have beaten her the last three our four times, three sets, Fed Cup final, 6‑4 in the third. It was long. You were kind of tired but still managed to win. What happened today? 
    PETRA KVITOVA: Today I didn't manage to win unfortunately. I know with her it's always big fight. S you remember the last match which we played in Fed Cup was the biggest fight probably I ever played.
    I know that she's a great player. She's very good mover and fighter as well, so I know it's going to be difficult. I think in the second set it was kind of the fight finally.
    I was trying what I can in the moment. I expect for sure difficult match. She play really good swing in Asia. I just knew it's going to be good match. I didn't really play the best in the first set, but I was trying to do something a little bit better in the second. 

Q. What are you going to be doing between your match? Anything in particular you can do to try and maybe feel a bit better? Is it just a matter of resting? 
    PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know if the resting is helping, but I probably going to hit tomorrow for sure to be ready for the next match. I don't want to really think too negative about this kind of situation.
    It's still tournament where doesn't matter if I lost the first match, I'm still able to kind of play good tennis and see how everything is going in the group.
    So I am going to try to do my best next match and see how is it. 

Q. How difficult do you find it hitting through this court specifically, and do you think it's one of the slower hard courts on tour that you play on?
    PETRA KVITOVA: I don't think it's that slow as last year from the beginning, I think. I think it's getting a little bit quicker. I mean from the baseline it's not like‑‑ it's still good for the rallies, but it's not like long, long, what is good for me basically. I wish a little bit faster still, but I can't really do anything. 
    Yeah, I think it's a little bit better than the last year for me, but still not the best. I think that when you're playing the FedCup it's still a little bit faster. This is fine. I think we used to play on this kind of surface, so that's okay. 

Q. Apart from grass in Wimbledon, which is the best surface that you remember that you have played on? Indoor of course, carpet, which you really did like and you would love to play always on that. 
    PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, unfortunately no carpet on the WTA Tour right now. Yeah, when I was growing up I played on really fast surface indoors, so that's the best surface if I'm not counting Wimbledon for sure.
    But I think the last years I was playing good on the clay as well, so it's depends. I mean, I like hard court outdoor sometimes as well; sometimes not. 
    Still up and down. So I don't really can say what is the best one. But I like indoor. I do. 

Q. How does this one compare to maybe when you won in Istanbul a couple years ago? Conditions? Speed? The feel? 
    PETRA KVITOVA: It's long time already, so it's tough to say really. Istanbul I think was a little bit faster surface I think for sure. 
    I don't know. I just felt probably more comfortable there than here. I can't really say why. I don't know. It was just great even that year. I was playing really great tennis at the time and I was confident and physically prepared and everything.
    Everything was just in the great time together. 

Q. Throughout this time you've been dealing with the mono, whenever you talk it seems like you're quite optimistic or accepting of things. Has that always been the case for you? Are you just a naturally optimistic person or have you had to learn to be?
    PETRA KVITOVA: What do you think? 

Q. I don't think you want to hear... no, just kidding. I would guess yes, but I don't know?
    PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think I am. My mom is very optimistic, so I think that's from her. I know I can't do anything with this situation, so I'm just taking like how it is right now.
    As the tests are showing it's on the good way, so I should be optimistic on that one.
