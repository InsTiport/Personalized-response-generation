P. KVITOVA/S. Halep
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You hit 34 winners in those two sets.  Pretty flawless from your side.  When you're in this state, how does that feel on the court?
PETRA KVITOVA: It's pretty good number actually.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I really felt good on the court.  I was not really thinking how well I'm playing or how, like, the game is.  I was really just focusing on the next point.  I didn't really realize what's happening on the court that much.
I know the last game I really had to serve well.  It's always difficult to kind of finish the match.
I don't know.  I just felt that I got to really push her a lot, that I was really playing aggressive, even from backhand.  I was really going for that.
Q. You had lost to her every match you played before.  What felt different?  Did you have a different plan?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, finally then I won after many matches.  But I didn't really have different plan.  I mean, I felt good all week here.  I mean, last matches showed me that I can play well.  As well with Jo, she played really fast.  And Angie the day before.  It was just a little bit different.  I know Simona will try to play aggressive, too.
I think that helped me mentally, the last match.  I didn't really have any, like, amazing plan or something.  I was just, you know, going there and just try to serve well and attack from the first shot.
Q. It's your first final of the year.  Does it feel like it's been a while since you've been in a final?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I don't remember my last.  It was Singapore maybe, right?  Okay.  It's almost year then.
Yeah, now it feels like a long time.  But I'm happy that I'm there again, for sure.  Took a while.  I mean, the season wasn't pretty good, especially the beginning.  So I'm really satisfied that I can be in the final.
Q. The bronze medal at the Olympics, did you feel like that maybe redeemed your season a little bit; that it wasn't a lost year in a way?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, for sure.  I mean, even the season wasn't the best, I will never change it for anything else.  I mean, the bronze medal is this year.  In a way, I mean, if I lost all first rounds, I have a medal.  I don't really care about.  That's what's important.
From the time I felt better, as well, like mentally, and the confidence was there.  I played great matches in Rio.  I think that helped me for the tournaments after Rio.
Q. It would be very easy to point to that result, the bronze medal, and then say, Petra won the bronze medal and everything changed, maybe you played with less pressure or a little bit freer since Rio.  Do you agree or disagree with that?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think I agree with that.  It's your story, but it's good one (smiling).
You know, tennis is special.  We have four Grand Slams.  I didn't really have great results there, as well.  The Olympics is just one in four years.  For me, like athlete, especially Czech Republic, the Olympic Games are very important.  I grew up in kind of family when we are always watching the Olympic Games.  That's something probably special for us and for me.
Everything what I did from the off-season until the Rio, I was everything just going for the medal and Olympic Games.  That's I think helped me a lot with everything.  The pressure was better afterwards.
Q. The shot she hit on the first match point, your reaction was quite funny.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I mean, it was amazing, so...  Yeah, I smiled.  I mean, if I'm her, I will not have this idea.
Q. To serve and volley or hit that shot?
PETRA KVITOVA: To hit that shot, I think.  I mean, it was really amazing.
Q. Then playing Domi, you lost the last couple, but you haven't played since Indian Wells a couple years ago.  Talk about that matchup a little bit.  Physically, how are you feeling?  Do you still feel the match against Kerber?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's long time I play Domi.  I think from the time she improved her game, for sure.  I think she's trying to attack it more, especially from the forehand.
I mean, yeah, that's true, I don't really have great memories to playing her.  But I think the same with Simona or Angie or whatever.
I mean, I should take the positive from all matches I played here and just try to do the same as I did all week here because was kind of good.
Physically, I'm feeling, I don't know, so-so.  During the day I was really sleepy.  I was sleeping after breakfast, as well.  I was like in the bed all day.  But then when I coming, like, on the court and have the warmup on the court, just trying to feel better.  I just didn't really think about the tiredness anymore.  So I hope this will be the same tomorrow.
Q. Have your warmups changed?  You said you weren't practicing necessarily off days, were trying to save all your energy.  The warmup before matches, has that gotten shorter?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, today was much more shorter.  Today was like 15 minutes, I think.  I just need to just feel the ball a little bit, to sweat a little bit, and that's fine.  In the end of the tournament, I think it's not really necessary to have long warmups, I don't know, like half an hour.  You just need to feel warm and get ready, but not really hitting hard.
That's my opinion.
