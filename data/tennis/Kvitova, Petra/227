P. KVITOVA/A. Hlavackova
  6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you sum up that match? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Of course that I'm glad that I'm through.   That's the first thing what I have to say.
I mean, it's first round of the Grand Slam.   Always tough for me, especially here when I feeling really like at home.
But still, Andrea played well definitely.   Was our first meeting after long time, so I knew what I can expect.   We practiced during the Fed Cup week. 
It's not easy to play Czech girls on the Grand Slams, on the tournaments.   So definitely I was expecting tough match.   I'm just glad that I won the last point.

Q.   You had an injury last week.   How are you feeling physically now? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I feel better, what is of course nice news.   I had to pull out fro Eastbourne to be ready for this Wimbledon.
I'm just glad that it's getting better.

Q.   Is there any more pressure on yourself here at Wimbledon?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't think that it's pressure like 2012, but, I mean, I put pressure by myself to me.
Of course I am feeling pretty comfortable here.   But still I know I can play really good tennis here, so I'm trying to play that.
There is the pressure that comes, and of course the opponents that I'm playing knows that I can play good here.   They are more motivated to beat me, definitely.
