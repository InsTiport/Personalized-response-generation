P. KVITOVA/K. Bondarenko
7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel after that first match in Eastbourne?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I didn't feel bad.  Obviously a little bit tired.  But I got a hit this morning before the match, was a warmup.  I felt the courts are a little bit different compared to Birmingham in a way.
It took me a while to get used to the centre court, as well.  But I think it was fine in the end.
Q. Weather has been good in Birmingham.  It's been good here.  What differences do you feel in the grass between Birmingham and here in particular?
PETRA KVITOVA: I do feel the grass, it's a little bit like softer.  So sometimes it's, like, slow.  But then when you hit it really, really flat, then it's pretty fast.
That's what I found a little bit difference.  And I did feel in the movement that it's sliding a little bit.  So kind of like it's happened like three times.  Yeah.
Q. Obviously it was a long week in Birmingham.  Emotional, as well, maybe?  You pulled up well to come here.
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think emotional with the final, it was a tough final, was a fight, which took me some energy, for sure.
But emotional, I think, of course winning the title, it's amazing.  I was happy, for sure.  But the whole tournament was more relaxed for me from my side.  It was great that I hopefully will save some energy for the next weeks.
Q. Were you tempted to not come here, given after a long week?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I am happy that I played the first round, for sure, or second round, for sure.  Hopefully will help me for the next ones.
Q. So you never thought about not coming here?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I felt good with the body, so that's important.
