P. KVITOVA/D. Collins
6-7, 7-6, 6-3
Q. Petra, we need to stop doing this.
PETRA KVITOVA: What do you mean?
Q. Another three-set match to start the year for you.  A little bit tricky there.  Can you talk through that?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah.  First match of the season.  I was quite nervous for the match, and through the first set as well.  But I started very well, but I didn't really kept doing what I wanted.  And sure, I had a three set points in the tiebreak in the first set and serving for the set as well and I just didn't make it, which wasn't really easy for mental side.
So the beginning of the second set wasn't really easy in my mind, to be honest.  But, yeah, I was just counting the points, and in the end of the second set she didn't change hands, so it was suddenly on my side.  But then I had a few set points again, tiebreak, and I just didn't make it.  So I was like, okay, no.  Please.  And we played like over two hours those two sets.  So I was like, okay.  Hopefully I can make it until the end.
But, yeah, the second set was good to win, for sure.  And I started pretty (indiscernible) in the third.  I played great, finally after two really tough sets.  And, yeah, the first four games was great.  I wish I can play like this all year.  But I know it's impossible.  But that's the way I wanted to play, for sure.  She came back again, but luckily I was able to hold the serve in the end, and yeah.  I am very proud that I was able to win after three hours and after tricky points.  Yeah, good to be in the second round.
Q. Physically how did you feel first match to play that long out there?  Were you having problems at all in the second set?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, I didn't, actually.  So I was fine.  And in the end of the match I felt a little bit heavier.  But wasn't really that bad.  It's probably as I expected.  But I had it in my mind that I had a great preseason, so I had a lot of hours under my belt to kind of be building on.  So happy for that.  And that's what I was actually telling myself, that I'm still able to do that, and I didn't have any cramps or something.  So great.
Q. And you play Kontaveit next.  She's obviously playing very well, much more of a consistent Top 20 player, Top 25.  So what's the biggest challenge there?
PETRA KVITOVA: We played a few times, I think three times last year, which is a lot.  I played her in Montreal, which was great match for my side.  I need to watch it a little bit to see.  But in the beginning of the season, everyone is prepared.  Maybe she will play something new, but overall probably very similar.
She is Top 20 player, as you said, very consistent.  So she's going to not do anything for free tomorrow.  So I need to be ready for that.  Hopefully physically I will be fine and it will be a great match, I think.
Q. Is there anything that you can do during the preseason or in practice that can replicate this situation of you just played three hours, in the heat and you need to recover for a match the next day?  Are there things you can do in the practice sessions?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think you can, but you're never going to have those nerves which you have in the match.  I think that's the main case for us to be very tight and the nerves are just working and the body is not recovering that well afterwards.  But I think in the preseason you can do things the same and you wouldn't be ready next day if you do great, message and physios and that stuff.  But the nerves, yeah, I don't think you can really practice that.
