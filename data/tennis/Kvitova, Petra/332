P. KVITOVA/S. Stosur
  7-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Sam just had a press conference and said the difference between the two of you was that you played the big points better. Was it as simple as that?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yes, I was focused on each point, mainly on the big point. Yeah, each game was very close. Yeah, maybe. 

 Q. What was your game plan?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I had to play hard and fast for Sam because she has a big forehand and big serve. 

 Q. How did you handle the center court crowd? Did you enjoy it?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course I did. I like this court and this crowd. Unfortunately, it was against me. But still it was nice. 

 Q. Do you think the crowd can work for you as much as against you? There's that much expectation on the hometown player. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't think so. I think some likes also this crowd, so it was not just -- no, I don't think so. 

 Q. Australia has been good to you: Hobart, Brisbane, Melbourne. What do you think about that?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's nice country here (laughter). 

 Q. Can you win here? How far can you go? 
 PETRA KVITOVA: We'll see. 

 Q. You play Pennetta next. Have you played her before and what are your thoughts on that game?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I played her I think in the Beijing and I won. But match before I lost on the clay. 
 So I think it will be tough match. I have to be focused on each point also. 

 Q. Pennetta before said she was more afraid of your lefty game than with Stosur because she has a better record. She said with you is difficult for her. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: It's good to know (smiling). 

 Q. She beat you in Fed Cup, but you were not at your best there. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Of course, I don't like too much the clay. But what I said after this clay, I won, but it will be tough. 

 Q. You won easily in Beijing or not against Pennetta. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, it was two sets to love. But it was, I don't know, 7-6, 6-4, something like that. It was windy, so it was tough condition for both. So, yeah. 

 Q. What do you expect when you have to play her?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, we will see on Monday. I don't know what I expect. 

 Q. Are you surprised of the results you had since Wimbledon, semifinal there, then all these results, but you're still behind in the rankings? Your game seems to be much better than 28. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Oh, thank you. 
 Yeah, my game is improved. I hope so it will be better and better, yeah. 

 Q. Who is your coach?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Who is? David Kotyza. Fitness coach is Jozef Ivanko.
