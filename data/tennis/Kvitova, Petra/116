P. KVITOVA/K. Mladenovic
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and open it up.  First questions for Petra.
Q. You looked a bit nervous trying to serve it out in the second set.  Was it nerves or was it just the wind?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually I didn't feel nervous, but maybe my body was a bit tired.  But I felt like the wind came stronger and I couldn't hold my serve and I wasn't able to really hit it perfectly as before.  So it was flying everywhere.  And yeah, I made two double faults, I think, and it's difficult to play like on the grass with that when you have it in the mind.  So I was glad that I was able to make it for 6-6, and then the tiebreak you have to really play every point and just wait how everything is going, which a little lucky in the end.  So yeah, it was on my side.
Q. What are your predominant emotions after that match?  Are they relief or are you thrilled to have won the match?  How do you feel?
PETRA KVITOVA: You know, it was a mix of emotion because the match point was lucky.  So I was happy, but on the other side I was like, I'm sorry.  Like overall I'm happy that I won, for sure.  I mean Kiki has great runs this year.  She's very high ranked.  For me it's the second tournament of my comeback it's a good match playing on the grass.  So overall I'm very happy with my performance.
Q. How annoyed would you have been if you had to play a third set at that stage?
PETRA KVITOVA: Luckily I didn't think about.  But then when I came off of the court and I spoke with my coaches, they were like, thank you that we didn't have to stay there for the third one.  So I mean the tiebreak you never really know how everything is going.  You can serve well, but it's then it's about a few returns and it should be the third one.  I'm glad that I didn't play the third one, that I saved something energy for tomorrow.
Q. You've got Lucie tomorrow.  There's just something about your game that just -- why is it that she can never get anywhere near you?
PETRA KVITOVA: I just went from the court and I went to physio room and I saw her there.  And I just started to laugh and she was like, what's happening?  And I said, you think we are not playing many times together, like even on the grass?  She said, yeah, last time here in Birmingham.  You know, it's so weird.  I mean we practice a lot together.  We know each other well from the Fed Cup.  I mean she had a great run and momentum that year.  She's playing well on the grass.  And I'm not sure.  I just think that we know each other well, on the court as well.  And sometimes the score looks a bit easier, but it's not always like that and it's about a few points in the set.  That's how I think it will be tomorrow as well.  And she played great today.  I mean epic match I have to say.  And yeah, it will be interesting tomorrow with a lefty.
Q. A small point, something I noticed which you might have been doing for a long time, but I only observed it today.  On one of your serves you swap hands with the racquet and bounce the ball with your other hand and then swap it back again.  Is that ^ a new thing or have you always done that?
PETRA KVITOVA: I've always done that actually.  I'm always holding the racquet in the right and then I swap back before the serve.
