P. KVITOVA/D. Hantuchova
  6‑0, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You probably couldn't have dreamed of a better start.   First set in 20 minutes. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I was surprised that I played well.   In this condition it's very tough to play.   But, yeah, really I played very well.   I'm happy with the first set. 
Actually, I played second set also, but it was only about time when Daniela played too better.
Yeah, fortunately I make the second set, too. 

Q.   So that's what you think happened?   You were still playing as well as the first set but she found...
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so.   And, you know, on this high level what I played first set, it's not easy to play like all match. 
So it was about the time.   And, yeah, I had some double faults in one game and it was really bad for me, but fortunately I did after.

Q.   Did the wind have any effect on your play?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, I thought that I hate wind, but I played not really bad, so... 
Well, I mean, in the condition like this you have to fight with the wind.   Nobody is ask if it's okay for you or no. 
Q.   I know you say you're not really thinking about the No. 1 ranking, but you're obviously still on track to get in there.   You're in the semifinals now. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I'm still on the track how you said.   But still, it's two matches, and the next one is really tough against Li Na. 
It's still long time, so we will see.

Q.   You lost to her in the French Open, is that right, in your last meeting?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yes.
Q.   So is she really big in your head as a tough opponent?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, actually we play two times already on the clay.   We had the score 1‑1, so we will see.   I don't think so that I am really in head.
She is tough opponent, of course.   She's in top 5, so it will be really‑‑ I think it will be good match for tomorrow. 

Q.   How is the air on your lungs with the asthma?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I have to say not really bad.   I have more problem in the USA than here.   This is not really humid here.   Yeah, when I played this night it wasn't bad.   Good.

Q.   What about the delay?   It was obviously an unusual circumstance for the lights to go out.
                     PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I know.   But it's the same when you are waiting for the match and you have like a not‑before and you have to wait when they finish. 
                 So, I mean, it's normal life.   (Laughter.)

Q.   At least when you're watching a match before you can watch the progress and know when it might end.   This you didn't know. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I know but it was really similar as when they play‑‑ the match before they can play, like they can have a break and then it's tiebreak. 
You never know when you are going.   It was very similar, so nothing.
