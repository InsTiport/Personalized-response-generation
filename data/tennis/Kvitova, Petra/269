  THE MODERATOR:   As you're aware, unfortunately Petra has had to withdraw from the tournament. 
Petra, is there anything you would like to say before we start with the English questions.
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah.   First of all, thank you for coming.   I have to say sorry for presses today.   I wasn't feeling myself, because I find out like ten minutes before press that I am not really healthy with some virus.   So I will find out when I will come tonight to Prostejov and I will find what is really specific. 
Of course I'm really sad to withdraw from the tournament, from the Championships.   It's a great tournament, and it was honor to be here. 
You know, it was very nice to step on the court yesterday and feel how Turkish crowd is support me.   It was something really special to me.   I hope I can come back next year again. 
I mean, yesterday when I played I thought that it's nerves, but normally nerves are gone after first set.   It was actually during all the match, so I thought that it's something wrong.   That's why I have to pulled out. 
I mean, I never withdraw from a tournament.   This first time for me, so I don't really experience this kind of press conferences. 
Yeah, I mean, I don't like to give up, so I'm feeling really disappointing.   I hope that Sam will win some matches for me. 
THE MODERATOR:   Let's keep it fairly short, so just a couple questions in English.

Q.   You were nominated for the Fed Cup.   Do you intend to play, or do you know now whether you will play or not? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I try my best to be ready for the Fed Cup.   It's final at home and I would like to‑‑ I really want to play in front of our crowd, my family and friends, and try to win the Fed Cup title again.
So I will try my best to be ready for the weekend. 

Q.   You have also an exhibition scheduled in Prague with Maria.   Do you know the status of that given your health? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I hope that I can play for sure.   I'm really looking forward to play against Maria or with Maria in that time in Prague.   I'm really looking forward. 
If I can play, I will for sure.

Q.   So you were saying yesterday that your hands were shaking during the match.   With the illness, are you very cold or is your body too hot?   Talk a little bit about how you feel specifically and what the doctor said. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   You know, yesterday I thought that it's nerves how I said, but I was shaking all match and I wasn't feeling very well.   My stomach felt really funny.
After one rally with Agnieszka I couldn't breathe, so that's why maybe it looks so easy and I had a lot of errors then. 
I mean, after that I felt still the stomach not really well.   I had the diarrhea yesterday also in the morning.   I didn't have a fever or something, so that's the symptoms what I had. 

Q.   It's been a tough your for you with viruses.   This is the third or fourth; is that right? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think so. 

Q.   This one seems to be different than the other ones.   It's a stomach virus, is that what they said?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not sure if it's stomach virus, but I find out tonight probably.   I will go to doctor in Prostejov in the hospital and find out. 
But I think it's a lot of things.   I have a sore throat already from this morning.   I know that if I'm not really 100% ready for compete with these girl on this level, I know that I can't play.
That's why I'm withdrawing.
