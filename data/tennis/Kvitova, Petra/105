P. KVITOVA/Kr. Pliskova
6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel about how you played today?
PETRA KVITOVA: I felt okay.  It's always tricky to play Czech girl.  We never play each other.  She is a lefty.  She can be very dangerous.  That's what I was prepared for that.  She has a big serve.  I just needed to wait for the chance to break her.
I didn't take it for the first time in the second set, and it was pretty tight.  I was pretty lucky that I did it in the end.  But, yeah, she can really hit it hard.  That's what made me troubles.
Q. Because there are two Pliskovas, you are very familiar with the two sisters, how do you distinguish the two?
PETRA KVITOVA: I find the differences between them for sure on the court.  One is a lefty, one is a righty.  But I do recognize them in face, as well.
Q. I want to ask you, you met Li Na in Wuhan.  Can you describe to me what happened during the meeting.
PETRA KVITOVA: I had breakfast which I was the last day I been there.  She looks very nice actually.  She said she tried to lose some weight.  I saw her husband as well and kids.  It was very, very cute to see all the family.
Q. You always had good results in China.  You won two titles last year in Wuhan and Zhuhai.  You didn't do well in Wuhan this year.  Does that give you more motivation to get better in Beijing?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I always do have motivation.  Of course, as you said, I'm playing well in the China.  But so far was a pretty tough match in the Wuhan.  I'm very proud of it because I never played that long.  Even I lost, I think was a big fight.
And, yeah, sure I do have motivation to play here.  You never know, the draw, it's very tough.  The field is amazing.  I'm just taking match by match.  I'm happy that I get through to the second round now.
