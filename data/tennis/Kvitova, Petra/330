 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You are a very exciting player to watch. What do you expect of yourself?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't know what I expect, but I just want to try play my game and improve in everything. So just we'll see. 

 Q. Do you want to be in the top five in the next two years?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Who doesn't want? 
 Well, of course, I want. But it's hard way. Top five is only five girls, so it's tough. 

 Q. Was it nervous start for you today? Were you nervous when you went out there? 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't think so it was nervous. But I was little tired. Yeah, it's ten match in the way, so it was tough. 
 Also Vera played very well at the beginning set. I didn't know about me, so... 

 Q. Do you need to play more big matches? Is it just a matter of experience for you to go further? 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course I have to. But also only not big matches, but each match is good for me.

 Q. What do you take from this tournament? 
 PETRA KVITOVA: So, yeah, well, little confidence of course. And I happy that I can play how I played. So I know that I'm on the good way. 

 Q. Did the distraction in the crowd, the 21 gun salute, put you off?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it was strange. But maybe just have to be. No, I don't know.
