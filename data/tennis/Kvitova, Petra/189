C. NAVARRO/P. Kvitova
  6‑3, 4‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You got back into the match, and in the end it seemed very small differences.   What do you think made the difference in the end?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that I started late like yesterday.   Didn't really play what I wanted.   Actually maybe yes but not into the court but it's always big trouble.
Yeah, and the third set was very, was just one break.   And in one game I had a chance to break her, but unfortunately I didn't make it.   The game which I lost on the serve, yeah, I did some bad things and she did the right ones. 
So that always is tennis, and it's always about a lot of things, a few points.   And, yeah, she won.

Q.   Were you nervous?   You hit a double fault, and that was right before you got broken.   Was that nerves or... 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not sure.   I think my serve wasn't great as any other shots.   Same as yesterday.   So I really was in trouble all this tournament, and I hope it's going to be better. 
I just don't think that I was nervous, but of course when it's 3‑All, 3‑4 and you know you have to serve to stay in the match it's always make a little bit pressure.
But I used to it and it's nothing new for me.   I didn't really think it was big deal.

Q.   You kind of started in the heat, but I think it probably cooled down some a little bit after.   How was it?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I didn't really feel any difference.   Shades on the court wasn't the best.   I missed challenge a few times.   It's always the same for both of us, for sure.   The shade is always difficult when it's going from sun somewhere.   Sometimes you are playing shots behind yourself, so it's tough sometimes.

Q.   You have had difficult matches with her.   What makes her game tough to deal with?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that Carla is playing different than the other girls, I think, you know, with the backhand slice and she can play on the net, and from the forehand she can put topspin.
Yeah, she has a lot of variation of her game.   Yeah.   I mean, she's not only one on tour, of course, she's playing like this, but yeah, I lost twice already against her, so I hope the next time will be better.

Q.   So many seeds lost today.   Aga, Ana, you, Venus.   The only top 8 seed to win today is Makarova.   Why do you think it is?   Is it difficult to come to Dubai and do so well because of conditions?   What do you think?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't know.   It's tough.   We spend all month in Australia and then we come to practice again.   After a little bit of break we are playing here.   Very tough, tough tournament from the first round we see great opponents.
It's a little bit faster surface, and it's just ‑‑ you know, I think the game is fairly close.   Everybody can play well.   The matches are very open, every match of the draw. 
I don't know if it's surprise, but yeah, that's happen.   It's not first time and last time, so... 

Q.   Are you getting the sense that the gap is closing between the other players?   Is it happening more now than before?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so.   I mean, you know, always like to be top 10, it's always a lot of pressure and everybody really wants to beat them.
I mean, I think like top 50 it's pretty same level, if I can say, but only in the small, important key points it's different. 
Yeah, everybody can beat everyone in the top.   And, yeah, maybe it's nice for the fans that they can see something new and some surprises, but not every time it's nice for us.

Q.   What's next for you?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm playing Doha next week.
