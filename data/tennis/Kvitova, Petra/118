THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You seem to be putting on cream every changeover.  Is that a healing thing for the injury or is it just something you do normally anyway to get a better grip?  Secondly, how important was it for you to have your surgeon in your player's box today?  
PETRA KVITOVA: The cream, when you have sweat hands, it's just drying your hands.  That's just the point of it.  I'm sweating a lot, so that's why I'm using it.  Especially with the scars on my hand, I think it's helping me to keep the racquet stronger than before.  But I was using it before, as well.   
Yeah, it was very nice that he sat in the box for my match.  It was a special one.  I'm really glad that he took the invitation.  He came with his wife to support me here.   
 Q.  You said after your layoff, the first time you picked up a racquet you started thinking about Wimbledon.  What was the experience today your first time back?  
PETRA KVITOVA: It was very special, I have to say.  When we came on the court, I know British crowd, but today I feel a little bit different.  I mean, they scream a little bit more than they normally do.  It was very special for me to feel the energy from the crowd again.  It was through the match all the time.   
So it was beautiful to be back on the court playing my game, on the beautiful Centre Court, of course.  I couldn't wish more.   
 Q.  What about fist pumps during this comeback?  It's been difficult for you to do it with both hands.  Where are you in that?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I don't care where I am.  I'm here.   
I couldn't still do by my left, but that's okay.  I'm using it sometimes.  But then I realize every time that I couldn't do it.  It's weird.  But, I mean, I can get used to this.  I doesn't really have a troubles with it.   
 Q.  With the first service game, did you find yourself nervous?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I did, yes.  I mean, in the warmup I felt okay.  I didn't really expect this start of the match unfortunately, the three double-faults.  That's how it is sometimes.  I just glad that I was able to came back in the first set, and to break her afterwards.  It was a good point that I won my second service game.  It was very important for me.   
 Q.  This morning and going into the match, what were the butterflies like?  What were the nerves like?  Did it feel different, different type of nerves and butterflies than a typical first round at Wimbledon?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yes, it was different.  It was more about the passion probably than about the nerves that I don't really know what will be on the Centre Court.  It feels different from the time I came back actually.   
I feel that my body is not as tired and not as nervous as before, so that's a good sign.  I hope it will stay with me forever until my career finish.   
It's a good point, I think, that I know it's just a match.  Of course, the first rounds are always difficult.  So the nerves are there.  But not that much as before.   
 Q.  Venus was in here earlier and was quite upset talking about the incident she's had to deal with.  I know it's a completely different situation, but dealing with something traumatic like that, then having to focus on tennis, how do people in professional sport do that?  Would you have any suggestion as to how you could focus like that?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think it's difficult, especially in her position.  I mean, every traumatic situation is always tough.  I feel like for womans it's more difficult because we are more sensitive and more emotional than you guys.  So I feel like it's not easy.   
I mean, you still want to be focus on each point what you are playing, but same times you just get upset with something else.  It's just difficult to switch for the tennis again.   
I know that she doesn't really have a good time right now, but I wish her all the best.   
 Q.  What are your expectations from this point on?  You're a bookmaker's favorite.  
PETRA KVITOVA: My expectation is to stand up on Wednesday in the match and just play what I can.  I don't see myself really too ahead.  I'm just here to play every single match what I can.  I'm not really thinking that I'm the favorite of the tournament.  I'm still underground.  Just play what I can.   
 Q.  You finished the season last year very well, making all the finals, winning Wuhan, Zhuhai.  Obviously in the five and a half months, you came back, played very well, winning Birmingham.  Can you connect the form from the end of last year, did that have in I impact on what you're doing the last few weeks, or is it completely different because of the five and a half months?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it's connecting actually.  I feel that the end of the season stayed in my mind.  Then when I started to hit few balls, I was still over there.  So for me the time when I didn't really hit well, it was a difficult time for me to know that I needed time and to get there.  So I was still thinking as I'm in Zhuhai.  It was really difficult.   
But then when I could play finally, I think the mind just stay there.  Then when I play the matches, I think that help me as well, that I did finish the last season very well.
