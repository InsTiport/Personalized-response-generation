P. KVITOVA/I. Begu
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. A lot of very different things about this tournament, obviously.  How difficult is it psychologically to adjust to all these, even the little changes, like the towels, Hawk-Eye, and these things?  Very different from a typical experience, obviously.
PETRA KVITOVA:   Hello, first of all.
Yeah, it's been different, for sure.  And I'm glad that I had a couple of matches before to kind of get used to these new things, which as you mentioned, the towels, it's without a crowd.
Luckily I played one match in the tournament before, Cincinnati.  I played some exhibitions in Prague, as well.  Well, we had to hold our towels, and so I'm kind of player who always going for the towels like many times.
So, yeah, some things which I really had to get used to, to be in the bubble of course, as well.  It's something totally different, which I was normally doing, you know, going out for the coffee, sitting in Central Park.  Suddenly this is not the option.
So that's how it is, and we are all on the same page, so everybody had to get used to.
