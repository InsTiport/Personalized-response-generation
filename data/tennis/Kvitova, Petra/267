A. PAVLYUCHENKOVA/P. Kvitova
  6‑4, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Commiserations.   Tight, tough match.   How did you feel you played today? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, of course it wasn't my best tennis today, and I think that it's the beginning of the season, so I hope that it could be better for sure.
Right now I have still some space what I can improve, and I hope that in Melbourne I will improve the things.   Of course I will try to have more matches before.

Q.   Big disappointment, big blow for you heading towards the slam? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not saying I'm really sad right now.   I had much worse matches before.
I know that I can play better for sure, and I have to practice.   I hope that it's can show in the Australian Open. 

Q.   Did the humidity affect you at all with your asthma and that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I have some troubles with the humidity if it's somewhere, and here it's quite also.   I don't want to say that it's affect me, but of course I have to use the inhalator to help me. 

Q.   So you'll be looking forward to going a bit further south where it's drier and not so humid?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yes.   I hope Sydney and Melbourne will be better for me.

Q.   How many matches do you think you need to have under your belt to go into a Grand Slam confident?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I'm not thinking like this.   Every match what I'm playing it's good for sure.   I'm glad that I play two here.   Of course it could be more, but that's fine. 
I'm going to Sydney, and I hope that I can play some more matches.   I can't say the number. 

Q.   A lot of top seeded players have tumbled out.   The draw was very good here.   Can you explain why that may have happened?   Is it conditions?   Too early in the season?   What is it?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that this tournament was really tough draw and everybody is playing.   After off‑season it's hard to be on the court against some opponent.   I think that it's because the season just start. 

Q.   Will you head straight to Sydney tomorrow? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I didn't speak with my coach about this.   I think we can fly around Thursday.   I'm not sure yet.
