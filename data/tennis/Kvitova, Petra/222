  6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Last year you played a lot of three‑set matches here.   This year you didn't drop a set.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah (smiling).   I will celebrate this one as well.   
No, I'm glad for that, for sure.   Last year I play a lot of three‑setters, not only here.   I'm just glad that I did it without dropping any sets.   I'm just very impressed about that, of course.   
In the end it's important, the last point.   Doesn't matter how long the match is.   I have this beautiful trophy, so it means I won the last point.   That's important for me, I know.   
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about your service game, where it is.   You had 10 double‑faults throughout the entire tournament, dropped three service games.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, that's important.   If I'm missing my serve, it's difficult for me.   I mean, it's one of my best shots.   It's difficult to just be without.   So I'm glad for that.   
Of course, it's important when the important points are coming and I am on the serve.   Sometimes it's just easier to put the first serve, if it's an ace or something like that.   
Yeah, we are working on it all the year.   We starting I don't know how long ago.   But there's a lot of space where I can improve and I'm trying to do.   
My serve was great.   I'm just happy I can show it on the hard courts, as well.   
   
 Q.   You talked yesterday about your friendship with Magdalena.   You said it was going to be difficult.   Was it?   It didn't look it.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   That's nice with Magda, we have a really good relationship.   You know, we were chatting and smiling before the match and straight after.   It's always nice to have a girl like she is on the tour.   
But when we are stepping on the court, they are opponents.   Everybody wants to win.   It was same for both of us today.   
You know, it was the final.   There's no excuse if there's any one friend there or no.   
   
 Q.   Did you notice she was hurting with her right leg?   You seemed to move her around.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, I didn't.   Once I saw her when she didn't catch the ball, that she was just running mostly on the one leg.   So I saw a little bit of that.   But then after the match I was asking her what she did.   She said she has tape on the leg and she has little bit of hamstring problem that she did yesterday during the match.   
It was really a plan.   Of course, it was a plan before the match that I need to make her run.   I didn't really know that she's injured.   
   
 Q.   You did have a little trouble in the first set at the end.   Did you lose your concentration?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   You know, serving 5‑3, I knew I was serving for the set, so it's always little bit difficult.   Yeah, I was a little bit hectic.   It was quite new balls.   A few times where I could push her, but I missed the ball.   
Yeah, I think I lost a little bit my concentration.   But important was I break her for the set.   In the second I was trying to keep my concentration.   
   
 Q.   You didn't play your best tennis after Wimbledon.   You seem to have ramped up now.   Can you explain where your game is heading into the US Open?   Is that your goal, to win the second one?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   It wasn't really great in MontrÃ©al, but I still felt pretty good over there.   It was first tournament after Wimbledon.   
I had a bad loss against Makarova.   But in Cincinnati I struggle a lot.   I didn't really find my confidence.   It was really difficult for me.   
But now, I mean, from the first match what I played here, I think I played really solid game.   Everything what I need, I just did it.   That's important for me going with this into US Open.   I playing Tuesday.   It's a good time to have some time off before my first round.   
Yeah, I mean, that's something what I can enjoy today, this title.   But from tomorrow I have to think about the Grand Slam.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel good about the momentum you're taking into the US Open?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, that's something what I need probably, have some matches before.   I remember when I won my first Wimbledon, I played until fine to Eastbourne.   I hope it's going to be a little bit similar.   Yeah, I know last two years I had great run here, but I didn't have great results in US Open.   
Still, I mean, I hopefully can make it little bit better.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything you can pinpoint as to why you struggled at the Open?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   It's difficult.   I mean, this question I'm hearing many times.   No, I'm just not pretty sure.   It's something what I don't think is really my personality.   New York is pretty crowded.   It's always big show.   A lot of people everywhere.   
I'm more the person who is little bit calm.   I don't know if it's like about that, but for sure if you are on the court, it doesn't matter how is the city and everything there.   
But, yeah, I'm not pretty sure.   Maybe the hard courts are not the best for me.   But still I think sometime hopefully I can do the good result there.   
   
 Q.   With the way you're playing, do you feel you can beat anyone in the world now?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not thinking like that.   I mean, every match is different.   You can't really compare it with the others.   
You know, every opponent is different.   Every match, every day, it's totally different.   I really can't say that.
