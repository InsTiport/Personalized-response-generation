 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You must be very happy. A little up and down. Maybe you were nervous at the end. At the very end you played more aggressive than she did. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I was -- I know that I have three match ball, but when I played, I have served, so I don't know what I playing on the match ball. So I just know now what was. 
 Yeah, I'm very happy. 

 Q. That was the biggest win of your career, you think?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I think so, with Venus Williams. Yeah. 

 Q. Were you disappointed they moved you off of Arthur Ashe, or did it matter to you?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Doesn't matter for me. I think for Dinara was worst. I understand her. She is No. 1. She wanted play on the Ashe Stadium. For me doesn't matter.

 Q. You started off the season winning a title. You had good results. What happened between then and now?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I was, in January before Australian Open, I won Hobart. And after Miami before Fed Cup, I was injury with my ankle. After I was must rest I think two months. And I didn't play Roland Garros, and Wimbledon I was still a little bit injury with ankle. 
 Now in American tour, I was some problem with my breath. We have suspension for asthma. I have asthma in New York. So that's why maybe. 

 Q. You played more aggressive than her. You had many more winners. Was that the plan, to take the risks?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's my play. I want play like this. In second set, I think Dinara play very good, better like me. And it's why she won the second set. 
 And first game in third set, she was make some free double-faults, I think, yeah. 

 Q. So what did you tell yourself going into the tiebreaker?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I just thought that I must each point play very good because Safina play even point. She didn't give it up, so that's why, yeah. I must play every point, so... 

 Q. Your first match point you set up beautifully, had the forehand down the line, missed it. What were you thinking after that?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Didn't remember it, so... I think the first and second match ball I was winner, no, on forehand, and after backhand? I don't know. Third match ball she mistake from my serve, I think. I don't know. 
 Yeah, I'm risk every point. 

 Q. What do you think about Wickmayer?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I know her. I was playing with her in Estoril on the clay. I lost with her. So I don't know. She have very good serve and she play very hard. We will see. I want to play my best tennis and we will see.

 Q. Before you were changed to the other stadium, did they ask you, or were you just told you had to move?
 PETRA KVITOVA: No, just talking with Dinara.

 Q. And she didn't want to move?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know what she wanted. But I think no wanted. 

 Q. But you said okay to it?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, for me. Yeah, doesn't matter for me. I'm not star, so... 

 Q. Maybe now. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know (laughter).
