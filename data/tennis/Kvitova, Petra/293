P. KVITOVA/A. Amanmuradova
  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was it very off‑putting when the rain came near the end? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I wasn't thinking about the rain, that it's come early, soon.   I mean, yeah, it was very close to did match before the rain; unfortunately I didn't. 
But in the end I was lucky, so that's okay. 

Q.   What happened at the start of the game?   You seemed to struggle. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I was nervous.   It was first time for me to be as the defending champion of the Grand Slam.   You know, it was huge honor to come to the Centre Court. 
Of course I would like to make everyone happy, but it's not that easy.   Yeah, it was lot of firsts for me today, but I'm happy that I stayed calm inside and not to be panic in the important points.

Q.   Is it very difficult coming back as the defending champion this year?
PETRA KVITOVA:   It is, for sure.   As I said, it's a huge honor for me.   I'm glad that I won last year and I played and won today.
