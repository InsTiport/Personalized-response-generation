 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What are your thoughts on the way that game went?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I started very well. At the beginning I was better and I played so good like matches before. But then I get little nervous, and in my mind was something I don't know what was it. I was mentally down.   
 Yeah, it wasn't good for me, and I did some easy mistakes. Well, yeah, and then, I don't know, but I'm so happy that I win the first game in the third set, that I break her. Then it was better.   
  
  Q. Why did you become nervous in that second set?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, because I knew that I can be in the semifinal again, and it was in the head.   
  
  Q. Having got through that match, are you confident you can reach the final this year?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah, it was tough match for me. We will see how I will play. But I will try my best and we will see.  
  
  Q. The Williams sisters and Wozniacki are out of Wimbledon now. Does that make the competition a lot more open in the ladies draw?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think so. It's open all the tournaments. Yeah, everybody can win here.   
  
  Q. Do you have any connections with Martina Navratilova, and what do you think about her?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course she was my idol when I was young. I watch her in the TV when she played here and when she won here.   
 But some special connection, no. We can meet, but is nothing special. She said me, Well done, great job, and that's it.   
  
  Q. Why do you think you've been so successful here in the last couple years? What is it about your game that's carried you through to two successive semifinals?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, it's tough to say, but I think that it was my game and my left-handed, it's advantage here for sure. So when I get the better serve it was better for me here.   
 Also my game is fast and my leg is stronger, so I can move on the grass.   
  
  Q. How did reaching the semifinals last year change your life on the court and off the court?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, of course I was very happy after the semifinal. But then I saw that I have to beat everybody who I'm playing, so it wasn't good for me.   
 I lost five matches in the first round in the row, so it was very tough to get back and be on the court and focus on each point.   
 So, well, of course it was bad experiences, but I'm happy that I have it.   
  
  Q. What do you think you'll learn the most from last year that will help you this year?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, of course that I can play on the grass and I can beat everybody who is playing against me and some top players also.  
  
  Q. Do you think inside you can lift the trophy on Saturday?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I'm not thinking about it. I have a next match before me in the semifinal. I will looking forward for sure, and then I will see.  
  
  Q. Your opponent said if she beat you she hoped to make the news in Bulgaria. How will news of your victory here be greeted back in the Czech Republic?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know for sure. You have to ask somebody who is in the Czech Republic.   
  
  Q. Will it be big news? Will you make the main television channels and your name everywhere?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.   
  
  Q. You had some tape on your right leg. Is there any fitness problems?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah. I'm happy that today was better for sure. I had some pills for the pain, so I not saw anything.   
 Yeah, it was something with this. We will see tomorrow how is going.  
  
  Q. What is the injury?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, it's tight in there a little bit, so it's painful. But with the pills it's fine.   
  
  Q. Is it thigh or hamstring?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: It's abductor magnus.   
  
  Q. What was your very first memory of Martina Navratilova?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, it's long time ago. I don't know. When she won here. But I don't know.   
  
  Q. Have you any preference for who you'd like to meet in the semifinal?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: No.  
  
  Q. Have you played both of the girls?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I played against them. With Vikka in Madrid, so we know each other. With Paszek we played, but it's long time ago, two years probably. So we will see.   
  
  Q. Is there a special reason why there are so many good players from your club?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: The club? I think it's big chance in the Czech Republic and everybody wants play there. We have a good boss who can have some money for us. There is many players, good coaches, sparring. There is everything. It's good there.
