P. KVITOVA/F. Pennetta
  3-6, 6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

 Q. You lost the first set and then came back to win the match. Can you tell us how you went in the first set and then how you got back into the game?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I was very nervous in the first set. I thought that it will be fighting, and it was, so I just wanted to try for just focus on each point.
 But all match was very close and very tough.

 Q. Flavia said she's beaten you three times and you won one prior to this, and she thought you improved greatly. Would you agree with this? And where have you improved?
 PETRA KVITOVA: In the match?

 Q. No, overall since your last meeting.
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's can be, and I am happy for that because we are practicing a lot in everything, tennis, fitness, and also mentally.
 So, yeah.

 Q. Did you feel different going into this match to the match against Stosur?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah. When I played against Stosur, I didn't was nervous or something like that, so I just want to enjoy.
 But today I was slowly, and I didn't focus for each point in the first set.
 So, yeah, it was different.

 Q. Why do you think you were more nervous today against a lower-ranked player?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. I don't know why, so...

 Q. Have you had this happen before from a big win going into a next game...
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, sometimes I have this.

 Q. A slower start in the next game?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Uh-huh.

 Q. You can't explain it?
 PETRA KVITOVA: ( No response.)

 Q. You made a lot of mistakes in the first set, and then suddenly something changed. Pennetta had the chance to go 2-0 in the second set. Do you think that was the key moment, because you were able to escape that situation?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, well, when I served, each game was very close. It was deuce or something. But I made the big points also. I improve also my serve and just think about the point and I think around, so...

 Q. Pennetta in the first set had 76% of first serve in. In the third set only 43%, so less than 50%. Did that help you a lot, to find the return, to make points?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course, because I wanted just go to for the point, and from the second serve is easier for me, so...

 Q. You had two games where Pennetta was Love-40, so you had three breakpoints each game. She came back to win each game. Were you worried you weren't going to break?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I didn't know about this, so... I just focus on each point. If I lost these games, I didn't think or nothing.

 Q. Do you think you are playing better here than in Wimbledon? Has something changed, apart from the surface?
 PETRA KVITOVA: It's similar, but I think it's not same because there is grass and here is hard. It's a little bit different, but I feel good, and, yeah.

 Q. There are not many lefty players on the tour. Do you try to use that as an advantage?
 PETRA KVITOVA: If I do what?

 Q. You are a left-handed player. You are No. 1 in the world for lefty players.
 PETRA KVITOVA: Okay.

 Q. Do you try to use that?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course. The left-handed has something good for the serve or something. So, yeah, it's good for us.

 Q. You're stroking your hair. Is that a nervous thing?
 PETRA KVITOVA: No. I just do, so sorry (laughter).

 Q. This is a prior question. How long have you been wearing braces?
 PETRA KVITOVA: How long I have? It's one year and one month, so...

 Q. And for how long more?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I think just only two months.

 Q. How do you think you'll be feeling going into your next match?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah, it will be tough match if Iveta or Vera, from both sides. Iveta is good friends and Vera is No. 2.
 So, yeah, I try my best also.

 Q. Can you play with a bit more freedom, a bit more relaxed?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I hope so.

 Q. Caroline Wozniacki play for Prostejov.
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yes.

 Q. Can you talk about that? Why did you do that?
 PETRA KVITOVA: We were very happy she played with us with the Prostejov. It was a good group, and Caroline was very nice. So it was fun.

 Q. You are very young, so you probably don't know how somebody can feel when they're 30 years old. Francesca Schiavone played 4 hours and 44 minutes. She has to play tomorrow Wozniacki. Do you have the feeling someone who is 30 years old can play another match two days after?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think Francesca is very fit and very good. So I think for her will be no problem or something.

 Q. Who do you see favored in that match? Be honest.
 PETRA KVITOVA: So what I can tell?

 Q. Tell me the truth. What do you think?
 PETRA KVITOVA: It's 50/50 (laughter).

 Q. What will you do over the next day and a half in terms of preparing and relaxing before your next match?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I have to get some massage and treatment from the physios, just lie to bed, because I'm so tired.
 And tomorrow's just practicing once and rest again.

 Q. What did you do yesterday before this match?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yesterday, what I did? Hmm. I had a practice, only one. I'm still resting (smiling).

 Q. Can you shut down your thoughts and not think about tennis?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I can. It's good.

 Q. How do you do that? What do you do?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Some movie or book, yeah.

 Q. What are you reading at the moment?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I read the three parts of the Steig Larsson from the Swedish.
