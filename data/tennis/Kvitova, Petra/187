  P. KVITOVA/I. Begu  6-3, 6-2    THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   Q.  How pleased were you with your performance today?  PETRA KVITOVA: I think it was for sure the best match which I played here so far, so I'm really glad for it.  I'm glad that I didn't forget many things from my game and it's still there. Yeah, I felt better today, for sure.  It's third round which I didn't pass here last year, so I was really motivated by it.  I'm glad I'm through.   Q.  You had a couple of three-setters in the first two rounds.  Are you sort of feeling more comfortable now with each match as it goes on?  PETRA KVITOVA: I hope so.  For sure today was the best.  I will try to still, you know, continue in the good game and trying to be better because, of course, the opponents will be tougher.  Late play in the tournament is always much more harder for us, so I will try it.   Q.  A bit of an offbeat question.  When you're standing there to serve, most of the time on the tennis court you're trying to think of nothing, but when you serve you have a lot of choices to make.  What are you thinking when you stand up to serve?  PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think that the serve is only one shot which you really can do it by yourself, and that's what I'm trying -- I mean, for sure I try to, you know, to think about where I gonna put the ball, which corner of the court and then what she can play from the return. So the first two shots are in the mind if I'm there, as well (smiling).   Q.  Either Bacsinszky or Madison Keys.  Can you just talk about -- those are two very different matchups for you should you play one or the other.  PETRA KVITOVA: I played both of them, actually.  I played Bacsinszky this year in Shenzhen, and I lost.  For sure I think that she's playing really well here.  I think that it suits her game, and I think that she really improved well, so I really have to think what was in Shenzhen and try to play a little bit better than there. I lost Madison this time in Melbourne, as well.  It was good match from both of us, but she just played better.  On the clay I think it's a little bit difficult for her probably than there, but anyway, I think when she is serving and playing her shots, she's still dangerous.
