THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Bad luck.   What's the problem?   How serious is it?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I feel my right leg hamstring.   I started to feel it yesterday morning.   I played quite solid match yesterday, but today was much more worse.   So I hope that I gonna be ready for Wimbledon.

Q.   Have you seen the medics yet?   Have they passed an opinion on it, how serious it might be?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, I hope that it's not that serious that I'm feeling it.   I hope that just some days off will help. 
I don't think it's any strain or something very serious.   I mean, it's really painful, so I really couldn't move but I hope it's gonna be good.

Q.   Have you pulled out of this match to make sure you're ready for Wimbledon?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Was one of the things I was thinking about, definitely.   I mean, probably can take some painkillers and go there and play, but I never know what's happen then.
Wimbledon is starting on Monday, and, yeah, I mean, I need to be ready for there.

Q.   How many days are you going to take off?   Obviously you'll head up to London now, I guess. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   This depends.   I mean, we're going do it one day after every day we were thinking about.   I mean, the plan now is to have two days off and try to play Saturday afternoon very easily.   So I gonna see.

Q.   When did you start feeling the pain? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   When? 

Q.   Yes. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   When I played against Lucie, it was pretty tough match.   And the next morning, yesterday morning, I start to feel my glute.   From there it's going to hamstrings.   So it was yesterday morning.
I still should play the match yesterday, but today was worse.

Q.   How are you feeling?   Are you disappointed?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I mean, it's not very often what happening for me to pull out from a tournament, so for me it's very strange. 
Of course I'm sad about that I couldn't play.   I mean, against Heather, of course, the people came to watch us, and it's really sad news for them and for me, as well, but, I mean, that's how it is.   So how it's important now.

Q.   Would you consider yourself doubtful for Wimbledon at this stage?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I hope not (smiling). 

Q.   Is grass a difficult surface to play on if you do have a strain?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Definitely, yes.   Normally I have some tight glute from the grass when I'm landing from the serve and when I'm still very low with the shots.
But this time it's a little bit more than normal one, so I'm just decided not to play today.

Q.   It's ironic that you should get an injury like that when the weather at Eastbourne is at its best for some years in terms of the tennis, no wind and warm sunshine. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Definitely beautiful weather this year, definitely.   I mean, today was pretty nice, as well.   Yeah, I mean, I can't do anything about.

Q.   If it still feels this sore tomorrow, do you think you can still practice with it, perhaps some limited hitting?
PETRA KVITOVA:   That's what I don't know.   I mean, that's the injury what we can expect anything about, so, yeah, we will check it tomorrow again.   Probably I will definitely have a day off tomorrow, as well.   We'll see. 

Q.   Did you say you're heading to London tomorrow?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Probably, yes. 

Q.   When was the first time you felt something in your hamstring?   Was it just today?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Was yesterday morning.
