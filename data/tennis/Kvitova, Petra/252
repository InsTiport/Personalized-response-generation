  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just seemed to be that she played incredible tennis today. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, she did.   First of all, I think she was really prepared to play.   She certainly knows what she has to play actually. 
In the beginning was pretty tricky for me.   I had chances to break her.   Maybe then would be a different match.   But I didn't do it. 
I mean, she took everything what she could and she played very well. 

Q.   Do you look back at that missed opportunity in game three to break her as the turning point? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think so.   I had like four breakpoints I think in the first two games when she was serving.   She played just really good shots in that moment.   That was turning the match around, I think. 

Q.   I think she was four for five on breakpoints.   She converted on every one she got.   What was going on for you in those games?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, it was quite tough.   She didn't make any mistakes, so it was quite tough for me to play the rallies. 
I was trying to play my game, but it was just for a few games in the beginning of the match.   Unfortunately I couldn't play for a longer time.   It was only one way to try play better, to play my game, but I couldn't.   That was the problem, I think. 

Q.   At a tournament like this, two days before the US Open, is it hard to maintain focus on a tournament like this when you know such a big tournament is coming up?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No.   For me, no.   If I'm still in the tournament, I'm still thinking about the next match and about the day when I playing.   That's not about the US Open here still. 
Now I can thinking about US Open.   But, I don't know, five hours ago I was thinking about the final. 

Q.   Do you feel you put pressure on yourself at all to defend this title?   Was that important to you?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I don't think so.   I mean, I didn't put pressure on me.   Of course, I would like to win.   Yeah, I mean, it was first time for me to defend a title and be in the final.   That's a good sign actually for me. 
I will try to take the positive things from this tournament because it was great matches for me.   I played very well yesterday in third set yesterday against Pavlyuchenkova.   I have to think positive.   Next tournament is coming.

Q.   What do you need to improve going into the US Open?   What can you take from this?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I mean, I can still improve my game, for sure, from the baseline to play more fast and aggressively, to play my game, more winners, going more often for the volleys, for example, and try to have a better serve. 

Q.   What did your coach tell you when he came down?   Do you think it would have made a difference if he came down earlier?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't think so, actually.   He said I should just play my game, but it wasn't really easy for me to play my game.   She play really well.   She put the balls always on the other side, so it was quite tough for me. 
Yeah, I don't think it's big change if he comes earlier. 

Q.   Did she hit the ball particularly well or was she just getting it back in play all the time?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Uhm, I think that she hit well.   I mean, it wasn't just put the ball in the other court.   She played like good placement, quite fast.   So on the other side, if it's slow, exactly on my hand, it would have been much easier for me. 

Q.   She's on an incredible run.   Can you assess her as an up‑and‑coming player?   Is she somebody who can be an elite player in this game?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I can't say like the number when she can show in the ranking.   I think she's very solid player.   She's moving real well and she putted the balls quite fast on the other side. 
I mean, we see how she's playing in this period when she won the titles.   So I can't say the number, but she's dangerous. 

Q.   Is there anything you think you can do to maintain your level, like the way you played yesterday versus today?   Is there anything you're looking to improve, or was it just not your day?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I said already, I have things what I can improve to the next tournament.   I mean, of course, every day is different and every match is different, too.   I played really well in the beginning of the match.   Unfortunately, I didn't take my chances.   That was the thing what I did badly.   So that's it.
