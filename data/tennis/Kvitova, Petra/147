6-0, 6-7, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You tried to fight until the very end, but tell us what wasn't working for you today?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I felt like nothing really work today.  I think I didn't start well the match and I was feeling very tired and my legs were very heavy.
I think she was playing very well from the beginning.  She was very aggressive from the baseline and I just didn't really have the feeling of the ball and of the small steps on the legs.
So I felt just weird.  I didn't really sleep tonight and it's just difficult day today for sure.  It's one of the worst definitely to lost in the Grand Slam.  Of course that I'm very disappointing after today's match.
But I think that I left everything today there.  Unfortunately I didn't really get the beginning of the third set when I lost my service game.  It was really difficult to still fight when she was playing that well.
Q. Any reason why you were feeling so bad today on the court, so tired and everything?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, as I said, I didn't really sleep well.  That's it probably.  I think that the tired is the -- when the body feeling so tight and tired, it's difficult.
Q. She had also beat Karolina in the first round.  Did you catch any of that match at all or speak Karolina about her game or anything?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, I didn't.  With Karolina we never really speak about tennis.  I didn't watch any match but my coach did.  I had the tactic, but unfortunately I wasn't really able to put it there.
Q. Anything that's worrying you, keeping you up at night?
PETRA KVITOVA: No.  (Laughter.)
Q. Just a random night where you couldn't sleep?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah.
Q. Of course you have to focus in the direction of Wimbledon now.  What are your plans for the next Grand Slam?
PETRA KVITOVA: I will practice a lot again.  (Smiling.)  I will playing Eastbourne and Wimbledon this time, as every other year.  For sure I have to be ready for that.
That's my favorite Grand Slam, and I know I can play well there.  That's practice I'm focusing right now on it.
Of course it's difficult to focusing right now, but like in few days I will there hopefully.
Q. You've kind of been consistently in the top 10.  Does it feel weird that your ranking maybe dipped a bit, or do you not really pay attention?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't really.  I mean, I am always speaking about the ranking as a number before the name.  But I need to improve my game, and winning some kind of matches as I lost today is the biggest key for being in top 10 and improving everything.
That's it.  (Smiling.)
