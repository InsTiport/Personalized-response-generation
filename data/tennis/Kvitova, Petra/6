 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tough day at the office.
 PETRA KVITOVA:   My thoughts?  Okay.
 Yeah, it was quite a roller coaster, for sure.  I unfortunately couldn't take the chances to win the first set.  Yeah, I think that was really the key of the match.  Unfortunately I didn't make it.
 I played great second set.  But I think all the games which we played over those two hours were pretty close, was a lot of deuces.  Yeah, she just took it.  She really had a great day today.  She played a good game.
 Of course, it's a little painful and I'm really disappointing about my lost.  I didn't really bring the best tennis today.  It's really hurting.  But I can't really do anything right now.
 Yeah, it's been great to spend some days here in Australia (smiling).
 Q. Do you think this year's unusual preparation for the tournament, do you think that kind of situation affected your preparation?
 PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I don't think so.  I think this match wasn't really about the quarantine or being just practicing differently.  For sure not.
 As I mentioned, I should have take the first set when I was leading a break.  I was really fighting, losing four or five games in the row.  This can't happen to me unfortunately.
 I was pretty dealing with my serve today, especially from one side, it was really difficult to serve.  Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned, I should have won the first set and it would be different story.
