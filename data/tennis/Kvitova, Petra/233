P. KVITOVA/Z. Diyas
      7‑5, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   I just spoke to Marina before, and she said you played her in Cincinnati I think recently and had a very tough three‑set match.   Really looking forward to playing her again.   Can you give me your thoughts on her, looking forward to that game.   And congratulations on your win. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I didn't know who I am playing next one, so now I know it.
    Well, I'm not really preparing for the next match already.   Of course I know Erakovic.   We play if Cincinnati a tough match, three sets as always when I'm playing.
    Yeah, I think she's very talented.   She has a good touch and hands for the shots.   She has a great slice and she can play really well, so I have to be careful.

Q.   You had some success on the clay here at Roland Garros, semifinalist.   Clearly you still prefer the hard courts and obviously the grass. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Definitely I prefer grass, but, I mean, I had a good run 2012 here.   I won in Madrid on the clay, so definitely I know that I can play well on the clay.   So I'm not thinking that the clay is my opponent.
    I will be ready. 

Q.   Are you happy with your preparation, the way you're playing at the moment?   Happy with your performance today? 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so.   I mean, after Rome I had a really good days in Prostejov that I practiced pretty hard on my fitness and tennis as well. 
    So I was ready to play here.   I played a good match today.   I won in two sets, which is important, as first round is always tough for me.   I'm through, so I'm glad for that.
