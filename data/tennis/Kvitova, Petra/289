P. KVITOVA/K. Bondarenko
  6‑4, 5‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Were you expecting such a tough match today?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, except I think, you know, 2010 I played against her and I don't play well.   And I don't like her game. 
So, yeah, I thought it would be tough match for me.   The first round is always really a little bit nervous for me.   So I hope the second round will be better and I'm glad that I won.

Q.   Looking ahead to the second round, what are your thoughts on that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I didn't play against her, so it will be first meeting her.   Yeah, we will see.   I know she's playing really fast and flat shots, so we'll see.

Q.   How are you enjoying your Olympic experience?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I mean, it's great to be here in Wimbledon, to see a little bit different.   Unfortunately I'm not in the Olympic Village, so it's a little bit different. 
But, yeah, I like to be as a team.
