 Q.   Petra, tell us about your year so far.   It started very well, didn't it?   A little disappointed with Melbourne and with Jubilee or not?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, of course.   I mean, as a tennis player, I wanted do always the best and try to be deeper, especially in the Grand Slam.   I'm happy to have a title from this year in Sydney for sure.   Of course, I expect a little bit more from myself in Melbourne.   That hurt me but then I decide it's a tennis and it's always like that and I'm going to try to be getter again and play better tennis.   
Of course, the Dubai was tough that week.   Didn't really play my best tennis.   Wasn't good today.   How I said, it's happening unfortunately, and I try to play better this week here.   
   
 Q.   How do you like the conditions here in Doha?   You've been here three times and slightly windy this week.   How are you training here?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   That's what I wanted to start with, this year is a little bit different from what I remember from the last years, which is the wind was‑‑ I hit yesterday and was really, nothing reallysimilar to tennis.   It was more like badminton, I can say.   But it's fun on the other side.   Still you can't really feel the ball how you want it and it's always the more wind and you have to be ready for it.   
Sometimes it's also difficult maybe if somebody has a little trouble with the body, feeling with this not expectable movement.   So it's difficult.   
On the other side, I think it's getting better a little bit, so that's good.   It's warm here, but it's always nice.   And I feel well here on the court.   It's a little bit slow are than in Dubai.   I saw the draw again, so it's nice.  
   
 Q.   In your lead up to defending your crown at Wimbledon, are you going to be doing anything different this year, changing schedule, anything to your training?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think the year started already and the schedule is pretty similar to the years before.   I don't think I will do anything, any big transition in my schedule to be, to play well on the Grand Slams notonly at Wimbledon, but I always wanted to play great on the big events.   And so we will see how it is going.   Health is important and we see, hopefully will be everything fine.   
   
 Q.   I wanted to ask you, obviously you are a two times Wimbledon champion now.   How do you feel‑‑ what are the main goals you're focusing on in this year?   Is it to win another Grand Slam crown, maybe Wimbledon for a third time?   How realistic do you see the chance to get number one in the world?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I did say I would like to be one day number one, but I didn't say it's going to be this year.   For sure it is still a lot of work.   I'm not really thinking about it now.   I'm just trying to improve my game as I always wanted to do, still enough space to improve.   Good news for my coaches as well.   
Of course, another Grand Slam would be great to win.   I don't mind if it's Wimbledon again.   It's a great event and I always love to be there.   So we'll see.   I mean, of course it took me three years to win another Grand Slam after 2011.   So I know how tough it is to win again, and I try to do everything that is possible and I see how it is going.   
But of course from the last year and the year before, I would like to improve my results in the Grand Slams.   
   
 Q.   You seem to have a better record on the grass courts.   Improving on the hard courts, is that something that you will be looking at as the season progresses?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Of course.   I'm trying to improve on every surface, not only the hard courts.   I mean, I had pretty great events already playing on the hard courts this year when I won at Sydney.   It's still a lot of work to do, of course.   The clay is coming soon, in two months.   
So still I think it's nice to change the surface.   It's not still same in the season.   Yeah, I think I have a quite good game for the hard courts as well.   I'm not saying too much in the clay, because it's a little bit different.   It   always take me some time.   But the hard courts, yeah, I do like them.   I grew up on the hard courts during the winter, so I'm used to and yeah.   
   
 Q.   The draw here this week, it's a very strong field and it's a strong possibility, we don't know, you could be playing Jelena Jankovic in the first round, if she gets through that.   Have you looked closely at the draw and‑‑ no?   Is there anybody out there that you're particularly weary about this week?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I'm not‑‑ I never do that.   I always see my opponent the first round, I know I can possibly play Jelena on the qualifier.   Funny is that I lost to her in the qualifier last year here.   So it's quite tough for the first round if she win.   But I know the field, how you said, it's very tough.   The draw is great.   As always, I have to say it's a big event for us.   I'm just happy that I can be one of them and just play here and it's always‑‑ the center court is beautiful.   It's always nice to try the best and show the fans how trying to play the good tennis.   Yeah, we see.
