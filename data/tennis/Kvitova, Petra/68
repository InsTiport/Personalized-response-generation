K. PLISKOVA/P. Kvitova
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A little bit of a slow start there, but it seemed like after that 4-0 deficit you started to elevate and get back into the match.  What do you think made the difference?  And why do you think you had a slow start?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think the first game of the match was so-so, but then unfortunately I couldn't find a rhythm on the serve.  I made three double faults, which is just not great against player like Karolina is when she's really serving well.
Yeah, I was really fighting for the first game which that came, and suddenly I was feeling much better.  I think I was hitting the balls better than before, and I really tried to get the rhythm, which I got, and it was much better afterwards.
Q. Did you know, going into the match, that you needed to win that match, or the first set was so crucial for you not to be out of the competition, to have a chance?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I lost my two matches before, so I knew if I want to go somewhere I need to win.  But I didn't really think like that.
Q. So you didn't feel like in the second set it was just loose because you knew you were out?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, no.  Not at all.
Q. It looked like you loosened up.
PETRA KVITOVA: I still wanted to win.
Q. I'm sure, but it looked like you loosened up a little bit.
PETRA KVITOVA: No, I think I loosened up but not because I knew that I'm out.
Q. We touched on this a little bit at Roland Garros that that was like a full year since your comeback, but does this actually feel like you have gone full circle?  What will you change because you have won five titles, longest winning streak, you have achieved a lot in this full year back?  Just some thoughts on that and then what you think you'll change for 2019.
PETRA KVITOVA: I think the whole circle already ended this year in Roland Garros, was a year since I came back, so it's gone already.  So I don't really think about it anymore.
What I can change for 2019?  I don't know.  I just need to sit and have a think about.  But there is still a lot of things which I can improve in the game, for sure.  Of course those matches which I played here show something which I need to work on it, and, yeah, we'll see what will happen.
Q. Just in terms of your schedule, because it was quite a hectic schedule this time around, did you plan that because you didn't think you were going to go that deep?
PETRA KVITOVA: Exactly.  Well, since last year when I came back, I just wanted to have some matches.  I started this year not great in Australia, so that's why I asked for the wild card in St. Petersburg, which was great idea afterwards, and then we just kept going, of course some big tournaments which you don't want to skip I need to play.
Yeah, that's how everything end up, but I'm not sitting here and regret something which I did this season, I think.  I think it was great to have so many matches afterwards.  It's the best practice what you can have.  I think I improved a lot of things in those matches which I played.
Q. Did you feel this week that maybe your tank was a bit empty, that the fatigue of the year just settled in, or not at all?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, not really.  I felt it in Asia swing but not here.  I had a great two weeks of preparation.  I was really feeling well physically and mentally, as well.
I still had a lot of positive thoughts in the match still to fight and turn it around, even didn't happen.  But, yeah, I think I was fine, and I still need to be fine because I still have Fed Cup final coming, so...
Q. It's easy to forget that you started the season ranked No. 29.  But can you just talk about, in terms of the season and that you had in the first six months in particular, you know, after that, was it more just a reset?  Was it more physical fatigue from everything that had happened, mental fatigue?  What do you think was the big difference in the second half of the season?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think everything is just connected.  It's tough to say only one thing.  Definitely physically I was pretty empty after everything which I had been through those couple of matches in a row, those huge tournaments, the final of the Madrid, it was just so tiring, and even I just look back and, yeah, I don't know how I did it.  But definitely was physically.
Mentally, of course, I need to really be there for those really tough, tough matches which I played.  It took me some energy, as well.
On the other hand, it boost my confidence, but on the other hand, it's always, you know, so-so and tough to find the balance between everything.
So, yeah, I need to be more, a little bit probably thinking about the scheduling and everything.  But you never know.  Maybe it will be few months when I'm going to lose in the first rounds and then I need to play some tournaments.  It's tough to plan it in tennis.
Q. It's the last year that the WTA Finals are held in Singapore.  What have you enjoyed from the years that you have competed here?
PETRA KVITOVA: I really enjoyed it, actually.  I'm pretty sad it's done here, to be honest.
I just found beautiful beach yesterday in Sentosa, so unfortunately, yeah, it's done here, but it's been great five years here, for sure.  They did great for everything.  It was a big show.  I'm just very glad I could be part of it.
