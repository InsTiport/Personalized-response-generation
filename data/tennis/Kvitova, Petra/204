 P. KVITOVA/J. Gajdosova
  3‑6, 6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You had practiced with her before.   What did you make of her game tonight?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   We play already one match during the Fed Cup week in Ostrava.   It was a little bit different, of course.   I played at home and today it was on her side.  
I think she really play well.   I mean, she is serving very well so it's tough to break her serve.   And then, you know, when maybe she is down she's just playing much more better from the returns.   She's going forward.  
That's what I missed in my game today probably, that I was too much passive and she was making the game.   That's what probably I need to change during the match a little bit.   That's why probably I won the second set and was big fight in the third.  
I'm just glad that my last game and my serve was helpful, that didn't continue in 5‑All.   It was good match.   I mean, long, difficult fight, so that's what I need probably today.   
   
 Q.   I was going to say, coming back from a set down is always pleasing when you can wrap those up.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, for sure.   It was my first three‑set match this year after losing the first set, so I'm glad that I turn it away for my side and then I was able to win it.  
   
 Q.   So, very windy.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   It was windy for sure.   I can't say it was very.   It was the time that wasn't wind over there, but of course the wind came.   It was a little bit different always.   It was still turning around.  
That's how it is for both side.   It's the conditions here.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   So overall since last week do you feel like you're hitting okay?   You're feeling well?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Not really.   I think that I can still improved a lot.   I'm not feeling 100% well with the balls and hitting everything fine.  
So I think that my serve is okay.   That's what I can build it on.  
   
 Q.   But you're not sick?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, no.   I'm not sick.   I'm talking only about the game, not about myself anyway.   
So that's good.   Serve is good.  
   
 Q.   Ground hog day.   You had semifinal last year against Pironkova and you got her again this year.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think it's unusual actually.   It's funny.   We will see how it is going to be.   It's a good revenge of course.   Looking for a first semifinal, it's a good start to the year.   
Pironkova is playing always great here, so it's going to be tough for me.  
   
 Q.   Have you been able to watch her?   She's higher ranked than she was last year.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, no.   Maybe my coach watch her.   I'm not pretty sure.   But I remember something from last year, so I think that it's going to be similar.  
   
 Q.   So the off‑season went pretty well, I would assume.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, Alex, my new fitness coach, came.   It was great preparation for two weeks and something.  
Then we are of course still building on the techniques and the tactics as well.   Yeah, I think was fine.   I did a good job.  
   
 Q.   So you feel like you're running faster?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I hope I am.  
   
 Q.   Very fast?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Am I fast?   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   You tell me.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah.   It's tough to recognize it.   From past I'm probably experienced enough that I'm expecting something and it's not coming.   So now I'm not expecting anything.   I'm just trying to be still there and still working and working.  
It's not magic, so I know that it needs some time to set it up everything together to improve everything.   It's not like two weeks and suddenly I'm runner.  
It's not about that.   I still need to be aggressive.   That's what I think sometimes is missing in my game, for example today.   
So I think it's everything fine.   I mean, I lost some weight.   I'm more fitter.   I'm feeling well.   Nothing bother me really.  
So, yeah.  
   
 Q.   So you're saying aggressive.   You've always been aggressive.   You mean you want that right at the start when you're hitting the ball as fast as you can as hard as you can?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Of course.   But it's of course a lot of risk.   So, yeah, working to still be aggressive but with the spin a little bit so it's not that many unforced errors.   What I didn't show today.  
So I think my coach will be not happy today.   Yeah, I think that when I'm starting to improve my fitness and the movement on the court that I am more able to play more rallies, for example.   Then I don't have to play ore risk.   I can wait for the good point where I can really push opponent.  
That's what I hope to try.   
   
 Q.   Of course you played a lot of matches in your career.   Today you were comfortably leading in the first set, and then she started hitting winner after winner.   All the crowd was behind her and she was one point away from breaking you and serving for the match.   What did you think at that point?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually I didn't know it.   Okay.   So she had the break point?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Oh, did she?   Ah, I served well.   I remember.   
   
 Q.   And you made quite a big scream after that.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Did I?   Okay.   Good.   (Laughter.)   I'm sorry.   It's late, you know, so...  
I don't know.   I mean, it's always tough to break opponents.   I was trying to have a good serve, what I did in the moment.   Luckily she missed it when.   Of course when it's playing the rally it's always difficult.  
Yeah, I felt a little bit that we are playing FedCup today, not really a normal tournament, normal match.   But that's how it is.   I mean, it's very nice that the people are coming to support her.   I heard a little bit of Czech language over there somewhere as well, so it's always nice.   
Of course it's normal that the people are cheering for Jarmila.   I think she deserve it because she played really good match.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about Pliskova.   Seems to be getting better all the time.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Oh, yeah, I think so.   She had great match against Azarenka in Brisbane.   I heard, I didn't see.   It heard it was great.   I think that she still young and needs some experiences.   Of course from last year she won a title.   I don't know if one or two or how many actually.   
   
 Q.   You played her once, right?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I played her once in Wuhan.   She's serving very well.   Doesn't look, but she's playing very aggressively and going for her shots.   
She seems very relaxed on the court, so it's very nice.   I'm glad that we have still young girls coming out, coming up in the rankings.   
Yeah, it's nice that we are still here.   
   
 Q.   So might see her in a couple days, huh?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Possible.   We see.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   So you haven't decided on Fed Cup, Canada?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   We are playing Canada.  
   
 Q.   Yes.   But are you going to play or you haven't decided?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   We are still talking with the captain, so I'm not pretty sure how it's going to be.   We are still chatting about, so we will see.
