P. KVITOVA/C. Garcia
  6‑1, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Yesterday you said that you were getting to be friends with the clay.   Are you dating the clay yet?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Probably no.   I mean, it's still taking some time to getting know each other much well, and then we can dating.   But I think that we going to start dating when it's going to finish the clay season. 
I'm glad that I played better than yesterday for sure.   I mean, I play a little bit aggressiver than yesterday, and that's what I think was the important.   Because if I didn't, I think that she is going to smash me.
I'm glad everything well.   I served well.   The last game was really important, and I made it from 40‑Love.   I'm happy for that for sure.   I didn't expect that I going to play three, four matches here before the tournament, so I'm really glad to still be in. 

Q.   Thinking about clay, your first big result was at the French Open in '08.   What were your thoughts on it then?   Was it a surprise?
PETRA KVITOVA:   You know, that's the tennis.   I think that for sure she had to play well today to beat Barbora.   It's always difficult, especially on the clay when she really can catch everything. 
So I'm not really sure how playing Begu is now, but I think my coach will find out everything for me.   Then you're going to see what's going on tomorrow. 

Q.   It was about Begu, the question.   Did you play with her?   Yes.   And you don't remember.
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't remember, that's why.   I'm still thinking, but no. 

Q.   So it will be a total surprise for you?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Probably, yes.   Of course I will know some things, but from the beginning of the match it's always a little bit difficult when you don't know someone.
You generally don't know what to expect.   But in a few games you normally find out.   Hopefully I will. 

Q.   Like in a relationship.   (Laughter.)
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, you have to find out before you start the relationship.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Can you remember much about the French Open in 2008 when you made the fourth round there? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I do.   I do remember.   I played Begu there or what? 

Q.   No, no. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Okay.   I was still confused.   (Laughter.)
When you ask me dating the clay, from that time I'm a little bit out of control.   (Laughter.)
Yeah, the question was? 

Q.   2008 French Open. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I do remember.   It was my first Grand Slam, so of course I was fighting a lot to be in the main draw that time.   For me, fourth round was really great result. 
I remember the match when I lost to Kanepi in three sets.   It was really good match, but I lost. 
Anyway, I think it was a lot of experiences for me, especially on the clay.   It's nice to know that I can play well on the clay, but it's always taking me some time to know it and to really get used to.
So, yeah, I have nice memories. 

Q.   You stop for a while just to I think get some focus and some rest.   You lose some rhythm I think.   We have Petra back, 100% Petra?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm back.   (Laughter.)   As you see me here.   But I think that, you know, as I was talking about, the clay, I think that's the same with me.   To get back for 100% as I was before, for example the second part of the last year, it's still taking so much practices and everything.
For me I'm happy to be back, so that's the important.   I'm not feeling that empty, the empty I feel before I stop. 
So I'm really appreciating these feelings, because before I wasn't really happy and it was really tough time for me.   I'm glad that I can really enjoy it again. 
For me, every match what I'm playing now is just really good and I'm happy for it.
