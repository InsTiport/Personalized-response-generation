PETRA KVITOVA   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The first set looked pretty straightforward, but I don't think it really was with some of the scores.  What's your take on the match?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think the score looks a little bit different compared to game.  I think I find kind of my game after the second half of the first set actually.  I think in the beginning of the match, we were both, like, kind of finding the rhythm and finding the serve and finding the shots as well, especially on my serve.  I mean, I think sometimes I've been pretty lucky that she missed the return.  I didn't put the first serve in which was kind of tough to play then.  I felt like Julia had kind of troubles with the second serve as well in the beginning of the match.  When I broke her serve, it was a little bit kind of better for me, but was still trying to find good rhythm on the serve which I find afterwards.  Especially on the second set playing with the break in the second from the beginning was a little bit relaxed for sure.  But on the other hand, I know how she's playing even if she's down.  She really went for the shots and for the returns as well.  I'm pretty happy with the game how I played like the first two points in the rallies.   
 Q.  Obviously the other day it was really windy and today it's not so windy.  Is it hard to make that adjustment when you have such variable conditions?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think, for sure, today was much more better for us and for the serves.  It did feel a bit tricky yesterday, but today was much more nicer so we got used to a bit quicker.   
 Q.  Were you pleased with the way you took your chances today?  When you had a chance you took it.  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, for sure, that was kind of the key of the match today, especially from the beginning of the set, which I played good game on the important points and I took on my side.   
 Q.  When you're taking your chances like that, do you feel close to your best when you can take advantage of those?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, sometimes you don't really need to play well, even you take those chances.  That's about the game probably.  Sometimes when you're not playing great and you take those chances it's much more better for the confidence as well.  But I don't think I played bad today for sure.  I was pleased with the game and everything just worked well today.   
 Q.  Do you think it helped at all having to start your tournament and grass court season at such a high level having to play your first match against Konta, obviously Gavrilova is not an easy out, Julia as well?  You've had to kind of be sure to bring some of your best tennis?  
PETRA KVITOVA: That's true, especially in the first round.  Not an easy draw.  Sometimes it's kind of good to have those tougher opponents from the first round.  But I can't see any easy first rounds here.  I feel the field is very strong every year.  It didn't surprise me, some tough first rounds.  Last year was little bit different.  I played qualifier and then I played wildcard, so it was kind of different story.  But still I felt good which I do now as well.  I'm just glad that I was passing Jo and strong performance from the first round.   
 Q.  Do you feel that with these three matches, you haven't dropped a set yet, is the game there?  Are you happy with the grass court game that you're bringing?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I do.  I am happy with the grass game.  I'm not really counting it as finalist, I don't know, like, sad or few games or whatever.  I just always trying to focus how I feel and what I feel on the court and should I make improvements and kind of this stuff.  I'm not really focusing on the score.   
 Q.  You could play Buzarnescu next.  She has the first set of Svitolina.  Could be Svitolina as well.  But I know that you played Mihaela in Prague, three-setter.  What do you make of her kind of rise over the last 12 months?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think she's pretty confident right now.  She's in good form as we see.  Until I met her in Prague final, I didn't really know much about her.  Obviously I heard the name, saw the name doing well in the draw, but I never really pay attention until that time when we play three-setter.  It was a really big fight.  She's a lefty.  Probably she like the grass as well using a lefty serve.  I mean, she's playing with the confidence with nothing to lose.  Like for me she seems to be really relaxed every time she's on the court, off the court.  That's probably her biggest weapon now.
