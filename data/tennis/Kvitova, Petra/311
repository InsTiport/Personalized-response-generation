 Q.   Your thoughts on the match?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, after slow beginning it was fine.   Yeah, I think that I can improve for sure my serve.

 Q.   Did you find it hard to shake her in some of those close ones?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I didn't feel any shakers [sic].   
   
 Q.   How did you find the conditions, the weather?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I know today it will be very warm.   I happy that I played already in the morning.   It wasn't too bad.   
I mean, the windy on the Rod Laver wasn't too bad, so it was fine.  
   
 Q.   But you were happy when you realized you were scheduled for a morning game on such a hot day?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yes, a little bit.  
   
 Q.   It wasn't too tough, the conditions?   You were okay?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, yeah, the condition, I think outside it's much worst when they play on the opening court, so I'm happy that I play on the Rod Laver.
