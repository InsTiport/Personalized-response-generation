 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the winning team. 

 Q. (Through translation.) Petra Kvitova said yesterday she's looking forward to celebrating, and because of the win of the Fed Cup trophy, do you have any idea how you're going to celebrate it tonight? 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Not yet, but I think that we are going to do something. 

 Q. (Through translation.) Second question is: As the first trophy Czech Republic won under the flag without Slovakia. How important is this win for you?
 CAPTAIN PALA: Well, obviously it's very important. I'm glad that we won it, and it's a great feeling. We really want to enjoy it today. 
 I think all the girls and myself and the whole team, you know, it's unbelievable feeling. 

 Q. We have a question for the team captain. Just before, Sharmil Tarpischev said that Czechs basically won because of Kvitova. I mean, she got the two points and her playing not only this match and previous matches in the second part of the season. What do you think was the key to victory in this final against Russia?
 CAPTAIN PALA: Well, I don't want to put it this way. We needed three points, and Petra won two and we needed one more, and I'm glad we managed to make the third one. 
 I think throughout the year and this week we all won it because it has small pieces we have to put together. It worked out. It's a work of the team, and I'm glad that Petra played this year the way she played and didn't lose one match. It's very helpful and she's a great player. 

 Q. (Through translation.) Do you have the anticipation feeling of the team composition from Russia, how predictable were for you the moves made by the Russian captain, both the singles and doubles?
 CAPTAIN PALA: Well, we all expected their changes. It was not really a big surprise for us. 
 So we were quite prepared, but that's why, when you have a strong team and many players, that's what happens. But that wasn't something unexpected. 
 And I think it was wise decisions and it was really obvious who was going to play. I think it was wise decisions, because it was expected. Someone has to win, and that was us today. That's it. 

 Q. (Through translation.) Lucie and Petra, did you get any SMS messages? And if yes, from who now? Maybe from the Czech government? Any other congratulations? 
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: We got, yeah, from the Czech president congratulations and the prime minister. 

 Q. (Through translation.) Maybe friends, relatives?
 LUCIE SAFAROVA: Yeah, a lot of them. 

 Q. (Through translation.) For the captain, your charges, your trainees, they prepared some kind of musical composition. Could you elaborate, what kind of song was it they were singing?
 CAPTAIN PALA: The fans? Oh, the team? The locker room? It's very confidential. 
 No, it's a Czech -- we always listen to the same music, and most of the songs we know and we like to warm us up. We get pumped, and that's the way it is usually in locker room, so we are having fun. That's what you should do when you go out and have fun and do your best. 

 Q. (Through translation.) For Sveta Peschke, your observations on Moscow and your stay and the level of organization on the tie? 
 KVETA PESCHKE: We all know this tournament, and we have been a couple of times here. It was very exciting and wonderful experience for all of us. 
 Yeah, everybody was pretty nice to us. The one thing what we didn't like was our food, actually. Just on the weekend days. But other than that, everything was really nice, and we all appreciate the accommodation given to us and very nice to be very close from the hotel. So it was really good, and we all looking forward to come to the next tournament. 

 Q. (Through translation.) I want to clarify, I meant the song you were singing when you were entering this hall, like you were singing something when you entered the press hall. 
 CAPTAIN PALA: We were saying we won the cup.
