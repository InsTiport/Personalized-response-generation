(Transcribed from WTA recorded audio.)   
 Q.  Pretty perfect start.  How are you feeling?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I feel great.  Of course, I wanted to play yesterday.  Unfortunately, the rain didn't really allowed us.   
For me playing her is always pretty tough.  I played against Yulia already in Indian Wells in a three-setter.  It was a really tough one.  I really expected the same because I know she's playing well on the clay.  But, yeah, it was a good one from my side.   
 Q.  Unusual situation with the rain delay, means you have to play again today.  How do you prepare for that?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I'm playing in the night, so I still do have couple of hours.  I going to leave to hotel, maybe have some food.  I need to be ready for the night again.  It will be tough one.   
 Q.  Facing Sakkari or Kontaveit...  
PETRA KVITOVA: I play Sakkari in Miami, which I played really good game.  But since then I think that she really built some confidence, won a tournament.  I think she likes to play on the clay.  For sure she going to be tough opponent.   
Kontaveit, we just played a final in Stuttgart, which is totally different conditions compared to here.  It will be different.  Of course, we both having the match under our belts already, so it will be interesting to see how we going to handle it.
