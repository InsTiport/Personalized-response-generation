S. WILLIAMS/P. Kvitova
  6‑3, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   If you could have that match again, is there anything you'd do differently?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think, you know, I think it was great match from both of us, and I think that she just serve much better than me.   I think there were some really important points that I could play better.   I think that was the different. 

Q.   On set point at 4‑5 there in the second set really a crucial turning point? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think, you know, she had a big serve again.   The return was to the net, so, I mean, it happened.   It's tennis.   That's it. 

Q.   How has it felt being a Wimbledon champion here?   Has it been difficult, the expectation?   Do you find it a happy or difficult experience?
PETRA KVITOVA:   For me it was difficult first round when I went to Centre Court and played the first round because, you know, it was really big match for opening tournament.   You know exactly when you are playing. 
That was tough for me to be strong mentally because I played badly before, so I didn't felt much better.   Yeah, then I think after the first round was good and I didn't thinking about that I'm defending champion.   I just played every match what I did and I was more relaxed. 

Q.   Did you feel under any pressure in this tournament because of that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Not that much.   I mean, yeah, like the tennis is very open right now, so I didn't feel like I'm big favorite.   You know, I didn't feel the pressure that much. 

Q.   Did you sense that Serena was particularly keen to beat you because you were the defending champion?   In the buildup she made a few comments she was quite looking forward to playing you because you had the title and we got the sense that she's very keen to get it back. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, I didn't thinking about this.   It was just match that I went on the court and not about something else. 

Q.   Do you think she'll win now?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think so. 

Q.   When she's playing this sort of tennis, how would you describe the difficulty in doing anything against her, not just for you but for any of the players?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that I didn't play badly, so I think that she just serve very well.   It's looks like in the last game that I did almost four aces. 
So, yeah, I think this was really the big different.

Q.   How difficult is it for anybody to beat her when she's playing like this?
PETRA KVITOVA:   It is big difficult.

Q.   Impossible?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I can't say impossible.   She's human.   Yeah, I think that's why she's the great champion, because she knows what she needs to play in the important points. 
So I think that it's really tough to beat her. 

Q.   Now that your title is gone, how does it feel?   Obviously you're disappointed. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I have a trophy at home, so I'm still happy for this.   But, yeah, unfortunately I have to leave this tournament in the quarters. 
But, yeah, I know that I have a lot to build on.   I hope I can be stronger and I can improve everything in my game.   I'm looking forward for the Olympics here. 

Q.   You have an excellent left‑handed serve, and it usually works very well against right‑handed players against the backhand.   She seemed to hit her backhand very, very well today.   Is that your impression?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think she expected my serve will come to the backhand because she has a really great return from the forehand.   So it wasn't nice to just have like second serve to the forehand, so it was better for me to go to the backhand. 
Yeah, I think she knows it before.   That's why she could play that like the returns today. 

Q.   Have you traded in your Skoda?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No.   I have a BMW.

Q.   What did you do with the other car?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually it was unlucky, because it's looks like that I can keep it, but it was about the managing.
