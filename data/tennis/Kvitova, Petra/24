M. KEYS/P.Kvitova
3-6, 6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: First question.
Q. Tough match today. Started well. What do you think changed during the match to let her take control of it?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I didn't want to, of course, but, yeah, I think we are playing similar games and it was a little bit in waves, sometimes I play better, then she play better, then she just kept it until the end, which I think in the end I didn't have the serves I wanted, probably. I was doing pretty well, but the serve really didn't help me in the end, which was probably the biggest difference.
Q. In the second set it seemed that you were feeling a little bit of fatigue. Was that because of the humidity today or you were just lacking a little bit of concentration maybe?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I did feel a bit fatigued, but I think the reason I just keep it for myself. Of course, they maybe know (laughing).
Q. The conditions were really tough today, though, I mean, just talk about even though you're under the shade a little bit, they were tough conditions for you both.
PETRA KVITOVA: Definitely it's better to play under the roof, for sure. I mean, it was pretty humid today, but it was the same for both of us, and actually we don't really have a game when we are running side to side, but it was really about the few points, few rallies in the beginning, so that's probably how everything will show afterwards. But the center court, it's great, so we're lucky that we have a roof.
Q. The word surprise is always loaded, but did you feel surprised at sort of the way that she was able to up her level in those second two sets and to do so -- I mean, she stayed with it towards the end.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I wasn't really surprised. I know how Madison can play well, and then she just showed it in the end of the second set and in the third as well. So I had my chances in the third when I came back to break her serve and I lost in the game, so it was a bit difficult mentally in this case. But she was there mentally as well and she was hitting it pretty well and pretty clear, so, yeah.
Q. What do you take out of this tournament? How pleased are you with where your level is at the start of the season?
PETRA KVITOVA: Definitely I'm going to take a lot of positive things, for sure. I think in the beginning of the year it's a good tournament to have and I played great four matches so I'm pretty satisfied with everything how it went. I'm not injured. That's good as well. And I think it was a great prep for Melbourne.
Q. Do you still have more prep in Adelaide? Are you planning on playing Adelaide still?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm going to Adelaide for sure, yeah.
Q. What are you still looking for in Adelaide, in terms of your preparation?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm looking forward for a new place, for sure. It will be nice, I hope so. I heard a lot of great things about it, so I'm really curious how they look like there.
Q. And there's been a lot of talk this week about ATP Cup and maybe WTA will do something similar, WTA Cup. We don't know how soon that would be or if ever or this time of year or whatever, but would you like to see that -- this tournament continue like it is next year or would you like to see some sort of change?
PETRA KVITOVA: I would love to keep this tournament as it is.
Q. There's quite a few players who have, especially on the women's, side hitting partners that they travel with. Osaka has one here with her. You've kind of had the advantage of your coach as your hitting partner. But what do you think about a hitting partner and for you, is it nice to be able to have your coach that can kind of double up as that?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think Jiri is mentioning some using partner pretty often, but I think he's just kidding. But, yeah, I hit a few times here with a hitting partner for the tournament as well. Yeah, I think sometimes it's better to hit with a coach, but sometimes it's nice to hit with someone else as well, not like a player, but like a hitting partner. With the guys it's a little bit different and just going for it. And actually when I'm playing with the boys I'm not really kind of thinking about him. He's just there to play with me. And if I'm playing with a girl, it's always she is practicing as well and so it's a little bit different mentality, so sometimes it's good.
Q. Have you ever considered bringing someone on or have you had someone full-time?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, I never have it.
Q. And why not?
PETRA KVITOVA: And I'm not planning it. Jiri has to hit. He has to still play. He was 17 in ATP ranking, so I still need him to be focusing on it.
Q. And do you -- I know you're smiling, but do you like it that he knows your game so well, because sometimes hitting partners need to be told very specific things about what you need.
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't think with me it's very specific, but pretty easy. I think that sometimes, obviously I'm not playing any points or anything very special with Jiri, so we're for sure having some warmups with me and that's probably -- sometimes just we do have some practices before the matches, but it's nothing really, I don't think it's any problem there.
