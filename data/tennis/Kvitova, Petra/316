P. KVITOVA/A. Radwansk
  7-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Are you happy with your ability to come back in that first set today?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course. You know, in every tournament you need some fighting, and it was -- I mean, it was great for my side. I'm really happy that I won the first set when I was down 1-5. 

 Q. You've got Samantha Stosur up next in the semifinals. Can you talk about that match a little bit, what you expect from it?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, the last time that we played it was in the Australian Open, and the first set was very close. I mean, it will be great match hopefully again for the people and for us.
 We know each other. She's playing a little bit like me, so she has a big serve. I have to be focused on serve and return, for sure. And she had US Open, also. 
 So, I mean, I'm looking forward for a semifinal again.

 Q. What do you remember of your match against her at the Australian Open? Because at the time it was a big upset. Doesn't look like it's a big upset now. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: What I remember? That we played very good tennis, I think. I mean, she was at home, so it was a little bit tougher for her. Maybe she had some pressure on back, but I remember something from the tactics, so we'll see.

 Q. Did you know that Radwanska today needed only one set to qualify to semifinals?
 PETRA KVITOVA: No.

 Q. No? Now you know. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: I think she has to win.

 Q. No, she needed only one set. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Okay. I didn't know it. 

 Q. You played now a few days of the Championships. What do you think about Istanbul as a venue and the atmosphere out on the court?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I mean, I didn't expect that many people would come. And it's very nice to have full stadium and play there and support all the time. You're still hearing your name, and it's very nice to play here. It's great Championships. 

 Q. Is it important for you to have won all three of your matches in the group? Is it good for self-confidence, extra?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I think so. It's much better than if I lost this match, so hopefully it's better.

 Q. The question is if you would know that you are deciding the fate of Zvonareva, would you think about it for a moment or you just play for yourself?
 PETRA KVITOVA: I play only for myself.
