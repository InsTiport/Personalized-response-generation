  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Now Li Na's farewell press conference is holding in Beijing now.   After she announce her statement of retirement, some were asking her a question that if you have a chance to choose one of the players in the tournament as your sister, who you will choose.   She choose you.   Yeah.   Listen to this.   Do you have some comments for that?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   First it's so nice from her that she said my name.   You know, I'm going to miss her so much.   We are good friends, and we had great battles on the court and always had fun in the locker room.   She always make me smile, so it was always very nice to be with her and share these moments with her.  
I don't think that I, only me, am gonna miss her but I think all WTA Tour and the fans.   She's very funny.   I think that you Chinese can be very proud of her.  
   
 Q.   (Off microphone.)  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   (Through translation.)   You mentioned just now you and Li Na are pretty good friends.   Could you please give us some examples?   And after her retirement, Li Na will like usher in a new stage of her life.   Will you still stay in contact with each other?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I can't really share any private conversations, but I mean, it wasn't really big deal.   I mean, we always speak with some small things.   Nothing really big.   
You know, I think we have the same sense of humor, so that's why it was always very nice to speak with her.   After every match we just had a hug.   Doesn't matter who won or lose.   It was always very nice to speak with someone before the match and same straight after.  
So it's not really happening so often, so I'm just glad for that.   I hope that we stay in the touch, for sure.   She's a great girl.   Unfortunately I think for me she gonna stay in China and I'm in Europe.   So it's not gonna be very easy.   But maybe we gonna see if she go to visit some tournament or something.   So it's going to be nice.   
   
 Q.   (Through translation.)   Last year you won the champion of Pan Pacific in Tokyo.   As far as you are concerned, what is the difference between Wuhan and Tokyo?   What attracts you most in Wuhan?   What do you think of your performance in this tournament in Wuhan Open and which place will you get?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   So I think the difference is the country, right?   Wuhan is new tournament.   And I just came yesterday, so I'm not really sure how's it look like here, but I just hit two times already, and the courts are pretty fast, not very slow.   So I hope that this can suit my game.   
It's beautiful, what I have to say.   I mean, the center court is very nice and pretty.   I'm looking forward for the match.   I had just some weeks off after the US Open, so I'm looking forward to the match finally.  
Yeah, I feel confident.   I hope I gonna be healthy, and it's still playing for the Singapore, so I hope that I can make some points.   
   
 Q.   When Kim Clijsters, when she retired she said that when I retire I want something around me, not just trophy but friends and friendship.   And Eugenie Bouchard said going to the tournament she is not going to looking for the friends but for the winning.   We know you are very kind and nice person in the tournament and some other players say that.   What do you think about these questions, friends or winning?   How do you balance that?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that everybody is a little bit different.   So, I mean, it's something you really can't choose in yourself, but I'm the person who same probably as Kim, that I want to have friends, for sure.   
Tennis is beautiful, of course, that I want to win, but it's happening on the court.   So I don't think that off the court you can be normal, have friends and going for dinners with someone and something like that.  
So, yeah, I mean, I'm glad that I have some friends in the locker room when you can chat and smile and everything like that.   It's something what it's my personality, and I'm just happy that I can have them.
