  6‑1, 2‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tough match.   What were your thoughts on it?   What changed in the third set? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think that from the beginning I felt tired a little bit, and it's not nice to go 10:00 p.m. on the court.
Anyway I did a lot mistakes, and I knew that if I will play my solid game and go for the volleys I can win.   But, yeah, I did a lot mistakes, so I think that was the problem.

Q.   You won MontrÃ©al; made the semifinals here.   How much better are you feeling about your US Open chances than you were two weeks ago?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Now I'm a little bit sad so I'm not thinking about the hard court here.   But anyway, it's great result for me to win the MontrÃ©al and be in the semifinal here in Cincinnati.
I hope that give me some confidence for the US Open. 

Q.   Can you talk about her defense and where she might rate now in terms of best defensive players in the WTA?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think that she's moving very well.   For sure side to side she's very good and playing a lot of crosscourts very quick.
Yeah, I think that someone who's playing really aggressive and can play volley is the good game for her.

Q.   A lot of people have compared her game to Caroline's, being more defensive and things.   Are they similar or different?   Can you compare the two?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think Angelique is playing a little bit faster from both sides.   I think that Caroline, yeah, it's great in the defense and can moving very well also. 
Yeah, I think they are very similar, but I think that Angelique is playing faster a little bit. 

Q.   Do you like playing another lefty or does it matter at all?
PETRA KVITOVA:   It doesn't matter for me for sure.   When I'm in the game I didn't think about the lefty.   Yeah, it was okay.   I had different troubles, not the lefty one. 

Q.   You played Li Na a week ago in the final in MontrÃ©al and you played Angelique just now.   Who has the advantage in the final?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that Li Na win.   I think that if she will not as crazy as me today, she can win.
Yeah, I saw her when she played tonight against the Venus, and I think if she will play similar, I think she will have tomorrow going for the volleys.   So we will see. 

Q.   In the second set what advice gave you your coach when he came to the court? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that he said to me that I have to play more cross, and if I will play more cross than before she will have more shorter ball and then I can go for the volleys for the winner.   Yeah.

Q.   And what about the third set? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Because I had the mistakes again, so that's easy.   (Laughter.)

Q.   We saw you get quite frustrated on the court and stuff.   Were you frustrated with tactically what you were trying to decide to do and you thought the tactics were wrong, or because you didn't execute the shot?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that I knew tactics and I knew what I have to play, but my body was not really ready for the shots and for the tactics.
Maybe that's why I was a little bit crazy on the court.   Yeah, I think that it was everything together.   Yeah, it was close but still far away.   (Smiling.) 

Q.   So New Haven?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, we are going tomorrow.

Q.   So still going to play?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I will. 

Q.   What's your favorite thing to do in New York when you're away from tennis?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Shopping.

Q.   Where?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Everywhere.   (Laughter.)   No, I mean, the New York is for me like for tennis, and then if I lose and I have a flight in the night I go shopping and buy some present for my family and for my friends.   That's it what I'm doing there.

Q.   Did you experience anything this week with your asthma or is it significantly better?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think that it wasn't that bad, I mean, about the humid and hot.   It was quite good for me, so I hope that it'll be similar in the New York.
