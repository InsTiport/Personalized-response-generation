THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A tough start. Walk us through how you felt in the match. Are you feeling any better today?
PETRA KVITOVA: It didn't surprise my it was a tough start. Much of these will be tough, so it didn't surprise me at all.
I know how Naomi is playing, how confident she is from the past weeks when she played well in the Asia. So I did expect really tough match.
I think we showed great tennis today. I think I played great, too. She was just better in the breakpoints, in those important points.
I feel a bit tired right now after two and a half. But overall I think I'm pretty pleased with my performance today.
Q. Looking back to the first set tiebreak, you made many mistakes. Did you have any regrets about the tiebreak in the first set?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, not really. I mean, tiebreak is kind of short. Sure, I couldn't miss anything in the tiebreak. Every ball missing is just losing the tiebreak. It did many times.
I'm glad how I handle the beginning of the second set, even I played really bad in the tiebreak. I'm taking positively this time of the match.
Q. You had a few double-faults at some big moments. Was that a disappointment for you today?
PETRA KVITOVA: Definitely. I mean, giving Naomi a free point is always tough, especially in the first set when I had a break. It was a really poor game from myself and my serve.
She was really going for it, and I just wanted to have a good second serve. Sometimes it didn't really paid off as I wished. Yeah, I mean, that's tough.
I served pretty well in the beginning of the match, then I had not great. The second set was really tight. I mean, sometimes I did have games when I served so well, then poor games on my serve. Yeah, I need to work on it for sure.
Q. You said the court was slow for your liking. How much did that play a part in the result?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think I used to the surface. I didn't think I did have any big problems with that today. Maybe just on her second serve, but just from the beginning.
Yeah, sometimes when we don't play that fast, suddenly it's too slow. But it's same from both of us when we are playing pretty aggressive. It was a little bit of surprise.
I think overall I was kind of dealing well with the slow surface today.
Q. The process of this match was similar to the final of the Australian Open. During the match did you get déjà vu moments? Do you think the results of that match influenced you today?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I had one flashback when I lost my serve in the third one. That was the only time when I was like, This is kind of similar to Melbourne. But after it was different. I was like, Okay, this is not the same, I still do have a chance.
Yeah, that was just one flashback.
Q. With the round-robin format, what do you do mentally or tactically to adjust for the next one?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I'm glad I'm taking it pretty easy. I think winning the second set helped me a lot as well in the round-robin format. I mean, I've been in the semifinal and final when I lost some matches, so it's not the end. I'm still here to fight.
Q. Here in Shenzhen the court is totally an indoor court. Do you think players need more time to adapt?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't think so. I mean, from my point I think that we are adapting quicker going from outdoor to indoor than from indoor to outdoor, which is the wind and sun and everything. I think this is little bit easier for us to adapt for the indoor court.
