    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It looked like toward the end you weren't feeling well.   Could you explain what was happening there?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Unfortunately I was lying in the bed yesterday and I had a fever, so I didn't come to site yesterday. 
    Yeah, I mean, my body didn't help me today to move little bit.   So unfortunately I tried to play, tried to fight.   But, yeah, my body wouldn't let me to fight. 

Q.   Is it the same kind of sickness you had in Wimbledon? 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I think it's the same, because I had a blood test to see if it was bacteria and virus and it was virus.   I mean, I didn't have any sore throat or anything like that.   I had just a very high fever. 
    Yeah, is unlucky on the Grand Slam.   I will take it for this year and next year will be better.

Q.   Can you talk about the frustrations in Grand Slams this year. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, that's a life.   It's not only in the tennis.   These challenges, is not always happening.   It's something I hope that can help me and make me a little bit stronger.

Q.   She let you make a lot of mistakes.   She kept the ball in play.   How different would it have been if you felt better?   Would this have been a completely different match, do you think?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I hope so.   I mean, I beat her last week in New Haven.   Unfortunately, I couldn't play really long rallies, like more than three shots in the rallies.   So I try to play my aggressive game, first or second shots, to have a winner. 
    But she moved quite well.   She pushed me to the back.   So, I mean, that was tough for me. 

Q.   Are you going to go back to the doctor?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I have the blood test near my hotel in Manhattan. 

Q.   How disappointing is it to not be able to play?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, it is for sure.   I am disappointing.   I wanted to play better, for sure, today.   Who knows if I win or not. 
    But, yeah, unfortunately it happen.   I have to look forward.
