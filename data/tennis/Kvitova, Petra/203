P. KVITOVA/S. Stosur
      6‑3, 7‑5, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   What are your thoughts on your match as a whole? 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   It's tough to say something about the match.   I mean, it was really up and down.   You know, in the second set she was the better player on the court. 
    I'm just glad, you know, to win it in the third.   I knew how Samantha can play really well.   She play really amazing second set.   I was a little bit worried in the third.   If she continue, is going to be quick one. 
    Yeah, I had some chances, and I did it.   In the end I served well.   It was important. 

Q.   You called the doctor and trainer out.   What was going on there?   Also, how difficult was it to have that 30‑minute break while the roof closed?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I felt a little bit dizzy.   I mean, I'm quite tired already.   A lot of matches in Wuhan and here.   I didn't sleep well, as well.   So it was really difficult today. 
    You know, when we had the 30‑minute break, it's difficult.   I won the first set and I was playing very good.   Then they stopped me. 
    When it's the time off, I'm not pretty sure what I should do.   I wasn't running for 30 minutes.   I was trying to calm down and then have a quick warmup. 
    Yeah, from there I think that Samantha came to the court and she played really much more better than the first set.   She played very aggressively and she served so well, as well.   It was really difficult. 

Q.   Can you talk about how difficult it is to play two weeks in a row, make the finals both weeks, just to keep your energy levels up? 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, it is quite tough.   It's long time what I had this.   I'm glad, of course, to playing final here.   It's a big tournament.   I'm just glad that I played well. 
    But on the other side it's very tiring.   I'm trying to do nothing else except tennis, of course.   I'm just playing tennis and I'm saving my energy for it. 
    But it's not easy.   The days are long sometimes in the hotel.   So, yeah, I'm not doing anything excited anyway (smiling). 

Q.   You mentioned that you felt unwell.   Was that anything to do with the pollution, and in particular with the asthma which you suffer from?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   No.   I mentioned earlier I didn't sleep very well.   I'm long time here already.   It's make me little bit tired. 
    Then, you know, I'm looking forward to go to Europe.   So I'm glad the final match is the last one here, then I can go. 
    But, of course, it's the final and I will do my best over there tomorrow.   We'll see. 

Q.   On that subject, it might interest you to know that the United States have a website which measures air quality.   Today's air quality in Beijing is called 'unhealthy' and recommends that people with respiratory illnesses shouldn't exert themselves outside for more than 30 minutes. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Here we go.   Probably I'm unhealthy (laughter).   And I went there for 2 hours and 20, right?   So I don't know what I will do tomorrow then. 
    No, I mean, my asthma improved already.   I mean, I'm taking medication for five years, so I'm feeling much more better.   I didn't use my Ventolin today anyway. 
    I know that the air is not great here.   Everybody knows it.   For everybody it's same.   So, I mean, we just need to fight with that, as well. 

Q.   If you win the title tomorrow, you will be ranked No. 2.   Have you ever thought about it?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   Not really.   I mean, I read it somewhere yesterday already.   But I was No. 2 already, so I'm not really excited about. 
    But, no, I'm kidding (laughter). 
    I'm not really focusing on the number.   I mean, it's just number before my name.   More important for me are results on the big tournaments and on the Grand Slams, as well. 
    So tomorrow I will play for the title, not for be No. 2. 

Q.   Can you talk about either Maria or Ana who you will play in the final. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I play with Ana in Miami.   It was a really weird match.   I won it in the last point.   But it was really difficult.   I mean, she's playing so well.   She find her form.   She fight hard for Singapore.   So I think she's playing really well.   Her forehand, it's really amazing shot.   That's the weapon. 
    And Maria, it's long time when we played each other.   I know that she's great champion.   She can really fight.   If she doesn't play well, she can still come back and win the match.   So it's going to be difficult with both of them, of course. 

Q.   When you get into those matches against Maria where it might be very tight, does her reputation as being a fighter, somebody who shouts, almost gets in your face across the net, does that play in your head?   Is there an intimidation factor with her for you?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   You know what, in those matches what we played, I really don't think so.   If I'm playing, I'm not really thinking about the opponent.   I know that I'm fighter, as well.   I know that I can come back in the match anyway. 
    You know, when it's really tight, it's just small things to make a difference in the end of the match.   I think in those points she's really great.   Yeah, that's it. 

Q.   Can you compare your 2011 season and this season.   You won the WTA Finals and Wimbledon both.   Is it much better this season?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not really sure.   I mean, 2011 was little bit different story.   I didn't really deal with the pressure after I won Wimbledon. 
    This year I feel more comfortable.   I know what is it around, and I can handle it much more easier probably than that year. 
    Yeah, I'm playing well here.   But still WTA Final is in two weeks.   That's still a long time, so we will see. 

Q.   You said you had some trouble sleeping last night.   You look a little tired.   Do you know why?
    PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't know.   Sometimes it's just those nights when you really can't sleep.   It was just last night.   So I hope that tonight's going to be better, otherwise I'm not sitting here anyway (smiling). 

Q.   The past two weeks are so fantastic for you.   You have played phenomenal tennis.   How will you prepare for tomorrow's match, because whoever the opponent will be it will be tough. 
    PETRA KVITOVA:   It's the first time probably I will need to have some energy back, so I need some massage probably and have good sleep.   That's important. 
    I mean, the opponent, both of them, is going to be very tough.   So anyway I need to be ready for each of them.   I think that it's more about David, that he needs to think about the tactics, then I will try to show it there.
