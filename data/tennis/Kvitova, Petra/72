THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How do you feel physically and mentally coming from Wuhan?
PETRA KVITOVA: Feeling good.  That's important.  It was tough one with Pavlyuchenkova in Wuhan.  But I'm here.  It's different.  It's another chance to play better, maybe to improve some of the things from the last match.
Obviously I do have great memories from here, as well.  Hopefully those will help me.  Will be nice to be back on court and playing.
Q. With previous experiences in Beijing, do you feel your familiarity with the China Open gives you any advantage this year?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I think I didn't miss any year of playing here in Beijing, so definitely I've been here with all the improvements in the tournament.  It was my first Olympics here in Beijing, so I will always have the best memories for that.
Q. Did you see Li Na and her children?
PETRA KVITOVA: I didn't see her, unfortunately.  We had one of the things for the tournament, but it was conflict in the end.  Unfortunately I didn't see her.
Q. Now that we're almost to the end of the season, you look at your 2018, you had two parts of the season.  Your Grand Slams you said you were not thrilled about, but on the WTA Tour you won five titles, played excellent.  Looking at the whole season, what is your analysis of it?  Are you pleased?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm very pleased with the season.  Doesn't matter how I was in the Grand Slam.  You know, when I was trying to come back after the injury, I never imagining to have a season like that.  Not even like the season after.
For me, it's a huge thing which I always very appreciate.  Well, I do have many, many matches played in this season.  That's what I was looking for, so I'm very happy with the season.
Q. Obviously at this point of the season, everybody is getting tired.  It's more challenging to travel and play compared to the start of the season.  Apart from the level of competition here, rankings, prize money, is there anything in China here, the fans or culture, that weigh in your decision that you want to make the commitment to come here every year?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, this is still huge tournament for us.  Of course, we are a bit tired after all season.  On the other hand, it's still lots of things to play about here.  I think it's a big one here.  I mean, everybody is here playing.  I don't see any point not to come here and compete with the best.
Q. You took the train from Wuhan to Beijing.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yes, I took a train.
Q. What is your feeling about this?
PETRA KVITOVA: It was great.  It was something different compared to planes when we are still traveling around the world.  Yeah, it's huge.  It were coming like over 300 kilometers per hour, so it's pretty amazing.  It was a great experience.
We did the same last year, so we knew already what to expect.  But it was great.
