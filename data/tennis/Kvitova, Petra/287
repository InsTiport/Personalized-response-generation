M. KIRILENKO/P. Kvitova
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You mentioned in the mixed zone about Court No. 2 playing very last.   Can you elaborate?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think it's no more grass anymore on the baseline.   I think that the court around the baseline is very bad. 
Yeah, I mean, it's bouncing everywhere from the shots.   It's not really nice. 

Q.   Did that affect the outcome of the match for you?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think it was same for both of us.   So I don't think it was problem only for me.   So, I mean, yeah.   It wasn't the reason that I lost.
