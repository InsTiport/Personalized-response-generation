  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   At this tournament you're a former champion.   Do you think the conditions help your tennis?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Definitely, I think.   This is not typical clay.   When it's the altitude it's flying much more faster.   It suits my game, so that's much better than me.  
   
 Q.   Azarenka is not here; Sharapova just came from winning in Stuttgart; Serena is here obviously.   Who do you think are the biggest three at this tournament right now?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Serena won it two times in the past two years, so I think she's one of the favorite definitely.  
   
 Q.   You have to rate your season so far, what will it be?   Good season?   Better than expected?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I cannot say any number as a percentage, but I thought that I can play better in the beginning of the season.   I didn't play well in the Grand Slam in Australia, so that's a bad thing for me.  
But I took over already thinking about the future.   And, I mean, it's not the best but not the worst, so it's something in the middle.  
   
 Q.   You said earlier that clay is not your favorite surface.   How did you manage to reach your top level here?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   It's difficult.   It's a mentally side, and physically the movement it's totally different to other surfaces.   
So this I think it's tough for me.   I just need to used to.   I had a good practices at home, so I hope it's going to be better.   
   
 Q.   You won Wimbledon couple three years ago.   Are you right now on level to be again slam champion?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, it's already few years, so, I mean, everything changed.   I can't compare my game to what I had in 2011.   
I am feeling good, but still trying to have a good result in the Grand Slam.   But I really can't compare it.
