P. KVITOVA/K. Zakopalova
  6‑0, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Did it play as easy as it looked?   In a few minutes, it was all over.   She was never able to get it together.   She said it was more you than it was her. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I felt the same way.   I think the beginning of the match was pretty close, the first game, and the next game when she was serving.   I think that was the turning point to keep in the first set. 
I was saying to myself, I need to stay focused in the first set and play really well because I know she can come back anytime.   I was ready for it. 
Yeah, I think that I played well, for sure.   I think that she made some mistakes, but I think, yeah, I was the first on the court, yeah. 

Q.   What happened to all the three‑set matches?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Finally (smiling).   Yeah, I remember your question yesterday, so... 
Yeah, I mean, that's helpful, for sure, before tomorrow's final.   I hope that help me to have more time for rest, not be on the court pretty long.   So that's the good thing. 

Q.   She said when you play like this, you can beat anybody.   Did you kind of feel that way when you were out there?
PETRA KVITOVA:   She's so nice.   We are good friends, so that's nice from her. 
I mean, yeah, I play my game finally today.   I play aggressively.   I can improve my serve.   I had some double‑faults again, so I can still improve. 
From the baseline, I felt pretty comfortable.   That's important for me to get this confidence.   Yeah, I hope that I can show it not only one time. 

Q.   When people come into this tournament, they say that's what they want to get, to be able to improve their game going into next week.   Seems like you've done that this week. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think in every tournament like this, I know the first rounds are very tricky, then you are improving a little bit.   I am glad that I am the same. 
I think yesterday fight in the end of the match was very helpful to me.   It was big fight, and we played very well in the third set. 
I hope it's going like this.   I'm looking forward for tomorrow's final. 

Q.   When your dropshots are falling like they were today, is that a sign of your confidence?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I said already I felt pretty confident.   That's means a lot of things. 
I went to the net many times to play some volleys, the dropshots.   I moved quite well today.   That's good to know. 

Q.   You've never defended a title before.   How important is that to be able to get that on your rÃ©sumÃ©?
PETRA KVITOVA:   That's true.   I have one more new motivation then (smiling). 
Of course, I will try my best tomorrow.   I like to play finals.   I don't know yet who I am playing tomorrow, but I will be ready. 

Q.   When you're playing someone who is a good friend like that, is it hard to look up at the scoreboard and see 6‑0, 5‑0 in 45 minutes? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, it was a little bit.   I mean, I'm a little bit sad about Klara.   That's certainly bad score for her. 
Yeah, I mean, on the court we are opponents, but off the court we are good friends.   She was pretty nice.   She said, Good luck in the final and see you in New York.   She's very nice person. 
Yeah, it was very quick for me today, so it was surprise for me, too. 

Q.   Do you ever remember winning a match 6‑Love, 6‑Love?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't think so.

Q.   What about your potential two opponents, Simona and Caroline?   What about their games might give you trouble?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't know.   I don't know how Halep is playing.   I don't think I played her.   I know that she's very good mover, as Caroline.   I can't say who can win tonight.   So that will be surprise for me, too. 
I know Caroline well.   We play in Cincy last week.   It was in three sets, of course (laughter).   So it will be nice to reach in the final against Caroline, but I don't care who I meet tomorrow.

Q.   You played Caroline eight times.   The Cincy match was a close one.   What was it about that one that let her win it?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Unfortunately, I was leading 3‑1 in the third, and I played my game, then I was like more afraid.   I just pushing the ball to the court.   Unfortunately she took the important things, points, tried to play more aggressively.   So that was the difference.
