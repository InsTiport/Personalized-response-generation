S. WILLIAMS/P. Kvitova
  3‑6, 6‑3, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You played really, really well.   Does that somehow take the sting off losing a little bit?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, I think that was one of the best matches in this season for me.   So I'm glad how I played, but of course I'm disappointed that I lose.
I mean, I'm really glad that Serena is No. 1 right now, and I think she deserve it.   I mean, like the difference was in the serve, so I think that that was the key for today.

Q.   You said the difference was in the serve, but do you think in the second set that she played differently a little bit, as well?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I don't think that I played differently.   I mean, it was just one game when I lost my serve, and that was the key of the second set.
The third I had some chances to finish the match.   But anyway, I mean, she came back.

Q.   Does this match give you some confidence moving forward in the season?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I hope so.   It was a really good match from my side, and it was a good fight.   I think it was good tennis for the fans, for the people. 
I mean, for me, of course that I will try to have some good things from the match and to learn the mistakes and the bad things, of course.   I mean, I'm going to Dubai, and of course I will try my best again there.   I hope that, you know, I can still improve everything in my game.

Q.   Last year you were in the same position than Serena.   You were one match away from the No. 1 ranking.   Did you think about it before the match, Okay, this time I'm on the other side, I know how it feels for her, maybe I can take advantage of it?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I think that I wasn't one match out.

Q.   Very close, anyway. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I know.   But anyway, I wasn't thinking about this.   I mean, I just went there and tried my best and to beat her, of course.   I mean, I'm not thinking about if she wins she will be No. 1.
So, I mean, that's different position, and, I mean, I didn't thinking about.

Q.   4‑1.   So you said the serve was the main factor for the fact she was coming back.   Is it the only factor you see?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, of course, it was some rallies where I was fairly close to win it, and then maybe to turn it for me.   But, I mean, anyway, leading 4‑1, I have to serving well and keep serving until the end.

Q.   She seemed very emotional during the match.   I don't know if you could notice, but there was almost tears in her eyes during the match.   Do you notice these things when you're playing her?   Did you notice that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, I didn't think about her.   I was there by myself and thinking about my game.   Maybe she didn't felt quite well.
But anyway, I mean, she played well in the end of the match, so I think that, you know, for her was quite tough to thinking about the No. 1, but she's a champion so she did well. 

Q.   What do you think about her at 31 becoming No. 1?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, you know, she played so well last season.   She won almost everything.
That just took some time to be No. 1 for her and she is right now, and I think that she deserve it, for sure. 

Q.   Just looking at Dubai, the surface there is a bit faster.   Do you think that favors you a bit and you're looking forward to build on this week over there?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I'm first time here, so I really like to play here.   I will be very happy to come back next year.
If Dubai it's a little bit faster, I'm okay.   I mean, we played Fed Cup and it was quite, really fast.   So I think that I can use to quite soon.   Of course my game, it's very aggressively, so I hope that I can play good on it.
