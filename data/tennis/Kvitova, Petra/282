  7‑6, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   With the win in MontrÃ©al, the win here, you're on quite a roll?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think it is unbelievable.   I mean, play three tournaments in a row and win two, it's great for me.   I hope it will continue in the US Open.   
   
 Q.   Is it enough for you to want to come back here and play or do you look at your schedule every year and try to figure things out on a yearly basis?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think the schedule is very similar every year.   We had the Olympics this year.   
But, anyway, I think I will come next year again.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little bit about how grueling that tiebreaker was.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, I don't know.   I mean, I played just point after point.   I didn't think any about the score.   I mean, it was pretty close, a pretty good tiebreak.   I'm really glad that I won it.   
After this, I was really down physically.   I felt like without energy.   So that's why maybe I was seems just walking, no running.   Had a lot of mistakes and then 5‑2 down.   Just play, not thinking about the shots, about the tactics, just put the ball into the court.   
Yeah, then it was 7‑5.   Surprised (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Down 2‑5 you weren't thinking about the score, you were thinking point to point?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Of course, I knew what's the score.   In this score, I mean, the girl who is down, I mean, they just try to hit the balls, have some good shots, have some good serves.   It was good.   
   
 Q.   Maria said at 5‑2 down you weren't hitting the ball as hard as you were in the first set.   Did you change to try to keep the points alive instead of going for winners?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not sure what I said.   I didn't thinking about this.   Yeah, I was just play.   
I don't know if she had a set ball actually, did she?   
   
 Q.   She had one set point.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   5‑2, right?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I hit a return, right?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Okay (laughter).   
So, yeah, sometimes when I knew that it's like nice ball for the winner, I just go for this.   Yeah, I just try to not have that mistakes how I had before.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your overall impressions of this tournament, what you think of this tournament.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I'm here second time.   I enjoy much more than two years ago because I was first round.   I didn't have a lot of time to enjoy New Haven.   
But, anyway, with a great director, it's amazing.   It's very calm here.   You know, it's five minutes from hotel to here, so it's pretty easy for us, for the players.   You can go out to downtown for good dinners.   We had a lot of offers here, so we could choose something we want to do.   So that's great.   
   
 Q.   You said it might be beneficial that you played today and you play Monday.   Mentally do you feel rested to take on another two weeks?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm not thinking right now about this.   I mean, I have to recovery well tomorrow and be ready for first round.   It's always tough.   
Yeah, I'm playing Monday, I can't change it.   So I have to go there and play my best tennis.  
   
 Q.   You didn't drop a set here.   Is there something that you've changed in your hard court game?   Is there something that's working for you now that's allowed you to be so dominant?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I don't think that it's about the sets.   Yeah, I improve definitely.   Like I feel more shots, good moving.   Maybe because that I play lot of matches here, so maybe that's why I'm feeling more like relaxed and confident on the court.
