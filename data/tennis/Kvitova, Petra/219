E. MAKAROVA/P. Kvitova
  6‑4, 1‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Tell us what happened during the match with the rain delays?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, it was difficult.   It's a long time when I had time when I have to wait two times when the rain came out.   Yeah, I felt a little bit like in England today. 
Yeah, I mean, she played well today, for sure.   For me was difficult to really play my game.   It's first tournament after winning Wimbledon, so it's a little bit difficult for me. 
I'm going to work hard again and be ready for Cincy. 

Q.   Some players after victory at Wimbledon, there's some setbacks.   They call it the Wimbledon hangover.   Do you believe in that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No (laughter). 
If you win the Grand Slam, you can see the result after every Grand Slam.   It's not really big success after winning Grand Slam. 
I mean, still this is like matches before the US Open, so I'm still will work hard.   Definitely I'm looking forward for next match.   I will try to be better. 

Q.   You obviously had a great duel with Eugenie Bouchard.   Were you surprised to see her feel the home court pressure and be knocked out before you were?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Not really.   I'm not really surprised.   I mean, she's very good mentally prepared.   I think was a lot of pressure on her I think to play at home.   After this big success, final of Wimbledon, it's never easy. 
For her it's a new situation.   I honestly know what I'm talking about.   I really feel with her.   I know how she's feeling.   So it's not easy, but I think it's something what you never learn, you just have to live it. 
I think she will come back stronger. 

Q.   How has your life changed since winning Wimbledon?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, my life changed already in 2011, not really this year.   It's very similar.   I mean, it's not big difference this year. 

Q.   What was missing today for you?   Your serve?
PETRA KVITOVA:   My serve wasn't really there.   It was just sometimes, what is not really nice.   It helped me sometimes in the important key, like, points.   But it wasn't there all match unfortunately. 
My legs didn't move that well how I needed.   I didn't play that aggressively how I really needed.   She played very well, aggressively.   She was the player who pushed me back little bit.
