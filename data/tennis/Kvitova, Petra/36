6-3, 1-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk through the match a little bit. Seemed like it was difficult to find consistent rhythm for both of you.  
PETRA KVITOVA: I think was such a weird match today. Definitely I couldn't find my rhythm there. I find it for a couple of games, then I lost it.   
I think I started pretty well, was serving pretty well, as well. Suddenly I made some double-faults. Kind of similar scenarios against Naomi. I think overall my game was, like, much better than in my first match, for sure. I just couldn't find the rhythm today.   
Yeah, was just different day, and that's how was it.   
 Q.  Do you feel it was a matter of fatigue? Just the different type of game style that Belinda plays with? She doesn't play with rhythm in the rally.  
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it was, like, everything kind of together. I mean, yeah, I was a bit tired from my first match. Still I felt it just in the beginning of the match. I was then on the good way up.   
Yeah, I think she missed some, she made some winners, she served well, then she was serving a little bit worse. Same kind of as me today. It was really tough to find the rhythm everywhere.   
Definitely she's playing a little bit differently than Naomi. But, yeah, sometimes I thought that I probably played too forward for me, when the surface was a bit slower, suddenly I have too much time to hit it. It's been a bit difficult.   
 Q.  Everyone has the chance to go through in the group. Do you know what you need to do to go through? Is that on your mind?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know the scenarios. To be honest, I don't want to know at all.   
Well, should be my last match of the season. I really do my best there. We'll see what happen.   
 Q.  Talk about the next match, how you'll prepare.  
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, Ash is No. 1. It's always big challenge. I won it two times, she won it two times. I mean, I always like to play Ash. It's something different. She's mixing a lot. We don't always know what she will bring. She has a great slice. Definitely she will use it here, especially on this surface.   
Of course, it's about my game, as well, how I going to handle her serve, her variety of game.   
 Q.  What do you want for tomorrow? Do you want to rest or go on the court?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I want everything. Unfortunately there's only 24 hours. I will need to kind of combine everything.   
But for sure I going to play some tennis tomorrow. I need to serve little bit, get into the rhythm, maybe get used to some slices for the next match. Yeah, I would like to do both, of course.
