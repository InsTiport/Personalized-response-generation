 P. KVITOVA/L. Safarova
  6‑7, 6‑2, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. Do you feel anything changed between the first set that was pretty competitive and the latter two which you dominated?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it was. I think the first set was really very close. We were holding the serves. The tiebreak was pretty close. I think I could do little bit better in the tiebreak, for sure. She was leading 3‑0 very soon, so it was kind of difficult to still be able somehow to get it.   
Anyway, I think in the second set I was trying, still holding my serve. The chance to break her came, which was really good. For the first time I break her serve.   
It's gave me little bit of confidence, as well. I was trying to continue in that. I think I was little bit better player in the second set.   
Of course, in the third, you never know how everything will go. Actually, I was continuing to play the same as in the second set. That was really paying off today.   
   
 Q. Did you just feel like your serve was on? She said she felt you were on target.   
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, the serve was on, for sure. I made some double‑faults again. But I think in the important moments, I really served well.   
I think she served the first set very good actually. I didn't really have a chance to break her.   
Yeah, I think that her serve went little bit not that great as before. That I think was kind of little bit better chance for me to break her. I knew it, little bit, yeah.   
   
 Q. Three titles in four years here. You must feel pretty comfortable.   
PETRA KVITOVA: I do, yeah. It's nice to have it. As I said on the court, it's the first time I defend a title, so it's really great to have these kind of experiences, as well.   
I'm really pleased for it. I didn't really came here with a good kind of confidence and game and everything. But everything turn around. I have it again. So it's great to feel better before the US Open, for sure.   
I'm happy because of the trophy here.   
   
 Q. Do you feel the fans embracing you here? You did beat the American. You beat their sweetheart in Caroline. They still seem to like you.   
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm very pleased. Yeah, I'm happy for it, that's for sure. I know it wasn't the best tournament for them. But I was trying the best what I can.   
But it's nice. Yesterday when I played with Caro, it was full stadium. It was beautiful out there. Today for the final, of course, it was great atmosphere. We felt that, for sure, the support of the people on my side, on Lucie's side. I heard the names, as well.   
It was very nice to play in front of such a great crowd.   
   
 Q. You said you're excited to be more confident. Physically since you're still recovering, do you feel the wear and tear of playing a week?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I feel terrible, but doesn't matter (smiling). I will have a day off tomorrow. I hope I will get one.   
Yeah, was many matches. I didn't spend the time on the court and practice as I spent in the four days. So it was very tiring. I'm happy that I won it.   
Anyway, I didn't really feel the best, but that's counting, as well. I still have a few days to recover. I'm playing Tuesday, so that's the best schedule for me.   
   
 Q. You've had great success here. It hasn't necessarily translated to the US Open. What has to happen for you to break through at the Open?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. I was trying lots of things already. But I just don't find New York as my favorite city, if I can say. It not really suit my personality probably. But still if I'm on the court, I should just play little bit better. It's easy to say.   
I'm little bit struggling with the weather over there. It's going to be humid. I don't feel good out there. But I still kind of had few chances to do well. I beat world No.1 at that time, Dinara Safina, at the US Open. I hope one day everything will set together and hope I will do good over there.   
   
 Q. You said it was difficult playing against a friend today. Is there an advantage to playing against someone you know so well?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Sometimes. On the other side, she knows me as well. It's kind of advantage for both of us. Yeah, we practiced a lot, so we really know the game. She improved a lot. She really served well today, as well. She moved well.   
But it's on both sides, as I said. We know each other well, yeah.   
   
 Q. Are you going to come back next year?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I will (smiling).   
   
 Q. Caroline has been called the Queen of New Haven because she won so many times. Have you kind of taken over her throne now?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I still have to do a lot of work because she has four titles here. But I'm in a good way. But, of course, I know Caroline really likes to play here. She likes the place and everything.   
It's going to be difficult, but I will do my best.
