 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How do you think things went today?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I mean, the match was like -- I don't know, I was a little bit confused in the game. It was fighting with me and with the opponent also, so...  
 Yeah, it is tough for me for the mentally, but I'm happy that I'm through for sure.   
  
  Q. What's the talk in the locker room among the women's players about Serena and her comeback? Are they afraid? Are they amazed by her comeback?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: No. Well, I think that I don't speak with somebody about this, so...  
  
  Q. What do you think?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I mean, for her it's great to be back for sure. She want to be top 10 again and she's playing great. She has confidence. She can be back for sure.   
  
  Q. What is the tape on your left leg for?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah, I had a little bit of tightness there on the hamstring.  
  
  Q. Just recently?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yes.   
  
  Q. What did your coach come out and talk to you about in the first and second sets?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I mean, he talked to me about like just make a little bit steps before the shots and be ready after the serve and after the return, because she played fast.   
 So I had to be ready for this.  
  
  Q. How do you think your body language was today?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Not so great. (Laughter.) Yeah, it was a little bit confused how I said already.   
  
  Q. Have you been doing anything around Cincinnati apart from the tennis?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: What I am doing here?   
  
  Q. Yeah. Just anything fun?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I didn't think about this. I have only tennis now, so maybe when I lose I can speak again about this.   
  
  Q. How did Wimbledon change your life?   
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, for me as a person, I'm not feeling different like before the Wimbledon.  
 But I know people recognize me and everything around me is a little bit different. I have to go for the press, for the All-Access Hour and something like that.  
 But I don't feel any pressure or something.   
  
  Q. You reached your highest ranking this week. Were you excited when you saw the rankings?  
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, of course I am happy for that. But still, I have to improve my game. It's only a number for my name.
