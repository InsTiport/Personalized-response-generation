P. KVITOVA/K. Mladenovic   
7-5, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How is your arm injury doing?  Is it better?  You're not wearing a sleeve today.  
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, it's still same.  I can't say it's better, I can't say it's worst.  I mean, I'm feeling everything on my body.  It's not really surprising.   
We'll see how that will look like tomorrow.  I mean, I really had a tough match today.  Was fast serves flying to me, so we'll see how it's going to be tomorrow.   
 Q.  Can you talk through that first set, how you were able to kind of escape with that one?  What was your mindset afterwards?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, well, afterwards was much better than before.  Yeah, I started pretty slowly.  I mean, I was so tight and nervous.  I don't know why.  Playing on the Court 1 probably again was something really special.   
Yeah, I played really bad game, the first game.  Then she played great.  I mean, she was serving pretty well.  But I try to wait for the chances, which they came in 4-3 already.  But I just couldn't make it.  5-4 she had a setpoint.  Suddenly I took it, it was 5-All.   
Yeah, of course she will help me with some double-faults over there.  On the other hand, it's tightness in the end of the set.  I was probably just a little bit stronger at that time and took 7-5.  From the time I started to feel much better.   
 Q.  Did you think at all about last year's match with Sasnovich?  Is it maybe more out of your system now that you fought through that tough situation?  
PETRA KVITOVA: To be honest, I did.  I didn't want the same result as last year, being back on the Court 1.  So I'm really glad that I turn it on my side this time.  Hopefully that match will be from the last year.   
Yeah, I'm glad I do have now the better memories on the Court 1.   
 Q.  You've mentioned all through the season about having Plan B, kind of adding different ways to win when maybe your A game isn't there.  Today did you feel as though you had to pivot to something like that, or did you just stick with what you were doing?  
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I think I stuck just with the game A.  It's difficult to have a game B on the grass.  If I'm not playing my game, it's really tough to win on the grass.   
I think when the match gets little bit longer, I just play better and better.  I felt much better in the rallies afterwards.  When I put the return in, I just felt maybe it's on my side when we are playing the rallies.   
It wasn't because I just wanted to put it in.  I just probably felt physically better and mentally.  Maybe a little bit pushing today.  That's probably what helped me.  You know, I can't really play long rallies on it.   
 Q.  There have been some reports the courts are playing a bit slower this year.  Do you think that's true?  Is it the same speed?  
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it's pretty similar to last year.  I mean, Aorangi is a little bit faster from what I feel than the main courts.  I just didn't feel it's that slow.   
Of course, if it's faster for me, it's better.  I just really didn't find it that slow.   
 Q.  Do you think in a way being injured, having more cardio, more fitness, less time on the court, could be something that is a positive for you right now?  
PETRA KVITOVA: To be honest, I don't think so.  When I couldn't hit, couldn't hold the racquet, I had to really do something.  I spent lot of hours in the gym, running as well, everything I could do on my fitness level.   
Of course, when you're missing playing tennis, being on a tennis court, running there, it's totally different compared to normal running or jumping.  I'm glad I was back pretty soon, with the movement on the court, seeing the ball clearly and everything.   
Of course that I had to do something, but it's a little bit different compared to tennis.   
 Q.  In the stairwell for us, when we walk up and down, there are photos of former champions.  There's one of you.  I pass it all the time.  
PETRA KVITOVA: Sorry (smiling).   
 Q.  I'm curious, when you walk around the grounds, the locker room, this area, you see out of the corner of your eye a photo of you, the first time you won it or the second time you won it, what, if anything, ever goes through your mind?  
PETRA KVITOVA: To be honest, I saw for the first time today when I was walking to the Court 1.  There are some pictures on the wall, as well.  Yeah, that's me from the first time I won.  I saw it for the first time today.   
Yeah, of course, it's nice knowing that I'm playing well on the grass.  I think it's always giving me some confident, especially before my match.  But always bringing some nice memories of it.
