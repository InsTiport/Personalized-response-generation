7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. How would you judge your comeback?  What were you expecting to see in your game?  And what did you see in your game?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I have to say that I'm kind of surprised how I played, even I lost.  I think it was good fight, and I think in the tiebreak showed that I don't really have matches under my belt.
So otherwise I feel good.  I mean, I didn't really have time to prepare or practice as much as I wanted, but I feel good.  I'm happy that I'm back.
Q. Does it now feel like business as usual?  Do you feel like you're properly back, losses and all?
PETRA KVITOVA: It's weird.  I mean, I'm disappointed, for sure.  I came here to win the matches.  I'm not here to sit and talk with you guys, but -- that's nice, as well, sorry (smiling).
But I really fight.  I mean, after the match, I didn't feel that bad as normally I probably do.  I mean, I'm still happy I'm here and playing.  The fairytale ended.  Now, in upcoming weeks, I think it will be business as usual.  That's what I'm looking forward to, just focusing on the tennis and on the game and everything what I do need to improve to my game.
Q. Just talking about that in terms of the intensity on court and the competition today and your ability to compete, were you surprised even, you know, the double fault, you tossed your racquet, you were mad?
PETRA KVITOVA: I was mad (smiling).
Q. Yeah, you were mad.  That seems like a good thing.  Were you surprised you were able to tap into your competitive instincts so quickly in today's match?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm not sure, my father didn't like it that I throw my racquet, I think.
Well, I mean, I really fighted.  Of course, the match could be longer and I will stay there a couple minutes more.  But unfortunately I didn't.
But still, I think we played two hours.  I did feel a little bit tiring.
I mean, I still do have the motivation inside, which is good.  And of course the throwing racquet show that I'm a bit angry, as well, to me.  A couple of double faults in the tiebreak, it's nothing really nice.  It's something what I need to improve.  But of course, I didn't have that many serves in the practices, so I'm just taking as it is.
We'll try to improve it and to fight again and again and again and forever, and, I don't know how I think it will be.
Q. You did look to me a little bit emotional in that long delay at the end of the first set.  You sort of had your face in your towel.  Was that just an ordinary reaction to dropping the first set?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, not at all.
Q. The long wait?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, not at all.  I lost the first set, but I could win, for sure, but it wasn't about it.  I just need to, you know, think a little bit about something else than just the match, and it was a long break.  So I need to be focusing back to the game.  And, yeah, it was okay.
I mean, then when I started the second set, I was a bit tight.  But with the points was better and better.  I felt better, but not at best.
Q. You received a lot of love and support from the crowd here, cheering you on at Roland Garros.  How did that make you feel?
PETRA KVITOVA: It was great, actually.  The atmosphere on Court 1 was incredible today, I have to say, even for Beth.  It was really amazing.  I mean, it was full and they were cheering loudly.
So made me happy, as well.  It was nice hearing my name through the crowd.
Q. Are you already thinking of selling the shirts at least in Czech Republic?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, we started to think about, because everybody is asking about the T-shirts.
Q. There is a young Czech player here, Marketa, who is doing really, really well, and she spoke very highly about you guys, like the older, middle-age Czech players, like you were idols.  She seemed a pretty gentle person, as well.  What can you tell us about her?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I don't know her that well, actually.  She started to play well, and I had the time off.  I didn't really speak with her that much.  But I know her from when she played the juniors and know that she was playing well and she is playing well here.  A lefty, yeah.
I think she has a good touch.  She has variety of her game.  I hope she can be very good player, which she is already, but she just need to improve that.
Yeah, I think that we as Czech players like her, that she can be one of us soon and to play well.
Q. What was said at the net?  You had a nice moment with Bethanie up there.  Just wondering what she may have said to you and what you said to her.
PETRA KVITOVA: She said it's nice that she's seeing me back on the court and I'm playing well after that time off.  She just wished me good luck, and I did the same to her.
Actually, everyone here is just wishing me good luck and seeing me very happily so it's nice to see them, as well.
Q. What was your goal coming to this event?  Is French Open warmup to you, or you were hoping to achieve something here?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, actually I didn't really have expectations here.  Just came to, you know, open my comeback, kind of.  The mission is completed, which I'm very happy for that, and I'm happy that this all ended.  I just will focus now for grass and for the tennis again.
Q. What's your best memory in Roland Garros?
PETRA KVITOVA: My best memory Roland Garros was when I won the first match, for sure.  It was very emotional, and was nice feeling to be back on the court.
Q. Looking back at this whole experience, what was the thing that you were missing the most?  Like hitting balls, competition, struggling?
PETRA KVITOVA: Struggling, no.  I miss the game, for sure.  To be on the court and to think about the court and think what the opponent likes and what she doesn't like and kind of the thinking about the game.  That's what I missed a lot.  This game which I love from when I was child, that's the main thing.  And of course I missed some kind of faces on the tour, as well.  Some friends in the locker room and people around.
That's what is the best.  And of course the feeling when you win and be on the court.  It's amazing.
Q. You have won twice at Wimbledon.  How important is it for you now to prepare to play there again?
PETRA KVITOVA: You know, coming to Roland Garros was one of the things, which we were preparing for Wimbledon, that we do have a lot of attention here.  And Wimbledon should be much more relaxed afterwards.  I really am looking forward to being there.  It's a really great tournament for me.  I have the best memories which I can have.
I think that, you know, my game still suits on the grass, and I will do my best to be there.  I will really enjoy the time to be there.  We will have a house again in Wimbledon Village and will be similar to other years.
I'm happy that I will not miss Wimbledon this year.  Actually, I hope.
Q. Nothing to do with the hand, but every year when you get to Wimbledon or get to the grass, what's the feeling you get playing on the grass?  What do you feel when you first start playing on the grass again?
PETRA KVITOVA: You know, always as tournaments before, the preparation, I always feel like I'm so slow, because every time I wanted to move, I feel like I'm stuck there and I couldn't do anything.
But to be on the grass again, it will be amazing for me.  I'm glad that it wasn't taken away from me to be there one more time, at least.  I will enjoy much more probably than the other years.
I'm really looking forward for my lefty serve wide from the left, as well (smiling).  Yeah.
Q. Where are you going to do your preparation?  Birmingham, Eastbourne, UK?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I have no idea.  We are waiting how everything will go here, if the hand will be fine and everything.  So now we have to sit down with the team and think about the schedule before the Wimbledon.
