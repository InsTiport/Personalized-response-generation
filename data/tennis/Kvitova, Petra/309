THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Today when Maria had the medical timeout you had your head in a towel.   You obviously were on a massive roll and couldn't make a mistake.   What were you thinking when your head was in the towel?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, I just said to myself that I have to play still same way as before and go for the balls and don't make many mistakes and just be focused.   
Because sometimes timeout is very tough for us, because, you know, when you are play really well and then you have five minutes off, sometimes it's tough to get back and play as before.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you were particularly in the zone today?   She wasn't moving that well obviously, but you were striking the ball so cleanly.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I mean, what I played the first five games was great.   I mean, yeah, from the last match what I played was really big different, and I'm really happy how I played today.   
Hopefully it will be continue like this (smiling.)  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you kind of go into a certain place or certain zone out on the court?   You put on such a different demeanor.   You have your game face of sorts.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I know.   Maria is different player as Carla before.   I have to say that sometimes the outsider have like go and show how she's playing.  
I mean, I play against Maria in the Fed Cup, so I remember some things.   Against Carla I didn't play like two years, so it's already different.   
Yeah, I was really focused and only focused on my game.   
   
 Q.   In matches like the one against Carla where you sort of lose your way, you have a streaky set, how do you pull yourself back into the match mentally?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, actually we had good practices today, and I felt very well.   You know, it's different match, and every match it's really different.   
I mean, maybe I like how Maria is playing, faster, and it's really going, yeah.   
   
 Q.   How important is the Olympics you to this year?   Obviously Grand Slams are the pinnacle of tennis, but the Olympics is a worldwide event.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, for me, it's really important.   I'm looking forward to play Olympics in the London.   I mean, for me it's like fifth Grand Slam, so hopefully I will be ready to play there.   
   
 Q.   How much have you been paying attention to other players' results here so far?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, actually, I don't know who lost and who win, so...  
No, really, for me doesn't care.   I really didn't check who win or something like this.   In the locker room for example, I just ask how she goes and something.
