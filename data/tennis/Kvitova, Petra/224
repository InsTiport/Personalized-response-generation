 P. KVITOVA/B. Zahlavova Strycova
  6‑4, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   She broke you early in that first set.   When you finally broke back to make it 4‑4, not only the momentum swing, but it seemed like it was just all you from there on out.   Did something change at that point?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yes.   I think I was a little bit thinking that I have to really attack every ball, playing a lot of winners to beat her.   It wasn't really true.   
Then when I lost my serve, was still nothing really special.   Just my coach, David, came to me and told me that I have to be a little bit more patient, that it don't have to be only like one shot in the rally.   
So I was trying to play a little bit longer rallies, just wait for the good point that I can really attack her, going forward for the final volleys, for example.   
   
 Q.   You were going for too much at the beginning?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I felt so.   I mean, I was not really sure I could play a lot of rallies with her because I know she's a very good mover.   I know it wasn't easy, our last match in Wimbledon.   
I thought I had to be really prepared physically, mentally.   I wasn't ready from the beginning.   But then I was trying to, you know, get little bit more comfortable on the court then.   
   
 Q.   Being the only seed left in the tournament, does it give you a little more confidence going into the semifinals and finals?   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Uhm, not really.   I mean, yeah, it was lots of upsets the past few days.   But this is tennis, it's the tournament, it's the beauty of our sport.   
I'm not feeling anything.   I'm just feeling well on the court, which is important for me right now.   I will just focus on my next opponent, and that's it.   
   
 Q.   On the point about feeling well on the court, as you just said, are you totally comfortable or are there adjustments you still feel you need to make?   Where is your level of play right at this moment?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   It's difficult (smiling).   
I'm not pretty sure.   I mean, I know that I improved my fitness little bit but I'm still not confident that I can really play rallies little bit longer than normally I did.   I still think I can improve in my head, as well.   
I mean, it's really difficult where the level is.   I can't really compare with Wimbledon.   It was special.   The final was unbelievable for me.   I can't really expect from myself that I will play every match like that.   It was grass.   Now it's hard court.   It's totally different.   
For me it's just important to keep my serve, helping with the serve, of course.   Then the first point, the return is important for me, as well, to get into the rally and just play it.   
I mean, I can't really say where I am just now.   I'm just trying to play one more match again before the US Open.   It's semifinal, so nobody wants to lose.   It's the same with me.   
   
 Q.   At this tournament priorities of a lot of players are, A, getting ready for the US Open and then, B, results.   At what point does that switch for you as you get further on where the result in this tournament becomes your top priority?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   To be honest, I'm not really think it's preparation for the US Open.   If I'm here, I want to play my best tennis and have the great result I can.   
Every match I step on the court, I want to win.   I'm not just thinking it's match to warm up before the US Open.   I can't really think like that.   
   
 Q.   The draw came out today for New York.   Have you seen it at all yet?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   I didn't.   I just know who I'm playing first round and that's it.  
   
 Q.   You don't want to know anything more?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, please (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Your next match here would be Stosur or Flipkens.   Talk about that next round.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   I know both players, of course.   I played with Flip doubles in MontrÃ©al, so we know each other well.   I think I lost to her last two matches.   So if I will play, for sure I'm going to be ready for the revenge.   
She's dangerous player, I think.   I have to say that she has very good slice from the backhand and she can really attack from the forehand and she has a really good serve with the kick, as well.   
Same as Sam actually.   Great serve.   I think it's a little bit similar game of these two girls.   We going to see how it's going to be.   
Is enough for you (smiling)?   
   
 Q.   Is it different when you're playing another Czech player?   You know each other very well.   
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, it is.   But for me, you know, past couple of months, I'm playing lots of Czechs, so I'm just getting used to it probably.   I'm not thinking a lot about that she's Czech.   But, of course, somewhere in the mind it is.   
Emotionally it's not that out as normally should probably.   But it was fine.   I did few times prior to today, so...   
   
 Q.   Is that something that David had to work with you on, as far as playing other Czech players?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   No.   I think I had a really great practice in Wimbledon.   That was really tough mentally.   I think from that time it can be only easier than that.   
Was very difficult for me in the Wimbledon when I had the first round Andrea and then quarterfinal and semifinal with Czech girls.   More pressure than I have on me, more than normally.   
   
 Q.   Having won this tournament before, other than leading up to the Open, does it have any sentimental meaning for you?  
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, for sure.   I'm glad to be just back.   It's just beautiful.   We have great hotel.   Close to site.   Center court is beautiful.   Lots of people are coming to watch us.   I really can't wish anything more.
