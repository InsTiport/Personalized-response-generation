P. KVITOVA/L. Safarova
  7‑6, 5‑7, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Took you until the third set to really break away from her.   Talk a little bit about the match. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I knew that it's gonna be tough match.   Always when you are playing with a friend, it's tough on the nerves. 
I know she's playing very well, aggressively, as me.   She has a good serve, with a lefty, which is always tricky, so I know how the opponents are feeling if they are playing against me, so that's not very nice.
Yeah, she served well.   It was really tough to return.   I really need some games to get used to and put some returns into the court.
Yeah, I was coming back every time in every set to win the first, and in the third I felt like Lucie was a little bit tired already.   So I took my chance to win it.

Q.   Did you feel you served well?   I think you had like 15 aces. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I served well, yes.   I had one window when I did some double faults, unfortunately, but I think that ‑‑ I did not see the percentage of the first serve, but with the aces I'm really glad.
Yeah, I mean, I have to use my lefty more. 

Q.   Just talk a little bit about your quarterfinal. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I know I'm playing Jelena.   We played last time in Beijing when she won in the third set, and, yeah, I know she's in very good form.   She's in the top 10 again.   I know that she's working very hard.
She has a great backhand down the line, so that's I think is the biggest shot of her, and I will try to keep my confidence up and try to win.
