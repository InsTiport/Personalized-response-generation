P. KVITOVA/A. Pavlyuchenkova
  2‑6, 6‑2, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You started off slowly again today.   Did the rain have something to do with that?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Again?   I start really slowly again (smiling)? 
I don't think that, like, the rain delay was help for anyone on the court.   I mean, it was pretty close.   I was leading in the second set.   The third set was pretty close, very tough games in the beginning.   It was until the end. 
I don't think the rain was certainly a big problem.

Q.   Even though obviously everyone would love to win quickly and stay fresh, is it a good thing to have tournaments like this where you face some adversity?   Is that good once in a while to have?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think so.   These matches are important, too, for us to fight until the end if you are not playing well.   That's about tennis, too. 
Of course, we are preferring playing shorter matches just in the two sets, for example.   But, yeah, I mean, I don't care, I won the last point, and that's the important thing.

Q.   You have played 29 three‑set matches this year, which is the most of any top‑100 player.   What do you think the reason for that is?
PETRA KVITOVA:   The reason?   I don't know.   I mean, my season so far and my matches are up and down this year.   So maybe that's why. 

Q.   When you get into a third set, you've put in the work, do you like your chances of being able to win the match?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think I know I'm playing a lot of three‑set matches, that's why I probably know if I lose the first set, still I can go to the third.   I can find good thing on the three‑set matches, too. 
I don't feeling like without energy in the third set, so that's good sign, too. 

Q.   Seems like you were not able to get into a rhythm serving for a large part of the match.   Is that the way you were returning?   Was it difficult to get your serve going?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I think she's returning pretty well, pretty deep, from the second serves, from the first sometimes, too.   I think it's tough for us to play the next shot, the next ball after the return, because it's very deep, long to the body.   That's quite tough. 
She return very well, I think so.   I think that's why we lost some serving today. 

Q.   You struggled with your serve in the first set.   Are you able to, as you're going along, figure out in your own mind what you might be doing wrong and correct that while you're playing?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I'm trying, of course.   From the beginning, it wasn't good.   I had many double‑faults.   That's why probably it was not that easy, the first set, for sure. 
I knew that I have to change something with my serve, to maybe put more first serves in just to get the rhythm, play more percentage.   That was better and better.   I think in the third set, in the end of the third set, was my best serve today, for sure. 

Q.   It was 6‑5.   Could have gone to a tiebreaker.   How important was it to win without playing a tiebreaker?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I was okay.   I had a match point at 5‑4, but she served very well.   It was the first ball that I was quite sad because it was pretty close to end the match. 
But then was pretty tough game in the 5‑All.   I think was good rally from my side when I put the winner.   It was very important to keep winning or leading 6‑5 in the third. 
I was okay to thinking about the tiebreak.   I was still in that game the at 6‑5.   I was down 40‑15, I think, still a chance to break her, what I did in the end.   But I was ready for the tiebreak, too. 

Q.   Were you in the building when the fire alarm went off?   Can you describe what happened in the players' lounge. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, we were actually laughing because the outside was raining cats and dogs, and then was fire alarm.   I think that was really like easy for us to laugh. 

Q.   They said it was somebody cooking food in there.   Do you know what was going on?
PETRA KVITOVA:   No, we didn't know anything.   Was just surprise for us to get out.   But it was okay when we were waiting for the match, some fun (laughter). 

Q.   You weren't the one causing the alarm?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I wasn't cooking, so that's good (laughter). 

Q.   What is it like when you come back to a tournament that you have won?   Does it have a different feel to it when you've already won a tournament?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, I think if you are coming back when you played very well the last year, you have a lot of emotions, that you know the pressure is there, that you are the defending champion, there's lots of points.   But on the other side, you know that you can play well here, that you have nice memories. 
The court, the center court, the crowd, everything, I think it's a little bit mess.   But for me it's nice to be back, for sure.   I have nice memories from the last year.   I played really good tennis last year here.   So for me it's good.
