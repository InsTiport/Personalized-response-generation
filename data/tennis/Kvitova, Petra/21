P. KVITOVA/P. Badosa
7-5, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How difficult was the wind out there today?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, today was everything together, very difficult. Yeah, definitely the wind was, you know, hitting side to side or you never know and which side it's coming.
So, yeah, it was a bit different and very difficult.
Q. The end of that second set when she had the set point, that pass was very close. Small margins between going three sets and winning.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, that's true. I was lucky at that time, for sure. Maybe it was kind of not, like, a gift because I was trying to go forward and, you know, she was under the pressure to pass me. Yeah, I was lucky it was little out, yeah.
Q. So how are you feeling about your game in general? Two solid wins.
PETRA KVITOVA: I mean, for sure I felt much better in the first one. Today was really about the nerves, about the wind, about the opponent. I really wasn't playing probably my game which I wanted to play. I was struggling with the serve a little bit sometimes.
Yeah, I was down 4-2, but I was managing to win it somehow. Three set points in the second set.
But I think in the end of the day I think this match is kind of important to have, for sure. In the first one I really played well. It was just, you know, played really good.
Today was up and down. I was dealing with many things. I think on the other side it's good to have this one.
Q. Did you ask to play early?
PETRA KVITOVA: I didn't ask to play early.
Q. You play at 11:00 a lot.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's not that early, actually, I think. 11:00 is still good (smiling).
Q. In your service routine when you're getting ready to serve, you pat your ball on the other side of the racquet and then you get ready. How long have you done that? When did you first start doing that?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I started even few years ago, because still I was with David Kotyza, and he kind of teach me that I should have, you know, some free space and free time for my left hand.
So that's I was starting to hold the racquet more in the right one. And I think then of course with my left hand with the surgery and everything, I don't know, probably I found a kind of new rhythm or new routine. I'm not really sure what I'm doing, actually, to be honest.
But, yeah, for sure after the surgery, I changed a few things.
Q. Those routines like the rhythm, how important are they to a player? I imagine if you changed it it would be strange.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, for sure. For sure if you change something, it's strange from the beginning.
But with the time you get used to, for sure, and you are not thinking about it anymore afterwards. Which as I said, I don't know what I'm doing really (smiling).
Yeah, like since beginning, you have to really think about it and knowing what you are doing, but then you're just used to it and you don't care.
Q. How much time have you spent hitting with Katerina, your next opponent? Your next opponent. Have you hit with her?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually, I just hit with her once, and it was in the offseason in Prague, so we had a practice, but I think it's like two years ago already. Not, no.
Q. Can you talk about that match? She's on a great run.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, for sure she is. She has a Czech coach, she is practicing in Prague.
It will be very interesting. I didn't play her a long time. I know she's really trying to play aggressive, going through the shots, same as me.
Yeah, it will be about the first few shots who gonna hit it harder, probably.
Yeah, I'm looking forward for that match, for sure. As I said, I didn't play her, so it will be a new challenge.
