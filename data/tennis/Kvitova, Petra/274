P. KVITOVA/P. Hercog
  7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   This first set was obviously the key today. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think the tiebreak was really key.   I'm really glad that I won it.   I had 6‑4 and I did double‑fault, so it wasn't very easy for mentally. 
But yeah, I stay calm and focused and it's helped me a lot.   The first set is very close, and I'm very glad that I won it.   Then it was important to break her serve. 
Then when I kept my serve, it was much easier. 

Q.   You played a lot since the French Open.   How do you feel coming into this US Open with all the victories you had in the summer?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm feeling very good.   I mean, with the victories it's always much easier. 
So, yeah, I think yesterday I was a little bit tired physically, but today was pretty good.   I was surprised in the morning. 

Q.   You have asthma.   Are you doing something in the States? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   I have to say that my asthma improve a lot the last two, three years.   But still in the North America and in New York it's always tough for me. 
But I have inhaler, so if I can't breathe, I using on the chair.
