P. KVITOVA/S. Hsieh   
6-4, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  I wondered how you felt about how the match went today and how you see your section of the draw opening up.  
PETRA KVITOVA: I felt good about the match, of course.  When you win it's always the good sign.   
But the first set was very tight, and I had a break, I lost my serve.  It was a little bit of the nerves out there.  But I'm happy that I managed to win the first set and started well in the second.  That was kind of the way I wanted.   
And about the draw, I'm not pretty sure, because I didn't see it and I don't want to know (smiling).   
I'm just taking match by match.
