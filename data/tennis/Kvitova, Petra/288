P. KVITOVA/S. Peng
  7‑5, 2‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Last two sets totally different.   Finally you controlled the game.   Would you talk about it. 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I played so, so bad in the second set.   I play so slow.   I did a lot of mistake for my forehand. 
The beginning of the third set, I think it was a big key to break her the first game.   I had a lot of breakpoints.   But, yeah, it wasn't easy to break her. 
After this was much easier for me.
