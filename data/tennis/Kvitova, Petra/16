P. KVITOVA/C. Su√°rez
4-6, 6-3, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about the game, especially the first and the last set.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it's been a little bit different. Definitely, it was my first match, I didn't really practice before that much, I was a bit ill, so and especially playing Carla, I mean it was 6-6 in the previous matches and she's very dangerous player for me, definitely. She likes to play slice, she has a great backhand and she mixes up the game a lot.
So it took me awhile to get used to and to find my rhythm, which luckily I did. Yeah, that was the difference between the first and the last set.
Q. On that, what do you think you were able to do in order to find your rhythm?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it was the game when I was down 5-4 in the first, even though I lost it and I had a few break points, but finally I find something in me, I find the rhythm as well in that game, so that helped me a lot to the next games, for sure.
But I think I was too hectic, in a way. I was trying to make a winner for the first or second shot, which I shouldn't do that risky probably, just be a little bit more patient and find good spots and I could play some rallies as well and that's helped me.
Q. How much of it -- you mentioned 12 previous matches against Carla, you guys have come up against each other a lot -- how much of it is in the back of your mind that when you do get into rallies with her that she has the ability to kind of make life very difficult in the rally and did that put pressure on you to kind of try and not get there?
PETRA KVITOVA: Definitely she likes it, for sure, that's what I saw, I think. I tried from the beginning, but as I mentioned I was too hectic. So I knew what I had to play, but I just missed a lot and I just didn't feel that well to do those shots.
So, yeah, I knew what I have to play, but it's tough to play sometimes. I tried to attack the second serve afterwards and I was getting to it a little bit more, even from the first serve, and in the end I put the pressure on her, which was the key for sure.
Q. And can you talk about Carla. Obviously it's her last season and I know she's much beloved by all of you in the locker room. But talk about her as both a competitor and as a person on tour.
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, she is definitely is loved by us for sure. She's a great person on and off the court. She always plays fair play. Talking in the locker rooms, laughing. She loves to play soccer as well, so we always get it a little bit of it.
She's a great competitor as well. She always fights, she never give up until the end. So glad for her career and I for sure going to miss her on the tour.
Q. And then your next match against a different type of opponent, Jelena Ostapenko. Can you just talk through what adjustments then you have to make against, having come off of playing Carla, playing Jelena, who likes to hit the ball big like you?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, she's a big hitter for sure, as you mentioned, same like me. She was playing final against Carla the time she Carla won, so definitely she likes to play her, play here.
I will see. I mean, of course it will be totally different compared to today. I will need to serve a little bit better as well I think and try to be low and hit it a little bit harder than she does (laughing).
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.
PETRA KVITOVA: Thank you.
