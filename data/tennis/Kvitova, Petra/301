P. KVITOVA/A. Ivanovic
  6‑2, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   How were you feeling today?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I'm lucky that I played at 11:00.   I am happy that I won the second set because in the end it was very tough to come back.   I lucky that I'm not playing a third set. 

Q.   Were you distracted by the smash you missed at 5‑3?   Is it why you lost a bit of momentum at the end of the second set?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, you know, it was really easy point.   I missed it.   Actually I don't know why, what's happened.   Then I thought that it will be fine and I just go.   You know, the serving in 5‑4 in the second set, you have to do it. 
Unfortunately I lost the game by 40‑Love.   It was really easy for Ana to play like this.   It was tough to get back and be focused on every point when I served.   I sat on the chair.   It was tough to get back. 
But, yeah, fortunately I did it. 

Q.   Martina Navratilova was in here earlier and spoke in glowing terms about you, thought it could be a real breakthrough for you.   What does that mean to you? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, Martina is very nice lady.   I like her.   You know, she was my idol when I growing up.   She real legend. 
Yeah, that's it.

Q.   Have you spoken to her at all, crossed paths?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Here?   Well, I spoke with her, but really quick.   She just say congrats, and was enough. 

Q.   The missed shot, was that the worst miss you've made in your career?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, actually, I mean, I don't know if it's worst in career.   It's happen.   I don't care really about this.   I know that it looks like really strange when I miss it. 
But anyway, it's happen.   I won, what is the important thing.

Q.   The other day you walked onto the grounds past a big line of fans.   You just had your bag on.   You seemed very relaxed.   Are you able to keep that aura about your camp when you're on your way to being No.1 and perhaps winning here? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, I like really this tournament.   I'm relaxed.   I try to be focus only on the tennis and think of nothing around. 
I mean, everybody is talking about the first position.   But, you know, many players who can be No.1 after this tournament.   So, I mean, it doesn't matter to talk about this right now.

Q.   What is a balance for you?   Is it always talking about the tennis and going back to the practice court, or do you kind of leave that once you leave the grounds?   Are you able to kind of do some relaxing things, too?
PETRA KVITOVA:   I mean, both things are very important for the tennis player.   I mean, you have to play or do something for 100% if you are on the practice court or you are in the fitness. 
I mean, then, of course, you have to be as a normal person in the hotel and just lying and reading book, for example. 

Q.   I know you said you're not thinking about it so much, but what would it mean to you to become No.1?   Is this a major goal of yours in your career?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, it's all the time that you are asking me.   I can say something about this when I will No.1, not now.

Q.   What book are you reading right now? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Actually, it's something from the history.   It's a criminal book. 

Q.   I'm wondering if you watched Li Na's game yesterday.   Do you know what happened in the tiebreak?   According to your experience, how can she improve so that doesn't happen again?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, is the woman's tennis.   It happen in our game. 
But, yeah, I watched it.   It was really sad when she lost the tiebreak and then all match.   But she play really well until these things. 
I mean, the Kim didn't give up and just play what she could.   Maybe she has something in her head that she knows she can win. 
Unfortunately, she made some mistakes, then it's really tough to come back in the head and be confident and still be focused on every point when she's playing.

Q.   How hard is it for a player to refocus on the game, to play normal after losing such a great chance?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I think it's really hard because you are still thinking that you had some match points.   The third set, it's really tough to be concentrate in the beginning. 
Kim was in the fire and she just play.   She didn't have some mistakes or something, so it was really hard to get back.
