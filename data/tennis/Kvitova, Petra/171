P. KVITOVA/C. Wozniacki
  7‑5, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. You did not look at all today like someone who has been dealing with mono all summer. Did you feel pretty good?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, I did. I feel a little bit tired from yesterday. I feel every muscle in my body. But that was fine. It was good to play at night. The conditions was better. I had a nap after lunch, so it helped me as well. 
So everything just came together and I'm happy how I played today because the first set was really close. For sure that was the key of the match. 

Q. Looked like you came up strong in the first set then kind of faltered a little bit, but then came back strong at the end to win the last game. 
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it was very similar to yesterday when I was 5‑3 down, as well, and I had to really fight back. It was one break. 
You know, I think in the end of the first set, every game what we played was really close. It was just few points and could be on the other side. 
I was happy I won the first set. I was really happy because we play over the hour. So for me was good to be the first one, for sure. 

Q. How does it feel to be playing for another title here?
PETRA KVITOVA: It's great, for sure. I mean, finally I should defend a title, so I have to really do well tomorrow (smiling). 
Of course, the final will be very difficult to play. Lucie, she's playing good game as well. She's improving and playing really good. So for sure she will want to win it as well. 
So hope to play well and to fight for the title. 

Q. How close are the two of you?
PETRA KVITOVA: We are close, for sure. We know each other well from on the court, off the court, from the Fed Cups, as well. We always have great atmosphere out there. 
Yeah, we are friends. It's always difficult to play friends, for sure. Even in the final it's not really easy. But that's how it is at the tennis. If you are on the court, I don't think it really will thinking about the friendships. 

Q. Why do you think you've had so much success against her when you have played her?
PETRA KVITOVA: I don't know. Tough to say. I know probably her game a little bit. On the other side, she knows mine as well. We practice kind of a lot during the Fed Cups, and if we were in Czech, we hit together, as well. 
I don't know. I just think that maybe in the important moments I'm kind of maybe a little bit stronger player, if I can say. But it's really difficult. I think it's a year when we played last match against each other. So I think from that time, she improved a lot, as well. 
It's going to be really difficult tomorrow. 

Q. How pivotal was the 12th game of the first set today? Do you gain momentum from winning something like that?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, it was really difficult, as I said. Every game that we played was pretty long. It was a lot of deuces over there. It was really tough mentally, as well. 
I know that Caro can play forever. She ran the marathon, so she could be there many, many hours. But I'm not really this kind of player. So for me it's a little bit better to have shorter rallies and shorter matches, like what I did today in the second set for sure. 
Yeah, I think was nice first set, for sure. 

Q. Is your game getting better right now? Do you feel like you're just getting into good form?
PETRA KVITOVA: I do, for sure. I feel much better than Toronto and Cincinnati. I mean, I know that New Haven is one of my favorite tournaments. Always coming back, it's great. I always feel more little bit confident and I know I can play really well here. 
That's nice to know when you're coming somewhere, where you really have good success. That's the same this year. I'm happy I'm in the final again. I feel better for sure. The first round I played Keys, was really difficult for me. That win give me little bit more confidence as well. I'm happy for that and I hope that this will continue tomorrow.
