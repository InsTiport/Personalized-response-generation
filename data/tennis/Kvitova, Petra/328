 Q. You have had a lot of close matches this week, haven't you?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Yes. I fighted a lot, but this is -- this match is whether you have to fight. It's more important. Then if you win, you are playing amazing. I'm happy for that, for sure.

 Q. How did you struggle with the wind?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah. I was confused all week here. It's something for both players, and you have to fight with the wind there, also. 
 It's not about tennis, but you have to think how the wind came. So yeah.

 Q. How big of a step was it in your career for you to reach the final here?

 PETRA KVITOVA: The Wimbledon or -- Wimbledon last year? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, yeah. Of course I played very well there, and I beat many good players. Afterwards I was confident, but I lost five first rounds in the row. 
 So I was thinking I have to win everything that I play, what is -- it cannot be. After this I was a little bit down mentally, so it's good experience.

 Q. You obviously reached the top 10 after Madrid. Then you went and played in Czech Republic. How different is it when you go back home? Are you much more famous now?
 PETRA KVITOVA: Well, after Madrid it was very nice, because when I played there, it's many people came for watching. It was very nice.
 Of course I'm famous there, but it's good for the tennis, for the fame of tennis in the Czech Republic. I'm happy for that.
