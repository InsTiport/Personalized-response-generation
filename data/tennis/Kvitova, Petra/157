THE MODERATOR: Questions for Petra Kvitova, please.
Q. Welcome to Doha.  Talk a little bit about this tournament, how do you feel here and the atmosphere.  Also with the withdrawal of Serena and Maria, will it affect this championship?
PETRA KVITOVA: I like coming back to Doha for sure.  I feel this years it's more warm than last year, which is good.  For the night matches it was kind of cold. So I'm glad it's great and we have a little bit of suntan.
I feel good here again.
And about the withdrawals, I don't think really change something on the draw.  It's still a strong field.  I just don't think it will affect any kind of big matches.
Q. Recently you had a few tough losses like Australia.  Can you talk about if you feel like you're getting back the confidence or what kind of stuff do you feel you need to do in terms of getting back your form and confidence?
PETRA KVITOVA: Well, I think the main thing is to stay healthy.  That's what I was struggling from the beginning of the year.  I'm missing some of the matches.  I think that's important for me to get the confidence from the matches the.  Practices are great, but I just need to put it to the match.
That's, I think, it's the main kind of reason right now.
Q. So do you feel just the problem you recently had, it's the health issue, not like techniques or any tennis-wise?
PETRA KVITOVA: No, I don't think it's tennis-wise.  I think it's the mental side a little bit, which I really wanted to improve.  As I said, practice are great.  I just need to really be focusing and play well in the match.
I think it's the practice of the matches, that's why I'm playing doubles, to get a little bit of the rhythm of the match.
