A. BARTY/P. Kvitova
7-6, 6-2
Q. (Question about playing Ash.)
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it's always a big challenge, for sure. You don't play every day world No. 1. Ash is a nice girl, great competitor. It's really great to have this challenge, have the opportunity to play her in the quarterfinals.
Q. What was your feeling at the end of the first set?
PETRA KVITOVA: What I felt in the end of the first set? Whew, everything. It's been tough battle, especially in the first set. Ups and downs. I had a set point. Tiebreak, she just played it well.
Yeah, I didn't really made it. It was a little bit frustrating after losing the first set. If you are facing world No. 1, as Ash is, she's really proving she deserving to be. Definitely she played good tiebreaks, same as me, but it was about the one point which made the difference in the end of the day.
Q. Specifically on your serve, it seems like she's made an adjustment on the return the last few matches. Is that something you've picked up on in terms of how differently things are happening in your service games against her?
PETRA KVITOVA: To be honest, I think I didn't really serve the best as I wished for, for sure. Probably that's why it seems like that she did some good adjustments for it.
But definitely I could serve much better. Still, I mean, I didn't serve that well. I still played some good rallies. I had really the opportunity to keep my serve more often than I didn't. The same was on her serve.
Yeah, that's how it is. But definitely she's a great mover. She can mix it up the game. Obviously she can do it. Yeah, I think she really improving every month.
Q. I'm sure you're very disappointed at losing the match, but overall these few weeks, how do you feel your tennis has been, where you're headed?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, obviously, as you said, disappointing to lose in the quarters. Really had a tough opponent today. Was really proving to be No. 1. It was a great, great match, great fight.
But overall it's nice to be back in the quarters after last year final. Definitely I'm taking lots of positive. I had tough matches before. I was still able to win them anyway, especially against Maria when I lost the first set.
I'm really happy. In small things I think I'm improving, which is really important for me. I'm happy with the new energy, you know, new team a little bit. I hope it will help me in the future, as well.
Q. The first set you had the set point. Before that, how big was that point at 3-2 in the tiebreak, 20 shots?
PETRA KVITOVA: Yeah, don't mention that (smiling).
It was a huge one, for sure. Probably I did everything what I could in that moment. Maybe I just put one more percentage that she couldn't have it. But I played it on the line. I don't know how I should do it more.
But definitely it was one of the toughest points, for sure, in the match. Yeah, I mean, that's what the tiebreak is, it's every point. Everybody is just putting everything in it. Yeah, she was just better in the rally. That's how it is.
Q. In terms of today, at times finding it difficult to get the ball past her, is that Ash's defense or her anticipation? Is there less speed than you're used to on that court?
PETRA KVITOVA: I think it's about - you know that word, I'm not saying it (smiling) - of her, for sure.
I'm not sure if she's reading the game like that or it was just the bad timing of me or just bad choose of the sides. But definitely even I choose the sides that she was running to, I could play some volleys, as well.
So, yeah, I think I should go to the net little bit more often than I did today actually. But anyway, it was a little bit tough when she pushed you from the baseline to go forward.
But I think I should do a little bit more anyway, yeah.
Q. What were the conditions like? Was it slow out there this year with the balls as well?
PETRA KVITOVA: Actually I think it was a little bit slower, yeah. I mean, I do remember last year, I don't think that I played that slow anyway. So, yeah, I think it was a little bit slower, for sure, even we played in the day. Still, yeah.
Q. What is your schedule now for February?
PETRA KVITOVA: I'm playing St. Petersburg and Doha, then Indian Wells.
