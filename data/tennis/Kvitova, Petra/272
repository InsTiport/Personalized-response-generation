P. KVITOVA/D. Hantuchova
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese, please. 

Q.   I think your performance here today is much better than what you had in Tokyo tournament.   In which area did you make some changes?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I mean, the best things that I want compared to Tokyo were nothing what I did today. 
I mean, in the beginning it was very close, every game when we played, and it was very tough to keep my serve in the second game.   Then just wait and have some good returns.   I mean, I improve my serve compared to first serve in Tokyo.
Yeah, I mean, I didn't have little mistakes what I did in Tokyo, and I tried to play my game. 

Q.   It's very much cold in the night of Beijing.   Do you think that will influence your performance?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Yeah, I remember last year I played night session also.   It was much colder than tonight.   That's why I had the pants. 
I mean, it's not very comfortable, but it's same for both of us on the court.   I try to be still moving and be warm. 

Q.   Do you think what will be the single largest potential opponent for you to find before you're gonna reach the title?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I think the opponent will be in the second round now, so we will see.
I'm not sure who I'm playing, so that's surprise for me.   (Smiling.)
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English. 

Q.   Did that match go exactly how you would have wanted it to?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Sorry? 

Q.   Did the match go exactly how you would have hoped?
PETRA KVITOVA:   Against her? 

Q.   Yeah.   You won in straight sets, 6‑2, 6‑3.   Is that the best start? 
PETRA KVITOVA:   Well, I mean, I don't care if I will play three sets and I won.   That doesn't matter for me. 
But it's good I didn't spend plenty of time on the court in the night and in the cold.   So, I mean, yeah, it's better to play only two sets and win.
