XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, a little bit. I think most of the time it's for the worst. But like if it's in the beginning, yeah, you got to get into it somehow. I'm not going to say by getting upset, it's the right way to do it, but it's definitely, you know, steers you in the right direction. A little bit of getting pumped up, getting fired up, yeah, get energy and pumped up.
