Q. I was told a trainer came and saw you out on court. Can you explain what the reason was? 
 
 XAVIER MALISSE: It's the same as always. I said it 10 times. It's nothing dangerous. My heart goes a little faster. That's it. It's nothing more. I wouldn't be playing if it was dangerous. It's just I got a little dizzy because I had breakfast, but then it's closed here so I couldn't eat anything. So I just got some stuff on the court and just got dizzy. That's it.  
 
Q. So food helps it if you keep food up? 
 
 XAVIER MALISSE: It has nothing to do with my heart. I just got dizzy because I maybe didn't eat enough. I had some chocolate and some electrolyte pills. It helped in the end.  
 
Q. Is there any medication that would help you? 
 
 XAVIER MALISSE: No, no. No, I don't have to take medication. It's not dangerous, it's not anything. It's nothing.
