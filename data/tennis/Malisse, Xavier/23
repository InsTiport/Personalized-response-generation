XAVIER MALISSE: It's the same as always. I said it 10 times. It's nothing dangerous. My heart goes a little faster. That's it. It's nothing more. I wouldn't be playing if it was dangerous. It's just I got a little dizzy because I had breakfast, but then it's closed here so I couldn't eat anything. So I just got some stuff on the court and just got dizzy. That's it. 

XAVIER MALISSE: It has nothing to do with my heart. I just got dizzy because I maybe didn't eat enough. I had some chocolate and some electrolyte pills. It helped in the end. 

XAVIER MALISSE: No, no. No, I don't have to take medication. It's not dangerous, it's not anything. It's nothing.
