XAVIER MALISSE: No, not really. I mean, it was fun. Hit a good shot. Obviously, they'll get into it. No, I felt comfortable. You know, I've always felt good on the second serve with Andre that I could take it early and get a couple of hits. You know, he just came up with some good shots at the end. It didn't trouble me. I didn't get in a panic mode. I just kept playing my tennis. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, of course. In the beginning, you kind of see a little bit. I think from the back, he was just too solid in the beginning. I couldn't get to the net. All his backhands were deep and cross-court. You know, I couldn't play too aggressive. If I would play too aggressive, be hitting stupid shots from way back. You know, he served well. I think the only -- I started ripping good returns on second serve, and I should have done that a little earlier in the match. 

XAVIER MALISSE: A little bit, yeah. The game he played, first game of the fifth set, he hit three winners. He started serving really well. I didn't play much differently. I went for my shots. A couple went long. You know, you got to have that little bit of luck. At the end, too, even match point, I couldn't hit it any harder, any more perfect. He hit a slice down the line for a passing shot. You know, he was just too good in the fifth set. 

XAVIER MALISSE: No, no. I've only done that a couple times. I'm sure he's done it a lot more. It's nice to get free points against Andre. I'll definitely take it. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, definitely. It's like I said before I played him, I need to get that first set so I can get my beliefs up that I can do it. You know, I really believed in it in the fifth set. Like I said, he came up with the goods. All you can say is "too good." The next time I will have that confidence and we'll see how it goes.
