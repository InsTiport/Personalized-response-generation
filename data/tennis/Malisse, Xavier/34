XAVIER MALISSE: Thanks. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, I was tired from almost 5-All, 6-5. We had some long rallies. It was really hot today. Every game was like it became hotter and hotter. I guess that's experience. Sometimes you have to play in this weather. I tried to do my best, but I couldn't. I hit some shots I just had to hit. I couldn't run too much anymore. I would get cramps or something. I mean, he was better today. I've got to accept it. 

XAVIER MALISSE: What? 

XAVIER MALISSE: I was just kidding. But I wanted to play, but if I knew it was less hot (laughter). I mean, it was very hot. I think that was a big factor in the game. He solved it better than I did, and that's why he won. 

XAVIER MALISSE: This has been a great experience, not only the matches, but the whole week, with the whole team. It's been great. I was very excited to play Davis Cup matches. I gave everything I had. I hope they accept me on the team like I am. But I just want to say thank you to the guys this week. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Probably to LA tomorrow, take a day off. Normally LA. I don't know yet. I've got to call. LA, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and US Open probably. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah. Maybe I won't come back. See what the temperature is. 

XAVIER MALISSE: I don't know. I'm in quallies probably. I have to see. I don't know how it goes. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, they gave me the wildcard yesterday after the match. So that's great. That's why I'll come back. I know it can be hot here, so I'm prepared to play. 

XAVIER MALISSE: The first one I just moved around my legs. And the second one, I thought it was going out so I just hit it back, and it went over. Normally I make it, so it's fun for the people to watch. If I make it, it just makes you feel good. 

XAVIER MALISSE: No. But everybody called me yesterday. It was fun. Everybody was watching me on television. I appreciate it from everybody who called me. It was fun, the whole thing. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Other players, Fritz, Nick called me also, Jimmy, a friend of mine. All friends, friends in Miami. 

XAVIER MALISSE: Yeah, I'm legal now. No, I don't really feel a difference. It feels great to be 18, but I guess today was just a match in my head. Tonight I'll be 18. 

XAVIER MALISSE: It's nice. I didn't expect it, everybody was singing. It's nice. Give you a cake to play tennis. I think that's what we play for, to have fun and enjoy the people. I really appreciate they did that for me. 

XAVIER MALISSE: It might be different. Probably be different. I don't know yet. I'm too tired. I guess I'm going to take a day off and then think about my hair color.
