X. MALISSE/F. Verdasco
  1‑6, 7‑6, 6‑1, 4‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It looked like it meant so much to you when you won.   Can you tell us what it felt like to win it here?
XAVIER MALISSE:   Yeah, because, you know, it's been a long year this year.   The beginning wasn't so good.   It's tough.   You keep fighting, but you're not winning the close matches.   The last three, four weeks, everything's coming together.
It just means a lot, because, you know, last year you play fourth round, and, you know, you have points to defend.   There's a lot of physical work, a lot of work you do before you come here.   You play a lot of matches.
You know, it's just nice to win a close match like this and on the third round of a slam, so it just means a lot.

Q.   Like you said, you keep working hard and keep hoping things turn around.   It must be more worthwhile when it does turn around. 
XAVIER MALISSE:   It gets frustrating sometimes because you keep working and you lose 6‑4, you lose 7‑6 in the third, but that's why you keep going at it.   Sometimes, you know, it just turns around especially right now at the right moments. 
So it just feels good that the last three, four weeks have, you know, turned around.   Then I can play my best form here at Wimbledon, you know, one of my favorite tournaments.   It's nice to be in the second week again.
