Q. What happened today? 
 
 XAVIER MALISSE: I started playing and I felt pretty good before the match. I had a good night of sleep. Just around the third, fourth game, my arm started hurting. I had no idea why. It was colder today, so the ball felt really heavy. My strings were kind of tight. I guess it just got worse and worse playing. Every time, extending it, the forehand and service, it just got worse and worse. I've been playing a lot of matches after two months off and that's probably why.  
 
Q. Last week at Kooyong you had some problems with your leg. 
 
 XAVIER MALISSE: I feel really good about my tennis and about fitness and stuff. But I think after being two months off and then playing six matches in three days and Hopman Cup for four days, then play Sydney, a long match, and fly back to Kooyong... Obviously the matches here are tough even though it's -- if you win in three sets, they're still long matches. I just think I played a little too much after two months off. It's catching up on me.
