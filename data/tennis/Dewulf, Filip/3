Q. I'm from multimedia from Greece.  It was an unlucky moment, or you had problems before here? 
 
FILIP DEWULF:  No.  It just happened at 2-1 in the first set.  I twisted my ankle.  I had no problems before that. 
 

Q. What are your comments to participate in The Compaq?
 
FILIP DEWULF:  I mean, it's a great tournament.  I enjoyed the few hours that I stayed here, were incredible. First time that I come here.  I really enjoyed it a lot.  I don't know, maybe the surface is a little bit fast for the people, as well as for the players themselves. It's difficult to play good tennis on that kind of surface. That's what I think about it. 
 

Q. Many people prefer to watch matches in the claycourt because the points are longer.  Do you prefer to play clay or fast court?
 
FILIP DEWULF:  I like to play on fast courts as  well, but I think this court especially is a little bit too fast.  I mean, there is almost no rallies.  You have to play serve and volley.  I mean, it's tough to play from the baseline on this kind of court.  I don't think it's that nice to watch that sort of tennis.  Nothing I can do. 
 

Q. How exactly did it happen?
 
FILIP DEWULF:  I missed it, really stupid.  The ball came back from the net and I put my foot on it and I twisted it.  Very stupid.  It's always stupid to twist your ankle, but this one was really stupid.  Should have kicked it, the ball.
