A. TOMLJANOVIC/Y. Putintseva
7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you feel, that you were able to fight back?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah, not the greatest start. I don't even think it was nerves. I just think, yeah, I wasn't too focused at the start. With her, you have to be really sharp, disciplined, but still aggressive. It took me a little bit to find the balance.
But I think once I got going, it was a battle. I mean, she's always tough. She never gives up. She runs down every ball, really makes you win it. This is a quality win for me.
Q. How did you change your mindset?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: After Love-3?
Q. Yes.
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I just knew that Love-3 isn't really the most realistic score. I knew that if I can get down 3-Love, I can get back to 3-All. As I said, I know her well. I knew what to do. It was just about executing.
Q. (Question about fighting back.)
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I think winning that first set, she didn't feel great. I think it was an hour and 15. She definitely had her chances. Whoever had won that set, the momentum would have been with the other person that won. I think that's what happened.
I mean, I got down an early break, so she never goes away really. You just have to play well to win.
Q. The crowd was obviously all on your favor. Must have felt nice.
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah, I think this month that's just how it's going to be. Having 'AUS' after your name, it definitely brings that out.
Yeah, I'm just really happy to win and win as many matches as I can in Australia. Yeah, it's just a great feeling.
Q. Simona Halep next. It's going to be tough.
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah, I mean, I actually didn't know. I never look at my second round. I'm like, Whoa, okay, Halep (laughter).
But I'm up for the challenge. You want to play these matches, play against the top players. Yeah, what a better way than to do it here in Adelaide?
Q. What is your mindset like this month, knowing you have that kind of support?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I think any situation you can look at it as good pressure or bad pressure. I choose just to see it as the best thing possible. No matter how bad you're playing, they're going to cheer for you until the next point. All you got to do is just go out there and fight, just do your best really.
They love that fighting spirit, just to see you give it your all. That goes well with my personality, I think.
Q. (Question about the upcoming Australian Open.)
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I mean, you always want to peak in the third tournament of January. I'm still hoping I'm saving my best for Melbourne. But it's always nice to just get wins and feel good about your tennis.
Honestly, if I just played a quality match today, I would have felt pretty good also going into Melbourne. A win is a nice bonus.
Q. How have you found Adelaide so far?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Adelaide is great. I mean, what's that street called, the party street? Every night everyone is out and about. I got tempted one night. I'm just kidding, I didn't (laughter).
So far, so great. The site is so close to the hotel, I love that setup. People are so great. For a first-year event, it's amazing. I really like it.
Q. You seem to be quite friendly with a lot of players on the tour. I saw Felix congratulate you. Some players keep to themselves. How important is that for you? Do you feel it's a unique thing?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I mean, I'm friendly in general. For me, I wouldn't be able to be on tour and just be all to myself. I mean, I've traveled with my dad. He's more loved on tour than me unfortunately. He always brings friends that I didn't know we had (laughter).
Yeah, I think it's really healthy to have good relationships on tour. I couldn't do it if I didn't have quality friends on tour. I can still play a match, give it my all, come off and it's like that. I don't believe in that sort of thing where everyone is an enemy.
