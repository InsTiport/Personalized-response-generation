An interview with:   
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  When you came back with your leg strapped, can you talk us through the injury there?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I just felt old strain.  You know, I went one point wide and I didn't really feel too comfortable.  But, you know, I stayed out there.  I played the match.  So yeah.   
 Q.  You did hang in there really well.  Were you pleased with your ability to at least do that?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah.  I mean, retiring wasn't really an option for me today, and I think I did my best considering.  But, you know, I stayed out there.  So there's really no excuses for anything.  I just -- I was outplayed.   
 Q.  When did it become a problem?  Because your first set was pretty good?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah, it was actually beginning of the second I felt it.  And, I mean, for me it's tough now with my history.  You know, I feel one thing and maybe in my head it's bigger than it really is.  But I'm okay with that.  You know, for me, my biggest fear is taking time off and injuries.   
So I just wanted to, you know, stay out there, fight as hard as I can, and still, you know, not make it worse.   
 Q.  Is it a bit of a mental win for you then to overcome that?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: It's definitely mental, but, obviously, there's still something there that bothered me.  But, yeah, even in practice when I feel something, I stop, you know, soon.  And I try to be as realistic as I can, but I think it's better to be more cautious than reckless.   
 Q.  Through the first set and, I mean, throughout the match anyway, regardless of the injury, how pleased were you with the first match and here starting your season off with these two performances?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I thought I played my first round really well.  I was probably a little more nervous for that one just because it was the first one.   
But, you know, honestly, coming up today, I expected to play well because I've been training well.  You know, I've had good wins over the last couple of months, going deep into tournaments, even though they're not the same level like here.   
But I just believed in my ability.  But I feel like my tennis is kind of improving faster than my body a little bit, which is frustrating.   
But, you know, I've got nothing to be sad about.  I'm disappointed just because I obviously wanted to win, and I love playing here.  But looking ahead, I'm just pleased with where my game is going.  Just hopefully I stay as healthy as possible.   
 Q.  What are your plans for the coming week?  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: I've got doubles tomorrow so hopefully I pull up okay tomorrow morning.  I'm attempting to play, but obviously if it's really bad tomorrow, you know, I'll see.   
But I've got that and, yeah, I think I've got Australian Open quallies.  So I get, like, a couple days off and hopefully get a good preparation in.   
 Q.  The final game of that final set it's almost like both you guys just opened up your shoulders and started absolutely ripping the ball.  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: The 5-3 game?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC: Yeah.  That's when my adrenaline kicked in.  I kind of forgot.  Yeah, it was like I wish this happened at 0-0 in the third.   
But, yeah.  I mean, look, at the end of the day, this was a better night than being in a hotel room.  I remember last year what I was doing was watching this on TV.  So I've got nothing to be sad about.
