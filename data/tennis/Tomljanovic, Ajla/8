E. SVITOLINA/A. Tomljanovic
  6‑3, 6‑2

Q. Obviously tough day today.   What was it that Elina did well that frustrated you on the court?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC:   Yeah, you know, it was a tough day for me.   Couldn't get much rhythm out there today, and I thought she played pretty smart, got a lot of balls back.
Yeah, pretty disappointing for me.   I thought I could have given her a better fight.   It's the start of the season so I'm not going to get too down on myself.   Tomorrow is a new day, and just got to work harder.

Q.   Will you take a lot of confidence over the win you had over Jankovic and how much the crowd is behind you?   Will you take that into your next tournament, which is Hobart, correct?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC:   Yeah, definitely learned from even the win against Jelena and the loss today.
I think I'm generally playing well, you know.   Just got to keep moving forward.   It's really a joy to play in front of this crowd.
I'm really enjoying it.   Just got to work a little harder.

Q.   Last question:   Obviously you're still in the doubles and you're playing again today.   So the plan is to stay in the doubles and eventually head to Hobart and eventually Melbourne?   No change to your schedule?
AJLA TOMLJANOVIC:   Yeah, so far playing doubles here.   Hopefully we do our best.   Yeah, Hobart it is.   May be last‑minute changes but, for now I'm pretty sure it's just Hobart.
