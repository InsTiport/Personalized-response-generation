C. SUAREZ NAVARRO/A. Tomljanovic
      6‑3, 6‑3

Q. I would like to know what you will take from this experience in Roland Garros? 
    AJLA TOMLJANOVIC:   Yeah, well, after today, right now I don't really see the positives right away.   Obviously I am disappointed that I lost today.   Wish I could have maybe played better and showed more of my best tennis. 
    But, look, stepping away from today, this week has definitely been a positive.   Obviously a lot more positives than negatives.   I showed that I can play well and compete against the best girls.
    Today didn't go my way.   You know, I struggled with her neutral balls.   Played a little too defensive and had a lot of errors.
    Towards the end of the second set I think I started finding the court better and played more aggressive.   Obviously ran out of time really.
