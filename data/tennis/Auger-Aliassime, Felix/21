TEAM CANADA   
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from the captain.   
ADRIANO FUORIVIA: Sounds good. Hi, everyone. To my left we have Adil Shamasdin. Next, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Dennis Shapovalov, Peter Polansky and Steven Diez.   
Any questions?   
 Q.  First up against Stefanos, should be a tough game for you.  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, it will be exciting. I think the last time we played it was in Miami. It's been awhile. So, yeah, we'll see where our game's at. Obviously, coming off the little break that we had it's never, never easy knowing where exactly where your game is. But I played several practice sets, practice points this week, and I've been feeling pretty good, so I'm excited to get started.   
 Q.  (Question about the rising stars of tennis.)  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, I think there's a lot of talent, a lot of great players on every single team in our group, so it's a really exciting box. I think it's probably one of the best groups in terms of rankings-wise and just players in general. Everyone's really exciting, everyone's got their own personality, and are really fun to watch. So I'm excited. When the draw came out that we were going to play these guys I was ecstatic. I think it's great for the event and it's a great way to start the season, again, seeing where the game is at and comparing yourself to these great players.   
 Q.  Do you feel that the next generation is closing the gap between the Big-3?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah, definitely. I think, I think sooner or later and probably sooner, the young guys are going to start knocking on the doors and start winning Slams and pushing the top guys. We saw it at the Masters a lot last year. And even with Daniil almost winning the U.S. Open, we're seeing how close the young guys are to kind of breaking through. So I'm sure that this year's going to be big for the young guys. And, yeah, the next couple years are going to be really big and there's going to be a lot of change.   
 Q.  Felix, do you, from the outside it looks like this is kind of the start of a great generation again for Canada, Canadian men's tennis. What is it like to be kind of amongst that team, and are you guys going to have that same buzz, like, this is the beginning of the something special for y'all?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, it started even before us. I think a lot of guys, even on this team, on this roster have done things for the country that are good before even Denis and I came along. But I think for sure we're in the best era that there ever was in tennis in Canada, so I think, I'm honored, I think we're all honored to be part of that era and pushing us forward. But it's encouraging and motivating for all of us. And I think personally I'm just proud and happy to bring the country to a next level in tennis and we have done it with the Davis Cup end of last year. And if we can do something great again for the country this week, it's going to be good.   
 Q.  Have y'all discussed how your on-court coaching will work during the match and what are your thoughts on that overall, what that will add to the event?  
ADRIANO FUORIVIA: I think, I kind of like the idea to involve their personal coaches. I think it's another step in doing something different and being more exclusive to this type of thing. But we discussed it with the guys and they're going to discuss it with their coaches and myself and kind of like, how it's going to work and how we would like it to work. But I think it's definitely going to bring a different atmosphere.   
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, we can take that chance. We don't have that chance often to share with our coaches during a match, an official match. So for me it's just taking that chance to share on what we see, what we feel during the match. And, yeah, if it can work for the best then that's good. But it's good that we have a little changes like this from time to time.   
 Q.  You mentioned something before about how similar this event is to the Davis Cup, also the World Championships and after you guys had your epic run not that long ago in Madrid, how it feels starting over at another team event or if it's exciting you're keeping the momentum going or if it feels like you already did this very recently?  
DENIS SHAPOVALOV: Yeah. I think it's obviously exciting. I think any team event is super exciting and, honestly, it's just fun to be part of a team and we get along great with the guys, so I'm excited for this tournament. But at the same time, yeah, of course, it's a really similar event and it's literally back-to-back from the other one, so it's a little bit of a weird sensation coming from what felt like the world championships coming to play another world championship. So for me I don't see why they, the ATP and ITF can't combine, can't join, can't come to some agreement and make just one, one really unique and special tournament for everyone. I think that's what everyone will want. I think, as players, as fans, that's what tennis needs. So, yeah, for me that's my only thing. That's what I've been saying. But in terms of the tournament, no, I think it's great. And I think that there's so many great players. And like I said, the group is really stacked. There's going to be so many great matches ahead of us and I think every single person on this team is really excited.   
 Q.  This used to be the week in the calendar where Hopman Cup was, which was the lone mixed men's and women's team event and I'm curious, there's been a bunch of men's only events introduced recently but no, we're down to zero mixed events now. I'm curious, especially with how well Canadian women and Bianca are doing, if you guys would like to see an event like that -- even though there's already so many team events -- something that Canada can probably thrive into?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, it would be cool, but I'm not sure how it would work with, between ATP, WTA with the points. I'm not sure, like, how all of that would work. But for sure it's a good idea to mix up both parties. But I think to continue on what Denis was saying, how it's confusing, and I think it's also for us, but also for the fans. I have friends, I have, like, people telling me, like, they're not really sure what's going on because, let's say someone, you take someone that doesn't really know about tennis and you tell them we have the biggest world championship of tennis at the end of the year and now we're starting with another one. Well, why not unite the forces and just create the biggest world championship there is in tennis?   
 Q.  You mentioned the rankings points. I'm curious, have you looked at the numbers for that, like, what kind of points you'll be playing for this week? Because you're playing, you're having to play a pretty big range of guys, ranking point-wise?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Depending upon, obviously, your ranking on the team, your ranking in the ATP, it varies, but there's a lot of points available. I think the max is 750. It's even more than the second biggest tournament on the tour. So, yeah, there's a lot of points available, so that's also a big motivation for the players.   
 Q.  I guess I'm asking: Have you sat down and crunched your own personal math for what your ranking points -- because it's different for every player here this week pretty much what kind of points they'll be playing for.  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: I haven't done the math. I'm just going to play and see what happens.   
 Q.  What did it mean for Denis to pick you? So you guys have worked together in the past and with the Juniors, but I'm just curious what that meant for you?  
ADRIANO FUORIVIA: I think it's awesome, it's unbelievable, we have been close for many, many years. We kind of have each other's backs whenever we need each other and I think it's an honor that he picked me and I get to have the experience with all these guys. I had a lot of time to spend with each of these guys back in the days, whether Pete was beating me in ping pong or sometimes on the court with the boys. They both, Felix and Denis both won a Junior U.S. Open together and spent many Junior times together. Adil always training with us at times when we were back home. And Steven in the last couple years I got to see him a little bit more often on the tour and things like that. So just great to be together with these guys and enjoy a good, solid, hopefully two weeks together.
