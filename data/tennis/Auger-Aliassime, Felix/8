A. RUBLEV/F. Auger-Aliassime
7-6, 6-7, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What's your reaction to that match?
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Disappointed, for sure. There were so many occasions. Obviously we all saw the same match. It's tough to swallow, but I think we have to see the big picture.
It's a good level of tennis. It's a good match, good battle. He deserved it as much as I did. There can only be one winner. That's the way it is.
I'm going to keep giving myself occasions to play matches like this and to go deep in tournaments, and hopefully one day it will go my way.
Q. Physically, how are you feeling? It was three hours.
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: For sure tired. It's also late in the day.
You know, a few tensions in the muscles, camps, but nothing bad. I think it's a good sign for the upcoming matches. So now the goal is to, you know, rest well, recover, and then get ready for Melbourne.
Q. The first two sets you guys couldn't break each other at all, and there was like 16 breakpoints and all of them were saved. When you got that break in the third, did you get a sense that you were closer to the victory, or you kind of knew he was going to come back?
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: For sure I had a sense I was getting closer. I also served unbelievable the game right after, four aces.
I think, honestly, both players -- I mean, on our breakpoints, we just played unbelievable. I mean, he was serving so good every time. Okay, I missed, but it was like -- I think we pushed each other to the limit on each breakpoints, and, you know, it's tough to get those.
We bring the A game whenever we needed to. He did the same when I played him in Umag.
I don't know, in the third, just somehow raised his level. At 3-1, okay, I'm not putting first serves in. I'm not acing him. But still, I mean, the level he played to come back, I mean, it was just -- because I didn't, you know, I didn't give up mentally. I didn't lose focus.
I personally think he just overplayed me to come back. It was tight until the end, but credit to him, yeah.
Q. That match point in the end, are you the kind of guy who will replay it in your head, or will you get over this one right away, or...
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, the match point, I mean, the thing is I was a bit far from victory, anyway. If I had a match point and I missed that, that would have been something else.
I was already down 15-40, just trying to stay in, and I could have made it and it's 5-4 deuce. I mean, he's way closer to victory for me. No, that's where the match was played, so I'm not going to replay that point in my head, no.
