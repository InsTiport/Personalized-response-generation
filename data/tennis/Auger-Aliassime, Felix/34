THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How did it happen, like after yesterday, and did you wake up today, what was the evolution of finally deciding you wouldn't be able to play?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, so obviously I didn't feel great during the finals yesterday in Lyon.  You know, during the second set, you know, I could -- I was just trying to manage to finish the match.   
And then, you know, we were waiting to maybe get some exams done today in Paris, and then we went this morning, and they weren't in favor of me playing, so after that we took the decision of pulling out.   
 Q.  MRI or...  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, MRI, yeah.   
 Q.  Any regrets about not perhaps pulling out of the final in Lyon?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, not about not pulling out, I don't think it would have changed much.  I think the damage was done.  I was really, during the finals, I don't think I got it hurt more.  I don't think I would have saved my chances of playing here.  I think it happened before.   
I just, you know, in the finals, I was just trying to manage to finish the match.  But even after that, I was okay.  It hurt, but maybe, yeah, two days, I was waiting to see the results, so I didn't want to say that I had no chance of playing.  I just wanted to get an MRI done first.  After seeing the results, we thought it would be better, more careful to pull out.   
 Q.  Is it one of your most painful decision and things that you had to go through in your tennis life or not?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, one of the top things.  Obviously in US Open not being able to finish the match was probably the toughest thing out there, because it happened very suddenly.   
This one, I didn't expect it, as well.  I was feeling great.  And then during my semifinals I started feeling pain in my groin, so, yeah, I didn't expect it.  But at the same time, you know, we had time to think about it, do the exams, and it was a very thoughtful decision.  I think I'm at peace just knowing that it's not something that it's gonna heal, you know, pretty fast, but I have to be careful.   
But, you know, I'm at peace knowing that I'll probably be able to be ready for the grass, yeah.   
 Q.  (Question off microphone.)  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: I should, yeah.   
 Q.  Are you drawing any comfort from the Raptors perhaps?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, no, it's good to wake up and see this win.  I know everyone in Toronto was excited.  It's exciting for sports also in Canada to have a team like this in the finals.   
You know, there is also other things than tennis, and this is one of the good things, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  You say that you're going to heal rather quickly.  What is your objective for the next few weeks in terms of going back to the game?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: I want to play in Stuttgart on grass in two weeks.  So to say things clearly, my lesion is only a grade 1, so I should heal within seven to ten days if I'm careful.  I hope to be back for Stuttgart.   
If I had played five sets on clay, I run the risk of worsening the lesions.  This is why we decided I should pull back.  And I hope I will be back in a tournament in two weeks.   
 Q.  Does this change anything in your preparation for the future in terms of the number of tournaments, for example, you're going to enter?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yes, maybe I should be more careful in the future.  It's true I was feeling good physically when I got to Lyon.  Several players do that and do two tournaments in a row, but maybe I should learn my lesson.   
But then it's difficult to say why I got hurt.  I'll have to see that.  Nevertheless, as you said, yes, as for everything in my career, I learn every time.   
 Q.  (Question off microphone.)  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yes, it's the first time I'm hurt in that place.  Then obviously these areas are sensitive for a tennis player with the changes in direction and sliding on clay, so I can understand.   
But it's the first time I feel such a pain in that region.   
 Q.  When you move in ordinary life, when you do a little movement, do you still feel it?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, for my life it's okay.  After the match, after semifinals and the finals, obviously it was a bit sore, so it hurt.   
But otherwise, I'm not lame or anything.  I'm not limping.   
 Q.  You said it somewhat in English, but do you regret playing the finals in Lyon?  How did you feel the evening before and in the morning?  Did you have enough examinations before?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, not really, because it's true that after the semifinals I felt this pain, but I felt playing the final was important for me.  I wanted to win a first title, so in the morning when I got up, we thought that after practice maybe and workup, I could see if I felt okay.   
And honestly, before the match and at the beginning of the match, I felt good.  It came back at the end of the first set, that pain.  And then it worsened, so I felt that something was going wrong.   
Nevertheless, personally, I don't think it meant a big difference, playing or not, the finals.
