F. AUGER-ALIASSIME/A. Bolt   
6-3, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You can't be disappointed with that. It was pretty straightforward. Talk about it.  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, for sure. I think he started well, serving good. I was struggling to find my rhythm, find my position on my return at first, but what's obvious and what's for sure, my serve was there today through the whole match.   
I just felt like, you know, it was going to need a lot to shake me on my serve. And on the return, you know, I adjusted my position, came a bit earlier. You know, cut the angle a little bit in the middle of the first and was able to get my first break.   
From there I kind of, you know, was able to make him play every return, and I think that got tough for him.   
But then start of the second, you never know. Could have been like yesterday, 6-3, 7-6. Was able to get the break early, and from there I think he took a hit on that and I was able to just lift off from there.   
 Q.  Did you feel that he was feeling totally overwhelmed with the way it was going in the second set?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, in the second, at one point maybe. In the first, not. He held his service games sometimes with ease. It was tight. I mean, it was one break.   
But then in the second, you know, after I got that first break and there was a long stretch of me winning points, and the crowd was starting to cheer him up and trying to get him back into the match, that's where I felt he might have been a bit overwhelmed.   
But one time he saved 3-Love, saved breakpoint, good serve. In my mind, that's the energy of the crowd, because, you know, he came up with still good shots facing breakpoint down.   
In the end, yeah, I think it was a little too much and I was able to get away with that, and then from there, 4-Love and straightforward.   
 Q.  What about the next round with Rublev? He's coming in with great form.  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: For sure, hottest player probably on tour right now. We are just starting the year. He already has a title, semifinals here. He's on a winning stretch.   
It's going to be tough. I lost to him last time on clay. Different time, for sure. We all know what he's able to do. He beat Roger last year.   
So for sure it's not going to be easy. I think we're both playing well right now, so hopefully we will bring our A games and it will be a good battle. But I believe in my chances, for sure.   
 Q.  Do you think a test against someone like Rublev before the Australian Open is kind of exactly what you would want right now?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: I think I already got some good test in the ATP Cup, you know, playing Jan Struff and even Dusan that was playing really well. I think I got some pretty good test to see where my game was.   
This week I adjusted a few things. Maybe not playing as high-ranked opponents the first two matches, but still, I feel like against any player, the way I'm playing now is where I want my game to be.   
But tomorrow, for sure, if I can get the win, it's going to be good for my confidence leading to the Australian Open. That's the type of matches I'm looking for, for sure.   
 Q.  Did you get a chance to see the draw for the Australian Open, or are you trying not to look at it before you leave here?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, I don't want to know. It's okay. I'm not there yet, to be honest.   
I'm here in Adelaide playing semis tomorrow, and, yeah, you can keep it for yourself.   
 Q.  I won't say anything.  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Thank you.   
 Q.  I can tell you who it is.  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, that's okay.
