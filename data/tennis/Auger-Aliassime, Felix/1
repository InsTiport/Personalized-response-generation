6-2, 6-3
Q. How did you find today's game?
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME:   It was, I mean, not good, for my part.  It was tough.  I think he played a good match.  Credit to him for today.  He did what he had to do.  He played well.  He was aggressive, mixing it up well, and I just didn't play a good match overall for my part.
