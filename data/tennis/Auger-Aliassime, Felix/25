U. HUMBERT/F. Auger-Aliassime
6-4, 7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Was the break on 3-5 in the second set kind of the turning point of the match?
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, maybe even before.  I mean, the first set was pretty bad itself.  I don't know.  I felt like the whole match was a turning point.
The whole match was just -- it was just tough, like, I just didn't -- I felt maybe the first few games I started okay, and then from the first time I got broken, even though I got the lead, I was fighting.  Yeah, I just felt pretty bad out there today.
Q. Did you have any kind of warning sign that this was going to be not a good day for you, the warmup?
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: No, no, everything was fine.  I mean, you never know.  Once you step on court...  I started okay, you know, with the right intentions.  And then, I don't know, I just feel like, yeah.  Today, it's weird to describe.
Pressure got to me, and it was just...  Yeah, I mean, it got to a point where, like, it was a bit embarrassing.  Yeah, it was just tough, like, I just wasn't finding ways.  I think he just did what he had to do.  It was solid.  From my end it was pretty embarrassing.
