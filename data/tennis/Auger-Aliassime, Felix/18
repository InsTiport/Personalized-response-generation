 Q.  A tough one, how do you make that change in your mindset finding out just before the match that you're not playing Nick but you're playing John Millman?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Yeah, it's a different approach, obviously different types of players, longer rallies with John. I think today with these conditions maybe a bit better matchup for him, but even though I beat him before, I thought that I have what it takes, I can come out as a winner of this match, but he proved me otherwise. He was very solid, even though I had a great start, I think I took him by surprise playing some of my best tennis, I wasn't able to keep the level and then he was just getting better and better, I wasn't finding solutions, basically, and so the outcome is clear and he was a winner. But I think in the end it was the margins were not so big, so I still come out positive for the upcoming matches.   
 Q.  Now you mentioned the margin, obviously he's part of Team Australia but he's also from Brisbane, did you feel like a little extra push from the local fans today, kind of lifting him up on their shoulder as bit?  
FELIX AUGER-ALIASSIME: Well, for sure the energy from the fans were great, chanting from the warm up, obviously you feel that extra energy with them. I think he certainly felt it because I played him before at France last year and I felt like I was playing a different guy today, someone that was ready for a lot, was giving on every point, and credit to him too to be able to come out with these shots in difficult conditions like this and to be able to be that solid is just a credit to him and I'll just keep working on myself.
