A. MURRAY/P. Herbert
6-2, 4-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. Is it satisfying to push a player like him to a third set or do you have some regrets?
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: A bit of both.  Of course, I'm disappointed that I lost.  I want to beat that kind of player.  I want to do to those players what I did to him today:  imposing my game, having them lose confidence.  I was able to do that for one set, but I didn't do it for the whole match.
In the end, he made the difference.
So the feelings are mixed feelings.  It's the first time I was able to win a set against a player like him, so I'm getting close to that level.  In Miami I had a set point, but I wasn't able to convert it, so little by little I'm improving.
Q. In the third set, what made the difference?  Maybe he served better?  Were you tense?
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: Yes, he served better.  He was more aggressive.  He played at his usual level.  In the second set, he showed some weaknesses.  I was not playing that well.  My percentage of first serve was a catastrophe.  I didn't succeed with my first serves during the whole first set.  But finally I was able to find other solutions in my game.  Usually I rely a lot on my first serve.
In the third set, he was very solid.  Although in the beginning of the set, I was pushing him hard.  I was playing well.  But I missed a forehand volley, and that hurt me because I was having him doubt.
But after that, he played like Andy Murray plays.  He played well, and I made some mistakes, I lost my serve.
