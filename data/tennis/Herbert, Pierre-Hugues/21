P.H. HERBERT/P. Polansky   
6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  How did you manage yesterday the interruption and how did you resume playing today?  
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: It wasn't easy to manage, because I had a lot of images playing around while I was falling asleep.  So it was hard for me to fall asleep last night.   
I had 6-3, 4-2.  The end of the set was quite good.  Then, it was actually a good thing in the end, because I managed to refocus, to analyze what was going on.  And I'm quite proud of what I did.  I managed to handle it quite well.   
And my game this morning was quite good.   
 Q.  What did you change overnight in your mindset or your level of game?  
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I didn't change much because, actually, when I started, I was quite good yesterday.   
I went back to what I was doing at first, and I tried to keep my composure when it was harder.  And during the third set, I managed to hold my position, and this is how I won the battle.   
 Q.  This morning you practiced with Jeremy.  Tomorrow you're playing against him on Court 1. What is your feeling playing against him tomorrow in the French Open?  
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I'm very happy he won.  It's always better to have two Frenchmen in the second round.  That means that there will be one Frenchman during the third round, no matter what.   
It's not an easy round.  I don't think that I am a favorite here.  Because he's had good results on clay court so far and this year.   
I know my strengths.  I know that I can disturb him.  It would be wonderful to win, but there's a long path to go, and it's difficult because he's quite good right now.   
 Q.  You seem to be more consistent.  I asked the question to your opponent at the end of the match, and he said that it was hard for him.  Can you tell us all the work that you've performed to manage to get that level?  
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: It's a wonderful thing that you're noticing it.  Obviously, it's part of my game I worked on so much.  When he said that it was hard, I think this is because there was a lot of work that has been performed for some time.  And as the years pass by, I actually improved myself.   
Indeed, I did a good match yesterday and this morning over two days on that level.   
 Q.  A word on the doubles.  It was a thrilling match.  It's done now.  How was the third set?  
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: It's always hard to have doubles during the first round.  It always goes fast.   
We managed to win the first set.  The second wasn't too bad.  And then there's one game which is bad, and then we have a U-turn, and then we have a break during the third set, and we managed to get back.  We even saved some break points during the third one.   
So it's actually a worthy match to get to the second round.  And we're very happy with Nicolas to be there and to play in doubles, in a doubles tournament.
