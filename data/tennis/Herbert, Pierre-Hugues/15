M. KUKUSHKIN/P.H. Herbert
3-6, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. To go back to the match, there was a lot of points when you had a lot of the rallies, a lot of challenges, a lot of balls that were really a few millimeters away from the sideline.  Was it frustrating?
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I'm very frustrated.  I haven't been that unwell for a very long time after such a loss.  I had a break ball at the end of the third, a forehand stroke along the line, with just a few millimeters off.  He was more accurate and precise than I was.  And this is very frustrating not to have won.
Q. What about what is next?  You have the Davis Cup, the doubles.  Do you take every scheduled event in the order one after the other?
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: This was my last match of the season as singles.  It's a bit hard to end the season like this.  Then I will now play with doubles.  I will start tomorrow.  We'll try to with Nicolas to find our path together, to play well in doubles.  And then the Masters and the Davis Cup, well, we wait and we will wait and see if we're part of the team.  But there are big goals to reach before that.
Q. Among many French players who played today, they said that they didn't know how they will wrap up this season.  They don't know yet if they're on holidays or if they should continue practicing.  As far as you're concerned, what do you think?  You should know quite quickly?
PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I don't really have that problem because I'm not on holidays.  For those who have finished their tournament and who do not have doubles matches, of course they should be warned quickly if they are to be part of the group or not.
As far as I am concerned, this is not something that will have an impact on me.  We still have tournaments before the end of the year.  So of course, it is important to know ahead of time so as to think ahead, but we can wait till the end of the week, no problem.  Thank you.
