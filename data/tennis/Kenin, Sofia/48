D. GALFI/S. Kenin
7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Congratulations on a great tournament.
SOFIA KENIN: Thank you.
Q. How did you feel that you played today?
SOFIA KENIN: I played really good.  I was fighting till the end, and she has a really good serve so it's really tough to play if she's having a good serve.
But overall it was a great tournament.  I felt I did the best I can in the finals.
Q. I think you had two set points when she was serving at 4-5.
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah.
Q. She hit some good serves.
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah, like, I literally didn't do anything wrong.  Like I got like a tough ball back and she hit a winner at the net.
It was her serve.  I didn't really do anything wrong.
Q. In the second set, can you kind of take me through how that went?
SOFIA KENIN: Well, I knew I had to keep my serve if I wanted to stay in the match.  I lost it, and that changed everything.  After that I kept my serve and her serve was really hard.
It was getting better.  It's just really hard to compete.  Like it's really hard to get the ball back when she's hitting a really, really good serve.
It was tough, but like when I had -- I did try, so...
Q. Could you reflect on this last week?  Maybe your whole experience here at the Open since you started here in the first round?
SOFIA KENIN: A while ago.  It was very good.  It was such a great experience playing in the main draw.  That was a great experience, also.  And then coming and training really hard and just to get the finals it's really great.
It's unfortunate to have lost it, but I did everything I can to try and win.  I had some really good matches, and I was playing really good.
So I didn't like get beat.  Like I was right there.  Just the serves, it was really tough.  I'm really happy overall how I played.
Q. Can you tell me what your plans are for the next few months.
SOFIA KENIN: Train, of course.  I think -- I'm not so sure if I'm going to play Eddie Herr, but Orange Bowl.  Try to retain that title again.
Q. You have had a lot of success since maybe the Orange Bowl kind of started you off on this path.  Do you have any goals?  Obviously you want to win the Orange Bowl again, but you have another year in juniors.  Are you going to continue to play juniors?
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah, definitely playing juniors and just take one match at a time and hopefully do good.  I mean, I'm playing really good right now, so, I mean, I should be doing good.
Q. Is there any pro circuit tournaments on your schedule?
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah, October 3.  I don't know exactly where they are.  I think it's like a 25 and another 25, I think.  I know the last one is a 50, for sure, so I will play those, for sure.  It's driving distance, so that's good.
Q. Can you explain the feeling, what it was like to be at the US Open, American turf?  You're the American representative, and you were playing in your first slam final.  What beyond just the match was involved with the feelings?
SOFIA KENIN: It was great.  I was so happy to be in the finals and I was so happy with the crowd.  Everyone just started coming as the match went on and they were supporting me.  It was really nice.
But the one person that really supported me most was my dad and my family back home.  I'm really happy.
Q. You keep growing and getting better and more experienced.  What are you taking away from this one?
SOFIA KENIN: What do you mean?
Q. Oh, you keep growing, winning the Orange, having great success.  What are you taking away from this tournament?
SOFIA KENIN: Just how I'm playing, just with the match play.  I'm really confident.  Just because I lost this final won't change the way -- won't change my confidence and won't change how I'm playing, because I'm playing really well right now.
