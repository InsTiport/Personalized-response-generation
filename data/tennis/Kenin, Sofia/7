6-2, 6-0
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. A less dramatic day today out on Chatrier.  Can you talk through the match.  What do you think was the difference in this match compared to your matches previous that were a little bit more tricky?
SOFIA KENIN:   Yeah, well, I mean it wasn't as dramatic, which I'm quite happy about.  I kind of was a little bit tired of those dramatic matches.  I just wanted to just try to start off well and finish off really well.
But of course, towards the end I just started getting a little bit careless.  I started like doing dropshots towards the end, like just for fun.  I was like, Why not?  Let's just do dropshots.  But then she obviously picked up her game.
Yeah, it's nice getting like 12 games in a row, I have to admit.
Q. You came out of the Australian Open with so much momentum and then, boom, the pandemic hits.  I was wondering if you feel as if it just kind of cost you competitively, maybe even commercially.  Can you speak to what that's been like?  It probably feels like it was 10 years ago when it was just 10 months ago.
SOFIA KENIN:   Yeah, I was quite devastated what happened, of course what's going on around the world.  But speaking about myself, it was obviously devastating.  Obviously I was looking forward to the American swing and all the American tournaments.  I felt like I was playing some of my best tennis, and just all of it shut down.  Obviously it changed things, put a lot of things for me in perspective.
So, yeah, it was quite devastating but then I didn't have a choice, that's what it was.  The timing wasn't the best.  Obviously, I think it's the first time ever that happened after someone wins a major.  So I was like, that's just my luck.
But I just try not to, like, get too down on myself, even though I was obviously for some time, but then try to somehow regroup.  As soon as I knew tournaments are happening, I started getting the motivation again.
And, yeah, so I mean, I had good matches at like World TeamTennis in Charleston at the exhibition.  So it was just good to be out of the house.
But, yeah, overall it was fine.
Q. Was there any silver lining that you can see in retrospect to having that stoppage right after you have this amazing breakthrough?
SOFIA KENIN:   Well, I guess it gives me a chance to work on my game, more fitness.  So obviously I try to take the positive, whatever it was, even if it was just like a little thing.  But, yeah, that's basically the only positive.
Of course, yeah, just being at home obviously is way different.  I'm always on the road, I'm always complaining how I'm always not home.  And now I was home for some time, so now I was complaining when I would be back on tour again.  So, yeah.
Q. You've now made the round of 16 at all three majors this year.  That's a very short list of players that have been able to do that in this wild and crazy year.  But does it feel to you as though you have that slam consistency this season?  I know sometimes players can think that it's a lot more up-and-down than we do or vice versa.  So kind of where do you see your slam level in 2020?
SOFIA KENIN:   I mean of course, Australia was the best.  Unless I win the French, then it would be the second best.
But yeah, I feel like I'm playing well at the slams.  Obviously I feel like I should get deep in a tournament.  I'm a bit hard on myself.  It's a little bit different mindset now coming into the slams.  Of course, each match is a match, and I'm really happy with winning every match.  It's not easy, everyone is playing best tennis at the Grand Slam.
But I definitely feel like I should get deep in a tournament.  And I'm really hoping that I can do well in the fourth round, yeah, just for the next round.
Q. It's interesting that you say that because a lot of players try, after they have their big slam win, they say, I'm just going to try and keep it the same.  I'm going into every slam thinking the same as I did before, regardless of whether or not I won one.  And you're saying that it's a little bit different.  How different does it feel going into the US Open, going into Roland Garros, and what is it concretely that is different for you?
SOFIA KENIN:   Well, I'm high-seeded.  I obviously know that first two rounds I'm not going to play a seeded player.  Of course each match is a match and you know you got to prepare physically and mentally.
But, yeah, two matches I know I'm not going to play a seeded player, which is good.  So kind of gets me, gets me in a groove.  And then of course third round, seeded players and drama I guess you could say, that would be more dramatic.  Well, that's how it is.  At the slams anyone can win on any given day.
Q. Do you feel as if the dynamic has changed when you're doing news conferences this way as opposed to in Melbourne when you were face-to-face with your inquisitors?  How does it, if at all, does it change the dynamic for you?
SOFIA KENIN:   I mean, it doesn't really change much for me in terms of how I am during the press conference.  But of course this is not nice, I don't like it like this.  I prefer how in Melbourne, I came and everyone was like in the room.  I was really surprised by how much, how many people were in the room after winning.  Each matches that I won there were more and more people were there.
So obviously I miss it and I hope it's going to get back to normal soon.
Q. On that, when you're playing at the US Open or you're playing here in Paris and you know that the grounds are relatively empty, it's for the most part just you players and the staff and everything.  Is it sometimes easy to forget that you're playing a slam and not just, you know, a regular tournament or any other week?  I mean, what is it about playing either at the US Open or Roland Garros that is the reminder to you that you are playing a major?
SOFIA KENIN:   Honestly, when I'm playing a major, I know it's a major regardless if there's going to be people or no people.  Of course when people are there, you know, they really hype, they're so like into it.  Obviously I use their energy to help me.
But, yeah, I mean, I feel like once you're at a major you know you're at a major.  If you don't think that, then that's quite crazy because obviously you can tell that you're in a Grand Slam, you get days off and you win, it's a good feeling.  And then, yeah, and vice-versa, I guess if you lose, it's not a good feeling.
Q. Can you just look ahead, you'll play either Fiona Ferro or Patricia Marie Tig who are on Chatrier right now.  How familiar are you with each one of those opponents and can you just talk about the potential challenges with each?
SOFIA KENIN:   Patricia I never played, but I know she's having, she's had some good wins coming into Roland Garros.  I was actually watching before coming here, so I watched a little bit but probably just like one, two games, so that's obviously not enough.
But Fiona, I played her a few years ago in Charleston that's first round in qualifying.  If I'm correct I won like 7-5, 6-1 or 6-2, I don't remember, but it was a touch match, she's obviously a good player, clay court player, she's got a big forehand, big serve, she's got great touch.  She had a really good win a few days ago since Rybakina and of course she's using the crowd to help her, so I'll just have to watch after this and then I'll come up with a plan.
Q. I ask you, yesterday, Halep say that she would be happy if Roland Garros were played twice a year.  I wonder if is there a tournament that you would like to play twice a year?
SOFIA KENIN:   Australian Open for sure.  Unless I win Paris, then that might change or not, I don't know, but right now Australian Open for sure.
