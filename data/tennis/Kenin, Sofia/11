THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Would you reflect on this crazy year given all that's happened.  Once you get a chance to soak this in, you'll step back and take a look at your year in a positive way.
SOFIA KENIN:   Yes, definitely.  It has been a really crazy year.  Started off really well, then the virus happened, everything got shut down.
Yeah, I'm overall happy with how I came back after the whole virus.  Cincy wasn't good, I wasn't playing well.  Here I found my game, found my level, which I was really happy about.
I did better at US Open than I usually do, fourth round, that's better.  This is not funny, but somehow you have to joke around (laughter).
I'm going to take the positives from here, try to forget this match.  Yeah, I cried after already.  Just trying to hold it back right now.  Not happy about that match, but we'll see.
Q. What do you do in the first set like that when she is zoning, playing clean tennis?
SOFIA KENIN:   I mean, I wish I could have found a way because I know her game.  She obviously played well.  I obviously did not bring my game that I wanted to bring against a player like her.  You have to have your game, not make that many mistakes like I did.
Yeah, I mean, she was playing well.  I almost came back in the first.  Yeah, I tried to just stay, hang in there, even though I wasn't feeling 100% clearly game-wise.  Yeah, obviously that did not succeed today.
Nothing much you can do if she's playing some good tennis, being aggressive, being the one that's taking control, and I'm on the run like almost every point.  It's kind of hard to play.
The only thing I can say is just be on offense, not much of a secret, and I guess a bit of luck would also help.
Q. Looking ahead, because there are more tournaments, what is your plan?  Are you planning to go to Europe and do the Rome, Roland Garros situation?
SOFIA KENIN:   Yeah, definitely I'm going.  We will go, like, probably in two, three days.  I know my mom is going to bring some stuff back here since I'm not going home.
Yeah, just hang around a few days here, just relax.  Yeah, I'm heading over to Rome.  Possibly Strasbourg, I'm not sure, but for sure on Paris.
Q. There's no preparation for any of what we're going through, especially for you guys.  How do you handle playing the US Open, now play clay, the transition?  Are you usually pretty good and quick about the transition from hard to clay or does that normally take you a little bit of time?
SOFIA KENIN:   I mean, of course I have to get used to it.  It's different.  Obviously French before US Open.  It is what it is.  I'm happy that the tournaments are happening.
I feel like it's easier for me to adjust if it's a slower surface.  I think it's easier for me to go from hard to clay than clay to hard directly.  I guess I have to leave early and practice a bit, hopefully find a good groove there and slide because clay you got to slide a lot.  You got to return a lot of balls, you got to be physical there.
Q. At Roland Garros how are you with respect to your confidence level at that slam?  Is it a slam you enjoy?  Huge win there.  Do you like playing Roland Garros?
SOFIA KENIN:   Yeah, I love Roland Garros a lot.  I had a really great one last year.  I feel like after that things just started clicking for me.  I started playing better.  I found my great tennis.
Yeah, I mean, I love Paris for starters.  Yeah, I'm super excited to be there.  Hopefully I can do well there.
Q. How have you learned to deal with these losses as you get on the tour a little bit longer?  Do you think you're dealing with them better, able to compartmentalize and move on?
SOFIA KENIN:   Well, I mean, a loss is a loss.  I never like to lose.  I hate losing.  Like I said, I cried after.  Yeah, this is not something that I like.  Obviously it's gotten better since I'm not losing that much.
Yeah, it's not really something that I like.  Obviously I just got to -- I guess I'll take a few days just to finally go back on the court and everything.  Yeah, tonight is not going to be such a great night because obviously I'm pretty bummed about what happened.
Yeah, hopefully I can just, you know, whenever I play, come back.  I had a good tournament here.  I'm real happy with the way I played.  I feel like my confidence is there.  Still nothing has changed.
Yeah, I'm excited to head over to the clay.
