THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I'm curious for you, you were having such an amazing start to your 2020, winning Australia and winning another title before the stoppage happened, too.  How tough was it for you having to stop, given how well things were going?
SOFIA KENIN:   Of course.  Yeah, it's tough.  Really upset that this happened, but I really hope everything is going to go back to normal.
Definitely felt I was playing really well.  I was the highest level I could ever be in my career.  So of course was a little bit upsetting.  I had no motivation after that.
But I'm picking myself back up and I'm playing well right now, and we will see how it's going to keep going.
Q. How did you work on your motivation?  Where does that come from?
SOFIA KENIN:   The quarantine, at the beginning, once everything was canceling week after week, it was hard when you see the whole schedule, three months of no tournaments, no competition, nothing.
Of course it's a bit hard, but my dad really helped me with motivation.  He told me of course it's tough, but just try to do the best you can to motivate yourself.  He helped me with that.
Of course, once I found out I'm going to Charleston to play an exhibition and then WTT, World TeamTennis, which was a lot of fun, motivation was right there.  I was playing well and really fired up and super happy to be back on court and competing.  Now I'm back here at the Big Apple, the Big Bubble, so it's nice to be back (smiling).
Q. Between World TeamTennis and now, how much more used to the bubble are you because you had World TeamTennis behind you?
SOFIA KENIN:   Definitely used to it.  I have been there at World TeamTennis.  Everyone was taking all precaution.  All testing, everyone was six feet apart, wearing masks.
I'm used to these crazy times already.  I was there for three weeks.  But I really enjoyed it there.  Here, I'm following all the rules, doing everything I can to keep myself, my dad, all others around me safe and healthy.
So, yeah, I'm quite used to it, but of course would like to be done with this already, so if we can walk with no masks and go back to normal life.
Q. What did you do between?  Three weeks or so?  What did you do?
SOFIA KENIN:   After WTT?  I just practiced.  You know, just had some good practices.  I hit with Vika, Monica Puig, Tomljanovic.  I have been keeping myself busy during this time.
Q. During the stoppage, especially at the beginning, is there anything that you did that perhaps you never had time to do before?  I just want to know what were you up to in terms of nontennis stuff?
SOFIA KENIN:   Well, I have been playing every day after the whole quarantine for like three months nonstop.  Yeah, I worked a bit on my game, coming in to the net more, working on my serve, different aspects of my shots.
Of course I had a lot of time to work on things which obviously I never get a chance to have this much time, but it was a good time.  I tried to do the best I can to get my game better and stronger.
Q. The WTT experience, obviously things are now quite different on-site in New York, but what do you think is the toughest thing to adjust to?
SOFIA KENIN:   WTT experience was a lot of fun.  It was my first time.  I heard a lot from different players it's going to be a great week, so it's going to be really loud, rowdy.
I enjoyed my time there.  I got close with my teammates.  It was a great experience for me and I'd like to play again with WTT in the future.
In terms of here in the bubble, all of us are keeping social distancing, masks, following all protocols, everybody doing a really great job.  Everyone is taking every precaution they can.
I'm used to it, since I have already been at WTT, used to wearing a mask everywhere, so, yeah.
Q. I'm curious for you, two things:  You're one of only four WTA Top 10 players playing these tournaments as of now.  I'm curious what you make of that, six of the Top 10 being out.  Does that change your look at the tournament at all?  And secondly, what's it like having a suite to yourself in the stadium?  Feels like it's one big apartment building of top tennis players now.  They are all neighbors with their balconies and stuff.  Curious what that environment has been like for you.
SOFIA KENIN:   First question, yeah, I obviously wanted to come here and wanted to play.  Like I said, I'm playing and I obviously want to be here, but it's unfortunate the other top six players are not able to come.  Obviously wish they could have come.  This obviously isn't the way life is.
Of course mindset-wise I'm playing the same, exactly as if they would be here or not here, so I just hope everything is going to go back and I will see them next tournaments.
About the suite, I really like it.  I have quite a big suite.  It's really comfortable there.  I have a couch, TV, go outside on the balcony, watch practices on Ashe.
It's a bit special.  I'm really happy with the suites.  It makes us feel a lot better and a bit special.  I'm really grateful for that.
Q. Have you decorated at all, making it feel at home?
SOFIA KENIN:   No, I just order food and I sit back and relax.
