6-3, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you just talk through the match from your side, what do you think, yeah, why didn't it go the way you wanted it to today?  
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah, she played really well, I just feel like I can't find my game, I'm not playing the way I want to be playing, so it's pretty frustrating right now.   
But yeah, creds to her, she played well, came up with some good shots at those important moments, so, yeah, I mean, she just played better at important moments and I just made too many unforced errors, I just felt pretty flat foot the whole match.   
 Q.  How has it felt in practice here in Doha? It can be a little bit tricky conditions, especially in the evening with the wind and things like that. Did that contribute at all, did you feel like the ball wasn't coming off your racket the way you wanted to in practice as well as or it just today in the match?  
SOFIA KENIN: Obviously it didn't feel that great in practice as well, but I felt yesterday in doubles I played well, me and Belinda had a good match against Ash and Demi, obviously I know it's doubles, it's different than singles, but I thought I, I felt good, I thought that I was going to be able to play like that, but obviously not the case.   
 Q.  And then do you feel like at this point -- because after Melbourne you went straight into Fed Cup and you played last week you played this week -- do you feel like you need a break because you didn't really get much of one after Australia?  
SOFIA KENIN: Yeah, no, I didn't get a break, I just kept going. Honestly, it's just finding my rhythm again. I just feel like I'm completely out of it. So it's, obviously it's not good, I'm not happy about it, it's really frustrating, obviously coming off of Melbourne where I felt I was playing the best tennis of my life coming down to playing, not the worst tennis but not playing the tennis I want to be playing.   
 Q.  So are you looking forward -- is the mentality right now like I want to get back on the practice court and hit balls or is it I need to just leave the racket in the bag for a little bit and rest before Indian Wells, what's your mentality at the moment?  
SOFIA KENIN: I mean, we have doubles tonight, so obviously I cannot put my racket away. But obviously don't want to think about anything, I guess. Right now, planning to play Leon, so we'll see how that goes. Yeah, right now I just need to somehow find a way to manage everything and find a way to play my game at least.   
 Q.  It is your first time here in Doha, did you get to visit a little bit the city?  
SOFIA KENIN: No, we didn't go, unfortunately, maybe we might go tomorrow, we'll see, depends on how things go.   
THE MODERATOR: All right. Fantastic. Thank you so much.
