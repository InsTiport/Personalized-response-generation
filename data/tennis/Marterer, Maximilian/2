5-7, 7-6, 7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Did you have a plan against Denis, and how did the plan work?
MAXIMILIAN MARTERER: I mean, the plan was, yeah, first of all, serving well for myself, you know, being tough on my service games that he doesn't get too many chances to break.  That was key today.
Yeah, of course he's playing a really heavy, heavy forehand.  So I tried to keep him a little on his backhand, playing not too much on his forehand, because it's pretty solid, get good bounce in it.
And, yeah, I think I managed it really good after losing first set, especially.  And, yeah, it was good that I could raise the quality of my return that he had, yeah, also some problems in his service games after this.
Q. What do you think changed after the first set?
MAXIMILIAN MARTERER: As I said, I was struggling a little in the first set, like, in the quality of the return.  Some went pretty short.  Some went far out.  So, yeah, it was key to have good length in it.
Yeah, and especially in the second set I did really well with these things, you know.  And, you know, best-of-five it's always a tough match.  So it was, like, open fight in the end of the match, so...
Q. What impressed you about Denis?
MAXIMILIAN MARTERER: Denis is one of the players that play really good first shot after his serve.  So when he started already in, like, first two service games in the match, it was already pretty impressive what he was doing, like, so aggressive from the first shot with his forehand, especially, have a good angle in it.
And it's also, yeah, tough, if you have him playing many forehands, it's always, yeah, pretty tough for me.
