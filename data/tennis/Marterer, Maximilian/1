THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  What was your state of mind before the match?  
MAXIMILIAN MARTERER: Well, in front of the match, I was, like, I believe in my chance.  I know I played some great matches already here in the tournament.   
And, yeah, I just want to challenge him today, and, yeah, I think this is what I also, yeah, achieved today in my match.   
 Q.  What was your first feeling when you hit a Rafa Nadal ball at 100%?  
MAXIMILIAN MARTERER: Yeah, well, I already practiced with him, like, couple years ago.  There was something different in it.   
But, yeah, you know, if he hits a forehand like, yeah, really heavy, it's of course something different compared to any other opponent you have during the year.   
But I think I handled it pretty good.  I mean, I broke him already at -- yeah, at the start.  Maybe he was missing also a few shots, but I was feeling that I came well in the beginning of the match.   
And, you know, I think it was a -- yeah, it was a tough match today, and, yeah, I think the better guy won in the end.
