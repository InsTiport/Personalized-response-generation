P. CUEVAS/M. Janvier   
6-4, 6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  It was not that easy for first round.  What is your feeling after this first match?  
MAXIME JANVIER: I'm still very disappointed.  He's a very good clay court player.   
Conditions were not easy.  It was windy.  I didn't feel stable.  I did my utmost.  He was stronger than I was.  I can't say much about this.   
 Q.  How was he stronger?  
MAXIME JANVIER: He was stronger on some points.  This is why the two first sets were in his favor, and then for the third set he managed to break me.  He was always up in front of me.   
 Q.  Maybe it's hard to have some drawback, but what was your feeling?  
MAXIME JANVIER: It was hard for me to -- I could manage to stay calm, which was positive.   
 Q.  What did you feel about the atmosphere?  Did you feel supported by the French crowd?  
MAXIME JANVIER: I didn't think about that that much.  It's all the best, actually, because I had to be court focused.
