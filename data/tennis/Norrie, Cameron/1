D. GALAN/C. Norrie
4-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Obviously a rough result.  Did you feel there were points when you were close to getting on top or was it always too tight to call?
CAMERON NORRIE:   Yeah, I think when I won the third set, felt like I had a little bit of momentum.  Then he played a little bit more aggressive and teed off on a couple shots.  They found the court.  Gave him some confidence.  I think that was the only part of the match I felt like I was in control.
I mean, I obviously started well, but he clawed back.  He played good.
Q. You've had some good results on clay before, had a good run at the US Open.  What do you think has happened this year?  Since you set foot on the clay, you seem to be playing quite a long way below your normal level.
CAMERON NORRIE:   Yeah, I mean, it's tough to get used to.  But I think I'm just having a lot to work on.  Yeah, could be better.  But no excuses at all.
Yeah, I was just very disappointed with the result, gave it everything and left it all out there.  It's not enough.  Just need to keep looking for more and be able to concentrate for longer periods of time, especially over five sets.
But, no, I've really enjoyed the clay, love these tournaments.  Good to be playing again at least.  Wouldn't be doing anything else otherwise.
Q. Do you have an explanation why all the British singles results have been so poor so far?
CAMERON NORRIE:   No, not really.
Q. The weather, preparation, anything you can put your finger on?
CAMERON NORRIE:   Not for me.  I mean, we all competed as hard as we could.  I guess we came unstuck.  No real excuses really.  Just goes that way sometimes.
Q. I appreciate the draws have been tough, but should we expect better from the Brits when it comes to a foreign Grand Slam?
CAMERON NORRIE:   I mean, yeah, for sure.  I mean, be nice to get a couple of us through to the second round.  I guess we'll just have to wait for the doubles.
It's only ever expectations.  I think we're all competing as hard as we can and everything.  Just come unstuck.  It's tough.  I guess we all need to get better.
Q. I think we all thought that the Battle of the Brits would actually give the British players quite a leg up in these Grand Slams.  Not every other nation played competition to that level.  Did you all feel the same?
CAMERON NORRIE:   I think it did for the US Open.  It was great for that.  It was a great event to get us going with the matches and everything.
Don't think it has anything to do with the French Open.  Everyone else had matches leading up to this, as they obviously played US Open.  Sixth or seventh week back on tour.
Yeah, the Battle of the Brits was great.  It kick-started the US Open for me and a couple other guys, for sure.
Q. Are you going to go to the ATP Cup?  Have you had a decision about going to Australia and quarantining before Christmas?  Andy Murray says he is thinking of going to Australia perhaps before Christmas.
CAMERON NORRIE:   I haven't really thought about the ATP Cup.  I guess we have to go to Australia a little bit earlier this year to prepare and be there in time to quarantine to be able to play the Australian Open.  It's my only option, so I guess, yes, I will be doing that.
Q. How will that affect you if you have to have Christmas Down Under?  I know you have family in New Zealand.  What would be your logistical plans?
CAMERON NORRIE:   I haven't really thought about it too much.  I mean, just go to one of the three cities I think that you can go to to train, kind of do the quarantine there, kind of do a little mini preseason there.  Yeah, I guess that's what the plan will be.  I haven't really thought about it too much.
I'll be going there and just be fully committed, ready to kick-start 2020 [sic].  Obviously it's going to be more of the same in terms of how it is with COVID and everything during these tournaments.  Just prepare for that.
Q. Just on a lighter note, over the last couple months Andy Murray has been giving tennis fans a unique insight in terms of life off the court with his Andy Cam.  This is a great opportunity for you as well to have your own camera.  I was thinking either a Cam Cam, a Norrie Cam.  It's a work in progress.  What sort of unique insights can you give fans about life off the court?
CAMERON NORRIE:   No, I didn't see Andy did that.  I don't think I could offer anything too interesting at the moment.  I'm not doing too much.  I guess just in my room and reading a bunch of novels.  Nothing else to do now.  Listen to some music.  I mean, there's not many distractions and things to do, especially during a week like this.  Just hotel room and courts for the last couple weeks.
But I don't think it will be as interesting as it could be usually.
Q. A couple of ice baths...
CAMERON NORRIE:   Yeah, he loves those.
Q. Mats Wilander said yesterday that Andy should not be taking wild cards at the detriment of perhaps a French player or someone lower down.  Does Andy deserve wild cards?  What side of the debate would you be on?
CAMERON NORRIE:   Yeah, I definitely think he deserves it.  He got given it for a reason.  I mean, he's such a legend of the game.  He wants to be playing.  He definitely deserves it.
Yeah, I didn't see what he said.  Yeah, I mean, you would think Andy deserves a wild card here.  He's obviously played here for a number of years and done very well here.  He's still loving the tennis, he wants to compete, keep pushing for more.  I respect that and love that about Andy.
He doesn't really care about what anyone else is thinking.  He just wants to play.  He's loving the game, loves competing.  He gives everything.
Yes, he definitely deserved it.
Q. I just wondered, tell me, having sat here and listened to press conferences in the first couple days, I detect that players aren't as bothered by the defeats because of the two-year ranking system.  It's not as if ranking points are suddenly dropping off.  Someone sitting here tonight, two sets to love up against a player ranked in the top 150, does that feel as painful as it normally would, not as much to lose this year?
CAMERON NORRIE:   I'm not even thinking about that.  I'm pretty gone, pretty disappointed right now.  Yeah, I think a loss is a loss.  It would be nice to be in the second round for sure.  I don't really think about the points too much, yeah.
