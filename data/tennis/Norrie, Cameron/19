C. NORRIE/H. Zeballos
6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How does it feel to get your first ATP Tour-level win?
CAMERON NORRIE: It feels great.  This whole summer, it's been quite tough.  It's been quite different from college tennis, and I couldn't be more excited to have won my first match at the ATP level.
I'm just looking forward to a match against GaÃ«l.  Excited and just trying to enjoy it.
Q. Best-ever win?
CAMERON NORRIE: Yeah, for sure, my best win.  It was quite nice to know I didn't play my best today.  It's nice to know that I can hang with these guys even if I'm not playing my best tennis.  I can just build on that.
Q. Were you nervous beforehand, before the match?
CAMERON NORRIE: I wasn't actually too nervous.  I was more nervous at the end in the tiebreak.  A little bit tight.  No, I had a couple of big matches earlier this summer, and they prepared me well for that.  This match, for sure, prepared me well for Wimbledon next week.  Yeah.
