6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Quite a big game?  I guess it moves quickly when you're playing against Stan?  
CAMERON NORRIE: I mean, I think he served really well today.  I donated him my serve a couple two, three games, and that was it basically.  But he managed his serve very well, and it was tough for me to get into the rallies against him.   
 Q.  How do you think you would have done on a different surface against him?  
CAMERON NORRIE: I think I would have been probably similar.  Today I didn't serve that great.  I think I served like 40% or something, so it was really low for me.   
It was pretty surprising.  I have been serving so well in days leading up.  I wasn't quite hitting that wide spot on the ad.  That's been my go-to serve.  That was basically what let me down today.   
 Q.  How was it on centre court?  
CAMERON NORRIE: Yeah, such a set court.  Good atmosphere out there.  But, yeah, didn't really feel comfortable on my feet.  I felt like out of the corners I was going to slip, and I didn't really want to tear up my hip or anything.  So I kind of played it safe.  Yeah, it was tough.   
 Q.  Was that particularly that court or generally on grass do you think you're more cautious?  
CAMERON NORRIE: No, I think all week I have been training well, moving great, but I think today I didn't feel -- I was slipping and I didn't feel that true on my feet.   
 Q.  How will you approach the rest of the week now?  
CAMERON NORRIE: Just practice, I guess, and get ready for Eastbourne.   
 Q.  Are you in doubles?  
CAMERON NORRIE: No.   
 Q.  Eastbourne, you did pretty well last year?  
CAMERON NORRIE: Yeah, I won a round last year.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to another opportunity on the grass, another tennis tournament.   
That's the great thing about tennis.  You lose one week and you always got another week to kind of work on and get better.   
 Q.  Do you feel there is a bit more recognition?  Obviously when you were playing here last year, not a lot of people knew about you.  But this year people are getting to know you better.  Was it noticeable out there today?  
CAMERON NORRIE: I think support was in my favor but it was quite tough.  He served well and it was kind of tough to get into the match.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Anything you will do in London while you're here?  I think you said you were looking for somewhere to maybe have a base here?  
CAMERON NORRIE: No, I'm just going to train.  That's about it.
