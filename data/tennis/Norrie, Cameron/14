C. NORRIE/D. Brands
7-5, 6-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That was like a characteristic performance in the way you were under pressure in the third, you turned it around, and you dug deeper than him?
CAMERON NORRIE: Yeah, for sure.  I was trying to focus one point at a time, and it kind of felt like one of the challenger matches like the end of last year where I just toughed it out and managed to play my best tennis towards the end and down the stretch.
But he did well.  He served great.  He managed to play well on my match point in the second set.  I think I was a little rattled by that and thought about that too much in the tiebreak.
But, no, it was a very good contest, and I think it's a good one for me on the grass.
Q. You seemed to be quite happy coming to the net, going for the volleys?
CAMERON NORRIE: Yeah, I think today I was pretty instinctive with my play and volleyed actually really well.  Didn't come in too much.  But he's hitting the ball big and serving big, so it was pretty difficult for me.  But when I did come in, I was pretty clinical.
Q. It was said you didn't always play well against big servers, but you seem to be beginning to get that monkey off your back a bit?
CAMERON NORRIE: For sure, yeah.  I think there are so many great servers out there and so many players with big serves.  I think you kind of have to embrace the challenge.  I think I returned really well today, chipped my forehand well, managed to come up with a couple of big backhand returns in the first set to break him.  Yeah, it was great returning for me.
Q. What do you make of playing Jay in the next round, another all-British matchup?
CAMERON NORRIE: No, I mean, he's a great player, up-and-coming player.  He's playing well.  He plays well on the grass.  I think it's going to be a great matchup.
I'm playing doubles with him at Wimbledon.  It's going to be an interesting one, but I think I'm ready for it and I'm going to take a lot of confidence from the win today.
Q. Have you played doubles with him before?
CAMERON NORRIE: No, first time.  Yeah.
Q. When did you meet Jay?  How long have you known him?
CAMERON NORRIE: I have known him probably -- I really got to know him the first time in Davis Cup when he was selected in France.  We were kind of hitting together, practicing a lot.  So I knew of him, but I kind of met him for the first time there.
Q. Quite a story, isn't it, the two of you both very early in your careers playing for a place in an ATP quarterfinal?
CAMERON NORRIE: I mean, yeah, for sure.  It's going to be a big match.  Lots of pressure, for sure.  I think I'm just going to go out there and enjoy it and just stick to my game.  I think these courts really do suit me.  Well, more than Queen's, anyway.
Q. Why is that?
CAMERON NORRIE: I think they are a little bit slower, and the ball's bouncing a bit higher.  Queen's was very low, and I think I played on the first day at Queen's and it was really quite slippery and the points were really short.  But I do like the courts here.
Q. How are you finding Eastbourne as a tournament and a place to be?
CAMERON NORRIE: I mean, it's great.  We are right by the water.  The weather has been so great.  I think it's supposed to be good all week.
For some reason, I always play well near the ocean, so I don't know if it's a coincidence or not.  But I like it, yeah (smiling).
