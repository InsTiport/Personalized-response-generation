Q.  Very simply, you're obviously a better player than that.  What happened?

LARS BURGSMULLER: I have no idea what happened today.  I just was not on the court.  If I would have played like this the days before, I would have lost also.   So I don't know.  Maybe I slept in good enough.  I have no reason.  I don't know. 

Q.  You struggled right from the off, didn't you? Once you'd given him the confidence to go on from the other night, he grew and grew. 

LARS BURGSMULLER: Yeah.  It was just right from the beginning it was a bad start, and I lost my first service game.  It was a tough game with a lot of deuces.  But I was down a break and it's pretty tough to break him.  I knew that.  But then he was serving unbelievable.  But I thought I can play well from the baseline against him, but even from the baseline I lost most of the points. 

Q.  The best server you've ever played against?

LARS BURGSMULLER: Sorry?

Q.  The best server you've ever played against, would you say?

LARS BURGSMULLER: Yes.  Today, it was  -- he was very good.  When it's windy, it's tough for a good server, but today he proved that he's one of the best servers. 

Q.  Has anything like that happened to you before?

LARS BURGSMULLER: No. 

Q.  You don't want it to happen again?

LARS BURGSMULLER: No.  Actually, was a good tournament for me.  I had three tough matches.  I beat three good guys.  Now in the main draw I beat a good German, a junior and I beat the No. 1 from Austria.  So all together it was a good tournament.

Q.  How little did you sleep? How bad was the night?

LARS BURGSMULLER: I woke up like two times.  I don't know why.  No reason, I don't know. 

Q.  Nerves? Did you feel nervous at all about the occasion? It was a big crowd?

LARS BURGSMULLER: Yeah, of course.  Of course I never played like in front of such a big crowd, and I was a little bit nervous.  But I had fun.  Normally, if I would play like my normal game, it would be great to play in front of a lot of spectators.  But today, I was not showing my best.
