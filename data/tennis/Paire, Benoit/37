  7‑5, 4‑6, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French, please.   
   
 Q.   What is the dominant feeling after this match?   You fought a lot.   
BENOIT PAIRE:   I want to go home, practice.   It was very bad.   I tried my best, but I only practiced three times in three months.   It's not enough, of course.   
I've been fighting since I played in Casablanca.   But this match was very tough.   I wasn't able to play my forehand, and physically it was extremely difficult for me.   
I lack practice.   After one hour of play, I'm tired and I have sore muscles.   It's just that I'm tired.   I shouldn't have played yesterday.   
I tried to play tournaments back‑to‑back, playing Casablanca, Monte‑Carlo.   For the time being, so far, so good.   My knee is all right.   The ultrasound was all right.   But my knee bothers me when I play.   
Since I came back after three months without playing, I was only five or six hours on the court, including that match.   
Congratulations to MontaÃ±es, and I wish him good luck against Novak.   
   
 Q.   Do you think about your knee when you're playing?  
BENOIT PAIRE:   Well, this is not the only reason.   I have no reference points on the court anymore.   I can't feel the balls anymore.   I need to work on the basics again with my coach.   
In spite of all this, I was able to make the quarterfinals in Casablanca, and I lost here in three sets.   I did have some opportunities in the beginning of the third set that I didn't take advantage of.   
So that's what I'm doing:   trying my best.   
   
 Q.   What are you going to do now?  
BENOIT PAIRE:   Well, as I said, I want to go home.   I want to take care of my health, do my treatments, and practice.   
If the pain is not too bad, I'll play Barcelona, Estoril.   But I know this evening I'm going to feel a lot of pain in my knee.   
I will start working physically and doing rehabilitation a bit more when I will feel less pain.   I was doing rehab in Aix‑en‑Provence.   
   
 Q.   Mentally how do you feel?  
BENOIT PAIRE:   It's tough because what I like is playing good tennis, a beautiful game.   I'm just not able to do that.   It's a catastrophe.   My forehand goes right down at the bottom of the net.   It's awful.   
But I'm trying my best.
