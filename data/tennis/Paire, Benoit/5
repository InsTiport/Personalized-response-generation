Q. How did you recover after that second set?
BENOIT PAIRE: It was not easy. When you have a lot of chances and when you serve for the match, when you lead 6-4 in the tiebreak, it's not easy. But I'm very happy because my team stayed with me, told me to stay focused in the match. I was playing good so they told me to just keep like this and we'll see. And very happy about the third set. I served very well in the third set, so it helped me a lot. Yeah, it was a good match because Dusan is a very good player, so very happy about the win and to win 1-0 for the moment it's good for us.
Q. How important was that kind of a huddle with your guys after that second set?
BENOIT PAIRE: Honestly, you know, if I'm alone on court I can break more than the racket, I can destroy all my racket and leave the court. So that's why they told me, Just stay relaxed and you will see what happens. For the moment you play good, it's a good match, a lot of winner; some mistakes, but it was very important for me to stay focused for the team. So when Gael came and told me, Yeah, you have to fight, you have to fight for the team, I did it, so that's why I'm happy.
