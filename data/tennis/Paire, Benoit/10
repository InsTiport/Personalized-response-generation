R. BAUTISTA AGUT/B. Paire   
6-3, 7-5, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  The evolution of the match, what happened?  You felt in the second set that the match was going away from you?  
BENOIT PAIRE: No, the thing is I'm injured since three or four days already.  I tried to do my best but it's not easy.   
I have a tear in my abdominal, so I try to serve, like, 60%, 70%, but it's tough.  When you play against Bautista, it's not easy.  I couldn't practice.   
Against Vesely it was good, and after the match I felt.  So honestly, it's not easy.  I'm sad, because it's a good draw to play Roberto in last 16, and that's the thing, that's why I'm sad.   
But it's not about the match.  Roberto play like usual.  When I play him, it's every time the same.  The only thing is when you are injured, it's just sad because you can't do what you want when you want.
