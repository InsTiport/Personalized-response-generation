Q. Arantxa, can you talk a little bit about how you're playing, what your expectations
are for the tournament maybe compared to past years?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, I think it was not an easy match. I mean, she hits a lot
of spin. I feel very comfortable. Maybe the first games I make some easy mistakes. But I
always have to be very patient because she was playing very deep. I felt that I play, you
know, better than the past two days. Now I'm just looking forward to play the next match,
and hopefully be focused and playing as good as I done today and keep going.

Q. Arantxa, the fact that there are so few English language reporters here, do you
suppose the American reporters are discounting your chances of winning this tournament?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: I don't care about that. I mean, that's their problem. I mean,
I'm trying to just play my own game and, you know, try to do well, keep winning. If the
attention is on the other players, that takes pressure off me and I can sneak around and
keep winning. But that's something that I don't worry too much about, you know. Obviously
the other ones want much more than me, but this has nothing to do with keep going.

Q. Do you like your position, that so many folks seem to be expecting so little from
you?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: Well, it's been talking so much. But, like I say, I'm focused
about this tournament and that's all I thinking right now.

Q. Have you played in the stadium yet, the new stadium?

ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO: No. I play stadium three the first day and stadium two the day
before yesterday and today.
