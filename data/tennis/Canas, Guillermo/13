Q.  I just wanted to get your feelings on the match out there today and what you actually thought of David's form. 
 
GUILLERMO CANAS:  My feeling, I think today I paid the price to pay like last two matches, five set.  I think I don't be 100 percent in my physical.  I think David played very well.  He made me run too much in the beginning of the match, and then I start to get tired.  I think I have a little problem in my legs.  But, I don't know, I'm happy because for me was one step up in my career.  I didn't think before I start this tournament to, I don't know, be in the second week of this tournament.   I'm happy.  I try to continue play like this, to - I don't know.  Maybe in few months I stay in the first position in the world.  
 
Q.  Do you think David could win this tournament? 
 
GUILLERMO CANAS:  Yeah, for sure.  I think David, he have a lot of chance to win this tournament.  He play very unbelievable tennis.  He's, I don't know, very confidence in his tennis.  I think is one of the, I don't know, most important candidate to win this tournament.  Now is in quarterfinal.  Everything is possible after.  Is three more matches to win the tournament.  Is not a lot.  I think he's one of the, I don't know, one of the best to take this title.
