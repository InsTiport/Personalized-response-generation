  7‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you see that, Bernie?   Tough match?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, pretty good match.   Happy the way I played and fought, so it was pretty good today.  
   
 Q.   That's obviously the sort of hit‑out you want and need at the moment?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, very tight match.   We played good points.   It was good tennis.   Good for the crowd, very entertaining.  
Yeah, it was just solid.   And I did some stuff after, worked on a little bit of things so hopefully next tournament I can play a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   What are the things you're working on?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Just a few things on my game.   I did some stuff with my dad.   It's irrelevant what we were doing, but we did some stuff.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to do from here?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   I'm going to Eastbourne tomorrow so I have to play quallies.   Hopefully I can drop in to play.   I'm six out, so we'll see.   
Hopefully I can play well there, win some matches in the main draw, qualify.   That will be good.  
And then for the big one at Wimbledon, we are all getting ready for that one so I can play as best as I can there like I always do.  
   
 Q.   Did you ask for a wildcard at Eastbourne?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   No.   No, I didn't.   I don't need one.   I need a few more matches.   I think I'll be seeded very good in quallies, so it was good to get one, two matches there.   Who knows?   Maybe I'll fall in without the need of a wildcard.   
Matches are going to be good for me.   If I'm in quallies, that's kind of what I want right now and need.  
   
 Q.   Obviously working your way back from your injuries.   How is your confidence level at the moment?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Pretty good.   Today was a good match.   Could have gone either way.   I was happy I fought in, showed a bit of heart out there being down a break in the second.  
It was good, good to come back and give it a shot in the tiebreak.
