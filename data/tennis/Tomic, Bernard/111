B. TOMIC/G. Muller
  3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What did you think of your performance tonight? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, definitely can't ask for anything, you know, better. He's played unbelievable. I was lucky to get that first set. He didn't start serving well. But after that was a bit hard because his serve was going in. Once that started happening, it was too hard for me. 
 But I played well. I was happy with this tournament. I couldn't be any happier to get through that first round. It gave me a lot of confidence. Maybe if I had finished it off in the second set I might have got that first, second set. Got a little bit tired in the second set. It was a bit different. Hopefully I can learn. That's the best part of it.

 Q. How did you find the general experience? There was a debate beforehand about whether you should be playing on Rod Laver?
 BERNARD TOMIC: It was a great opportunity to play in front of the crowd in the biggest arena here. I was thankful for that. Like I said, I was happy to get on a roll in the first set, but after that I couldn't do pretty much anything else. 

 Q. Your opponent came here and said he felt you actually settled down. Did you feel pretty comfortable out there early on?
 BERNARD TOMIC: I did. I felt pretty good in the first set. It was getting a bit late and my eyes started falling in the second set. That's what probably caused me to lose that second and third set. I learned from that and had a great tournament, and hopefully I can improve.

 Q. People often comment on your composure. Have you always been like that?
 BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, it's something that I've learned to deal with. That's life. I'm just improving. I've got to improve more. That's what I'm ready for.

 Q. Could you sense the crowd out there? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah. I mean, I could. They were giving me motivation. But there was nothing I could do when he was serving every serve aces.

 Q. What's next for you? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Well, have a rest. I'm playing the mixed here, too. Hopefully I can give that a shot and hopefully get down to Tasmania for a challenger. From there we'll have to see.

 Q. What do you take out of the experience of the two matches that you can build on and learn from? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Well, what more is there? To play in my first Grand Slam and to win a round was my dream. To have a shot in the second round, you know, to be close to this player, it was a good feeling for me. 
 But I couldn't do anything in the second, third set. He was playing too good for me. That's it. 

 Q. Any goals for the rest of the year? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Just keep on improving and improving my ranking. I've done that here a little bit, but hopefully I can step it up in the next few tournaments when I play.

 Q. Did your dad have much to say after the match? 
 BERNARD TOMIC: He just said, Well done. You couldn't do anything. It's his birthday today, so happy birthday. I'm sorry I couldn't win, but that's all right. Hopefully I can be back here next year.

 Q. Who do you think will win the tournament?
 BERNARD TOMIC: Well, I'd love to say Muller, but I think Federer again.
