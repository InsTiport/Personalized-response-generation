  6‑3, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Perfect started to the tour year.   A bit nervous at the start and then it all clicked? 
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, was pretty windy out there first game.   Took me a while.   He was obviously very energetic and made good returns on his first three points.   I was a little bit tight.   I did good to come back to that deuce and then lost that game.
I felt like after that I was just on the ball.   I was trying to focus on my tennis and not on his.   Then I managed to play really good and I was happy. 

Q.   I don't see that they gave permission here for John to be in the crowd.   This court last year was a place you had a nice moment.   Nice to have him?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, it was good.   Having my dad there is a very good feeling.   Obviously winning my first title here gives a lot of memories to me.   I'm happy the way I played today.   Having my dad there for the first time in a while, it's good.
I know his ban will finish very soon, in a few months, and back to helping me.   I'm happy.   Today that was the position.   I played very good.   Felt very good.   I'm happy to be back playing like this.

Q.   With the new coaching staff, how much is John still having input in the whole thing?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Obviously my dad is still there.   He's the one that you taught me to play like this.   Spent hours with him that I probably won't spend with no one in my life.   He knows me the best.
He's one of the reasons I am who I am today.   Obviously my new coach is helping me out in a new way.   Still got my dad on my side, which is very important to me.   I think it's a very good team. 
I've always got two open minds and they're helping me.   I'm positive with it and thankful for that. 

Q.   Is there some contingency there for Melbourne given that he can't go on the grounds?   Do you have chats with him after matches and that kind of thing?   Is he going to be down there supporting you in other ways? 
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, well moved down to Melbourne, so Melbourne is home for me now.   Obviously he can't come in, but that's fine.   I'll see him at home.   If there is anything I need to hear, he'll tell me.   It's very good.   E.
Like I said, I'm happy to be playing back in the tournaments.   It's amazing for me.   I'm improving.   That's the most important thing. 

Q.   When you came here last year you had just beaten Novak in Perth.   Can you compare how you feel like you're traveling now compared to here 12 months ago?
BERNARD TOMIC:   I probably wouldn't say I'm‑‑ you know, the year has gone by quickly.   It's tough to answer that question.   Obviously I was playing very good at Hopman Cup this year and last year.
This is my first tournament for the year.   I won it last year.   I'm not looking at it to defend it.   I'm looking at obviously winning another title.   If I start looking at defending the title I'll get nervous and I'm probably not going to defend it more than likely.
I'm looking at this is as a positive and trying to win here as best as I can, regardless of what I have to defend. 

Q.   Last year you said that by the end of the year you hoped to be in the top 10.   Where do you set yourself this year since that didn't eventuate last year?
BERNARD TOMIC:   No goals, but I'll get there eventually.

Q.   Do you look at last year as a disappointment given you didn't reach that goal of top 10?
BERNARD TOMIC:   You know, if I'm 25 years old, 26 years old I would probably feel like that.   Just turned 21, so I think I'm at the right age.

Q.   No James Magnussen here?   No lucky charm?
BERNARD TOMIC:   He's here.   He'll come for my next match.
