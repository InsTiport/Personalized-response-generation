  B. TOMIC/L. Vanni6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. How satisfying was that?BERNARD TOMIC: It was not easy.  He beat me before, so I was very happy to win. Wasn't feeling that good.  Still sick.  You know, getting better, but still a little bit down. So it was tough out there.  Everything felt much, much longer than it was.  I was really feeling the fatigue out there. Happy I won in the end.  It was a tough win for me.Q. How important is it for you to get a couple wins here heading into the grass court season and hopefully boosting your ranking also?BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, I've been playing very good.  The last four or five weeks I've been losing tough matches to Vanni in Madrid, and Viktor in Rome, and to Tipsarevic in Munich. Very happy with the way I've played the last four or five weeks.  Can't complain.  I would like this sickness to go away.  Battling with it, but I tried my best today. Took a lot out of me.  We'll see what medication and procedure I can take the next day to make myself feel a lot better for the next round.Q. You appeared to be talking to the doctor out there.  Was it dizziness?BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, I'm still sick for the last week, so just obviously I was getting dizzy.  You know, I tried battling as much as I could. I wasn't going to pull the pin.  I was going to fight the whole way even though I was feeling a little bit sick.Q. Just explain what the problem is.  Is it like a flu?BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, a virus.  For the first four or five days I couldn't play.  Had to pull out of Nice. Still feeling the fatigue, and playing a match like this doesn't help.  Hopefully tomorrow I feel better.  It's okay.Q. Given that, do you just rest tomorrow or will you practice or what's the go there?BERNARD TOMIC: Well, I have to hit a little bit, probably 30 minutes, and then, yeah, get ready.  I assume I play Wednesday.Q. And assuming, again, your next round match could be pretty interesting as well.BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, I saw the score.  They're battling now.  It's the fourth set.  It's not easy, even for Kokkinakis.  He's playing a guy he played last week and beat him in the challenger very comfortably now is getting close to being a fourth set, a fifth set. So it's not easy.  He has to play good.  He got into the top 100 now, so that's very good confidence for him.  He prefers clay.  He hopefully can turn it around and win.  Be good for Australia. But he's battling now.  Like I saw it was a tough match.Q. Do you look ahead at all knowing what could be ahead of you if it is Thanasi and you got past him or anything like that?BERNARD TOMIC: As a matter of fact, I'm sick.  I don't look anywhere.  Yeah.  It's funny, because last week I pulled out.  I know what a sickness can do.  I've got to get as ready as I can for whoever I play, whether it's a qualifier or Thanasi.  We'll see. Yeah, I saw it.  I saw the potential third round for me.  It's going to be very important to try to win this match.  I have never made a third round here, so I would like to obviously do that and hopefully I feel better for it.Q. Due to the fact that this illness has been hanging around for a while, are you concerned at all tat it might drag into the grass court season unless you get on top of it quickly?BERNARD TOMIC: I think it's just a virus.  I don't know.  Virus could be three, four days.  Could be one week, two weeks. I've been five, six, days feeling bad, so hopefully it's going away. But for sure I'm concerned.  But hopefully goes away.Q. The frustrations you must be feeling with the various ailments and illnesses and tooth issues you've had this year.BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah.  I mean, honestly don't know how I got this high in the ranking this year, to be honest. Like I was had problems with my back.  I was going to get injections and maybe stop for a month. The wisdom tooth problem. I don't know.  I'm surprised I did very well.  (Laughter.) Of course, man, I'm Australian.  What do you think?
