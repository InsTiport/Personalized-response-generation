  6‑3, 6‑4, 6‑0 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the match.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   Well, he played very good.   I couldn't do anything really.   I think he played very good.   He served well.   I didn't have many chances to do anything.   
I think it was a good opportunity to have a test against him, to play him.   I haven't played him before.   He served pretty good.   
Felt like I needed to get some chances to break him, but he was serving too good.   
   
 Q.   And talk about playing on Ashe.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   I was a bit nervous the first set.   It's very difficult the first time to be in front of 22,000 people.   It's very different.   I'm used to playing in Australia.   Here it's a bit different.   Lucky I had that experience to play today.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?   
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, different feeling playing on the backcourts than playing on the biggest stage in the world, biggest country in the world.   
   
 Q.   Crowd cheered when you made a challenge.   Did you find that a little intimidating?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   I felt like anything I did, I wasn't quite sure how to respond.   The ball jumps on that court.   It's different to the outside courts.   
I think I would like to have had an opportunity to play on it this week.   It's difficult to get to hit on that court.   
He showed why he's been No.1 in the world.   
   
 Q.   The crowd hadn't filled in until the second set.   Why did you feel you couldn't do anything?   Pretty big statement to make.     
BERNARD TOMIC:   Well, I wasn't looking up, that's for sure.   More I looked up, the more I realized how much people were there.   
Like I say, I feel like I needed to hit 10 minutes on the court.   It's difficult.   The top seeds always get the opportunity to hit on that court.   
Yeah, this is his home city where he plays the best.   I wasn't quite comfortable I think the whole match on that court.   It was very strange.   
It was a good experience to play on that court.   I had to get confronted on that court sooner or later.  
   
 Q.   What happened in the last set?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Well, you go in with a plan to win.   You know, he's playing well; you're nervous.   He's getting you on little things.   You're not quite happy with yourself.   
I think third set he managed to get off to a 3‑Love lead in seconds in the third set.   All I could see was 3‑Love down all of a sudden in the third set.   I don't think I was responding with my legs the way I should have.   
He was serving I think better in the second set to the start of the third, but I felt like I couldn't get a racquet on his first serve.   That was the biggest key.   
   
 Q.   On television, John McEnroe said your effort in the final set was borderline not trying.   What are your thoughts about that?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Well, I think he's probably right.   Like I said, I couldn't get the racquet on the ball.   Andy was playing I think really good at the net, coming into the net.   
Every time I wanted to pass him, he ended up hitting a half volley winner or a volley winner.   He was on top of me the whole match.   I can't complain.   The whole match was his way from start to finish pretty much.   
   
 Q.   You talk about the size of the crowd, but also the occasion of this being Roddick's last tournament.   How did that dynamic play out in your head?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   It wasn't so much that I was worried about.   I was more worried about his playing on the court.   You know, you always dream as a kid to play in this arena.   It's the biggest stage in the world.   
To play one of the biggest players in America, I was thinking about it too much leading into the match.   He was serving well.   So I just couldn't, you know, find my way to get out of that little zone.   
   
 Q.   They made a pretty big deal of it on the last set, tanking, all that stuff.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   Really?   What do you think?   
   
 Q.   I'm not sure.   I think your relaxed style sometimes people get the wrong impression.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   That's how I play.   Do you have a problem with that?   
   
 Q.   No.   It was on TV.   It was a big deal.   Better to give you the opportunity now to talk about it surely.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, no, that's your prediction.   I have mine.   That's how I play.   If you think that's that, it's up to you.   What is your name?   
   
 Q.   Will.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   Will who?   
   
 Q.   Will Swanton.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   From?   
   
 Q.   Reuters.   
BERNARD TOMIC:   I'll remember you.   
   
 Q.   Davis Cup next.   What do you make of that?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   That's our biggest focus, I think, the whole Australian team's focus.   Good question for asking.   It's probably the biggest thing for us Australian players.   Good to see Lleyton doing well and having a chance to get back in the World Group.   
That's what we're going to work for the next week before going to Hamburg.   It's going to be tough as a team for Australia, but Pat is confident.   We're confident.   We have to play against some good clay‑courters to win.   
   
 Q.   Will you stick around or what are the plans there?  
BERNARD TOMIC:   Pat, myself, obviously Lleyton, see how he goes, and then I've got doubles.   We'll hang around New York I think until the end of Thursday or Friday.
