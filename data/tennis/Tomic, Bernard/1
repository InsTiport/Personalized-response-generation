THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Hard to get into a rhythm with someone serving like that?
BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, I mean, I played pretty bad.
Q. What do you put that down to?  Are you feeling okay?
BERNARD TOMIC: Well, yeah, I just played terrible.
Q. Lasted just 58 minutes.  Do you think there was any lack of effort on your part or...
BERNARD TOMIC: Well, I returned pretty bad.  Didn't see his serve.  Pretty terrible match.
Q. Are you happy with the effort you were putting in?
BERNARD TOMIC: Next question, please.
Q. Have you still got the desire to sort of work your way back up the ranks?
BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, played well last week. This week, tough first round.  I knew if I didn't feel good I'd lose this match quickly.  We played so fast.  It's not like we're gonna have a lot of rallies out there, for sure.
Q. In terms of preparation, were there any issues for you?
BERNARD TOMIC: No.  Just played terrible.
Q. What's next for you?
BERNARD TOMIC: I don't know.  I don't know.
Q. Outside tennis, there have been some reports back in Australia...
BERNARD TOMIC: Next question.
Q. (Indiscernible.)

Q. You were fined a couple years ago for lack of effort.  Are you expecting the same?
BERNARD TOMIC: (No answer.)
Q. What's next on your schedule tournament-wise?
BERNARD TOMIC: I'm going to the U.S.  Try and do tournaments at Newport, Atlanta, Washington, all their hard courts.  I've got to get ready for that, for sure.
Q. Do you still have the same passion for tennis as you did when you were younger?
BERNARD TOMIC: Yes.
Q. What are you going to do to try and get that motivation back and to kind of -- you know, this time last year you did hit a purple patch and you were doing quite well.  Is it something you can look to at that time that you can turn to and try and get your game...
BERNARD TOMIC: I played good last week, played bad this week, simple.  Every week we play tennis.
Q. Wouldn't you like to have more consistency obviously in your performance?
BERNARD TOMIC: Not really.  I don't know.
Q. Would it bother you if you did lose any of your prize money?
BERNARD TOMIC: For what?
Q. Perceived lack of effort.
BERNARD TOMIC: I think I played as best as I could.  It's just I played terrible.  And he served 24 aces or...
