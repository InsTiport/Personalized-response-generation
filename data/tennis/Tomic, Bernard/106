X. MALISSE/B. Tomic
  6-2, 3-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How are you feeling? You seemed to be suffering a bit with your shoulder in the match. 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Yes. I unfortunately had a bit of a pain in my shoulder which caused I think the first set to go by. But no excuses. I mean, I could play and everything, but just, I couldn't serve.
 It sort of went away in the second set, and that's where I could really get a few free points on my serve. I think I played pretty good. We both played good. There was a lot of good tennis, which I'm happy I'm playing that way today.

 Q. Do you know what the reason was for the shoulder? Just suddenly came on or what?
 BERNARD TOMIC: I think I had a bit of -- I had a treatment with the physio, so I don't know. I maybe hit a first serve in the first few games and I felt a little switch. Lucky it wasn't anything serious, especially coming in now, Wimbledon, Wimbledon quallies. 

 Q. You must be pretty pleased with the way you played that first round and getting through Seppi, and then to actually come back in this match. I would think you're feeling pretty good on the grass. 
 BERNARD TOMIC: Oh, for sure. I mean, I'd say it was a good win for me. Today I played good tennis. We both played good. 
 I think, you know, it's a matter of time where I really break through and have a good tournament, thanks a lot to the people here who gave me a wildcard. I really appreciate it. I did well here, I think, and I'll continue to play good on grass.

 Q. What did you do the last two weeks when the French was going on?
 BERNARD TOMIC: Well, I went to a Challenger in Italy on hardcourt, did really good and made semis, and played just Nottingham just in Challenger, quallied and lost to Anderson. 
 I'm pretty settled into grass now. I think I can play really good Wimbledon quallies.

 Q. Did you not think about qualifying, trying to qualify for Paris?
 BERNARD TOMIC: My clay court game hasn't been that good. I mean, you know, it was six, seven weeks where I didn't get any points, and, you know, right now I needed a few more points so I went to Italy. But I'll continue to grow on clay.

 Q. You're the next big thing in Australian tennis. Do you feel some pressure from that?
 BERNARD TOMIC: No, no, never have. Right now no one could put more pressure than I can on myself, really. I've just got to play tennis, I think.

 Q. What will you do now?
 BERNARD TOMIC: Tough call. I'm not sure. I'm still waiting on the wildcards for Wimbledon, and I think there's three more to be given out, so I'll see what happens. 
 I'm in qualifying, so either way I'll be pleased to be in the qualifying draw or main draw. Whatever happens, I think I'm gonna, you know, get ready for it. 

 Q. Has there been any indication of what course of action might be taken as far as the wildcard is concerned?
 BERNARD TOMIC: To be honest, I don't know. I know there was three left, and, you know, I'll hopefully maybe -- this might be giving me a chance after a good match win, you know, a good three-setter. But anyway, I'll be happy to play Wimbledon quallies, or main draw, I'll be stoked even more.
