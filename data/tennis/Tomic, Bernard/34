B. TOMIC/P. Herbert
  7‑6, 6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You had to grind that one out?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, it was not easy.   Obviously his game is suited for this surface, so for me it was a very difficult match.
I thought I played okay.   At the right times I played very well.   Served very well. 
You know, it was tough out there.   It was not easy, not easy.   He's a tricky player, so I'm very happy I won today.

Q.   Did you need treatment at any stage and what was it?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, I was very dizzy out there.   I didn't sleep well yesterday and the day before.   Probably getting three or four hours of sleep.   I was fatigued and starting to get dizzy out there with the heat hitting me.
It was tough, so I had to slow things down.   I had to catch my breath.   I had to serve that set out, which I did, but, you know, he had two break points and I played two good points on him. 
It was not that easy, that situation for me in the second.   I was feeling bad.   Hopefully I can get a good night's sleep in tonight.   I just haven't been sleeping well here.   It's been too hot.

Q.   Clearly you'll need a good night's sleep if you play Novak. 
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah.   I'll need more than that (smiling). 
Well, I will recover as much as I can from this match.   Obviously he's the No. 1 player in the world.   Against him, you have to go out with a different mindset and different belief.   I have to serve very well to have any chance of winning.
Yeah, I have now tomorrow I can focus on the stuff I need to do.   We will see.   It's never easy.

Q.   Four years ago you played him here.   How much has changed in your game and what are your memories of that day?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, I can remember I was playing very good.   He was No. 1 or 2, I think, at that time, as well.   He did win Wimbledon after he beat me in the quarters.
You know, I have played many times against Novak.   You know, I got the feel for him.   We have practiced a lot of times, but that can mean nothing when you come on the court with him sometimes.   He's a very good player.
I have to serve well if I have any chance of winning.   I have to play my tennis, relax, and go for it, you know, really believe and really be in the moment I think and enjoy the match, I think.

Q.   Can you take anything out of those matches in Perth and Kooyong, even though they are XOs?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, I think Hopman Cup was more of a match where I felt like he played pretty good.   I was playing very good, serving at 84%.   I think that's why I won. 
Looking back to when I played him at Wimbledon, I was serving very well.   I had him on the back foot in the third set, even 4‑1 up, I think, and I lost that 6‑4.   I think I was 5‑4 in the fourth against him, a few points away to make the fifth set.     I had chances. 
Him on grass, for me I have more chance, but he's the best player in the world and it's a very tough match.

Q.   I think he was on that big roll then, only lost one match for the year.   Do you think he's at that same level now?
BERNARD TOMIC:   I mean, if he's No. 1, he's obviously there for a reason.   You know, what a player he is.   But, you know, I know at my level, if I'm playing good on my day, I can beat him.
So I have to focus tomorrow, I have to prepare as much as I can, and, you know, have the belief out there.

Q.   You mentioned the heat being an issue for you today.   Would you be in favor of a male heat rule being brought in?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, I was actually talking about that in the locker room.   It's a bit interesting how the women have a different rule applied to them with the heat, which is interesting. 
I think ours is slightly different.   I think we are allowed to play in more heat.   Is it fair or not?   Who am I to say?   I don't know.   It's a tough one.

Q.   When you played Rafa a few years ago at the Aussie Open and Novak at Wimbledon, they seem to raise your game.   You sort of had no choice but to really go for your shots.   Do you feel that can help?
BERNARD TOMIC:   Yeah, I have to.   If he's out there matching, I have to come out on this court against him and I have to believe I can win, go for my shots.   That's when I play top 5, top 6 tennis.   It's tough for anyone to play me, I guess, when I'm playing well.
I have to prepare as best I can to get an opportunity to play as well as I can against him.   That's going to come down to me maybe winning this match or, you know, losing.
