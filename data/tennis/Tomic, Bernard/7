6-4, 6-0, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you sum it up and was heat a factor out there for you today?  
BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, I was playing top, you know, two, three player on clay, and he's been playing well, and really no chance today.  He killed me from the start, from the 2-All game, and that's why he's been playing so well.  So for him, I wish him the best of luck and he's a huge favorite to do well in this Roland Garros this year.   
 Q.  How would you describe the biggest differences between where your level is at on clay and him?  What are the main differences?  
BERNARD TOMIC: Well, it's just I think he's No. 2 player on clay statistics-wise.  He grew up on this surface.  He's playing amazing and he's also 6, 7 in the world.  And he's achieved a lot so far in his career, and he's only 23.   
And yeah, a huge favorite.  Had a chance, you know, to win maybe Madrid.  Had a chance last year semi to maybe make a final, and he's a huge favorite.  So I think game-wise on clay he's at a different level to me for sure.   
 Q.  You played some nice attacking tennis early.  Do you take something out of that now that you're heading to the grass courts?  
BERNARD TOMIC: For sure.  There was good positive signs.  But, you know, it's not easy.  You know, I mean, you're not seeded so it can be dangerous.  And especially seeing to play him here first round, you know, after Rafa, he's playing the best tennis this year on clay.  And for everybody, I think he's a top three player on clay now.  And he's not a player you want in the first round.   
And, you know, I knew straight away it was going to be tough and I would have to serve amazing to have any chance.  And really, you know, at the clay level I'm not quite there near him at this moment but hopefully one day in a few years I can improve on this surface and there's been positive signs this year.   
I played really well, what, three or four matches.  I think this is my best year on clay, where I have won the most matches.  So for me I'm pretty happy.  Obviously, the draw was bad and I look to be ready on grass.   
 Q.  Bernard, you had quite good service but you didn't ran a lot.  You tried to do drop shot quite soon.  Have you got some physical problems or not?  
BERNARD TOMIC: No.  I don't want to rally with Dominic Thiem.  I think physically everybody would say this.  You have to play, especially me, I'm not playing the game of running and playing 30 balls.  That's not me.  But I tried today and tried to do something different, but no chance really.   
 Q.  Irrespective of the surface where do you think your game is at and how do you rate your expectations for the grass season?  
BERNARD TOMIC: Yeah, well, I'm feeling pretty well.  Last year I played terrible on clay and I played very well on grass, and had a chance to make quarters, Wimbledon.  I was a few points away, I think 5-3 in the fifth in the fourth round against Pouille and played really well in Queens making semis.   
I didn't play that good on clay last year.  This year better.  Here at Roland Garros, I have played the wrong player in the first round and I lost and now I'm looking for the beautiful grass courts.   
 Q.  There's been some controversy back home around Margaret Court and comments she's made, anti-gay comments, and some calls for Tennis Australia to change the name on Margaret Court Arena.  Do you think that would be a good step for them?  
BERNARD TOMIC: What?  No, I didn't hear.   
 Q.  Margaret Court was getting attention for anti-gay comments, she came out boycotting Qantas, the airline, for coming out and supporting gay marriage.  Casey Dellacqua and some of the other Aussie girls were speaking out against her.  There was talk about renaming the arena possibly.  I guess you hadn't heard about any of this?  
BERNARD TOMIC: No.   
 Q.  Just your thoughts on it.  
BERNARD TOMIC: I don't know nothing.  I'm not in a position to say anything about that.  Well, that's some news.  I didn't know.  I guess I'll find out sooner or later.  Really, I'm not in a position to say anything.  So I can't.  Sorry.
