MATT LUCENA: We try to keep that way the whole tournament. We just decided first match we are just going to go out there and have fun and we weren't going to get stressed out and angry if we lose serving or if things go against us. Our motto was just to have fun; if things go bad, they go bad. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: I think we are aware -- 
MATT LUCENA: I think you are definitely aware of it. We just tried to put it out -- lucky, I have played on stadium before and have been in other situations close to that. I mean not quite playing for serving for a Slam, but close to that situation. I think that helps out a lot. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: First time. 
MATT LUCENA: Five matches. Four matches. Five. 

MATT LUCENA: It is kind of -- I was supposed to play with Patty ^ fend dick, but she just had an operation on both her knees. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: I was supposed to play with Rick Leach and he never called me back, so we are stuck with each other. 
MATT LUCENA: Luck. 

MATT LUCENA: Where did we decide to play? 

MATT LUCENA: I think -- 

MATT LUCENA: Tuesday or Wednesday I was sitting there eating lunch. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: Five days before the tournament -- 
MATT LUCENA: I said maybe she doesn't have a mixed doubles player. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: Well, he was too chicken. He sent his coach -- just kidding. 
MATT LUCENA: Scott McCain walked over. He is knew. I was looking for a mixed doubles partner. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: No -- well, we had a tough first round. We had to play the second seeds first round. I don't know what Matt was thinking -- 
MATT LUCENA: I only played mixed doubles one other time; that was against Stark and Martina at Wimbledon, so... 
MEREDITH McGRATH: You never know with mixed though, anything can happen. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: Tami Whitlinger Jones. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: Lan Bale. 
MATT LUCENA: First round losers. (GIVE EACH OTHER HIGH-FIVE). 

MATT LUCENA: That is what we said. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: I had forgotten that when I said yes. 
MATT LUCENA: See. 

MATT LUCENA: Sure, why not. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: Sure. 
MATT LUCENA: That is if she goes to Australia. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: Planning on playing. 

MATT LUCENA: Can't remember -- I think it was '90 and '91. 

MATT LUCENA: Duug Eisman for 1990 and then Bent Pederson for 1991. 

MATT LUCENA: I will call United and try and get home as fast as possible. I don't know if I can make it. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: I am going to wait 'til I get home to celebrate, I think. 

MATT LUCENA: I am just happy to be back playing. I have been hurt for the past 2 1/2, three years. I have had shoulder problems; elbow problems; wrist problems. This is the first year that I have been able to play, you know, without taking off a good month to three months and I have just mainly played doubles because I don't know if my shoulder can hang in there to play singles. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: I hurt my Achilles in Australia and I have just -- all year I have really been struggling with that. I mean, I manage fine in doubles, mixed, but singles I am a little bit slow and it has shown in my results. 

MEREDITH McGRATH: Yeah, need some time off. I don't know exactly when, but... 

MEREDITH McGRATH: I'd like to. 
MATT LUCENA: She has a previous engagement for tonight. 
MEREDITH McGRATH: I have a dinner that I have to go to. 
MATT LUCENA: And I don't know what I am doing. Kind of up in the air. Any good night spots? 

MATT LUCENA: Yeah, New York City....
