THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Nick, for you, what was it like playing against Stefanos since you have played with him a couple of times? Any strategies you could use in your match today considering you played with him recently?  
NICK KYRGIOS: I mean, when you're playing Roger or Rafa in doubles, the other person is usually the weaker point. But I thought me and Jack came out strong. We played really, really well.   
Stefanos returned well. I thought he played well today. Honestly, he served well. Especially to Jack I thought he served well.   
Yeah, I mean, he was solid. His returns were going in. I thought it was a high quality doubles match.   
Me and Jack, obviously we have played three times and haven't lost. Our chemistry is pretty high. I'm just glad we kept Team World in it.   
 Q.  John, your thoughts on today and the situation, 7-5 going into the final day?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: Well, we have been here before. We need to win three out of four. That was big, I think, because we would have had to win three and the doubles, so I think we get some momentum.   
We start with the doubles and hopefully we get a win there and it's two out of three and it's a different story. We are excited. You know, we're not exactly where we want to be, but we're still in a reasonably good place.   
 Q.  Bj√∂rn said that it's Federer/Nadal in the doubles tomorrow first up. Are you able to reveal your doubles partners?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: We're going to play with Jack and John Isner. We are going to go with that, and then we're going to have Nick play Rafa, and John's going to play Roger. If it goes to the final match, it will be Sascha and Milos.   
JACK SOCK: Tweet it out.
