 Q.  Your thoughts about this weekend and Laver Cup?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: Well, I'm excited. I think the format suits our guys. We are obviously big underdogs but we have been close, very close.   
So we feel confident that we can pull off an upset. But of course we know that obviously a couple breaks could hopefully go our way. When you have four matches, you have match point and lose all of them, that's rough, especially when you're playing guys this good.   
So hopefully we will take advantage of those chances.   
 Q.  How much stock do you put in the suggestion that they are the favorites? I mean, does that enter your mind at all or do you just go from scratch?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: Well, I think it's both. I mean, you've got to go from scratch, but look who we are playing against. Hopefully we'll get off to a little bit better start than we did the first couple of years and the first few days we will be in a better position.   
But obviously everyone tries to peak at the second and third days, and it's bigger points-wise. But we have been in some pretty big holes, so it would be nice if we actually, God forbid, had a lead or were close.   
 Q.  I was asking BjÃ¶rn if it gets any easier being captain. He said actually it gets a little bit tougher. What do you think?  
CAPTAIN JOHN McENROE: Well, I think that it seems pretty easier for him since he's won both. So I'm on the hot seat, I would think. So definitely feel some pressure, but it's good pressure.
