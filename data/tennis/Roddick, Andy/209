   THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Andy.   
  
  Q.  You said you weren't too happy yesterday about the way you played.  How was it today?  Seemed to be easier.   
 ANDY RODDICK:  No, I don't know if I said I wasn't happy.  I said it was difficult to play in the wind yesterday.  You know, you weren't feeling like you were getting clean hits on the ball.   
 Tonight I felt like I was hitting it about as clean as I can.   
  
  Q.  How about your next opponent, Djokovic?  Have you met him?   
 ANDY RODDICK:  We've never played.  I guess it's a rarity when you have the 3 and 4 guys in the world playing in the quarterfinals of an event.  But I guess that's the way it shook out this week.   
 He's had a great year.  I'm looking forward to it.   
  
  Q.  It's going to be a game of powerful services?   
 ANDY RODDICK:  Yeah, hopefully.  I feel like I could have actually -- that's the one thing I probably could have done a little bit better tonight, is serving.  But we'll see.  I'm sure there will be some baseline rallies.  Like I said, he's been playing great.  So I'm looking -- I'm going to have to play well.   
  
  Q.  Tell me more about the game of Baghdatis tonight.   
 ANDY RODDICK:  Tell you more about it?  What do you want me to tell you?  You want me to just talk about him?   
  
  Q.  About your opponent tonight, Baghdatis.   
 ANDY RODDICK:  What about him?   
  
  Q.  Tell me how he played tonight.   
 ANDY RODDICK:  How he played?  Well, I thought he played maybe not up to his ability in the first set.  But I thought he played better in the second set.  I felt like I played really well tonight and I felt like I had to, you know, against a player of his ability.
