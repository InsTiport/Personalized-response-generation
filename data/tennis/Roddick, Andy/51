 Q. Everybody enjoyed that match, Andy. Welcome back to the grass. How did you enjoy that?
 ANDY RODDICK: I didn't enjoy it when I saw that I might play him second round, I'll tell you that much.
 I felt great on the grass. This is one of my favorite tournaments in the world, and I'm just so happy to be back here in London.

 Q. What did you get out of that match? I mean, I know Queen's is all about Wimbledon, but Queen's is about Queen's, as well. What did you get from the match?
 ANDY RODDICK: Well, you play a match to try to win a match. You know, we come over here for Wimbledon, but we're trying to win this tournament. You know, I knew it was going to be tough. He's a very good grass court player, serves big. 
 A couple points here and there, I thought I started returning real well there in the third set.

 Q. Indeed. Now, we must ask, because we have noticed something down below. 
 ANDY RODDICK: Yeah. 

 Q. Let's have a look. We are going to move the camera down. Only the socks. 
 ANDY RODDICK: What did you notice down below, Andrew? (Laughter.)

 Q. Well, we were just having a little look here, and it looked fairly clean-shaven and the little pop socks, as well. What's the idea?
 ANDY RODDICK: Just trying to flash the calf a little bit, you know? That's it. 

 Q. You don't want any little bobbles on the back there, like the girls wear, just to keep the socks up?
 ANDY RODDICK: Well, no. Everyone comments on how my wife has nice legs, so I just decided to display them, also. I can't come in second in the family in everything.

 Q. Never compete with the wife. Andy, have a good week. Good to see you back. 
 ANDY RODDICK: Thank you.
