 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. It's got to be a tough loss, but talk about the game in the second set. You were down Love-40, and it was key getting back in the match and then really pushing him hard at the end.   
 ANDY RODDICK: Yeah, I mean, it's easier if I would have just played terrible the whole time it would have been probably tougher. I at least gave it a go there in the third, and didn't really catch a break there.   
 You know, he had a couple good let cords when it was a breakpoint against him, and one to set up the match. He hit forehand on the outside of the line down breakpoint, too.   
 You know, but at least it became a battle.   
  
  Q. Obviously winning is what you want. You put a lot of work in. Do you take any solace from it at least now, or you have to wait until tomorrow and really look at and see the progress you've made?  
 ANDY RODDICK: I'm not capable of being objective right now.   
  
  Q. Do you feel his level was better than last year, or same kind of level?   
 ANDY RODDICK: Yeah, I mean, he usually is. I mean, you want me to compare two matches in the span of a year. It's tough to do, to be honest. I mean, I don't know.
