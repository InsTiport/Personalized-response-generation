THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  You looked pretty good out there.  Do you feel like you're picking up right where you left off in Houston? 

ANDY RODDICK:  Well, no, because I lost the last one in Houston, so...  Hopefully, starting something new.  But as far as tennis goes, yeah, I played pretty well there.  Came in here and started off well.  I'm happy with the way I played tonight.

Q.  Where would you rate your chances in this tournament? 

ANDY RODDICK:  I'm not going to think about it.  I got Verkerk next, and that's what's in my mind now. 

Q.  Do you have any thoughts about the Agassi loss today? 

ANDY RODDICK:  Oh, sorry.  I played Agassi last, too.  Sorry.  I didn't see one point of it.  Obviously, it's surprising when you come in  - I came in the tournament about 5 o'clock today.  Someone told me that he had lost.  Obviously, it was surprising.  But I haven't really heard anything else about it.
