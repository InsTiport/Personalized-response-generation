THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Anastasia. 


Q.  Were you happy with the way things went?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No.  I mean, I'm happy that I'm in next round, but I'm not really happy like to play -- like to win that way because I know when the person get injured, it's really hard, first of all, to recover, to come back.  I think for Lisa it's going to be really, really hard time.  I wish her all the best and I hope she's going to come back really soon. 

Q.  As the French Open champion, bearing in mind a lot of noise has been made by the men players how this is playing almost as slow as clay, what is your take on it? 

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I heard a lot of things about the courts.  But you know what, I don't really remember what it was last year because we play so many tournaments.  I think every week it's different.  If you come here and you're not ready, that's not excuses about the surface.  You just have to be ready no matter what and play here no matter what kind of surface is here. 

Q.  You said obviously you feel sorry for Lisa.  From your point of view, for preparation, is it good to have a day off where you thought you'd be playing?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  We play doubles three hours yesterday.  For me, it really was good thing not playing today.  But still, you know, I'm really feel bad for Lisa.
