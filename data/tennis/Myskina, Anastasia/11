THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Anastasia, please. 
 

Q.  Did you feel at ease on the grass today?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, I was down a set and 4-1, whatever, and then 3-Love in the third.  I'm happy that I went -- that I got through the match like this.  And I think maybe if I play more matches like this, then it's easier for me to come back and play my best tennis. 
 

Q.  You had a very, very tough game today.
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, well, I don't know if she's playing like this all the time, but I think she played pretty good match. I'm really happy that I fought back and that was happy end for me.
