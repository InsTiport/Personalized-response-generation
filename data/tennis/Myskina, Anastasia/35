MODERATOR:  Questions for Anastasia, please.  
 
 
Q.  First, just tell us how you played today, how your match went.
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  The first set, I think she played really, really well.  She crash the ball, and I was just not ready maybe.  I played first time against her, and I had no idea how she played.  But then I found a way to win and it was pretty good.  
 
Q.  I would like to know how you will see your match against Mary Pierce. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's gonna be really tough because Mary play really well right now.  I lost to her last time in Charleston.  So it's gonna be tough.  I look forward for after tomorrow, and just try to practice tomorrow.  
 
Q.  What will be the key of the match for you? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, I don't know.  I have to talk to my coach first.  
 
Q.  What was wrong in the medical time-out?  Was it a blister on your foot?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, just a blister.  I had to run a lot today because she was playing pretty well. 
 
Q.  How did you find the conditions on the court?  The weather changed quite a lot.
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, it was really, really humid, so I was sweating a lot.  It was really hard.  But finally was happy end.  
 
Q.  What do you think changed as you went on with the first set?  You were behind, and you said you found a way to win.  What was it that you changed? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I just try to put ball in play.  Because if I would have hit the ball hard against her, I think that's just what she expect from me.  I try just to put the ball in, try to make her play.  
 
Q.  You were playing a part of the time the same time Capriati was playing her match.  During her match, she went to the chair umpire and asked if they could move the blimp because it was making too much noise.  Did you hear it?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  What's the blimp?  
 
Q.  The big thing in the sky. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, no, I had no idea.  I was really concentrating.  I didn't hear anything.  
 
Q.  Can you give me your advice about Kirilenko and Sharapova, please. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  They both good players.  Actually, I have no idea how Kirilenko play, I didn't see her any matches.  I know Maria better.  I think if she's gonna keep working hard, she's gonna be good player. 
 
Q.  Your reaction about playing Fed Cup at Moscow in November?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, that was really good.  I'm so happy.  Because I really, really want to go home, especially in November.  So we're really, really happy that it's Moscow. 
 
Q.  How much pressure is there or expectation as a Russian player? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  When you play at home, it's a lot of pressure for sure.  But, no, you don't really feel here pressure.  It's lot  of Russian.  I'm really happy that everybody play good right now, and do the best here.  And just we try to fight for every point and try to do our best on the court.  
 
Q.  Do you think the Russian women will come to dominate the league at some point?  Do you see that? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's gonna be hard.  I mean, compared to America, it's really hard.  But we try.  We try.  We will see.
