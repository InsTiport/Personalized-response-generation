THE MODERATOR:  Questions for an stay that, please.  
 
 
Q.  You didn't seem like yourself out there tonight.  Why was that?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Can happen, bad days, good days.  Today was bad day for me. But Justine play pretty well.  She didn't really give me any chances today.  Sometimes it happen.  
 
Q.  Since you had to play so many matches before you came here, with the doubles, are you looking forward to a few days of not playing matches and resting?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I play 9:00 doubles.  You know, after this, I'm not going to play for couple days, because it's just too much sometimes. 
 
Q.  How disappointed are you?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Not really because, you know, I know that was a bad game for me.  I didn't play my game at all.  So I know I have to practice, what I have to practice.  Just look forward for next tournament. 
 
Q.  Could you tell us about your serve.  You seemed to be struggling with your serve tonight. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I have a little bit pain in my shoulder today.  Really wasn't my day today at all.  Not just serve - everything.  
 
Q.  The pain in your shoulder, is that something you had a lot?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Not a lot, but sometimes I do have.  Yeah, when I play a lot of matches.  It's the muscle inflamed. 
 
Q.  It's like a sharp pain in your shoulder or a constant ache?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's a sharp.  
 
Q.  Are you thinking of taking some time off and missing the next tournament to rest it?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, no.  I play Miami for sure, and then I have a rest for the month.  
 
Q.  Your style of play, would you prefer to win from the back court or a mixed game or do you prefer to get on top of the net when you're playing your best?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I prefer to win at all, from anywhere, you know.  Definitely my best game from the baseline.  I'm not serve and volley, for sure.  Just, you know, baseline for sure.  
 
Q.  Is that typical of most of the Russian girls, in the training programs?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  We train all differently.  I think Kuznetsova prefer to play volley a lot because she good doubles player.  We all different, I think. 
 
Q.  Do you think the Russian girls are doing fine at the moment, better than men, in Russian tennis?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, we better than men's for sure.  But we have more of us than men.  I hope some of the guys going to play good this year and some new going to come, so going to be more Russians. 
 
Q.  Can you pick a winner for us for the women's final?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, no.  I'm not going to do that.  It's going to be good final, for sure.  Lindsay play really well, and Justine play well.  So they both want to win.  Definitely Lindsay play at home, so I think it's going to be really good final.  
 
Q.  Did you say you'll take a month off after Miami?  Did I misunderstand you?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I play Fed Cup, but then I play just Berlin after Miami. 
 
Q.  You go back?  No Charleston, Amelia?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, it's too much.
