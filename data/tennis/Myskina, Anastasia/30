THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Anastasia. 


Q.  You had an injured opponent.  Did you ever consider dropshotting her?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I did couple, and Kim was pretty quick.  So I lose this couple points, then I was not really confident to do this again.  But I think I lose the match -- this match before the match already.

Q.  Was it nerves?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I was kind of nervous because I thought I have a good chance to play, I mean, at least to play three sets with Kim, maybe beat her.  But that was not my day, for sure.

Q.  Have you ever seen the movie "Anastasia"?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Cartoon, not movie. 

Q.  No, the very serious movie, from the 1950s, with Ingrid Bergman.  You'd love it.

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Okay. 

Q.  What did you think when she took the injury break, that you had a good chance of winning at that stage?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, definitely Kim took it just because she was hurt.  I think she had the pain, that's why she took it, not just because there was something that she want to change or break my rhythm.  I lost -- I don't know.  I lost this match because I did lot of unforced errors.  That's why I lost this match, not because of the break.

Q.  During that injury time, you sat there for quite a while.  Did that add to your nerves as well?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Not really.  I was just thinking to keep the ball, you know, and play rallies.  But I wasn't able today to play lot of rallies, you know, and Kim just beat me in these rallies.

Q.  Where to next?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Home Sweet Home.
