THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  I guess the only question is:  How do you feel?  How is your ankle? 

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, it's okay.  It's definitely not good.  But, hopefully, by tomorrow, I'm going to be okay.  Really hope so. 

Q.  Are you worried you might have to pull out? 

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, that's a tough question.  I really can't say yes or no because I'm really hoping to do well here, no matter what.  Maybe just today I have a pain and tomorrow might goes away because I'm going to do a lot of treatment today, and hopefully tomorrow I'm going to be good. 

Q.  It looked pretty scary.  It looked like you turned it over pretty badly.  Were you worried you might not be able to continue the match?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, you know, sometimes when you feel the pain, you try to be tougher, you really become stronger.  So I was kind of thinking to finish the match because I was up.  I really felt that if I just can put everything to that set, I'm going to be able to win the match. 

Q.  Is it a sprain that you have?  Did you sprain the ankle?

ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yes.
