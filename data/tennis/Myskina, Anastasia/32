THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  How did you find that match?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Right now I feel great.  During the match, it wasn't kind of really good because I was really nervous.  Again, when two Russians play, it's always kind of nervous match.  I know that was not really the best match today, but I really happy that I won. 
 
Q.  Had you played her before?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, that was the first match ever.  
 
Q.  And what sort of things will you be working on before your next match?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I play Chanda, I guess.  I play her here last year, same round.  We know each other really well.  Just know I have to do best things on the court.  Just have to put pressure on her and definitely have to serve better.  Just fight for every point.  
 
Q.  Can you talk a little bit about her game, what it was like playing against Sharapova?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I believe Maria, she not played that good today.  I think she was really nervous, yeah, as me.  I just, you know, had no idea the way she play.  Just knew she hit the ball pretty hard.  But I just had to put the ball better, you know, one more shot than her.
