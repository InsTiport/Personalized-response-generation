THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  You've played a fairly unusual schedule.  Hard courts, clay in Sopot, hard courts again.  Can you explain a little bit what the reasons were? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's pretty simple because when you Top 10 players, you have to do commitment and you have to play some small tournaments.  And only one that I have to play was Sopot, my commitment, so I had to play that one.
