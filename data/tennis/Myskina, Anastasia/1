  Q.  How would you grade your own performance if you were a teacher?   
 ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, well, I was okay.  Wasn't that really great, because today was really match -- if we talk about my singles, it was a lot of unforced errors from my side than from Amélie's side.   
 But I guess in the third set she just was stronger on the serve game.  That's why she won.   
  
  Q.  Some of us get the sense that you're always one or two matches from a breakthrough win and getting back up to the position you held when you played so well at the French Open.  Is that an ongoing theme in your own mind, or is it just taking it one match at a time?   
 ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, no matter what, I'm still think positive.  It was a great tournament.  I played great matches.  I beat the people who I supposed to beat.  I just lost to Amelie, who's No. 1 in the world right now.   
 You know, I really look forward for next tournaments.  I'm hoping.  I think if I'm gonna work hard, then everything gonna happen.  I just have to work hard.   
  
  Q.  Do you think Amélie will win?   
 ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Well, it's tough to say.  It's gonna be good match tomorrow.  Definitely Maria playing really well.  She played really good today.  It's gonna be tough for Amélie.
