THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  We don't know you very much.  Is this one of your best victories, or did you beat other top seeds? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I beat Hantuchova in the first round, but she's 14 in the world.  So I think Dokic is my best.  
 
Q.  And how would you interpret your victory?  Why do you think you won? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I played before with the players Top 10, like Capriati and Venus.  I played three sets with both of them.  And I was, like, really ready to beat some of Top 10 players.  And finally what I did today.  And I'm really happy.  I was ready, I think, for this.   
 
Q.  Is it true that you had to stop for one year, your career?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I stop for four months.  I had surgery for my left wrist.  It was the end of summer, '99.  I'm not play four months.  But not one year, no.  That's too much (smiling).  
 
Q.  She had beaten you two weeks ago in Hamburg.  What did you do better this time?  Was she not playing as well?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  In Hamburg we play like almost indoors, and I think she little bit better in indoors than me.  She play, of course, faster.  So I try today to play, I think, more smarter, like, than usual  - not hit like every ball.  Sometimes topspin, dropshot, you know, like a short cross-court.  Not hit like every ball, because she like it when you play against her really fast.  
 
Q.  Would you say clay is your best surface, do you think?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No.  Actually, I like hardcourt, I like fast courts.  Prefer to fast tennis.  But really good on the clay courts also sometimes.  I hope not last time (laughing).  
 
Q.  How did you approach tennis when you were a kid?  Why tennis, and not something else? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  When I was six, my parents  -- I live near tennis club, and my parents play some on weekends.  And they brought me to this club.  And the mother of Marat Safin, she saw me first time and she said that I'm not too bad (laughing).  Not good, but... 
 
Q.  And the mother, she still follows you?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, she was my first coach until I was 16.  And now she travel with her  - the second child  - daughter, Dinara.  So, yes, I have another coach for now.  
 
Q.  You play her?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, she's younger than me.  So no.  And she practice in Spain, so... 
 
Q.  Besides your parents, who would play tennis in your family?  Do you have someone who would play sports professionally in your family? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Actually, my parents don't play tennis really good.  My father plays soccer  - I don't know, some teams.  I know he is not too bad.  And my mom, she's swimming - a little bit.  
 
Q.  He still plays?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No.  He played when he was... before.  
 
Q.  Was it a famous team?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, no.  I don't think so.  No.  But he is not too bad (smiling).  
 
Q.  Is tennis what you wanted to do?  Maybe something else?  Maybe ballet? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No.  I want to be designer, some clothes stuff so... But it's hard to study and play tennis.  So I think if I can, after, when I finish, I will do this, or be able.  
 
Q.  Why a designer?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I don't know.  I just would like to make some clothes, you know.  Just really like it.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yes.  
 
Q.  You seem to play well in Italy because I think once in Sicily you played well, no? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I won Palermo in '99.  And before, I won 25,000 in Gorizia.  So I really love Italy.  And I played lot of juniors in Italy.  It's like my second country I think (laughing).  
 
Q.  Do you remember where you played in junior events?  Florence or Salsomaggiore, Santacroce? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yes, exactly.  Salsomaggiore, Milan.  But not really good, just really good time (smiling).  
 
Q.  You don't speak a little bit Italian? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I  -- when I played juniors, I will understand good Italian.  But now, not really.  Sorry.  A few words, yes, maybe.  
 
Q.  Do you follow the designers in Italy?  Did you meet some? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, I really don't have the time.  A lot of practice.  And, you know, I have to study also little bit, but not designer.  
 
Q.  Which one do you like of the Italians? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I don't really know exactly  -- really good about this.  I just really want to do this.  So not really.  
 
Q.  Do you have any friends on the circuit that you go out with during the tournaments, the girls you see during the tournament?  Are they Russian?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, Russian usually  - Dementieva, Likhovtseva.  We try to keep together.  Because the same language, it's more easy to understand each other.  But I still really good to the other players so if they want to go somewhere, we can go.  Doesn't matter.   
 
Q.  Did you ever play Serena? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Was three or four years ago, qualifying Kremlin Cup, and I lost to her 6-love, 6-4.  
 
Q.  Do you think the match you played against Venus in Miami might help you to play this tournament better?  You played very well. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Not in Miami, in Dubai.  Yeah, was  -- I think it's gonna help me a little bit because I think they play similar.  But still they're different, because Serena play, I think, more aggressive than Venus.  And it's gonna be really hard for me tomorrow.  But I will fight.  
 
Q.  Who were the players you liked the most when you were young and you were looking up to players? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I think Monica.  When I was young, she play and she won some titles, and I watch her on TV.  But I really like Jennifer right now, how she plays.  I really, really like her.  
 
Q.  And the men? 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Hard question... Not watching men's tennis.  But I think Marat.  He's really good, impressive, how he's playing.
