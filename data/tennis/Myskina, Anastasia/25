THE MODERATOR:  Anastasia Myskina.  Please, questions.  
 
 
Q.  You said when we spoke yesterday you felt maybe you didn't have enough time between games.  Did that affect you in the final set today?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I was pretty slowly today.  I didn't move as well as I should move.  And I think I just deserved to lose this match because I wasn't really ready to win.  Amy was playing pretty good, I think, and she really want to win the match. 
 
Q.  Do you think coming into this tournament your preparations could have maybe been different or was it just really the weather which caused the problem?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, everything.  The preparation maybe wasn't that good enough.  The weather, as well.  You know, play lot of matches.  You know, just human being, you get tired.  And that's happen me. 
 
Q.  How did you feel having to go play doubles straightaway?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I didn't really want to play in the beginning, I was really upset.  But, you know, you play like a team, so you should play no matter what happen in your singles.  So I play. 
 
Q.  Will you play more grass next year?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Definitely.  I mean, it depends again the French Open, as well, because if you play two weeks, just no way you can play something before Wimbledon.  
 
Q.  Were you aware of the reputation of that court as the graveyard for champions?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  What is that?  
 
Q.  Court 2 has a long history in this tournament as being a place where champions are upset by lesser players.  Did you know about that?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  You know, I didn't knew, but I don't like the court at all (smiling).  It start yesterday.  I almost lost the match there.  So today that was my last match on that court.  I mean, doubles, it's different. 
 
Q.  You played there yesterday?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yes, and almost lost.  But, you know, I don't think it's court, just yourself, what you do on that court.  And it wasn't good.  
 
Q.  Is it very disappointing for you to lose today or do you still have in mind what you did in Paris?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Oh, definitely real disappoint.  I mean, French Open already in the past, and right now it's Wimbledon.  I'm really disappoint right now.  
 
Q.  For the future, what are your expectations for the next tournaments?  Do you think you will be ready to recover, repeat what happened in Paris?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No more clay courts in the future, but I don't know if you can repeat French Open.  For sure, I'm going to prepare for Fed Cup in Argentina, and Olympic Games, that's the main goal. 
 
Q.  I'm working on a profile of the Russian players.  Is it correct that you trained in the same club as Elena Dementieva?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Used to practice together, long time ago, when we were kids. 
 
Q.  Is that the CSK?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's Spartak. 
 
Q.  After that, what was the club you played in?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Actually I've been there for all my life.  I move couple of years ago to the private club.  Nothing special. 
 
Q.  Spartak, you were with Marat Safin's mother?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yes, for 10 years. 
 
Q.  Which other players were there with you?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Just Dementieva.  Kournikova was in Spartak, but she was different coach.  
 
Q.  Do you wish you could really take a long break now to absorb the French Open?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's no way I can take a break, because we have Fed Cup. 
 
Q.  Do you wish you could?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I wish I could, but there's no time.  Everything happened too fast.  But, I mean, that's the schedule.  And you play every year the same, so you have to be ready for that.  I hope I will prepare myself for the Olympics game. 
 
Q.  Do you think it's rather silly to have the French and Wimbledon so close together?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It was already question yesterday the same.  Yeah, it is, it's really close.  But like I said, you professional tennis player, you have to be ready for that.  If you not, you just lose.  
 
Q.  What will be your plans now?  Will you spend your time training, preparing for the Fed Cup, or spend a couple days in London?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  I'm still in doubles and mixed. 
 
Q.  Once it's over. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  As soon as over, I go home, then fly to Argentina week before Fed Cup starts because it's long trip and we have to acclimatization. 
 
Q.  So hardly no break?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's going to be no break at all.  
 
Q.  Did you feel being the French Open champion, that put you under more pressure here?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No, I didn't feel pressure at all.  Of course, a little bit.  But it's just completely how I was feeling, and I was really tired today, and I wasn't feel pressure, I just felt that I can win that, I can win the match. 
 
Q.  Does it make you more determined to come back next time?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  No.  I mean, if you mean for Wimbledon?  
 
Q.  Yes. 
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  It's going to be less points to defend, so I'm going to be completely free to play here, and I'm going to feel comfortable.  
 
Q.  Do you think if you come to Wimbledon very well-prepared, do you think you have a good chance to win this tournament as well as in Paris?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Why not?  I mean, if you can win a French Open, why not Wimbledon?  You just have to prepare right.  I mean, it's different surface, different game.  Serve is really important, and my serve wasn't that good today.  
 
Q.  Do you feel good on grass?  Do you think your game is good for this surface?
 
ANASTASIA MYSKINA:  Yeah, I feel good.  Just, you know, I feel comfortable on grass.
