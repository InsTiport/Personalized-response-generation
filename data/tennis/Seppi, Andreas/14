 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Did the rain throw you off a little?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: I don't know, it's always tough to restart a match when it's so close. I mean, 4-All, breakpoint and a long break, it's never easy.   
 But I think after I played some good points, so I can say that the rain, I mean, stopped it.   
  
  Q. You played Rafa four or five times now. Did he seem the same today as he has in the other matches?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: For sure he doesn't play for a long time. It's not easy to came back always, especially in the first rounds. I think you have more chances than maybe in semifinal or final.   
 So I knew that, and, yeah, I tried to play my best and it was close.  
  
  Q. From and outsider's perspective, it looked like his timing and fitness was good, but he wasn't moving as good as he had. Is that how it felt to you?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: Maybe a little bit. You can see maybe with the knee also. He didn't walk a lot like last year or in the years before.   
 Maybe his fitness is a little bit down, but I don't think that's a problem for him.  
  
  Q. The match turned on really just a couple points in both sets. Do you take encouragement from that, or how disappointing is that?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: Yeah, for sure I'm happy the way I played, but in the big points he was better. I had a lot of break chances, especially in the second set. I was 4-All, Love-40, and also the game before I think I had two breakpoints.   
 So I mean, I had my chances. So a little bit disappointed I am for sure.   
  
  Q. I think Rafa can be intimidating to other players. Do you feel that way, and it is the same?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: No, I mean, I know how he is, so I'm not intimidated to see him like jumping or running. It's normal. I think he's like that. You have to take it that way.   
  
  Q. You didn't have a set point in the second set, did you?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: No.   
  
  Q. You did in the first set?  
 ANDREAS SEPPI: Yeah, I had one at 6-5, 30-40. I think he served an ace or something.
