A. SEPPI/K. Nishikori
  3‑6, 6‑2, 6‑7, 6‑1, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   This great record of yours this season, five‑set matches, 7‑7, what do you put that down to? 
ANDREAS SEPPI:   Well, I don't know why, but I think physically I'm feeling well, you know, and I think as long the match is as well I'm playing always. 
Yeah, I mean, physically I feel well if it's five sets.   I think also especially today I was serving better in the fourth and fifth set. 
Yeah, that helped me a lot, especially to win, I think in the end. 

Q.   Do you have a particular mentality when you go into a fifth set?   Boris made that famous quote about it's not about the tennis, but about it's about who wants it more and about the heart. 
ANDREAS SEPPI:   I just try always to give everything.   The last matches I went always before the toilet to get some focus back and energy. 
You know, the fifth set is more a fight, so you have to give everything.   That's the most important thing.

Q.   Kei just said that you looked totally different player after the first set.   How did you turn things around?
ANDREAS SEPPI:   Yeah, as I said before, I think at the beginning I was not serving so, so well so I couldn't play as I want from the baseline because I had to play a lot of second serve and he was more aggressive than me.
I think after the first set I started to serve better and I could play more aggressive, especially my service game.   And also on the return game I tried to step in a little bit more. 
I think after the first set it was 50/50 for sure.   First set he was playing better.   That's for sure.
