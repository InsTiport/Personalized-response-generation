A. SEPPI/S. Giraldo   
4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  It's unusual to ask first not about the match, because the Italian guys will ask that later.  Can I ask different questions about tennis topic?  
ANDREAS SEPPI: Okay.   
 Q.  The ATP will play the NextGen Final with sets to four and shot clock and stuff like that.  Would you like to play like this?  Do you see it as a future option for the ATP Tour?  
ANDREAS SEPPI: No, I don't like it.  But anyway, I don't think I'm playing so long anymore, so I don't care what they are doing in the Next Generation Finals.   
 Q.  But do you think we have to or the tennis community has to change something or is it good as it is right now?  
ANDREAS SEPPI: I don't know.  Of course sets to four, it's different because, you know, if you start, if you didn't start well, then, I mean, the set it's quick over and deciding point, of course it's a little bit more tense watching the match.  I think it can go away or in the other direction also if you maybe play better than the opponents, because, you know, it's deciding point is always very tricky.   
It depends.  I think it's better for lower-ranked player, let's say.  They have like, I think, maybe more chance.   
 Q.  And how about the shot clock?  There is always a discussion that the umpires let some guys go away with taking too long.  
ANDREAS SEPPI: Yeah, it can be good, but if you do the clock watch, then you have to do it on every court, not just center court or the main courts.   
So if you do it on every court, then it's okay.
