USTA: Questions in English?

Q. Yes, Jiri and David, since you were more aggressive at the net today than the
Americans, did you make any tactical adjustments from the last two times you had faced
them?

DAVID RIKL: Well, we did some changes for this match. Our captain, he saw the match
also at Key Biscayne and he told us, you know, that that was very good match last time but
we have to do, you know, more intense, especially from my side on the line. Which is, you
know, I was doing well, especially at the end of first set and then the second and third.
And it helps very much.

Q. For the captain, can you win this now? Can you get one of the two matches, at least
one of the two matches tomorrow?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: We are in the moment very happy what happened now, and we wanted to
have Sunday to be very good tennis. We are not thinking too much in the moment for
tomorrow, because as we said, we approach this match to play ball after ball, so... And we
are going to do the same thing tomorrow. Nobody in team got very overexcited or thinks
that something should happen, but the last step is most difficult.

Q. Can I ask you, is this a dream weekend for you so far? (Laughter.)

JIRI NOVAK: This is not a dream, this is the reality. (Laughter.) We are leading 2-1
and for sure we are very happy because we play against them two times, we lost, we didn't
win the set. So we are very surprised that we won 3-love. So this is not a dream, this is
the reality. We are leading 2-1 and we will do everything what we can do for the victory
in this match.

Q. What about you against Agassi?

JIRI NOVAK: I think it will be very tough match for me, but there is one thing very
important for me, that I don't have to win, you know. I just can win because we are
leading 2-1 and there is still another match coming. So I can play pretty easily. 

Q. David, is this the best doubles you, as a team, have played ever?

DAVID RIKL: I don't think so. We played, you know, a lot of matches during the
tournaments. We beat also Woodies, Woodbridge-Woodforde, they've been first in the world,
last year in Indian Wells. You know, we beat, you know, a lot of teams who are the top
five or top ten. So we just said, Well, we have to be positive and keep going whole match
and hopefully we win, and we did it.

Q. Why did you raise your game? How were you able to raise your game to such a level?
Is it playing just for -- is it the principle of playing for your country that enabled you
to do that?

DAVID RIKL: Because we knew what we have to play, you know, against these guys, and you
can say we lost twice against them, but we know what is the best to play. We spoke with
Martin Damm, he beat them last time in Key Biscayne. He told us what to do, and it was
working, you know. Also captain told us you have to do this, that, that and it works.

Q. Are you surprised? On paper, the Americans are obviously the favorite. Are you
surprised by their performance here, especially Sampras and the doubles? Were you
surprised by how they played so far?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: You mean they did not play well or something like that?

Q. Well...

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: It's very difficult, you know, you don't realize. I said yesterday I
felt very sorry for Pete because Pete, I consider Pete to be the best player ever, and he
just did not have his best day only. It should not be the way like one day is a big hero
and the next day he's a loser. I think it's the same with American doubles. We were all
seeing O'Brien and Palmer are playing because they played -- I think really one set goes
to Martin Damm, because he won against them last week, you know. See, he knew exactly what
he should do. I was watching also both matches every point and we did exactly what they
don't like. You know, so if it could be even easier when David would not lose one set.

Q. You keep saying you did exactly what they didn't like. What did you do that they
didn't like?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: Against them you have to return 90 percent of balls along line. You
cannot go for cross because they are -- they are crossing net very well, and the next one
is our double is very technical double. They like to play softer-placed volleys and you
cannot do that against them, and also you have to stay both players returning in the
fence, they have to stay on the baseline, in one line. They cannot have one at the net
because they are playing many volleys against that guy. 

Q. Jiri, how tired are you right now, and how fresh will you be for tomorrow?

JIRI NOVAK: I'm not tired. I'm just happy for the victory, and I think and I hope that
I'll be ready for another match tomorrow. So I feel pretty comfortable.

Q. Jan, Captain McEnroe said his players simply are not working hard enough. Do you
detect a lack of effort on their part?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: No, I don't think so. We did not have any fight with McEnroe here
during the week because of practice, because they are coming for every practice session
and they've been practicing very hard in Key Biscayne. This is just Davis Cup, you know. I
think John McEnroe is going to be probably the best captain ever for U.S., but he still
doesn't have enough experience. It's only his second match, and I think a concern, he's
behaving very well, and I am supposed to -- I have to say that everybody organization is
very good. Jeanie Buss is doing her best to do everything for us, and we are feeling here
very well, and maybe that's why our players are playing so well. (Laughter.)

Q. Jiri, David, the atmosphere, particularly in the third set with the organ chords,
you know, the cheering, you know, even fans cheering when you guys were making service
faults, did that affect you at all? Did that unnerve you, or did you just figure that you
could sort of rise above it emotionally?

JIRI NOVAK: We were very fine because the same atmosphere we had in Czech Republic as
well, you know. So... That's nothing new for us. But, you know, it was pretty difficult
moment for us. Everyone leading all the time, we were 2-love up, then we had the break, we
had the 3-1, but we made maybe one or two mistakes and we lost the serve. But still we
were 2-love up, you know, and it must happen sometimes, you know, because this is such a
strong team, Palmer and O'Brien. There is no way that you cannot lose the serve game, you
know, during the whole match, best-of-five sets. We would just keep going and we were
trying to make another break and we did it.

Q. Jan, why do you say you think John McEnroe will become one day the best captain for
the United States?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: Because this is a guy, I don't remember anybody who loved Davis Cup
really, because most players don't like Davis Cup because it's a lot of pressure. And many
countries are not playing even the best players. This is the guy who really play, he's
having great Davis Cup record, he loves this competition, and he's having -- he's having
charisma, he's having influence on the young players. But this is not easy job because at
the beginning, you know, when I was doing coaching job, I was also playing every point
with them, you know, you cannot do that like captain. You have to relax also in between
points. This is what he cannot do now, I think.

Q. Jan, you said when this started that the US Team was probably the greatest Davis Cup
team put together. If your team defeats the greatest team, what does that make your team?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: We are -- I am very happy because we have been asked many times why
Czech Republic produce so many champions in the past and we don't have anyone now, so I
think our new champion is sitting beside me, you know. I think this is new. And I think
also they are one of the best double teams in the world. Even if it would be 2-love down
after first day, we knew that we have a chance in doubles, you know. This was always open
point. And the problem, who makes the serve point, it's we take it just easy. You know, we
will see. It's -- anything can happen on the last day.

Q. Captain Kukal, you say that McEnroe probably will be the best U.S. captain ever, but
you also say that he doesn't have enough experience. How are you able to determine that,
that he doesn't have enough experience?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: No, he lead only two matches. I am having lot of respect for him,
and understand very well how it is when I was starting to do it. I was mostly with Women
Federation Cup, which is more difficult job, I would say. (Laughter.) I was playing also
every point at the beginning. I did this job for a long time ago, I was even with
Romanians against United States in 1972. So I'm in this job for very long time and I am
having a lot of respect for McEnroe and we have nothing -- I think he's going to do this
well. It's only -- he's having only very tough matches at the beginning. This is very
good. Because Zimbabwe was, I think, similar match to this one.

Q. Jiri and Jan, both of you, you've been saying all week that there's no pressure on
us. Now you're up 2-1. Is there pressure now?

JIRI NOVAK: No, I don't think so. (Laughter.)

Q. Playing three big matches in a row like this, three days like this, does that
happen?

JIRI NOVAK: I think it can be possible. How I said, I can still play without pressure.
I don't have nothing to lose. I play against the player who is No. 1 in the world, I'll
just try to play my best tennis and I will see tomorrow.

Q. You've played three big days like this.

DAVID RIKL: He's physically very strong, so he's just fine. (Laughter.)

Q. Can you talk about your past matches against Andre and what kind of adjustments
you'll have to make against him tomorrow?

JIRI NOVAK: I think I must be very strong physically for tomorrow, you know, because
from the baseline, we have played a lot of points from the baseline. I think it will be
very nice match for the people which will be coming for the match.

Q. Jan, given that your strategy was successful today with the team with what you were
telling them to do, did you outcoach McEnroe? Were you the better coach today?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: No, no. Not at all. Just, you know, we would be in the same
situation when we would have No. 1 double team in the world and then would come a team
unknown for California, because I don't think they ever played here. Did you ever play
here, California?
JIRI NOVAK: No.
CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: They never played here. They're unknown and they were playing very
well. It's surprise not to McEnroe, it's surprise to everybody, to all spectators, you
know. But be careful of Jiri tomorrow. I do not know if I say it in English well, Iron is
his best friend.
JIRI NOVAK: It means that I will have spent another three hours in the fitness, you
know. (Laughter.)
CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: He would like it.

Q. You've been very gracious about giving credit to the American team. How do you feel
personally about the fact that you have been continuously labeled the underdogs, yet
you've walked away with victories? How do you feel about the fact that you've been
underestimated as a team?

JIRI NOVAK: It was question for me?

Q. For any one of you.

JIRI NOVAK: Captain. (Laughter.)
CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: Sorry, I did not understand very well. I thought was for Jiri.

Q. I've said that you've been very gracious about giving credit to the American team.
How do you feel about the fact that you've been so underestimated continuously yourselves?

CAPTAIN JAN KUKAL: No, we don't blame anybody because we understand this. This is -- we
have been, even -- we were very grateful to John McEnroe because we had lot of stories
about picking Roddick and talking to Sampras over TV, and they did not write even in Czech
papers about us. So we were very happy that there was so much publicity about the American
team that we were feeling really, really well. But players knew about this chance and this
is -- this is chance of their life, you know. And so that's why they knew it already for a
long time and this is still the same thing. It's still very far to make the serve point,
but we -- it doesn't bother us.
