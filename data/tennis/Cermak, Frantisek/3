CERMAK-MERTINAK/Nestor-Zimonjic
  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. You must be pretty happy with that. 
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: It was amazing match for us. Probably the best this year. Yeah, we are happy. 
 But we still need to win one more match to go to the semis.

 Q. I guess you didn't expect it to be that comfortable. 
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: No, definitely not. Because we played against them a week ago in Paris, and I think we played maybe the same level, but we lost in three sets. But we didn't have a chance. They played much better there, so... 

 Q. Now it comes down to the final group match. 
 MICHAL MERTINAK: Yeah, we will play in two days against Fyrstenberg/Matkowski. They played very well the last two matches. We will see. It's going to be tough to beat them. But we will try. 

 Q. You must take a lot of confidence from today going into that match, though. 
 MICHAL MERTINAK: Yeah, yeah, we are, yeah, so... 
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: But, I mean, they played two great matches, so I think they are confident, too. So it's going to be... 

 Q. Should be a good match. 
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: I hope, from both sides, especially from our side (smiling).
