BHUPATHI-KNOWLES/Cermak-Mertinak
  6-3, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Your thoughts on the match? 
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: It was our first match in Masters, so we were a little bit nervous I think. They played well. 
 So we really didn't have too many chances. That's it.

 Q. What did you make of the atmosphere out there? It was a pretty big crowd, wasn't it? 
 MICHAL MERTINAK: It was nice because it's full. Crowd was really nice today. It was very good. 

 Q. Must be good playing in front of that many people. 
 MICHAL MERTINAK: I played once in Chile in Davis Cup. It was 12,000 people. But this is a little bit more, yeah.
