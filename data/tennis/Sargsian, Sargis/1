THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  All your hours on the tennis court prior to Andre, did that help, hurt or what?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Well, definitely it didn't help.  But I was pretty fresh today for some reason.  I was fine.  I was fine.  Just my knee broke down a little bit in the second set.  I don't know what happened.  Like my muscles, everything else, I felt my speed, I was fine.  
 
Q.  Can you characterize this tournament, what it's meant to you with those two fantastic matches?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  It's been amazing.  It's been amazing, especially in a year like this where I've struggled.  I didn't feel like I was playing my best coming to this stretch.  To pull out matches like I pulled out against Massu and Mathieu, I don't know, it's unbelievable.  
 
Q.  So it's a very positive tournament?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Very positive.  Very positive.  
 
Q.  What did you and Andre talk about at the end of the match, if anything?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  No, he just asked me what was wrong with my knee.  Then I kind of wished him good luck.  He told me, "Great tournament."  That was it.  
 
Q.  Was the old man here today?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yeah.  He was in the box. 
 
Q.  How old is he now?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  101. 
 
Q.  Is he still playing?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  No, quit.  
 
Q.  He did quit?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  He doesn't play any more.  
 
Q.  Did you come into the court today thinking that you had done what you had to do or did you really believe you could do it today?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  You know, for me it's strange to play Andre, to be honest.  I really hope this is the last time I play him.  I feel like -- I don't feel like I have a game plan against him.  You know, like I don't know how to win the points.  Like I've played like Federer or something before.  I mean, I lose obviously most of the times, but still I feel like there is a way, I have a game plan.  But with Andre, you cannot serve and volley, you cannot play him from the back, you know, you cannot hustle because you know he's not going to miss, he's going to make you run till tomorrow morning.  I don't know.  I don't like playing him.  He just plays so fast.  He rushes you so much.  It's very uncomfortable.  
 
Q.  So why do you like him so much?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  I don't know on the court.  But off the court, he's nice.  
 
Q.  There are a lot of foreign players in American college tennis.  You were not the first and certainly not the last.  If you had it to do over, would you play college tennis in America or would you have gone straight on into the pros?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  No, no, for sure I would.  What I would change, I would go to college when I was a little younger.  I went there, I was 20.  Because for me it was great.  For me even at that age, I still needed some practice, some kind of growing up to do.  So college was great for me.  Maybe for some other kids, it's not the best thing, but for me it was very good.  
 
Q.  Patrick McEnroe said he thought, frankly, that any kid in America who wasn't higher than the Top 15 in the Juniors should go to college rather than trying to go on into the pros.  Do you think that's a good idea?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  I think so.  I think so.  Because I don't see -- if you are good enough to be a pro tennis player, I don't think going to college one or two years is going to hurt you.  Yeah, you might start make the money a couple years later, but you're going to be mature.  I think it can hurt you if you go to the pros earlier because mentally you going to start losing matches and it can really affect you mentally.  
 
Q.  How many years did you play?  It was Arizona State, right?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yes, two years.  
 
Q.  How many years have you been on the tour now?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Since '95.  Eight years, nine years.  
 
Q.  It didn't really slow you down?  In fact, you say it helped your social growth. 
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  It helped not so much my social growth as my game because I just needed the training.  
 
Q.  Did you have a good coach?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yeah, Lou Belken.  He was pretty good. 
 
Q.  I'm sorry?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Lou Belken.  He still coaches in Arizona State.  He was pretty good. 
 
Q.  Will you go back for a degree someday?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  No.  No way.  Too much studying.  
 
Q.  Is there a championship of Armenia now?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yeah, must be.  There is.  
 
Q.  You don't play in it?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  No.  It's not a fixed day.  They mix it up.  
 
Q.  But you did play for it, didn't you at one time when you lived there?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Oh, yeah, I've played it a few times, but not lately.  I think couple times when I was visiting there, they would set it up, the time that I would come.  So I did play couple times.  But it hasn't happened last couple years. 
 
Q.  Did you win it?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  What years would this have been?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Couple years back.  2000, 2001.  
 
Q.  2001?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Let's go 2001.  
 
Q.  2001, 2002, or just once?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Just once I've played. 
 
Q.  Where would they have played that?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yerevan, the capitol. 
 
Q.  If your health and physical condition continues to be the same, would you say you'll follow Andre's footsteps to playing into the mid 30s without any problems?
 
SARGIS SARGSIAN:  Yeah, I would.  As long as you enjoy it, that's the most important.  As long as you're willing to work, I would do it.  Body, of course, it's important.  If my body holds up, I think I will play for next two, three, four, whatever, as long as it goes.
