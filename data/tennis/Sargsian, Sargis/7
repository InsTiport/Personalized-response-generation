 Q. How well did you and Andrei know each other back home when you were growing up?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Well, we have been playing juniors like probably 14 'til 18, and we
know each other pretty well. But we haven't seen each other for the past four years, five
years. 
 
Q. When was the last time you played him; do you remember?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Probably when I was 16 or 17. I got beat pretty easily, straight sets. 
 
Q. Did you have any expectations that this could happen today?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Well, of course. I mean, I wouldn't bet on it, but I was hoping it
might happen. 
 
Q. The final point, I mean, you went down to your knees. Was the feeling just so
overwhelming for yourself right then?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah, you know, I had so much pressure. I just -- it is really hard to
finish it off. It is the hardest game, I mean, when I saw that ball going to the net, I
just, I mean, I was pretty happy. 
 
Q. After you went two-set down, did your game improve where you are just improving as
the match went --
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: After I was two sets down, I kind of started -- I had nothing to lose,
and I started more attacking the ball and which I should have done from beginning,
probably, just worked out my way, you know. 
 
Q. Could you sense he was starting to get that you were doing things that were starting
to frustrate him; that he was getting more and more frazzled by the things that you were
doing?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I think that because every short ball I was trying to come in, I think
that is why I put a little pressure on him, maybe that frustrated him so... 
 
Q. Did you play with the tension of your racket very low?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: It is very loose, 57 pounds, which is lower than average. 
 
Q. I suppose you play only the second five set match, how do you feel?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I feel pretty tired. I hope I don't go -- I don't go another five
sets, but we will see. 
 
Q. Right at this point, can you kind of think what would have happened if you hadn't
taken this path; if you hadn't come and lived in the states and tried to go to school; can
you even imagine what it would be like for you right now? Could you have made this point?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I don't think so, because, you know, going to school, Arizona State,
was really great for me. I just had a great coach. I really concentrated more on my tennis
than on my academics. And I really had great practices, really worked out, had nothing
else on my mind. 
 
Q. What did you study?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I was majoring in business. 
 
Q. Speaking of business, have you turned pro?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yes, last -- this May. 
 
Q. Who is your coach now?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I am working -- I have been working with Brad Stine for the last four
weeks. 
 
Q. Do you know how long it has been since the NCAA singles champ has won a match here
at the U.S. Open?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I don't know, somebody told me for 10 years, 9, 10 years, but I am not
sure. 
 
Q. Do you think it is pretty remarkable and are you surprised to be in this position
yourself?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah, I am pretty surprised. I mean, I knew I could win one round, but
winning two rounds, you know, first Grand Slam, it is -- I am pretty surprised. 
 
Q. How many times did you play him before you were 16, before the last time you played?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Played him a lot. I think I played him four times, and I beat him
first two, which we were, I don't know, 9, 10 years old; then we got through when we were
like 15, 16. He was beating me, so he was playing better than me. 
 
Q. Obviously, you know when you were younger but going out there today looking across
the net at him, did it seem like a different person? Did he just seem so enormous, maybe
so formidable at that point?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I was just trying to concentrate on the game. It was just another
person on other side. I mean, I didn't feel anything, you know, like he is my friend; I
have known him. Just another match. 
 
Q. Where do you play, I mean, in which place do you practice?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I live in Connecticut, Orange, and I stay with the Mansourian family. 
 
Q. You practice there?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah, I am either there or either in California working out with Brad
Stine; one of those two. 
 
Q. When you looked up in the stands at the Mansourian family what were you thinking?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: What was I thinking? 
 
Q. What came to mind when you saw them, when you looked up at them?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I don't know. It was just unbelievable. I looked at them and couldn't
believe I came from two sets down against a guy like Medvedev. I haven't thought about it
when I was down two sets, will I come back? I was even down a break; it just happened. 
 
Q. Have you ever felt over the last three years as you watched the rise of Medvedev and
Kafelnikov and saying"I could be in that group as well?"
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah, that gave me a little confidence and when both those guys broke
top 10, you know, and I really thought that I could at least break top 50. So that did
give me a little confidence. 
 
Q. You said you turned pro in May. Can you describe what your goals are in terms of
what you are going to do with the money that you earn on the Tour, and is it going to go
home to your family there to bring here; what is your interest in that regard?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I haven't planned anything yet, but I don't know. Let us first get the
money, then we will see. I don't have much now, so I don't have to think about it. I mean,
yeah, I am going to help my brother, my parents, you know. 
 
Q. Is it true your parents were supposed to come?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah, my mom and my brother actually they are coming either today or
tomorrow. 
 
Q. You don't know?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I don't know what flight they are on. Tell you the truth. 
 
Q. Did that enter into your mind during the match where they are?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No, they are not kids. They are not going to get lost. Most important
thing is that they are coming, so..... 
 
Q. How long has it been since you last saw them?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: 2 1/2 years ago. 
 
Q. Did they come to the states before?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No. 
 
Q. This is the first time they are coming?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Yeah. 
 
Q. Would you say this is the happiest day of your life?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: One of the happiest. Let us put it that way. 
 
Q. Was there any kind of conversation or connection with Andrei before the match at any
time like him saying hello to you or did you talk to him in the lockerroom?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I just said "happy birthday." Today is his birthday. 
 
Q. After the match or before?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Before the match. That was it. 
 
Q. Did he say anything to you?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: He said "thanks." 
 
Q. How did you happen to know it was his birthday? 
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Well, Brad Stine has been working with him, so... 
 
Q. What parts of your game, part of your game do you want to improve?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: My groundstrokes, I would say. I want to make them solid, you know, so
I don't hit very hard, so I got to start hitting harder and make less unforced errors. 
 
Q. What is your living arrangement? Are you looking to bring your mother and brother
here?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: One of my goals is to bring my brother to go to school here, you know,
and my mom, my parents -- actually, they are seeing what they are going to do; whether
they are going to stay here or go back. It depends on them. But I definitely want my
brother to go to school here. 
 
Q. How old is your brother?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: He is 21. 
 
Q. Does he play?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No, he doesn't play. 
 
Q. What is his first name?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Eduard. 
 
Q. Just like we spell it?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No, E-D-U-A-R-D.  
 
Q. How long is the plan for them to stay here right now and is it affected by how you
do in this tournament?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No. No. No, it doesn't affect. They are just going to stay -- they are
planning to stay for a month or two. That is about it. 
 
Q. In Orange, planning on staying in orange?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Actually -- yes. 
 
Q. Speaking of Brad Stine, he has to be expensive.
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Well, he -- you know, he did a great favor to me, so I mean, I can't
afford him obviously, so we kind of made a deal, so we both would be happy. 
 
Q. Have you planned for the next tournaments?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I had. I was planning to play a satellite in California, but after
what happened here, that might change. 
 
Q. Ever played Jared Palmer as a junior?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: No. 
 
Q. Which is bigger winning the NCAA or this here tonight?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Oh, this. Definitely. 
 
Q. Why? 
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Because NCAA I was favorite and here I was underdog. 
 
Q. Who was it that you beat in the NCAA final?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Brad Hansen (phonetic). 
 
Q. From?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: USC. 
 
Q. What is the biggest difference you found since you left college?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: You mean different in the games? 
 
Q. The difference of the tennis you were playing in college and this one, the biggest
adjustment?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: This is more fun, I think, you know, you win, you get something back.
In college, you keep winning, you go back and you have to study, so. 
 
Q. Is everything from here just gravy or do you feel you could maybe continue to move
on and get in the next group?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: Well, I got Agassi on my way, so -- 
 
Q. Maybe not. Maybe Corretja. What do you like to do in your free time?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: I play golf. I like music.  
 
Q. Which sort of music?
 
 SARGIS SARGSIAN: All kinds, I would say.
