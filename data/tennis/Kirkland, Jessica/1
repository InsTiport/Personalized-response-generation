THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Congratulations on making the final. 

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Thanks a lot. 

Q.  You looked very nervous when you went out today?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Yeah, I was pretty nervous.

Q.  How come you were so much more nervous than at the Nationals?  There was a big crowd there, too. 

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Yeah, I mean, it's a junior Grand Slam, so I've never really been in that situation before.  I really wanted to do well, but I think I went out a little bit too nervous (smiling).

Q.  Were you surprised how well she played today?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  No, I know she's a really good player.  It's just I never really -- I kind of helped her play good, because I never really played my game, you know. But, you know, she played great. 

Q.  How disappointed are you not to make the final and win the championship?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  I'm not really disappointed.  I'm just happy I made it to the final.  Hopefully next time I get in a situation like that, hopefully I can win the tournament.

Q.  Are you planning on playing more ITF Juniors?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Yeah, I am.

Q.  What would you do next time? 

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  I probably wouldn't be as nervous because I've been in -- this is my first huge, I guess, final.  So I'd probably have that experience.  I think I'd do a lot better, so...

Q.  What is the whole experience of the tournament and making it to the final at the Open, what do you think that can do to help you in the future? 

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Well, when you play in like a Junior final, there's a lot of people watching.  There's TV on the court, a lot of journalists.  It's just something I have to get used to because I'm not used to that yet. 

Q.  Did it bother you, the cameraman standing by you?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  No, it didn't bother me.  It's just I -- it was more of the idea of just being in the final that made me nervous, so...

Q.  Is there anything about your game that you weren't happy with today?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  My serve.  I didn't hit a lot of serves in.  I could have been a lot more aggressive on my forehand.  I think I was too far back behind the baseline, and she got to dictate a lot of the points. 

Q.  Where are you going from here?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  I am going to play the ITF in Tulsa, then try to play the WTA event in Philadelphia, so...

Q.  Will you come down to Orange Bowl this year?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  I think, yeah.  I think I'm going to play that tournament. 

Q.  Did you watch the final last night, the women's final?

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  Yeah, I saw a little bit of it, towards the end. 

Q.  What struck you the most, impressed you the most, or stood out from watching Kuznetsova? 

JESSICA KIRKLAND:  I was just -- I was really impressed that she, you know, she's 19 years old and she really wanted to win it, so you really couldn't tell she was nervous.  She just really wanted to win the tournament so bad. I was really impressed at the closing ceremony when they both mentioned 9/11.  That was really nice.
