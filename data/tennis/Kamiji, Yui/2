 7-6, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Could you just both give us your thoughts on the match, please.
 A PLAYER:   Yeah, today, well, it's tough match.  We played against each other last two, three matches, and we won one match and they won one match, so it's, like, deciding match.
 Yeah, we played well, but it's not enough to win.  They played very well, and we couldn't find how to, the way to win today.  So, yeah, I'm very happy with our performance but still need confidence and try to make another tactics.
