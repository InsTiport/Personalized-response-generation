THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Singles and doubles champion. How does it feel?
YUI KAMIJI: Of course, I'm very happy that just after the last point I wanted to finish with my service game, so little bit disappointed. But, yeah, still happy.
Q. You have this tournament played very perfect tennis. Sometimes we've been watching you and going, She's not going to do anything wrong. Is that how you feel?
YUI KAMIJI: I don't think I was perfect in these days. But I just focus to play my performance. Yeah, I feel getting better since after first week of this month. I just play fun and not have pressure, just play my tennis, yeah.
But it's not still perfect (smiling).
Q. 2017 champion. How do you think you've developed as a player since then?
YUI KAMIJI: Yeah, my first win here, my first title here was after Rio, next year after Rio. I was really relax, yeah, enjoying. Something like this year. It feel similar.
But my performance, my tennis is improving. I tried many things last year. I found little bit change than before. Now it little bit work. So I try many, many things in the match, yeah.
Q. You talked about having fun with your tennis now. You're now on Instagram.
YUI KAMIJI: Yes. Yeah, I just created my account.
Q. Is this a new era of you on social media?
YUI KAMIJI: I just look other players, like Jodie, the other players. But Shingo told me yesterday when we were waiting for the rain, before he told already me I have to have the account. I just ignore. He tried many times.
Yeah, I just start. Will be fun.
Q. You've had such a strong start to the year. How important is that for you for Tokyo?
YUI KAMIJI: I think it's very important because normally if someone won this title, then the player is very good whole year. I feel something like that.
Yeah, it's like not my goal, but it's very important thing to win here, yeah.
