PESCHKE - SREBOTNIK/Stosur  Â– Lisicki
  6-3, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Kveta, how does it feel to be a Grand Slam champion finally? 
 KVETA PESCHKE: It's terrific feeling. I mean, I'm playing for so many years, so this is, we say, the cherry on the cake. 
 I'm very proud of us. We played magnificent through the whole tournament and through the whole year. We are happy to have the trophy in our hands. 

 Q. What made the difference? The fact that you're doubles specialists? 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: It's never too much. 
 KVETA PESCHKE: Yeah, that's true. 
 Yeah, I think the singles players, it's good that they play doubles. I mean, that helps their game definitely in the singles. 
 Me, as a doubles player only, or us, because Katarina is playing doubles only as well, it makes a difference on the court if you click together with your partner, if you know the moves. 
 It's different game than singles. I think this experience we can bring in our game. 

 Q. You had more energy in the tank as well, playing only doubles. Sabine seemed to be out of steam a little bit. 
 KVETA PESCHKE: When I see the shots down the line, I don't know. 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: I think her tank was pretty full on those shots.
 KVETA PESCHKE: But our battery was loaded. 

 Q. How does it feel to be No. 1 in doubles now? 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: Yeah, it's impossible to describe I think these feelings, you know, right now. It hasn't sunk in yet. 
 I think tomorrow morning when we'll wake up, we'll realize we've achieved two big things, you know, like we've been waiting for this a long, long time. I've been in four finals before winning with Kveta now, been with one more time before this. You kind of want to get that Grand Slam under your belt. That's the first accomplishment. 
 And, of course, being No. 1, this is a dream of every player, regardless singles, doubles. It's a very big thing. Very proud of that. 

 Q. The final today, you were pretty dominant. Can you each say what the other one did really well in the final today? 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: I mean, through the whole tournament, we really played extremely well. Today we kept the nerves really good. Even though we were down 1-3 in the first set, we believed in this and knew that we can win it if we perform the same. 
 We just kept being positive and pushing. 
 KVETA PESCHKE: And we stick to our strategy, what we want to do the whole time. Never gave up on it at any time. Happy on that. 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: And we enjoyed. You know, we really enjoyed this final. This is one thing we did very good. Maybe we didn't want it too much, like maybe some other times you burn when you want it too much, and you cannot perform so well. 
 We tried to enjoy every minute of it, being out there. This Centre Court, I mean, it's amazing. I think winning a Grand Slam here in Wimbledon is, for me, special. 
 KVETA PESCHKE: It's a special moment. 
 KATARINA SREBOTNIK: It's special no matter how you look at it. It has some --
 KVETA PESCHKE: -- magic.
