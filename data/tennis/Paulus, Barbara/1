Q.  Did you expect her to be that good?

BARBARA PAULUS:  No, I didn't expect her to be that good.  I tried to play topspin.  It was too short with my balls.  If I get too short, she makes points everywhere. Sometimes she played serve and volleys when I didn't expect that.  But she had nothing to lose.


Q.  Had you seen her before?

BARBARA PAULUS:  No, never.  In the locker room.


Q.  After playing her, what do you think of her game? She's only 15 years old.

BARBARA PAULUS:  She's playing very well.  She has a different game than Martina Hingis.  They're about the same age.  She is playing very aggressive.  She comes a lot to the net.  She has a good volley.  She's very cool on the court.


Q.  What about her power, is she very hard at her strokes, very powerful?

BARBARA PAULUS:  Yes.  I mean, I think you saw it. 


Q.  Tomorrow is your birthday, right?

BARBARA PAULUS:  Tomorrow, yes.


Q.  Happy birthday.

BARBARA PAULUS:  Thanks.


Q.  When you say she's cool on the court, she plays with more poise than you would expect for somebody that age?  What do you mean "cool"?

BARBARA PAULUS:  She has nothing to lose and she doesn't get worried when she makes a mistake; she just plays.  She doesn't take much time between the points. She's always in a hurry.


Q.  Does she have a chance against Graf?

BARBARA PAULUS:  Yes.  I mean, Steffi Graf is playing very well.  If you want to beat her, you have to play really very good.  But, I mean, a everybody has  a chance.  I think it's very difficult to beat her.


Q.  Looking back, would you have done anything different in that match, knowing what you know now?

BARBARA PAULUS:  What do you mean?


Q.  Do you think you should have played the match a little more differently?

BARBARA PAULUS:  I don't know.  That's hard to say now.  I mean, I try to play topspin, but the balls were too short.  It's very difficult because she plays very flat. It's hard to go under the ball.
