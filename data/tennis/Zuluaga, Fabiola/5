VERONIQUE MARCHAL:  Questions in English.  
 

Q.  Venus (inaudible).  What's that like on stadium court?
 
FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  I'm used when I'm in Colombia, not outside of my country.  We know there is many Columbian person in America.  This is the first time a Colombian plays the Lipton in a main draw.  Now I won two rounds.  I was so good in Colombia.  That's why they come.  I feel very good.  I feel like I can do more. 
 

Q.  Do you think it made you play better, that you were a little more focused or had more energy out there?
 
FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  Venus plays so hard, she plays inside the court trying to get her ball back.  But I feel the next time I play better.
