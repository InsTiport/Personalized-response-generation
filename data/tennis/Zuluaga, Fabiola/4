 Q. Was Amelie too strong for you, or was there something wrong in your game? 
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: I think she played really good. Her shots were really deep, so I would
travel, try to get them back, and also I was a little bit tired. I've been playing since
Saturday here. I've been having a lot of tough matches. But I think she played really
good. She played the way she has to to beat me. I feel okay. I had a great week, and maybe
next time I can beat her. 
 
Q. Could you tell me just a little bit about you? I mean when did you start, why did
you start to play tennis, does anybody in your family play tennis that pushed you to play?
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: No one plays tennis in my family or does any sport. 
 
Q. Why did you choose tennis?
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: Well, I'm from a really small city, and so we had a club and all the
kids used to go there and do everything like soccer, swimming and basketball and
everything. Tennis was one of those. That's the way I started to play. When I was 12, I
started to go to the club so I had more chances to play tennis. 
 
Q. Did you play any other kind of sport?
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: I like to swim, yeah. I played basketball, but I had to decide in one
of the three sports. I couldn't do all so I had to choose one. 
 
Q. What's your goal in tennis?
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: My goal? 
 
Q. Yes, in tennis.
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: To be in the Top 10. 
 
Q. Do you want to be in the Top 10 in the next three years, five years, two years, what
do you think?
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: Well, I want to play, like, until 25 or 26. I think I have to maybe
enjoy my level as a person, so I decided to go to 25 or 26. And I know that I'm trying.
I'm practicing as hard as I can and doing my best on the court, so when I go out and I win
every match, I know that I'm getting closer to my goal. And I don't know, maybe this year
I can get there or in four or five years. 
 
Q. My last question. You said that you came from a small city. How small is it? How
many people? What is the population? By small, what do you mean by "small"? 
 
 FABIOLA ZULUAGA: I'm thinking. (Laughing.) 800,000.
