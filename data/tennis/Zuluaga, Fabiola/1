THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What was going through your head up a break in the third set?  You were saving match point after match point. 

FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  I really was enjoying this match.  I've been playing really good, especially last year.  Well, I had my best results, but I didn't feel I was -- I mean, I had no confidence.  I start playing really good here, so I just was trying to enjoy every point, try to enjoy the atmosphere, playing against Maria, such a good player.  In this stadium with some Colombians.  I was just trying to play point by point, just enjoying myself. 

Q.  Why couldn't you close it out?

FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  Well, I think I let her go in the third set really easy.  Then when I start coming back again, it wasn't that easy.  She start making a lot of mistakes, but also good winners, fast, deep balls.  It was not easy to handle those balls.  But I tried.  I'm okay.  I mean, I did my best.  Next time I have to maybe put some more first serves in so she cannot come with the second serve (smiling). 

Q.  Did it make any difference to you at all that it was Maria that you were playing?  Did that affect the match at all?

FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  Not really.  When I play someone that is in a higher ranking than mine, I just go out there and think, of course, I have to do my game, but the other one is the one that has to win.  Is the favorite, so she has to make it to the final or win or something like this.  So I just go out and try to play my game, like I say, enjoy every point I play. 

Q.  What do you think is the best aspect of your game?

FABIOLA ZULUAGA:  Normally I play aggressive from the baseline.  Well, we play on clay, that's my favorite court.  I think that's the most important thing.  And try to put a lot of first serves with the good power a little bit.
