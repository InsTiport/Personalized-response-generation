THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Virginie.  
   
 Q.   When did you find out that you would be playing the match instead of Alize?  
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   I can't tell you that because it's confidential, you know.   But I was ready to play and I had a good week for practicing.   I was ready for play any time.   
I'm happy to play today.   I lost, but it's for me a match.   It's only a match.   It's for the French team, but sometimes you can't win every times.  
So I do my best.   
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about the match, what you knew of Sloane before and stuff.   
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   It was tough today, yes, because she play very good.   She is 17 in the world, or 15, I don't know.   
You know, she has a game with a lot of variety.   She has a good timing.   For me, I know which solution I must do to make.   
But, you know, sometimes not easy to defend the surface, to defense many things.   And to defense you also, because you are the actress to do your job.   I do my best.   Sometimes you can't win.   It's the life, you know.   
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about Caroline Garcia.   She's young and obviously it's all hanging on her now.   She played a really good match yesterday.   
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yeah, she play a very good match yesterday.   Every match is very different.   We never know against who do you play and the games you play.   One match is one match.   After it's everything different.  
I hope she win today.   It's very important for us to come back on the 2‑All and play this doubles, because we want to win and to come back to the No. 1‑‑ you know, in the group.   
   
 Q.   Merci beaucoups.   
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   De rien.
