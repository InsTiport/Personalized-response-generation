V. RAZZANO/P. Kvitova
  6‑7, 7‑5, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was that the longest match you ever played, three and a half hours?
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yes, I think the last one it was against Serena Williams in French Open from one year ago. 
Yeah.   Against, Serena it was three hours and two or three minutes.   I don't remember exactly.   But, yes, today it was more. 

Q.   Talk about it mentally, the match point, the back and forth all the way.   You had a crazy second serve at one point, too.   Do you remember? 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   I think if I serve with forehand it was the same.   I prefer I think to serve with my forehand.   I can be better maybe.
No, this way it was not very good, you know.   Maybe next I can do that and I can surprise my adversary, you know. 
Yeah, I had a lot of stretch, you know, for serve, I think, and I didn't serve that well.   (Laughter.)
I don't want to serve again like that, you know.   (Laughter.)   It's the same if I play with my sister.   No, no. 
Yes, great match.   Very good match.   I'm so happy today to win and going in semifinals, because it's a big tournament and I work a lot for tennis and physical gym for come back with my ranking.   It's from two or three months I had a good result in my tournaments.
I make quarterfinals last week in BÃ¥stad and I lost against Pennetta on clay court.   It was not my surface.   But it was a good tournament after holidays and come back on clay court. 
I improve again here after when I go into hard court ‑   it's my surface ‑ with a lot of work before.   I am very happy because we have a lot of work and I am come back, you know.   I take time maybe.   I am not quickly girl.   I'm not quickly girl for comeback. 
But day after day, you know, week after week, after many tournaments I do my job and I deserve I think(In French) what I did and a lot of work for comeback.

Q.   How much of your ranking falling to almost 200 was injury and how much was other things? 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yes, I had injury on my right hip.   The year when I played Serena Williams, after French Open I must stop for six months and I didn't play and I didn't defend some of my points.   That's why my ranking was 200 three months ago.
You know, I had a problem of the hip from two years ago also, last year and two years ago why it's difficult for comeback when you don't defend your points and you didn't play. 
This year in January I can't play a lot of tournaments because my ranking was so bad, 200, you know.   And there is not WTA ‑‑I didn't get in quallies for WTA.   Why, I tried to play ITF tournaments, and there is not ITF tournaments from January to March. 
Just $10,000, but I don't want to play $10,000.   I play one and I win one in Amiens I think in February.
But, you know, it's difficult conditions to play for to win these tournaments.   I wait for $50,000 for ITF, and it was only in March.   It was for me two months very long from here, you know, because I am practicing from November, December, January, February, March.   Five months for practicing, you know, and you're staying home. 
Sometimes you say, Okay, now I want to go in tournaments to play, please.   You know, it's good to stay with a lot confidence on me, because I say, Okay I can play.   I practice at home, and I wait and I wait when is my time, you know.   When is your time, you go to play and you go. 

Q.   This is your fourth tournament to go through and get into by a wildcard.   You've also done qualifying in two tournaments.   At one time you were ranked 16th in the world and fell all the way to, I believe it was 196.   How does it feel to be on the rise up and have the success you've had this week? 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   The success is, you know, a lot work.   There is not secret.   I work a lot.   I don't want to be quickly, you know, and say, Okay, Virginie, you must to be quickly for comeback.
No.   Take your time.   I take my time.   I'm practicing a lot.   I stay with focus on my job, you know, to work on my game and when you go on court. 
I think I am a champion, you know.   I am a champion, because it's not easy for comeback every time if you have some problems with injuried [sic] or pressure of life.   It's not easy.
I think I have a big character, you know.   I have a strong character and I'm never down.   I am every time going up.   It's life.   You can't go down.   You must to go and progress and do your job during your life. 
If it's professional life, you must to do your best.   It's my think, you know, every time when I go to work for my job.   If I don't think that, I prefer to stop and say, Okay, this is finished for you, Virginie.

Q.   When you were struggling so much and the ranking goes down, did you ever considering quitting?
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   I had some difficult day, you know.   Sometimes I say, It's difficult to come back.   Maybe I can't came back. 
Of course I have one question like that:   Do you think you can come back?   But I was 16 in the world in 2009, and I played many times and I beat many top 10 in my career, you know.
I play a long time from 1999 for professional in WTA Tour and I have incredible career.   I beat I don't know how many top 10, Dementieva, Zvonareva, Safina, Serena, Venus.   You know, I can do‑‑ Radwanska, Agnieszka.   I don't know.   Many. 
But, yes, for me, I'm a champion because with my, you know, life, personal and professional life, I don't‑‑ maybe I don't have a life like that, professional, but I'm continue to progress, you know.   I never stop for many problem, injury problem or, you know. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yes, very good.   I stop six months for that.   I treat a lot.   I wait when I feeling okay for comeback. 

Q.   In the third set you were serving at 5‑3 and had the three match points.   When those went away, what were you thinking at that point? 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   I think I was nervous, you know.   (Laughter.)   If I don't tell you that I am not human.   I am human.   (Laughter.)   It's normal.   I'm not a robot, you know. 
Sometimes you can feeling stress, you know, emotion.   I tried to focus on me, on my game and on my points when I'm feeling nervous.
Sometimes it's not easy, you know.   You know you are not too far for to win and you're nervous and you must to put your emotion down, you know.
With my experience I know how you must to do for to win.   If you stay like that, you can't win.   You must to progress and say, Okay, point after point, game after game, you go. 
I did my best for that and I think I do a good job, you know, for to go in step, you know. 

Q.   How do you go from being so stressed, feeling all that stress, blowing the three match points and then a fourth match point, how did you get from there to over the top? 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   I think I used my (indiscernible) I think I use‑‑ after points and after points my (indiscernible) because in my head I never lost. 
You know, I'm stay a lot positive and I'm never think you can lost.   You know, never think like that.   It's every time I go and I play point after point.   I never imagine I can lost. 

Q.   (Question regarding her parents.)
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   My mother, she stay in la creche.   I don't know in English. 

Q.   Daycare. 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   She work La creche for baby and kid. 

Q.   Right.   And your father was a police officer?
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yes, police municipal, yes. 

Q.   What I was getting at was that it doesn't sound like you came from a privileged family, a wealthy family.   Sounds like you probably plugged away in your career.   When you had tough times you kept plugging away.   Your background is seemingly very humble.   Growing up in that kind of environment, did they set the example to never quit, keep going, keep going?
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Exactly.   (In French. )   Because my parents not have lot money, rich money or people, okay, you are okay, because I have sister, you know.   We have two in family with my parents. 
My father learn when I'm young to me, you must to (In French).   You must deserve what you want to have, you know.   Everything is not going on, you know, a place.   You must to go and you mustto ‑‑ yes. 
After then they gave me a little mental.   You know, a mental.   He give me a mental for to continue and fight every time. 

Q.   You talked about some of the heartache that you've been through and what you've gone through on the tennis court.   In your bio it talks about you lost your fiancee I believe in 2011 or '12.   I'm assuming that's what you're talking about.   Is that the type of thing you're talking about?
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   Yeah, that is why I said before I am champion.   I am maybe a champion not top ten because I have a life like that and I don't have, you know, a staff every time to have suggestion for players, you know.
I would like to take care for my boyfriend, my husband, you know, to live before he's going to because he has a big sick.
I would like to have a suggestion for that.   I can't focus on my tennis.   Some player, if you have staff for like that that say, Okay, no.   You focus on your tennis. 
But, no, for me it's my life also.   I can't go only focus on one things, you know.
For me it's everything very important on my life.   You know, why I say I'm champion because I can focus only on my tennis.   For me it's very important focus one person, you know. 
Maybe my ranking going down.   Maybe I had injury because everything was difficult for me to make, you know, important‑‑ I don't know.   (In French).   In French it's not easy for explain everything.
