THE MODERATOR:   Questions for the French team. 

Q.   Talk about Caroline.   Just an amazing weekend. 
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   Totally amazing.   She was unbelievable yesterday already and today again with both singles and doubles, with the help of Virginie in the doubles. 
I think she loved Fed Cup.   (Laughter.) 
No, I'm happy for her.   You know what?   I'm happy for her.
CAROLINE GARCIA:   Oh, yeah?   Are you? 
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   Yes, for the whole team as well.   She really stood up to the occasion, she rose to this occasion being fearless completely, being great, and supported by the whole group, the whole team.   Not only the players, but these guys out there, also. 

Q.   Caroline, you come here and you win three.   What's this been like?
CAROLINE GARCIA:   I don't know what's happen.   (Laughter.)   No, last week in Bogota was great week also for me. 
But it's also like a lot of work behind this.   It's not every day I feel this great, so we have to take it and just keep going. 
No, this weekend is just amazing.   I can't believe it's happen.   I did it 3‑2 and it was so tight.   Yeah, we always trust and always believe, and we did.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Talk a little bit obviously about being back in the World Group next year.   How important is that?
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   It's important for the French team.   It's important for the girls.   They came here really wanting to have this win.   It's important for the French women's tennis.
It was a big challenge a year and a half ago when I took the job.   The goal was obviously to get back into this World Group, and then we will see a little bit further in the future. 
So I'm happy for them.   They work hard all year long, but then they also make themselves available for these weeks.   It's not easy.   We had to fly here.   They were coming from tournaments tired, jet lag. 
So I'm happy that they get the reward with being able next year to play in the World Group.

Q.   Talk a little bit about that, because obviously you say it's a commitment, and you're a captain who has their best players willing to play.   Not every captain has that advantage. 
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   I'm lucky.   I'm lucky.   I don't know.   I think in France it's quite important.   The national team, it's something that we really cherish.   We are proud to play for our national team.
To carry the flag is always something that's quite emotional and something we have to do, and that we take pleasure doing.   I think it's a cultural thing, also.
The girls are responding to this really well.   I was responding to it as a player.   I'm now a captain that is really lucky and happy to have all the best players in my country.
So it's great. 

Q.   How will you celebrate tonight?   I expect the rest of us at the hotel not to be sleeping. 
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   Yeah, that's possible.   Where are you staying? 

Q.   At the Westin.
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   Bad luck.   (Laughter.)   I think we will destroy one floor.   Maybe more.   (Laughter.)
CAROLINE GARCIA:   And the lobby as well.   (Laughter.)
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions? 

Q.   Virginie, talk about your doubles match.   You had a good lead, they came back, but you got your poise in that second set and finished them off. 
VIRGINIE RAZZANO:   (Translated from French.)   It was not easy after my single because I was very disappointment, you know, for the team to lost.
After I must to be prepare to play maybe in the doubles, you know.   It's not easy, because, you know, it's not easy to come back and play in doubles. 
You know, I'm any time ready to play with any girls.   The decision is captain to say and tell me, Okay, you play with Caroline or Claire, you know.   Or Claire with Caroline.   We never know. 
But the most important is we win today.   And the team, we were everybody ready to play in singles and doubles.
CAPTAIN MAURESMO:   I translate. Most important is, you know, the l'equipe, the team spirit.   L'equipe, is team spirit.   Because the force is like that.   France is like that. 
I think the ambiance, the atmosphere, you know. 

Q.   Claire, it was your first Fed Cup outing.   What was the experience like? 
CLAIRE FEUERSTEIN:   I was happy when AmÃ©lie called me to come with the team.   I hope that next time I will be on the court, but we will see.   I need to have some results.   I know that. 
I'm very happy for the team.   I hope that I can help them during the weekend.   We will see for next year.
