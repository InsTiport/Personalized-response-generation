TSENG CHUN HSIN/J. Draper   
6-1, 6-7, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  He looked incredibly strong, technical player.  Was it character that helped you to take that all the way?  
JACK DRAPER: Yeah, the adrenaline from the crowd, for sure, having that many people watching me was just real (indiscernible) for me.  Yeah, for sure.   
 Q.  You started off pretty shaky in the first set.  Was that just nerves, the fatigue from Friday?  
JACK DRAPER: It was a bit of everything, also the occasion, getting used to having that many people watching you is a tiny bit of pressure on me.  I'm a Brit as well.  I learned to embrace that the second set, went from there.   
 Q.  You seemed to relish the occasion as the match went on.  Is that how it felt, that you really thought you could thrive in that situation?  Did that give you a taste for the future?  
JACK DRAPER: Yeah, for sure.  It gave me confidence because I feel like I'm able to do those things and have those celebrations.  But I've been practicing them.   
I'm joking, I'm joking (smiling).   
But, yeah, it was amazing.   
 Q.  You have at least one more or two more gos at the juniors.  
JACK DRAPER: Yeah.   
 Q.  How was the whole experience for you here?  Having gotten to the final, what kind of confidence does that give you?  
JACK DRAPER: It gives me immense confidence.  It feels surreal still.  I'm still taking it in.  Yeah, it's been an unbelievable week.  It's going to give me a lot of inspiration, motivation.  I'm very happy.   
 Q.  What was the turning point for you when you calmed yourself down?  Was it an internal thing or a big point?  
JACK DRAPER: It was probably when I got the game at 1-Love in the second after having two breakpoints down.  That sort of got me back into the match, I felt, because I felt then I settled down and got used to everything, so...   
 Q.  Your opponent was here earlier.  He's saying he plans to play US Open, then turn pro next year.  What are your thoughts about that at the moment?  
JACK DRAPER: I'm going to go more into the senior game, for sure.  I'm not really sure looking ahead at how many juniors I'm going to play.  I'm definitely going to try and transition into the men's game.   
 Q.  Sort of gradually, maybe not all in?  
JACK DRAPER: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
