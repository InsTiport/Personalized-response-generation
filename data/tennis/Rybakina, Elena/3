THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You must be proud to have played so well, even if you didn't win the match?
ELENA RYBAKINA: Yes, I played really good. It was actually a close match. I'm a bit upset that it's again just final. In the beginning of the week I didn't even expect that I can be in the final.
So it's been a great week for me.
Q. How would you describe the challenge of facing Simona? What is the trickiest part?
ELENA RYBAKINA: She's a great champion. She's fighting till the end. I mean, I have nothing to say. She played really good.
It was a great match from both of us I think.
Q. You've beaten this week players ranked 3, 7 and 15, and took Simona, world ranked No. 2, that much from victory. How do you look back on the whole week?
ELENA RYBAKINA: As I said, I didn't even expect result like this. But I'm really proud of myself that I managed to play all these matches and beat such a great players.
So, yeah, it was pretty close today. Still it's been amazing week here.
Q. Is there anything you think you could have done better today? I can't think of anything.
ELENA RYBAKINA: I don't know. It was so close. Just two points difference. I don't know. For sure I had some opportunities, I had some chances. Still, I mean, I couldn't even know that I can be in the final, so...
Q. Why did you switch to Kazakhstan nationality?
ELENA RYBAKINA: Can we just skip this question (smiling)?
Q. Do you have enough energy for Doha or will you make a decision later?
ELENA RYBAKINA: I think I will play. I mean, I wanted to play in Doha. We will see when I come there. I'm going to fly tomorrow, then already on Monday I have to play.
I will try because, of course, I'm tired but I think that I can play this week also, then I will have some rest.
Q. Are you looking up to a certain player which has had a track record similar to yours, made such a strong entrance into the top in such a short amount of time? Are you inspired by another player in history?
ELENA RYBAKINA: Yes, of course, it's motivation also for me that everything is possible. Of course, I'm inspired. I mean, I don't know.
Q. Do you look up to a certain player which had a similar ascent to the top like you did in such a short amount of time?
ELENA RYBAKINA: You mean which players?
Q. You tell us.
ELENA RYBAKINA: No, I think I'm focusing on myself more so, yeah.
Q. Who were some of your favorite players growing up?
ELENA RYBAKINA: Justine Henin. Actually I love watching men's, Roger Federer, yes.
Q. Talk a little about Simona's return and how difficult it is to serve to her.
ELENA RYBAKINA: To serve?
Q. To Simona.
ELENA RYBAKINA: She was playing really good, returning also. I have a good serve, and it was not easy to take my serve.
Yeah, she played really good. Everything was good: returns, the baseline she's fighting and running, yeah.
