E. RYBAKINA/S. Kenin
6-7, 6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A year ago you were ranked 192, now you're in the top 20.
ELENA RYBAKINA: Yes (smiling).
Q. What happened?
ELENA RYBAKINA: What happened (laughter)?
Q. So many good results in the last six months.
ELENA RYBAKINA: So now I had good pre-season actually. First time I did like six weeks of preparation. I mean, I feel good on court. Of course, tired today because of the flight. I just finished a tournament.
But still I feel confidence, so...
Q. What were your expectations coming here? A final on Sunday, then a flight. What were your expectations tonight?
ELENA RYBAKINA: To be honest, I didn't nervous at all because I knew it's going to be tough. Actually I prepared myself like it's a good practice. I didn't expect that I will win. I mean, I tried to do my best, but I was not nervous, so...
Q. Why are you winning so many matches this year, more than anybody else?
ELENA RYBAKINA: We started to work with a new coach year ago. He helps me a lot. Like I said, it was first time for me the pre-season. It was really good.
I think this is just the answer.
Q. Where did you prepare?
ELENA RYBAKINA: I had pre-season three weeks in Rome and three weeks in Slovakia, Bratislava.
Q. You won a lot of close matches this season. Have you been working on anything mentally, psychologically to help you in those tight situations?
ELENA RYBAKINA: We worked a lot. We trying to work a lot on my techniques because still a lot of things I have to improve. Of course, we work a lot on tactics before the match.
For example, the final yesterday - no, two days ago - I didn't follow tactic at all. Today I didn't feel the ball as good as I could. I followed the tactic I think like 90%. That's why I won also today.
Q. Your confidence must be really high at the moment. Playing the Australian Open champion. Before the match, you still believed you could beat her?
ELENA RYBAKINA: Yeah, of course I believed. I didn't think that she just won Australian Open because I know that now everyone could beat everyone. I didn't think about this.
