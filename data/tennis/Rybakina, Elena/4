E. RYBAKINA/P. Martic
7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How are you feeling after that?
ELENA RYBAKINA: So tired, but happy (smiling).
Q. How did you manage to fight back in both sets?
ELENA RYBAKINA: First set it was not easy because she plays really good. She has really good slices. Her serve, it's not flat like I played with Pliskova for example. It's completely different style of game. It was not easy to start against her.
But I tried to work every point. Second set, of course, I was 3-0 down, but I knew it's going to be easier to win this set than play a third one. I wanted to win second so much.
Q. What do you think you did well today?
ELENA RYBAKINA: I didn't start to serve good first set. Then in important moment I managed to serve really good. Serve helped me today.
I don't know, I was fighting every point. I think just fighting.
Q. If someone told you at Christmas that within a few weeks you would have reached four finals, what would you have said to them?
ELENA RYBAKINA: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's amazing. Hopefully I can continue to play like this this year and next years also, so...
Q. You played a lot of tennis recently. How do you now recover to get ready for the final tomorrow?
ELENA RYBAKINA: I just sleep a lot. I tried to sleep a lot today. I played at 5:00, so it's good. I'm going to the physio, just stretching like usual routine.
