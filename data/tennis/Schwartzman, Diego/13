THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. I'm curious what you thought of the conditions out there today and what it was like to play under the lights at Roland Garros.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, it was funny, you know, playing my first match this year under the lights.  Was totally different feeling here in Roland Garros.
Yeah, also this year the tournament changed the balls.  The conditions are different because of the month, as well, because of the weather.
It's different conditions for everyone who is here.  So we have to adapt to these conditions and try to do our best.
For me, playing at night, similar to Rome under the rain, under the lights, was similar to the last week, so I felt great on court today.
For me, the conditions today were really, really good (smiling).
Q. How important was that tournament in Rome, getting those matches in and going as far as you did for preparing for this tournament?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, it's very important, because I didn't start really well in USA, the first three tournaments I did not well.
And then I arrived to Rome to try and get confidence and to play a few matches, and I was doing very good matches since the beginning.  So I took a lot of confidence there.
I start very well here.  I don't know my opponent yet, but that's going to be on Wednesday.  But I'm feeling great.  So Rome helped me a lot to get the confidence back.
