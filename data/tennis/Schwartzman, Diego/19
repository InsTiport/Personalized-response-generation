D. SCHWARTZMAN/F. Davidovich
6-1, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you reflect back on today's match and your prospects continuing in the tournament.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Well, today match was tough because of the conditions. Was not easy to play today with the windy.
Thinking about that conditions, my game was very good, very solid. The game I was trying to do, before the match I think to do, was very nice on court.
That's why I'm in the next round. For the next matches, I need to keep continue like today and like the match before. Just I'm thinking about that.
