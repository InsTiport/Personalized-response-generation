THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on your performance today?  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Well, it's difficult always the first match in the year after one month and a half having holidays. I'm practicing in the preseason, and now the first match with this weather, you know, 45 degrees inside the court, difficult to play, difficult to be ready every single point.   
Then I think he deserved to win. He played much better than me, serving better, doing better things on court. That's why the result was like this today.   
 Q.  Do you feel like it was too hot? Do you feel like there maybe should have been a heat policy put into play, or do you feel okay?  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: It was difficult for me to continue doing good things after the first set and a half, because I was not serving very well and I was, you know, defending maybe all the time.   
You know, that part of the game with this weather, it's difficult to do every point. So every single point was difficult for me at the end.   
 Q.  Can you take us through the dispute there in the third set? What was the issue there?  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: The call review?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: It was about one -- I was saying the referee said "out" before I hit the ball, and that's was the call review. And I think in the video it was before. It was funny, but it's okay.   
 Q.  It's okay. Had you heard much about Juan Martin, us hearing he's not coming to the Australian Open now, another injury for him? Sounds like he's going through a tough time?  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Juan Martin? Yes, it's a situation for him since Shanghai when he start with this injury in 2018. It was difficult for him coming back. He was trying with different doctors, with surgery after Queen's.   
He's not ready to coming back. For us it's also difficult, because it's always nice to have Juan Martin in every tournament and for Argentina, for the country. For the tennis there, it's also important to have him on court.   
 Q.  Have you spoken to him at all?  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yeah, yeah, we spoke. I saw him few weeks ago, and he's trying to coming back. He's practicing when he can because of the knee and seeing a few doctors. I think maybe in one month, two months, he's going to be ready to coming back.   
 Q.  I saw sometimes during the changeovers you were looking at the tablet with the statistics.  
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: It was not working. If you are going to ask me, today it was not working. I was trying every changeover to see where he was serving, but was not working.   
And now I was not calling the people who is in charge to maybe change. I was just trying, but, no, it was not working in our side.
