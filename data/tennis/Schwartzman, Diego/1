 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. We saw a young player just 20 with great strokes, big size, quite a bit of calm.  Most of us feel he can go really high, but do you think he can go to the very elite of the game?  Do you think with his skill sets that he can go to the very top of tennis?
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, I really like how he's playing.  He's looking very well on court.  When I see him, like I said yesterday, I see many things similar to Tomas Berdych when he's playing.  I played against Tomas.
 I felt the same today, you know, on court.  He's hitting really hard the ball.  He has very good timing, good serve, good movements.  He looks like he's playing in ATP Tour since many years ago.
 He's doing great this year.  Since Roland Garros last year he's doing great in ATP.  Obviously when you are American you have a lot of opportunities, you know, playing a lot of tournaments with invitations.  And right now he took every chance the American tournaments give to him.
 So he's playing great.  He has a lot of confidence right now.  I think he's going to increase his ranking for sure this year.
