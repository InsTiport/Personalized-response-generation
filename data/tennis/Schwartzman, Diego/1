7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. It was a tough match out there today.  Can you give us some thoughts on how you think the match went.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, yeah, it was a tough match.  First match of the year after two months and a half, more or less.  Against Daniil, how he played every single point, it's really tough.  I think it was a good match from my side.
A few mistakes with my backhand.  I think my backhand, it's my best shot, and today it was not working good enough.  I did a few mistakes in important moments with my backhand, and then I think I did a good match with my forehand serving, going to the net, but in the end, the serve is also important, the mistakes are important in important moments, and I think he played better than me.
At the end, he was serving very, very good, so that was, I think, the advantage for him.
Q. You're going to play against Japan the day after tomorrow.  What kind of impression do you have of Kei?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, Kei is one of the best in our sport.  He was not playing many tournaments last year, but he's ready to come back to the tour.  I think he did a good preseason.  Now he was under the hard quarantine for 14 days, so I think I have maybe a little bit of advantage on that.  It's going to be a tough match.  I don't know how he's playing, so I'm going to watch his match tomorrow, and let's see what happens.
When I played against him, I beat him, he beat me, so it's going to be a good challenge.
