D. SCHWARTZMAN/D. Shapovalov
6-4, 5-7, 7-6
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. You mentioned on court how you were fighting because of the possibility of the top 10.  How much of a dream is that to go out there tomorrow and play Novak for a chance to accomplish that goal?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, I have two dreams, you know, tomorrow.  One, it's winning a tournament like this.  And the second one, be top 10.
Both are there tomorrow on court against Novak.  I know it's very difficult.  Almost -- I need to play more than my 100%.  I don't want to say impossible, because it's not impossible.  I know can beat him.  But it's going to be very difficult.
But the chances are there tomorrow, so I'm going to rest, I'm going to do everything to be more than my 100% tomorrow on court.
Q. Never easy to back up a big win like you had against Rafa yesterday, so how good does it feel that you were able to come back and be so mentally tough today and do what you did against Denis?  And also, what would you say about the game of Denis?  He seems to be pretty good on the clay these days.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, today was a difficult match.  Denis was playing very good tennis, aggressive tennis.  At the end maybe the third set we were playing for many things:  for the final, for the top 10, for the match, for -- you know, the nerves were there.  It was difficult.
But I think I took my chances when he was thinking about to win and nothing else, when he was serving for the match and break up in the third.
And the tiebreak was difficult, but I think in the tiebreak I played better than him.  Maybe in the third set he played better than me and deserved to win before, but at the end, in the tiebreak, I think I was very solid.
Q. I really just want to know who you're texting with, because obviously your phone must be blowing up.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Are many here, but right now, my brother (smiling).  He's asking me about how I am after the match, if I am okay with my legs and mind.  I'm saying I'm perfect, so nothing else.  Family right now.
Maybe on Tuesday and Wednesday, the other people (smiling).
