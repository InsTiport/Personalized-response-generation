D. SCHWARTZMAN/S. Napolitano
6-3, 7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Tell us something about the match and how does it feel to be in the third round?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: I think the match was okay.  I was a little bit nervous in the second set because I saw my chance there with many break points.
And he stop after the first set.  He called the physio.
And I don't know.  I be a little bit nervous, but I think I play well in the final of the second set.  And in the third set, the last three, four games I play really good.  I feel comfortable being on the court, and it's good because the next step is going to be really, really tough.
Q. Next stop is probably Novak, Philippe Chatrier.  How does it feel?  Are you getting excited and what do you need to do in order to have a chance?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: I need to improve everything against him.  He's playing now, but almost done the match.
I need to improve and I need to be focused tomorrow to my recovery with the legs, with my team, trying to fix my body to be perfect against Novak if he won today.
And if nothing, I try to play better than these two matches.  I need to play more than my 100% tennis to beat him, and I try to do.  I have confidence.  It's my second time I play in the Philippe Chatrier and I try to enjoy.  It's third round.  I have matches already here.  And if nothing, I try to enjoy and play good tennis.
