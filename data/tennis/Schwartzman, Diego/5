  D. SCHWARTZMAN/E. Ymer
 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Diego, two sets to love up, and then obviously your opponent provided a bit of a challenge for you, so you must be very pleased to get through your opening round match of the Australian Open.
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Yeah, I mean, it's always tough to play the first round.  Ymer was playing a very good match, a very solid match.  He was trying to play many different shots in everything single point.
 I think the match the first two sets, he had chances, and I got lucky, and I think he didn't play well in the tiebreak, so that's why the first set was for me.  Then the second set maybe I improved a little bit and I was up in the score, and for him was tough.
 But then in the third he keep pushing, so he deserved to win that set.  At the end in the fourth, maybe he felt his legs and the intensity and the solid game that he tried to did, and at the end I took the advantage in the fourth.
