5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. You got a huge ovation at the end, even from Djokovic.  How was the atmosphere during this match?  Did you feel you played amazing, like, your best ever on this court?  What about the end, too, with the injury?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yes, maybe.  It was amazing for me the final of the match with the crowd, all the people here.  I am just say thank you for all of them.  Was really nice.  After Novak beat me, the final of the match, I receive everything, that noise from the people.  It's amazing for me.
It was my second time here in the Philippe Chatrier.  2015 I played really nice match, five sets, as well, against Monfils.
Today, yeah, I finish a little bit tired, and with a little bit of pain here, but was okay.  It's a big opponent for me, Novak, and I played really good tennis great part of the match.
Q. Can you talk a bit about how tough it is against much taller guys on the circuit?  You are one of the shortest guys, so how tough is it to play every match...
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yeah, yeah.  It always happen to me.  When I was young, was the same thing.  And I tried to improve everything in the baseline or my serve or everything to try to beat all the people taller than me.  But was always like this.  It's the custom.
Q. This was a great result for you, actually reaching the third round.  Do you think your level has something to do with the way you prepared this year?  You went to Holland and played an exhibition there.  And I believe you trained with Rafa Nadal.  Did it help you?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yeah, I think it's helping a lot.  Practicing with Nadal a few days in Mallorca was really nice for me.  I improve a lot in that three days with Rafa.  Always with that kind of players it's amazing for practice and for everything.
Yeah, I think I prepare really well this year, Roland Garros.  I didn't play the last week.  I tried to just be focused in this big tournament.  I won two matches.  Today I was close.  I think I was close.
But I try to improve for the next year and try to be in the next round the next year.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Spanish.
Q. What happened when you were at 40-Love in the third set?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: I wish I knew.  I have no idea.  Sometimes you're at 40-Love, you start thinking about the next game, and you don't finish the game you're in the midst of.
I think I was playing really well up till then.  I gave him an opportunity to retrieve his confidence, and then his tennis was amazing and he gave me absolutely no opportunity to break.
I tried to keep a bit of energy for the fifth set.  I have this pain in my side, which was getting worse.  When you're playing a guy like Djokovic, if you're not at 100% during the whole match, you just can't make it.
Q. I don't know if you think you gave your best tennis, but you definitely were playing better at the start.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Maybe I was fighting against myself, because I thought there was an opportunity there.  And at the start of the fourth set, maybe I got a little bit too excited losing 40-Love on my serve, because in the third set, as we were actually very close, he started to get really nervous.  What I wanted in the fourth set was to try and catch up as much as possible.  That's why I was a bit mad at myself.  I need to improve.
I played a lot of matches today against top-10 players, top-seeded players, and they were all pretty close.
Q. Two years ago you hurt your ankle.  Both times it was in five-set matches.  Beyond the pain of defeat, how does it feel to have played such a match against such an opponent?  Surely it's a great sign for the future.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yes, in 2015 when I played Monfils here, it was my first time ever in this huge arena, and there were plenty of players who never get this far.  Sometimes when you have an unlucky draw in 2014, when I came here, it actually helps to have experience on bigger courts and to face highly talented opponents.
Every time I play against a top-10 player or a top-seeded player, it helps a lot.  Today did, too.  I enjoy playing on these courts against these people immensely.  Rafa, it was an easy win for Rafa, of course, that made me very nervous.  I thought I really need to apply myself.
So, yes, I was a bit nervous, but I calmed down and I also love to play in front of large crowds.
Q. How did you feel at the end when you were packing your bags and you got this massive ovation?  Even Djokovic clapped.
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Yes, well, it took me a while to notice, because I was packing my stuff.  I could see that everyone was clapping and that Djoko was clapping and looking my way.  Then finally I understood, and I thought, okay, get your kit in the bag and try and enjoy the moment.  It's a truly extraordinary thing.
I think that persons who have not experienced it directly cannot even imagine how wonderful it is.  It's going to be a great memory.
Q. I wanted to know if the pain in your side is better.  Is it going to be a problem for further matches?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: No.  I think it's just because it was a very tough match.  When I had to stretch my arm, especially when I was serving, it was a bit of a pain.  It's still slightly painful, but the doctors say it's not serious.  We'll see tomorrow if I need a further examination.
But I think it's just exhaustion.
Q. Djokovic in 2015 was at his top form.  Do you think he's more vulnerable now?
DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN: Possibly.  But I'm a much more mature and experienced player, and I always try to keep the score very close.  I tried to prevent him from really overtaking me.
In the first set I really thought I had my chances.  And if I compare those two years maybe he played better then but I play better now.
