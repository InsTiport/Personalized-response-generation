 THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.
 Q. Can you tell me how you plan to pass the time over the next few days waiting for the US Open to begin?  And what advice you might have for anyone who asks you how to win matches in this kind of strange environment where there are no fans.
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, how to prepare US Open, I'm going to practice, like always.  Is tough to keep practicing, you know, and not play matches in a tournament, because we were practicing for many, many weeks.
 I have one more week to practice and prepare and try to improve the things I didn't do well in the match today and be ready for US Open.
 Then how to win matches, it's like always:  Playing better than the opponent or trying to have a better day than today.  That's the key.
 I mean, how is the situation right now outside from the matches with the COVID, it's important, but is not the key to win matches, I think.
 Q. When you're not practicing over the next few days, what do you plan doing?  How do you plan on spending your time?
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Playing cards with my team, watching Netflix and few movies.  Not more.  Not much.  Not much to do.  We are in the hotel on-site.  No chance to go out.
 So we are not having much to do right now.  Just watching, rest, practicing, focusing in tennis, totally tennis bubble is right now.  Nothing else.
