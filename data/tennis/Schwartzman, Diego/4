 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. How are you feeling about your early season form?
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, very well.  I start very well.  The last week in the ATP Cup, I felt very well on court, playing good tennis against Medvedev and Nishikori the second match.
 I had a good start here.  Maybe on Monday I played a good match, him as well.  That's why I won in four sets.  Now I did everything almost perfect today in the match.  The other guy starting a little bit nervous, I think, doing a lot of mistakes.  I took many chances at the beginning.  That's why I was up in the score quickly.
 At the end he was trying, but doing mistakes.  I was every single game playing better and better.  At the end that I think was the difference.
