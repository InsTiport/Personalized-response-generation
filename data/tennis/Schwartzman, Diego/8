 6-3, 6-3
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tough round here at London, but 2020 was an awesome year for you.  So many great moments.  I just wonder if you could tell me what it was that made you the most proud about what you've been able to accomplish this season?
 DIEGO SCHWARTZMAN:   Well, I think watching this tournament, you know, against the players I played and where I am right now, I think that's means a lot for me, because I feel like I deserve to be here with the best guys on tour.
 I won the chance to be here in many tournaments since a few years ago.  But also I see this week that I have to keep improving, because if not, being here against these guys, it's going to be really tough.
 I'm really proud because I did many great things in many different weeks this year, but also I have the feeling in my body that I have to improve, because I want to be here again.  But to be here again I have to do better.
 I don't know why, but we are going to work hard to find a way to come back here, win the chance to be here again and try to do better than these three matches.
