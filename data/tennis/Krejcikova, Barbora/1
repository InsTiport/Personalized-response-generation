5-7, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Talk about today's match.  What was the key to coming back and winning that against Tsvetana?  Seemed like you were pressuring her on her serve.
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   Yeah, I think it was a really tough match, really difficult match, really up and down.  I lost the first set.  Yeah, the conditions were really, really difficult.
I mean, I was just enjoying being out there, enjoying playing.  First time third round of a Grand Slam.  I was fighting for every ball, trying to do my best to win the match.
At the end I got very lucky and I won.  I'm very, very happy.
Q. What do you think has been the key for you this week at Roland Garros in terms of getting a fantastic singles result, but also in the tennis you're playing?  Seems like you're playing the way you want to play.  You look comfortable out there.
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   Actually, I don't know (smiling).  I really don't know what change.  I've been playing for many years.  I've been having so many good results in doubles.  Yeah, the singles just couldn't click in really.
I don't know.  I think maybe I just got better mentally.  Also I think the break that we got during the season, it helped me to practice little bit more, to work on the things that I wasn't able to work before, because mixing singles and doubles, it was really difficult.
Yeah, it's tough to answer this question because I really don't know what changed.  I just think, yeah -- I don't know.  I just think the break helped me.
Q. Do you feel different?  You said maybe it's mental.  Do you feel different playing at Roland Garros this year in singles?  You had singles success coming into this as well.  A long process for you this year.  Do you feel different?
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   I think for sure mentally I feel different.  I've been playing for so long.  I've been trying to break to the top 100 for so long.  Every time I was really close, I couldn't really make it.
So this time we got the stop, we got the break.  I think I was 116 or something.  Then I was like, Okay, now is the time to break it.  I was a little nervous about it because I really wanted to make it.
Coming to this tournament I tried to change my mind with this.  I was just like, Okay, maybe I will never make it.  Maybe I'm just going to be just a doubles player, okay?  It's fine.
I kind of like realized it, I was okay with that.  I just went here, I just wanted to play every single match.  I love clay.  I love to play in here, Roland Garros.  It was my very first tournament when I played main draw two years ago.  Two years ago we won the doubles here, my first Grand Slam.  You know, it's very special for me.
Also I have to say that today was really special also because my former coach, Jana Novotna, who passed away, she would have a birthday today.  It was very emotional for me, very special that I could win this match today.  I would like to also dedicate it to her because she would be really happy for my result.
Q. At Wimbledon when you won, this has come up quite a few times in terms of your relationship with Jana, what she meant to you.  The symbolism of all this happening on her birthday wasn't lost on us either.  Everybody noticed.  How heavy was that on you today?  Was it something that made things lighter?  As you said, it's an emotional moment.
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   It actually made it really, really tough.  Really tough.  I spoke with one of my friends, one of the former tennis players, she know Jana well.  We were talking about it a little bit.  She's like, Okay, now is the time.  You should play for her.
I'm like, No, I cannot do this because I'm just going to get too emotional, and it's not going to help me.  I'm going to be more nervous, more tight and everything.
I was like, No, I'm just going to go there, try to enjoy the match, and I see what's going to happen.  If I'm going to lose, still she's going to be really happy and really proud, so...
I went like this for the match.
Q. Looking ahead to playing Nadia Podoroska in the next round for a spot in the quarterfinals as Roland Garros, do you know much about her?  Have you played her before?  You're around the same ranking.
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   I don't really know if I played her.  I know she was playing the same tournaments as I did, so many ITFs.  She was playing the WTA in Prague where I saw her.
Yeah, so, I mean, until now I didn't know who I'm playing.  I'm going to look at it tomorrow because tomorrow I have a doubles so I'm going to look at it after.
Q. On the whole, what does it mean to you to make the round of 16 at Roland Garros?
BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   I'm really proud of myself that I was finally able to step out and to show how I can play, that I can have a success also in singles, not only in doubles.  I hope it's a right time to do it.  I'm just enjoying it.  I'm really happy to play a Grand Slam.  It's always an extra motivation.  It gives me an extra energy.
It's very special.  I'm just very happy that finally it just clicked in.
