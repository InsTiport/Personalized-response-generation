  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Talk me through your match, how you were feeling on the court today.
 BARBORA KREJCIKOVA:   I mean, yeah, I have to regroup.
 I mean, I start with the second question.  I felt really good on court today.  I mean, last couple of days I've been playing so many matches.  I was lucky that I was able to or have been able to win all of them.  So I'm just, like, really, really grateful that I played, that I'm going to play another two matches again.
 Going for the match, I mean, we start, we broke the opponent's serve, then we get to the lead 4-0 very quickly.  I just felt like they lift up the game a little bit and the game started to be really, really close.  It was like since the 4-1 lead for us, the match pretty much started from there.
 I mean, I feel like they really got way better.  I mean, I feel like there have been just so many no-ads where we got more lucky, I think just maybe a little bit better strategy how to play these points.
 I mean, I'm just really happy that we were able to play this well and we were able to control the match, that we won.
