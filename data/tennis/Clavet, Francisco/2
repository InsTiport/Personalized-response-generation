Q.  What do you think of this match?  This is a match to forget, isn't it?

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  It was a match to forget.  I had some expectations about this tournament and the Federation had given me a wildcard.  I was really looking forward to play.  Unfortunately, I've been very nervous and tense all during the match.  I haven't been able to play well.

Q.  Was it your last match? 

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  We'll see what the future holds.  After a long career, this has been a match to really say good-bye to tennis.  But I don't intend to play the same as before, not a hundred percent.  I might play other tournaments if I get a wildcard, but with a different perspective.  I don't want to call it the last match. 

Q.  Will you do a good-bye circuit next year? 

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I want to retire progressively, not all of a sudden.  I might play in tournaments where I get a wildcard, and if I feel like playing.

Q.  Would you have preferred to play a good match before you retire?

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  No.  I knew from the beginning I wasn't going to play at the same level as the last year, but in a progressive way.  Today's result doesn't change my idea of the way I'm going to retire.  I'm no longer going to be fully dedicated to tennis a hundred percent, playing every single day.  This doesn't mean that I will stop all of a sudden.

Q.  What about this year? 

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  Well, this year I think is over.  That's all for this year.
