 MODERATOR: Francisco Clavet. 
 
Q. Was it a matter of boycotting the Wimbledon Championships with all the Spanish
players together with Juan Carlos, or you didn't think about it, there was no issue? 
 
 FRANCISCO CLAVET: We didn't talk about that. They didn't talk with us. That's a problem
for them. I mean, we had other things to talk about. They took their decision. I think
it's good. I think it's right that they did, but they didn't involve us in their decision. 
 
Q. How was your preparation for grass? Did you spend much time playing on grass before
Wimbledon?
 
 FRANCISCO CLAVET: Just one tournament, that week in Hertogenbosch. I played there. I
think it's good to play there, to get used to this tournament. Maybe it's a little bit
different. There I was faster than here. But is good to play on grass at least one
tournament before this.  
 
Q. You're feeling good?
 
 FRANCISCO CLAVET: I'm feeling good. I think I play well last week. Today I'm happy with
my performance. I think as long as you play on grass, you used to the surface, you play
better.  
 
Q. You've been pretty successful on grass. You beat Rios here. Do you feel you can
achieve more? Is it right for Wimbledon to treat like this the clay-courters?
 
 FRANCISCO CLAVET: I mean, it's the only tournament that they did the seeded like, you
know, as here. For example, in Roland Garros, US Open, they do by the rankings. Here is
the results on grass. For me and for the Spanish, maybe for the clay court players, is not
fair. It's Wimbledon. I think they have to do something about this. The players are not
going to be happy. They are not going to come, like this year. We cannot do anything.
