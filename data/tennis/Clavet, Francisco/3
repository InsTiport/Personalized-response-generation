Q.  I just wanted to know if you could give me an assessment of Sampras' form, really, from your perspective.

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I think the first match is always very difficult because you have to get used to the court, to the atmosphere, to the balls, to everything.  And especially on grass. 

Q.  The surface was quite slippery, wasn't it?

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  Yeah, was slippery, was difficult to read the bounce, and was quite hot also.  So it wasn't easy to play. Anyway, I think he served really well.  I had no chance on his serve.  But the other side, I think I played good from the baseline.  But it's very difficult to win a match when he's serving like that. 

Q.  He said you were a very crafty opponent today -  you gave him plenty of slice and stuff like that.  You were happy with your performance to a degree? 

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I am happy the way I play because I think, you know, I did my best.  I play as best as I could.  But like I told you before, when he serve that way, there is nothing to do because, you know, I had like just one game 40-all and nothing else. 

Q.  How do you rate his chances of winning again?  People are questioning, saying that maybe he's won his last title.  What kind of a chance do you give him of winning here again? 

FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I think he has a lot of chances to win here again.  He's, for sure, a favorite, No. 1.  Maybe he didn't play well, you know, in the past this year on the clay court, but when the grass come, he's always the favorite for me and I think for everybody.  He has the game to win here, and I think he keeps in form.  So...
