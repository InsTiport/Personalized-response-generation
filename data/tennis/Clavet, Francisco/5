Q.  During the first set and half of the second set, you seemed to be in control of the match.  What changed?
 
FRANCISCO CLAVET:  Yeah, maybe in the second set, when he broke me, I think I did a double-fault there.  After he played two good points.  Since then, he start to play better.  I was a little bit tired.  I think I went down.  He start to play much better.  He played a better forehand, he didn't mistake.  After that break, he took the control of the match.  
 

Q.  What do you think are his best weapons on the court?
 
FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I think he's very quick and he has a very good forehand from the outside, outside forehand.  He's quickness I think is one of his best points.  
 

Q.  At the end you looked very tired.  Did you have any physical problems or was it just tiredness?
 
FRANCISCO CLAVET:  I just tired.  I start to feel a little bit tired.  To play against him, you have to be very fit.  He's very quick.  Make it difficult to make him a point.  Like I told you before, at the beginning maybe he make some mistake, but in the second and the third set, he didn't miss any ball.  Maybe I try too much.  I made more mistake than in the beginning. 
 

Q.  How do you see the final?
 
FRANCISCO CLAVET:  Is difficult to say.  Maybe Krajicek is the favorite to win the tournament.  He's very strong, has very good serve.  I think he has played really well here.  He has had very good matches.  But in the final, you never know.  Everything can happen.  I think Grosjean is going to be out of pressure.  I mean, he reach the final.  He's going to be very happy.  He's going to play relaxed for sure.  Maybe he can win.  I think it's the best-of-five set, so maybe Krajicek get tired and Grosjean take advantage of that.
