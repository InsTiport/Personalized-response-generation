 D. FERRER/A. Seppi 
      6‑2, 7‑6, 6‑3 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please.   
   
 Q.   You had total control of the match for one‑and‑a‑half sets, and then it became more complicated.   How come?  
    DAVID FERRER:   I don't really know.   It was 6‑2, 3‑2, 40‑15.   I was playing well.   I don't know.   Maybe I speculated too much, and I thought he would make mistakes.   But then he managed to play better on my forehand.  
    And then I broke him, and I played a terrible game.   I lost some points, but then after the tiebreak I managed to come back with my forehand.   During the third one I made a break game against him.  
    So I'm quite satisfied with the match.   I would have liked to be more steady with my forehand and more consistent, but still, I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   It's been 16 great tournaments that you have played.   I suppose you're very happy.   
    DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, I do my best to be consistent, to be among the best.   Now I have reached the round of 16 I feel good.   And I think this is an asset in a tennis career, to be this consistent.  
    I suppose I'll try and do my best to reach the quarterfinals.  
   
 Q.   It's been more or less six months that you've been with Artur.   When there is a change it's always a bit tricky sometimes.   So what has changed?  
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, there's not much difference.   My game has not changed that much.   When I chose JosÃ©, it was not to change my tennis or to change who I was, but to gain more motivation day in and day out, because we travel a lot.  
    You know, what I was looking for is a calm team, united team that would be serene.  
   
 Q.   I don't know if you've worked on this with him, but I would like to know something.   I have the impression that for you what is difficult is the beginning of a match.   Therefore, my question is:   Have you worked on this with him or not?  
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, in the past five weeks I have started my matches in a more regular way, more consistent, I was more solid.   Therefore, I must say that as far as this is concerned, JosÃ© has helped me a lot.   We have worked a lot on this.   That is how to kick off a match.  
   
 Q.   We know that perhaps we are looking ahead too much, but will you be playing the Davis Cup in Brazil in September?   Have you discussed this with Carlos Moya and the other players?   What would you expect from these matches?  
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, yeah, this is really far away.   We have not yet discussed this.   I don't know what I will be doing in September.  
    There are many months to go before September before this event.   It will very much depend on my physical and mental condition.  
   
 Q.   You return perhaps better.   Is this a trick to win?  
    DAVID FERRER:   No, this year I didn't have the feeling at the beginning of the year.   That's true.   Therefore the first game was like my feelings, my sensations were not okay.   I feel really comfortable on my return, and this is why I try to change things.   
    I decided to focus more on my returns, because this is an asset that I have, and then I thought I would improve my serves.   
   
 Q.   You have been on the tour for a very long while, so I suppose that you've tried many solutions to improve.   
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, you know, when I'm on the court I'm always warm.   That's something that's very important, the warmup phase.   I will never skip it, because even when you're warm, it doesn't necessarily guarantee that the beginning of the match will be good.  
    Therefore, this is what you have to focus on and work on and pay attention to, this perhaps slight weakness.   And also to be consistent, which I think I've been for four or five weeks on clay.  
   
 Q.   During the second set, could you tell us what's happened?   Could you explain the second set to us with more details?   It was quite strange.   
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, I was up 40‑15, and then I don't know what happened.   All of a sudden I was perhaps down a little.   I was perhaps not aggressive enough with my forehand at that moment.  
    This is when he started dominating the game, and then he played a lot better than before.   
    After that, I missed a few points, and therefore, I lost my serve.   This is because I was not paying enough attention to the game at that moment.
