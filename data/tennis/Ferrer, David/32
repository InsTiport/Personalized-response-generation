D. FERRER/D. Brown
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How hard were the conditions out there today with the sandstorm, the wind?
DAVID FERRER:   It was really difficult play with this condition, no?   Anyway, I think the conditions favored to me, because, well, Dustin, he has a very good serve, and with the wind it was more difficult for him than me.   And fortunately I could win playing solid, because I cannot to do too much with the wind.

Q.   You kept to your usual steady performance.   He offered you 41 unforced errors, as well.   How much of a help was that?
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, it's his game, no?   He's unpredictable.   He's playing with a lot of risk with shots, and I do to be solid with my game.

Q.   You might face either Djokovic or Karlovic.   Is there something that you can change in the way you play if you either play Nole or Karlovic?
DAVID FERRER:   Well, of course, Nole, he's the No. 1 of the world, and Karlovic not.   So tomorrow change.   Depends of the player I will play. 
But anyway, now I have to wait for my opponent and we will see later.
