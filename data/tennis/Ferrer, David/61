D. FERRER/L. Rosol
  6‑0, 2‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You are the defending champion here.   Do you feel a bit more pressure than usual?
DAVID FERRER:   No, no.   Really am not, because the season was very good.   I am 3 in the world.   Maybe I can finish 4 or 5 of the world this year. 
I only focus with my next match.
