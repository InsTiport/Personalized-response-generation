 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Can you answer in English about Soderling? You met him a couple times. How do you feel about meeting him now?  
 DAVID FERRER: Okay. It will be a very difficult match, no? I think Soderling serve really well and he play very fast. I need to be very focus all the time, no, and serve with a good percentage.   
  
  Q. Wimbledon has been your least successful Grand Slam. How are you finding the grass these days? Is it getting better? Easier for you?   
 DAVID FERRER: It's difficult for me. With my game, it's not easy. But I think now that the players who can play in the baseline, who can receive, and that is important, no?   
 I think now all the tennis players play in the baseline, no? It's more slowly, the court, the balls, I think so.
