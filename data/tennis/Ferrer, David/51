THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English for David, please. 

Q.   What is your analysis of that match? 
DAVID FERRER:   Well, start Stan very good, no?   He start playing unbelievable.   I didn't have option to rest him. 
I never receive return very good.   In the second, Stan, he did a little bit mistakes.   I play with more power with my forehand. 
But, anyway, Stan was better, no?   All the time he move the ball better than me. 

Q.   He made a lot of unforced errors but had a lot of winners.   Is the aggressive approach difficult for you?
DAVID FERRER:   Is difficult, Stan, his game.   Play with very power with his shots.   I try to rest him, but is difficult. 
Nothing to say, no?   Stan play better than me, play more aggressive.   He was looking the match more than me, and nothing else. 
Me, I try to do my best.   Well, I don't have nothing to say, no?   I fight.

Q.   Although you did not reach the final, you must be happy with the results.   You beat Rafa; played great tennis yesterday. 
DAVID FERRER:   Now I'm not happy, sure, because I lost. 

Q.   In this moment?
DAVID FERRER:   In this moment. 
But, you know, tomorrow I know it was a good week.   I played good tennis this week.   Nothing else.   I did semifinal.   Now I want to be focused for the next tournament in Barcelona.   I try play similar like at this week. 

Q.   Wawrinka never won this tournament.   Do you think he can?
DAVID FERRER:   He's in the final.   Of course he can.   He has option to win the tournament.   I think the favorite players are Roger or Novak Djokovic, no?   They have more experience than Stan. 
But Stan won one Grand Slam.   He's playing with very confidence with his game.   I am sure he will have his options in the match.
