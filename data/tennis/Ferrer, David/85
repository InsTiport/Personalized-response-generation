THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   So can you tell us how did you leave the game?   And what happened in the first set?  
DAVID FERRER:   He played a very good game.   He served very good.   In the first set it was 5‑All.   I didn't serve so good, and he played better than me.  
Well, I tried to fight every point and finally I won.  
   
 Q.   The match was unusual for all sorts of different reasons, wasn't it?  
DAVID FERRER:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   The match was unusual for many different reasons.   
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, of course.   There was a hole in the court.   I never happen, this, but it was bad luck, you know.  
   
 Q.   Did it remind you of what happened in the US Open two years ago when you played Roddick?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, really, really.   But it was for different situation, no?   
In US Open it was because it was raining a lot of days, and it had all side water.   Here because it was a hole.  
   
 Q.   Then last year you were delayed by the tornado.   In NewYork last year you were delayed by the tornado.   
 DAVID FERRER:   Yeah.   So many things, yeah.   Too many things.   (Laughter.)  
 Q. Is something following you around?   
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, it's bad luck.   I don't even know why.   
But anyway, I okay, no?   It's rules of the game sometimes.   But the wear, the court, it's normal these problems, no?   It's impossible to play always during your career of one tennis player with nothing, no?     
   
 Q.   When you restarted, you played very well, didn't you?   You came back and you played your best.   
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, I came back, feel better, no?   I tried to play more and I receive better than the first set, no?   It was good to stop a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Did your foot dig that hole?  
DAVID FERRER:   No.  
   
 Q.   It wasn't the heel of your foot?  
DAVID FERRER:   Nothing.  
   
 Q.   Nothing.   It just...   
DAVID FERRER:   No, I didn't feel the hole, no?   When I finished the point and my head, I saw the hole.  
   
 Q.   Were you aware that people started to tweet, sent Twitters to Andy Roddick about it, and he sent a Twitter back?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, I remember when he said...   
   
 Q.   No, tonight.   He said that everybody is sending me a tweet that there is a hole in the court in Doha.   He said, Move it to Court 13.   
 DAVID FERRER:   No, I don't think so.   I don't think so.   (Laughter.)  
 Q.He's an unusual player to play against, right?   He's very exciting to watch, but how different is this...   
DAVID FERRER:   Very difficult player, play very strong.   It's unusual, yes, sure, his game, and he like to play short points.   
Is difficult when he serve good, and sometimes he take a lot of pressure when he's returned.   It's difficult.
