R. NADAL/D. Ferrer
  4-3 (Ret.)

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What happened?
 DAVID FERRER: I had problems in my knee and was retiring. I cannot play. 
 I prefer to relax for these few days and stand by for next week to Cincinnati.

 Q. Was this bothering you before?
 DAVID FERRER: Yes, I have the problem before in Wimbledon, with this problem in knee, and I want to take time -- some time for treatment for this. 

 Q. How did you find that Rafa looked tonight?
 DAVID FERRER: I don't know. We play few games, just four games. We don't have a lot of time. 

 Q. Do you think it's a serious injury?
 DAVID FERRER: No, no, I don't think so. No, just a few days. I think next week I will compete.
