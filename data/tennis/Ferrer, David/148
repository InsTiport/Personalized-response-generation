   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  A semifinalist in last year's US Open, how do you rate your form so far in this tournament?   
 DAVID FERRER:  Well, I feel good, no?  I'm happy.  It's my first time in quarterfinal.  But now I play against Djokovic, no?  Djokovic or Hewitt, I don't know, is playing.  It's a tough match.   
 Me, I will try to do my best because now I am with very confidence, no?  I beat Juan Carlos playing very well, very tough match.  I happy for that.   
  
  Q.  There were lots of rallies out there, 27 shots in one rally.  Is fitness your key?   
 DAVID FERRER:  Well, now I am a little bit tired.  I was problems in the fourth set because the match was very tough.   
 But now I want to drink a lot, and I will have one day, I will have one day for relax.  I will do a massage.  I think I will stay okay for the next match.
