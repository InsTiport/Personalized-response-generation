  4‑6, 6‑3, 6‑1

  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How difficult was it to play that match, knowing that you already could not get through to the semifinal?
DAVID FERRER:   It was not easy, no, because I know before the match if I won the match, I was not qualified to semifinal. 
But I begun very bad, with feel bad with my shots.   But in the second set, I can played better with my game, feel better with my shots, and I can won, no, the match. 
But was important because I had 2,000 more points, and it's good for the next year. 

Q.   How soon are you going to leave for Prague to get ready for Davis Cup?
DAVID FERRER:   I will leave tomorrow at 3 p.m. to Prague.

Q.   Other people on the team, other than the guys that are here, are there already?
DAVID FERRER:   I will go with Nicolas Almagro.   Feliciano LÃ³pez is going from Spain to Prague because he is in Madrid.   I will go with the captain, Alex Corretja and Nicolas Almagro, and of course my partners, Marcel and Marc, they have to play semifinals.   So we will support to them in Prague. 

Q.   Are you excited about being the No.1 Spanish players? 
DAVID FERRER:   I don't mind, no?   For me is not important to will be No.1 or No. 2 because every point is very important, is the same, no?   Just this, we will try to do a very good tie, to will win, and I hope to will win my match and will do one point for Spain.

Q.   The Czech players say they want a quicker surface than here.   Do you like that challenge or do you find that a little bit frightening? 
DAVID FERRER:   I think it's going to be faster than here, but I don't know, no?   I will test when we go there.   Is not a problem, no?   We know the team.   I think we know that. 

Q.   Do you feel a little unlucky the way things turned out here?   Do you think your match should have been first today?
DAVID FERRER:   I think maybe we could play first, no, because it's my opinion.   I think if the won the first match, they have to play the second, Del Potro and Federer, they have to play for two.   I can't explain in English, is difficult. 
I talk yesterday with the ATP and I express my opinion, no?   My opinion, I will have to play first match.
