 Q. Commiserations. I just wanted to ask you something about Rafael Nadal. Have you been speaking to him since he pulled out of Wimbledon?
DAVID FERRER: Nadal? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 DAVID FERRER: He was injured.

 Q. Have you spoken to him since he pulled out? 
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I received a message from him. No, nothing. 

 Q. I'm asking a few players today. Tendinitis, do you suffer much from it, your knees, like Nadal, tendinitis? 
 DAVID FERRER: Yeah.

 Q. Never bad enough to stop you from playing, though?
 DAVID FERRER: I don't know, but you have to ask to him, not me.

 Q. But your tendinitis --
 DAVID FERRER: No, I am okay.
