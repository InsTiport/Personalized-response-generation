  G. SIMON/D. Ferrer  6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-3   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  You appeared to be quite exhausted at the end of that match.  I think at one point you were checking your pulse.  How are you feeling now and what were you feeling at the end of that match?  DAVID FERRER: Well, it was tough match today.  There is a lot of humidity, very sun, and it was not easy for me.  I was not good with my fitness.  Nothing else, no?  He was better.   Q.  How disappointing is it to go out at this point in the tournament?  DAVID FERRER: No, I am okay.  It's one match of my career.  Don't worry. Now we have couple of weeks to rest, to stay in home.  Nothing else.  Enjoy with my family.   Q.  You have known Gilles Simon for a long time now.  How did you find him?  DAVID FERRER: (Through translation.)   Good.  Gilles is very consistent player; he was top 10 in 2008.  He's a really good player.
