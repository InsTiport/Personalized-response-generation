   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  You must be pretty familiar with your next opponent's style of play.  How do you think you'll go in the quarterfinals?   
 DAVID FERRER:  Yes, it my partner.  I played very much times against him.  But he's playing very well, no?  He did final in Auckland and won easy to Nalbandian.  Is not easy that.   
 Well, I think it's a match very tough with very rallies, very physic game.   
  
  Q.  What were your thoughts on the match today?   
 DAVID FERRER:  Well, maybe Spadea was a little bit tired because he plays two matches in five sets.  But me, I did my game, I done very well.  I played very solid all the match, no?  And maybe today was the best match I serve, no?
