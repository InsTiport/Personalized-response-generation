D. FERRER/F. Verdasco
  6‑3, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Pretty straightforward except for I'd say that seventh game maybe in the second set where you dropped your serve?
DAVID FERRER:   No, in the second set I have three or four match points, but Fernando serve well in that moment nothing else.   I am quiet because I was playing very good with my serve, and Fernando broken my serve only one time.

Q.   How tough is it to play somebody who's a good friend who you kind of know and grew up with?
DAVID FERRER:   Normal, normal.   We played a lot of times, Fernando and me.   No, I think our career is similar, playing 13 or 14 years in the tour, and, well, in the court we try to do our best and after the court we are friends, no?   It's only one job, and we played a lot of times.

Q.   Dustin Brown I think tomorrow. 
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah.

Q.   Talk a little bit about that. 
DAVID FERRER:   Well, Dustin Brown, he's unpredictable.   He's anarchic player, no?   He has a good serve and good volley, so I will have to be very focused all the points, and is very important my receive on my first serve.   I have to be consistent with my first serve, because with my second, he will be, do a lot of pressure.

Q.   If you can, just a little bit on Rafa's situation going into the Australian, obviously not a good day for him. 
DAVID FERRER:   It's only one month.   We are beginning the season, and this is not important.   Rafael sure is going to be good in Australian Open.   This is tennis. 
I saw the matches today, and he begin the match playing very well, so I am sure that he will be strong the next couple of weeks.

Q.   So you feel he's recovered from the appendectomy, the operation? 
DAVID FERRER:   The operation? 

Q.   The appendix.   Do you feel he's all recovered?
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, sure, sure.
