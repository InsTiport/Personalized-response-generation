D. FERRER/S. Bolelli 
      6‑2, 6‑3, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish. 

Q.   Can you tell me what you think about Bolelli, the way he is today?   You know, we come from Italy.   We would very much like to know what you think about Bolelli.   Do you think he's still a good player and that he has potential?   What would you say?   What do you think about him?
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, you know, Bolelli has been playing for many years already on the tour.   He was injured at the wrist, but he started well with some matches.   Then he went up the rankings, and he's a player who now has reached the top 100, I think.

Q.   (Off microphone.)
    DAVID FERRER:   Yes, very much.   And I don't know.   He hits the balls really well, but he's not consistent enough.   If he were more consistent, he could be in the top 100.

Q.   What can you say about your match?   What did you think about it?
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, I think that this match was okay.   I didn't really feel that great myself, but I think that the match was, how can I say, not brilliant. 
    We would need perhaps a more brilliant match with something more in the forehand. 

Q.   It's your first match.   Can you tell me what's changed when you have to play against a player you have never played against?   Do you watch videos before?   How do you get ready?
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, yes, of course it's quite different when you've met the player before.   When you know the other player you are quite calm and you know what to do.   But if you've never met the player before, you never know what's going to happen.

Q.   You have said that what you mean is to do something with your forehand and to shine more with your forehand. 
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, I have to gain confidence, to start with.   And on the short points I have to hit the balls harder.
    You know, every day the sensations, the feelings, change.   I hope that I'll improve my game. 

Q.   During the match you gave us the impression that perhaps the balls were quite heavy.   Would this have an impact on you?
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, yes, of course.   If you feel good on the court, you can hit hard.   But then, you know, today we had to fight against the wind.   After four games, it was difficult and the balls were heavy.

Q.   There are four Spanish girls who have gone through this round.   What about the future?   Would you say that female Spanish players will be more famous than the male Spanish players?
    DAVID FERRER:   I don't know, but there is a new generation of women or girls with Muguruza, for instance.   But not that many female players like in the top 100 like Conchita and others. 
    You know, if you look back in the past 10 years we have had two players in the top 10.   Today we have quite a lot of good women players, but they are not necessarily in the top 100. 

Q.   You were talking about the court and the balls that were a bit heavy and it was a bit windy.   Well, you know, the Spanish players feel better when it's really sunny and warm. 
    DAVID FERRER:   I prefer when it's sunny.   The balls are faster, that's true, and I'd rather have a faster type of court.   It was too slow today.

Q.   Now, back to female players, I don't know if you saw Garbine's match, could you tell us more about her?   Do you think she's reached her maximum, or do you think she can reach the semis? 
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, I couldn't watch this match with Garbine.   She's a player who has a lot of potential, that's true.   She hits really so hard, and also it's true to say she has many assets.   Give her time.   She will have a bright future, I think. 
    As far as the shots are concerned, she's an all‑around player, and she can reach a very high level.
    I don't really know her that well, so that's all I can say.   That's my view.   I'm not enough informed.   But from what I've heard, she's an excellent player and I like her very much.

Q.   Who's your coach today?   Do you have good relationships with Piles still?   Because I heard that he was discussing with Winsley [ph].   Do you still have this friendship between you and Javier Piles?
    DAVID FERRER:   I don't know what Javier will do in the future, but I still have good relationships with him.   Yes, certainly.

Q.   Now, after the Acapulco tournament you had to withdraw because you were injured.   Are you okay now?   What did you do to recover from this injury?
    DAVID FERRER:   Physically I'm really good.   I'm okay.   I have no problems.   After Acapulco, I had to stop for two weeks.   I work with my physiotherapy, and I had to rest, which is normal.   Then there's muscle building on the upper part of the body that I had to work on.
    But what I needed mainly was to take a rest.   Mainly at the beginning it was not easy with this injury, but now I feel good.

Q.   Are you superstitious?
    DAVID FERRER:   No, not at all.

Q.   What about your haircut?
    DAVID FERRER:   No, that was just a change, my haircut.   That's all.   There is no being superstitious about my hairdo.

Q.   (Off microphone.)
    DAVID FERRER:   JosÃ© Arturo.

Q.   Now, another question nothing to do with tennis.   I'd like to ask you about the Brazil World Cup, the soccer cup.   What about the Spanish players?
    DAVID FERRER:   Of course the Spanish selection is good.   We have a strong team for the World Cup, and there are many things that can happen.   It's based on luck but also physical preparation of the players.   I think that the Brazilian team can win as well as Germany and the Argentinians, they have the best players in the world.   I think.   We never know.   And Italy, of course, yes, Italy, as I said. 

Q.   What about the Davis Cup?   Now, since we are talking about Brazil and Spain, what I'd like to know is that ‑‑well, you know that on paper this meeting is not really what one could call an obstacle.   By the way, are you in the team?
    DAVID FERRER:   No, no, it's really so far away.   I don't know.   It's going to be in September.   We have so many things that we can do and that can happen.   I don't know if I'll be available.   I don't know who's going to be on the team.   I don't know if I'll be injured or not.
    But anyway, what's really important is that Spain should maintain its position.   Also, the team should do their best.

Q.   What about Carlos, if he calls you?
    DAVID FERRER:   It's too far ahead.   I don't know.   Frankly, I have no idea whatsoever.
