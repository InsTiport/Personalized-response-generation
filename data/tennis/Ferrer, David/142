 THE MODERATOR: We'll have to be short because he has doubles in 25 minutes. So five questions, please.  
  
  Q. That was quite an easy workout for you. Were you quite surprised at how easy it was for you?   
 DAVID FERRER: Well, the result is 6-2, 6-2, but it was not easy. It was a very tough match. I got lucky because in the second set, I had a lot of breakpoints down, but I make it, and this is the result.   
 But I fight a lot and I played very, very focused and consistent for to beat him.   
  
  Q. What do you think was the best part of your game?  
 DAVID FERRER: I don't know, but of course, this match was my best match in the season, in this year, but I'm playing very well all the year, very consistent, and this is important for me.   
  
  Q. Is that the best match this year?  
 DAVID FERRER: Yeah.  
  
  Q. And tomorrow you're going to play Novak. Any thoughts about that?  
 DAVID FERRER: Well, it will be very tough. Novak is a very good player, and I will try to do my best and fight a lot to beat him.   
  
  Q. Do you feel too tired to play in the double now, or are you fine?  
 DAVID FERRER: Now I am okay. Now I want to take a shower and relax in 10 minutes and come back to the court.
