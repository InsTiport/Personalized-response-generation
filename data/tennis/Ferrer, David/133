  7-5, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Are you a little annoyed that you didn't at least take that to a third set?   
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I tried to do my best, no? I fight to won the second set.   
 But Robin plays better than me and he has more chance all the match.   
  
  Q. Even though you lost, you still have a chance to get through.   
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I know is very difficult. But now I want to relax. I have tomorrow. We will see.   
 Thursday, no? I will try to do my best.  
  
  Q. You have a good record against Andy in the past.   
 DAVID FERRER: I have a good record in clay court. Not in hard court. He has hard court.   
  
  Q. How difficult was it to face the Soderling of today? You created very few breakpoints.   
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I think I don't have any chance in the match. Maybe in the second set with 5-All, 15-30, maybe there. But he served really well all the match. Nothing else, no?   
 I think the surface is similar like Valencia. I won in Valencia. I like the surface. I don't have no problems. It's just Robin serve really good and take more chance when I serve.   
  
  Q. You can still technically make it through to the knock-out. How confident are you of doing that and what do you need to do against Murray on Thursday?   
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I am with confidence, no? I finish the season top 10. I don't have any problem physical, mentality.   
 I know with Andy will be a very difficult match. But with all the players, we are the eight players of the world. So nothing else, nothing special, no?   
 I fight everything. I fight, and with Andy too.   
  
  Q. What would you change in this match today against Soderling? Backhand passing wasn't working as they can do for you.   
 DAVID FERRER: No, I don't know. Maybe I play more aggressive in some moments. But, you know, after the match is easy to say. On the match, is difficult to do it.   
  
  Q. Did you see Andy's game today?   
 DAVID FERRER: I don't saw the match. I don't saw the match. I don't know.
