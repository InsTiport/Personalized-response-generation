  6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Could you sum up your match, how you felt you played throughout the tournament. 
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I think the match, Andy plays a very good match. Little bit tired. Some is good, some is bad. I served very bad all this week. And with these players, is very difficult, no? If I not serve good, is difficult. 
 And the week good, no? It's my second Masters Cup. I am happy with my season. 

 Q. Today you got off to a good start. What happened after that?
 DAVID FERRER: 2-0, because Andy, he was start a little bit nervous, I take my chance. But after Andy plays really good, no? And me, the same, the serve is not good today. 

 Q. Did you feel like you had a real chance at the start of the match?
 DAVID FERRER: Today with Andy? 

 Q. Yes, to qualify. 
 DAVID FERRER: No. I don't think I was focused in the match, in the match with Andy. I try my best. But today I have a lot of problems, no, physically, mentality. Is difficult, no, play with these guys. If I am not perfect, 100%, is impossible. 

 Q. Having faced Andy Murray tonight, if he is to face Rafael Nadal in the semifinal, how do you think he would do against him?
 DAVID FERRER: I don't know. I don't know. Andy, Rafael and Federer, for me are doing the best tennis this week, no? 
 But I don't know. For me, it is Rafael for me.
