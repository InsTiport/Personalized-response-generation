THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, quite good.   It wasn't easy because you come from playing a tournament that's played at sea level and you've got two days to train.  
Here in Madrid, we have little bit of altitude.   I'm quite happy with my game.  
   
 Q.   Your next opponent is Tommy Haas I think.   What do you expect from that match?   Then, I think that the courts this year are much better, not only in respect to last year, but in respect to other years.  
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, with Tommy Haas it's going to be a very tough match.   We played in Miami and went to three sets.   Tomorrow I will have to return very well because he is a player that serves pretty good.   He serves pretty well.  
We'll have to play hard and play aggressively in the match, no?   That's what I'll have to do tomorrow.  
And it's true that's courts are much better than the courts last year for sure.   I think that this is the year that they are the best courts we've had.  
   
 Q.   What are your expectations of the tournament?  
DAVID FERRER:   Well, my expectations are to play well tomorrow to be able to pass to the next round, to make it to the next round.   I really never have any expectations.   I just think about the match that I'm going to play.  
   
 Q.   With Djokovic out of the tournament, do you think you've got options to win the tournament?  
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, not really.   No, because as I said before, I think in each match I have a tough player.   Tomorrow I have Tommy Haas.   If I win, well the next match will also be very difficult.  
Could be Rafa Nadal or I don't know who.
