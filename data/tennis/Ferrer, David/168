THE MODERATOR:  Questions for David.  
 
 
Q.  Good recovery in the third set. 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Yeah, it was a tough match.  I tried my best in the third set.  I also knew he could miss some first serves because of the pressure, so I took advantage.  
 
Q.  This has been a key year in your career with the results in the Masters Series and Grand Slams.  To what extent is it due to your change of attitude? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Well, this is important.  Mentally I've been steady this year.  Last year was more irregular.  This year I've been consistent psychologically.  
 
Q.  And you have improved on hard courts. 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Yeah, I've achieved good results this year on hard courts.  It's not that before I had bad results, but this year has been better.  
 
Q.  Looking forward, what do you expect for next year?
 
DAVID FERRER:  Right now I don't want to think about next year.  I still have three tournaments to go.  I'll do my best and then we'll see and stop to think for next year.  Maybe to be as consistent as this year mentally.
