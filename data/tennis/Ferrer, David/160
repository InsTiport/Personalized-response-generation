   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Do you have to adjust to the serve when you're going against somebody who's that tall? 
 DAVID FERRER:  No.  I never do.  Except for maybe Carlos serve similar like, like Isner, no?  But and then it's difficult.  It's difficult to receive, no?  You have to make the chance or the opportunity in the moments, in important moments. 
 In the tiebreak I have to play very, very focus for to win Isner.  Because when do you lost your serve you are dead. 

 Q.  Did you know anything about him before today? 
 DAVID FERRER:  I saw in Washington, no?  He was through final in Washington with Andy, and I saw that.  It's -- for me he's very good player, no?  With a good feel to it, because he's a young player and he was playing in university, in college, no?  I think so.  And the next year he will stay 200, 250. 

 Q.  Is there a lot of pressure because his serve is so big that you have to hold your own serve? 
 DAVID FERRER:  Pression? 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 DAVID FERRER:  Yeah, I have pression.  I have to serve very well and play very focus my games, no?  Because when I lost one serve or he did me break, to return back the break it's very difficult. 

 Q.  When you broke him to start the second set, did you get a sense that you were in control at that point? 
 DAVID FERRER:  Maybe I have the control in the second set because I broke him in the first game of the second, and for me it's too easy then.  I no have more pression and only I have to focus in my serve.
