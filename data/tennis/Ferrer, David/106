THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Your thoughts on the match?   You seemed very much in control out there tonight. 
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, I played very well tonight.   I played very consistent, very solid.   Good performance and maybe my best match this year.

Q.   Do you think it was one of your best matches against Del Potro?
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, one of them.

Q.   Do you think you are sometimes underestimated for how good you are on a hard court?
DAVID FERRER:   Sorry? 

Q.   Not given enough credit for your hard court... 
DAVID FERRER:   I like playing hard court.   My best results are on hard court.   I like this surface.   I like the fans here in Miami, I like this tournament. 
Good performance.   I am playing really good tennis.

Q.   Any thoughts to bring the same confidence against Novak on Thursday?
DAVID FERRER:   It's gonna be difficult to beat Novak, no?   But I will try to do my best.
I have to do very good tennis.   I have to play very solid.   I need my first serve, good percentage with my first serve. 
Novak is No. 1 of the world, but...
