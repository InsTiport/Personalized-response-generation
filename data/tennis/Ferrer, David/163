  Q.  How surprised were you in that long rally in the second set, he comes up with that short angle backhand?  It looked like you had won that point straightaway, and he comes up with that shot.   
 DAVID FERRER:  (Through translation).  Yeah, it was a very nice shot.  He did it very well.  That's why he's No. 1 in the world.   
  Q.  How difficult is that shot that he pulled off?   
  
  Q.  Yes.   
 DAVID FERRER:  (Through translation).  Obviously, it was a very difficult shot, especially on the run.  But I think another player could have done it, like Ferrero or Rochus or any other player.   
 But, obviously, you know, being Federer, he's used to these kind of shots.
