 T. BERDYCH/D. Ferrer
  3‑6, 7‑5, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us why that match turned around so dramatically?   
DAVID FERRER:   Well, I think I was playing good the first set, and the middle of the second maybe with 4‑3, 40‑15, I didn't serve really good.   
The second and the third, I serve very bad and I play very short my shots.   It was very short, no?   
In the third set, he was playing with more confidence.   When it's not working, my serve, it's very difficult to beat the top players.   
   
 Q.   You now have to play Roger Federer in the semifinals.   How do you assess your chances against him?  
DAVID FERRER:   I don't know.   Tomorrow I will try to do my best.   I will try to fight a lot.   I never win to Roger, and I hope tomorrow if I can change the (speaking in Spanish).   
   
 Q.   Do you have any physical problems?   Is there something wrong with your shoulder?  
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, no, nothing.   
   
 Q.   How do you prepare for a match tomorrow night?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, I don't have too many time.   Nothing special.   Now I will go to dinner with my team.   I will do a massage.   I will try to sleep eight or nine hours.   
   
 Q.   Several of the other players have been talking about how long the season is, how many matches they've played.   You've played a lot of matches this year as well.   Are you starting to feel tired at this stage of the year?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, of course.   All the players, you are tired.   The season is very, very long.   We know that.   We are talking like this every week of the season, no?   
Of course, I'm tired.   But, you know, I have to play tomorrow a very important match, a semifinal here in the finals.   After here I have to play another important event, the final of the Davis Cup.
