  6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel today?  
DAVID FERRER:   Not too good (smiling).   No, is tough.   He did a good match, good game than me.   I didn't play very well.   But my opponent, he was better than me in the first and second set, in the whole moments.   
I made lots of mistakes.   I am not fast.   He plays very aggressive, very consistent.   He was better.   
   
 Q.   It was your fourth game with him.   The first three you won easily.   How do you explain today?  
DAVID FERRER:   I don't have words for explain, no?   Is difficult.   
Bad day, and the opponent plays very good.   I think every year is different, every match is different.   And today he was better like me.   Only this.
