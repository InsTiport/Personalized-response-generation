THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk about how you feel about the achievement again of another quarterfinal here.  
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, I'm very happy.  A quarterfinal without losing a set.  My fitness is okay.  It's important in the second week, in a good condition, my fitness.   
 Q.  Your thoughts if Andy wins tonight?  
DAVID FERRER: With Andy, it's going to be tough.  He's playing really good.  The last year he finish No. 2 of the world.  He improve his game I think so.  He's playing more aggressive.  He improve his forehand.   
So I need have a good day, play aggressive.  Well, if is possible, will be a long match.

Well, I have fun playing tennis.   
 Q.  You just changed racquets.  I assume during the off-season you took time to adjust.  
DAVID FERRER: I practiced in the pre-season one month, three or four weeks, practicing with the new one.  I'm happy with the new one racquet, sure.  I am playing good.  I'm in quarterfinal.   
I change because I thought, me and my team, that I can improve in my shots.  Well, is the way, no, for improve and be with the best tennis of the world.   
 Q.  Did you have to spend even more time on court to adjust to the new racquet?
