THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish.  
 
 
Q.  Can you analyze generally the match? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  I think he played a great match.  Maybe I was a bit tense at the beginning, with all the excitement I had some of the other days.  He has been very consistent throughout the match.  At the end I tried my best, but congratulations to him for his great match.  
 
Q.  It's possible he faces Nadal tomorrow.  What would you advise Nadal? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Well, I'm no one to advise Nadal anything.  But I think Rafa lifts the ball okay.  Ginepri is a player that shoots straight.  I see far more favorite Rafa than Ginepri, but Ginepri is playing fine, too.  
 
Q.  You find Rafa has more chances of winning? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Well, with tennis, you never know.  This is a lottery.  A priori, Rafa, yes.  
 
Q.  What happened today?  You were sort of a boom this year.  What happened? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Well, I lost.  Nothing more.  My opponent was superior on the court.  He was playing better.  That's all.  Sometimes even if you're playing well other people do play better.  He was far superior, I think.  He was consistent.  Maybe I didn't play as well as yesterday because he didn't give me a chance to get into a rhythm.  
 
Q.  How has the crowd behaved to you?  Have they behaved as other crowds elsewhere? 
 
DAVID FERRER:  Yeah, the crowd has been great.  Maybe it's the tournament, I felt I'm closer.  In Valencia, at home, people know me more maybe.  But here, I've had difficult matches, like with Calleri or Puerta where you need the crowd to support you.
