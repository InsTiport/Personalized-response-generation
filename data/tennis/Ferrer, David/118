 THE MODERATOR: Questions for David. 

 Q. How does today's match feel compared with yesterday when you were fighting off the match points against Ferrero? Today did you feel stronger out there? Did you feel like you played better?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I think is different play with Ferrero and Andy because is different game. 
 But today the first set I think we didn't play so good. But in the second and the third, we play better, no? I play with more confidence with my game, more consistent, and I can win in the tiebreak of the third. 

 Q. You looked very strong at key moments and your serving was good. That must give you confidence for the rest of the tournament. 
 DAVID FERRER: Well, of course when the player win the match is with more confidence. More confidence with my first serve, I am confidence with my mind. This is very important because some moments I didn't play really good. This tournament, you know, in important moments I served really good. So this is very important to every match. 

 Q. You had the first match point on his serve. What were you thinking then?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I tried to not think about this, no, because when I lost the two match points with the second serve, I know I had a really good sense. 
 But I tried to forgot these two points and I tried to focus in the next game. 

 Q. Did you ever imagine you can step so far into the semifinals before the tournament? How is your preparation for the next game?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, the same like the last matches, no? Now I want to enjoy this victory. I will be relaxed with my team. I will do a massage with my physio and nothing else. Tomorrow I will try to do my best for to win.
