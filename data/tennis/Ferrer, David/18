An interview with:   
DAVID FERRER   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously that was a dead rubber today, nothing to play for in terms of qualification.  How pleased were you that it was a good contest, a good match.  
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, well, I tried to do my best.  I haven't chance for qualification.  But it's a Masters Cup, a very important tournament.  I tried to fight and win.   
But, anyway, Rafael in the third set, he improve his game.  It was close, but he was better.   
 Q.  What do you think of his level of play?  
DAVID FERRER: He's playing good.  He's playing more obviously with his backhand.  The last tournaments he's playing better.   
 Q.  Given your Davis Cup experience, with the final next week, how helpful was the home support playing in front of your home fans?  Do you think that's a big advantage for Belgium next week?  
DAVID FERRER: Well, of course it's a very good moment for both teams, Belgium and also England.  They have a really good chance for win, one of them, the Davis Cup.   
Well, maybe England depends a lot of Andy because he needs play the three matches.  And Belgium maybe they are playing home and is advantage.  Well, depends a lot of the first day.   
 Q.  How much more improved do you think Andy is on clay now?  In the past he struggled.  
DAVID FERRER: Andy, he was a good player in clay court.  Maybe this year he play better, more consistent.   
 Q.  Do you feel Rafa can create a bit of history at this tournament?  Only Andre Agassi has won every single major tennis title.  Rafa could do it if he wins.  
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, of course, sure.  Rafael is one of the best tennis players of the world.  I think he win everything.  He will have a chance for win here, sure.
