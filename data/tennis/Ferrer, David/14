A. MURRAY/D. Ferrer   
6-3, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the match?  
DAVID FERRER: It was a good match.  It was a lot of rallies.  It was tough.   
In the third set, the first games, it was tough but it was close.  He was better than me playing very aggressive with his backhand.   
And in the fourth set when I broke him with 2-0 for 2-All, well, in the game 4-3 or 4-2 I didn't -- I lost a little bit the concentration.  It was the key.   
But anyway, I made him serve to win the match.  I'm happy with my tournament, my game.  It was okay.   
 Q.  When they closed the roof did it change conditions significantly?  
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, change a little bit, but what can I do?  Is the same for us, for him and also for me.  Not excuse.   
 Q.  Do you know what caused you to lose...  
DAVID FERRER: For the weather.  Is it rain, no?   
 Q.  Do you know what caused you to lose concentration?  
DAVID FERRER: No, no, because it's very difficult be concentration all the match.  I run a lot.  Well, I tried, but sometimes it's impossible to be perfect conditions.   
 Q.  David, maybe my judgment is wrong, but it looked like when you walked off the court you looked a bit more disappointed than usual.  Is this a different loss for you compared to others?  
DAVID FERRER: No, no.  It's okay.  I am okay.  My feeling is good.  No problem.
