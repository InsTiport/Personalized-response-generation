      7‑6, 3‑6, 7‑5, 7‑6 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It was a tough match for you today.   
    DAVID FERRER:   Yes, it was a very tough match.   Janko and me, we play a very good match.   We had a lot of chance, both players.   
    Well, I think it was my best match this weeks.   
   
 Q.   So what was the difference between winner and loser, do you think?  
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, maybe the key was in the third set, no?   He was 5‑4, 40‑Love, three set points up.   Well, I don't know what happen if I lost that set.   
    But, anyway, I try to be focus every point, to fight.   Well, finally I can win.   
   
 Q.   With the rain delay and so on, any effect on you?  
    DAVID FERRER:   No.   Of course, no.   We know that.   Every year it's the same.   We try to be with our team, quiet.   Nothing else.   
   
 Q.   You played on grandstand today.   Grandstand is going to be moved the end of next year.   What do you feel about that court?   
    DAVID FERRER:   It's okay.   It's a good court.   I don't mind to play in important courts.   My goal is to win the matches as possible and to be consistent.   Now I am in quarterfinal.   After tomorrow, I will play in center court, perfect.   If I do not, don't worry.
