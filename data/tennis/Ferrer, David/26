THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please.   
   
 Q.   David, good match.   How do you see Verdasco?   Normally you beat him in Madrid.   Talk about everything.   
DAVID FERRER:   Thank you.   It's been a tough match.   Very tight.   Fernando is a very good player.   He makes a lot of winners.   With his serve, here in attitude it's very difficult to return the ball.   At the beginning it was difficult.   
Then in the second set I think it was very important the first game that I managed to win.   Then I could play more aggressively with my forehand and then everything was a little bit more even.   
   
 Q.   Next round quarterfinals you'll play Nishikori or Bautista.   Which do you prefer?   
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, I don't prefer any of them.   Of course Roberto is a really good partner of mine on the tour.   Playing him in the quarterfinals, I would be very happy about it.  
I like to see that good people are doing good.   Nishikori is one of them, and so is Roberto.   But I am more comfortable with Roberto.   He is a really good partner of mine.   
   
 Q.   Are you a bit tired?   Perhaps too many tournaments in a row?   Yesterday you finished late.   What do you think about the schedule and timing?  
DAVID FERRER:   You know, we cannot make up excuses.   We're all tired.   The calendar is the same for all the players.   The more matches you play the more tired you are, but also the more happy you are.  
This is what we have.   I made it to the quarterfinals.   I'm happy because of that.   Tomorrow I'll try to do a good match.   It's going to be a tough match either against Roberto or against Kei.
