THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Were you over the illness that caused you to withdraw from the grass court tournaments before Wimbledon?  
DAVID FERRER:   Because I had stomach problems and I didn't play nothing last week.   
   
 Q.   How long for?  
DAVID FERRER:   After Roland Garros, Friday of Roland Garros.   
   
 Q.   Did you have much grass court practice at all?  
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, no.   
The match, I lost because my opponent, he was better.   I think I did a good game.   But he surprised to me and he play very good.   A lot of winners.   
In important moments, he was more aggressive than me.   
   
 Q.   And for yourself, how do you feel?  
DAVID FERRER:   Well, now, of course I am sad.   Is a disappoint for me.   What can I do?   I tried to do my best.   I lost.   This is a game.   It's not the end of the world.   
   
 Q.   What were your expectations for the tournament?  
DAVID FERRER:   I never have expectations for the tournament.   I am only focused with my match and nothing else, no?   
I will not focus any more on this week.
