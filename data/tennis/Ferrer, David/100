D. FERRER/R. Gasquet
  7‑5, 7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Quarterfinals in all four Grand Slams.   You, Federer, Murray, and assuming Djokovic.   What do you think of that?
DAVID FERRER:   Well, I'm very happy for that.   This season was the best of all my career.   I'm play consistent all the year.   I will try to play here like finally of the year. 

Q.   You only dropped one set this tournament so far.   Can you explain how you are feeling heading into the next round?
DAVID FERRER:   I don't know.   I think I have luck in important moments, no, because I had tonight three set points down in the second set. 
The first round with Anderson I had also three set points down.   With Sijsling in second round also the same, no? 
So I think in important moments I played good, but of course I had lucky, no?

Q.   Despite having had such a great run with all the attention focused on the top three, you have been under the radar screen.   How has that affected you?
DAVID FERRER:   Can you repeat the question?

Q.   All the attention has been on the top 3.   Has that been to your advantages?
DAVID FERRER:   No, for me that's normal.   Djokovic and Murray and Federer, they deserve the attention because they are amazing players.   So not a problem for me. 
I'm trying do my best, do my best as possible.   I don't care.

Q.   Why do you think you're better now than three, four, five years ago?
DAVID FERRER:   Well, I improve some sort of my game.   I improve of course my mentality.   I have more experience and this is more easy for me.
