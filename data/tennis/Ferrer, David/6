F. LOPEZ/D. Ferrer   
7-5, 3-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  It was a very tough match.  Just what do you think made the difference in who won today?  
DAVID FERRER: It was very close.  I think he played really good on the base with his backhand, closed backhand, and it was not easy, maybe in the third.  And my serve, I didn't serve so good in the important moments.   
 Q.  How tough has this year been for you overall?  I know you had injury issues and some early losses.  
DAVID FERRER: I'm okay.  It's tough because I lost today in second round and nothing else.
