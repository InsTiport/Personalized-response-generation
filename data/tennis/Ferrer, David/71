D. FERRER/T. Haas
  7‑5, 4‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please. 

Q.   Congratulations for the match.   Do you feel pressure to make it to the finals in all the tournaments and not be out of the top 10 in the end of year?
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, I just think about playing each match, doing it as best as possible.
Well, I'm happy about making it to the quarterfinals here again in Madrid. 

Q.   In that moment, you had lost your second set and you hadn't started well the third set.   You were playing a little bit to your limits, right?
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, yeah, to the limit really.   We had played three in the third set, 40‑15 for him.   Luckily I could play a couple of good points.   Then when I made the break I played more aggressively and better. 
I think that in the first set and a half of the second one I had the match under control.   I had a couple of options in the second set to do a break, but I didn't do it.
Maybe over there I had a bump or five or six shots that I paid for quite expensively, especially playing against Tommy Haas.   He's a very complicated player.

Q.   I wanted to ask you about the crowd.   Perhaps here in the Caja MÃ¡gica.   It's very big.   12,000 people.   You've played some matches with half of the people.   Court 2 was really full.   Do you prefer Court 2 really full or Caja MÃ¡gica half full?
DAVID FERRER:   It's really good when the crowd are supporting you a lot.   Luckily here in Madrid I always have the support.   Yesterday I played in central court and it was nearly full.   Today, because it was really small, we can really feel the support of the crowd.
Well, just want say thank you for the support that I've had for from all the people of Madrid.

Q.   Tomorrow is another battle against Nadal.   Do you have any new tactics?
DAVID FERRER:   Well, I will try to do a really good match and see.   It's not only about tactic.   It's just about that Rafa is a really good player.   It's very difficult to beat him.   We'll see how it goes.
I will try to play aggressively.   I will try to miss as few balls as possible, and let's hope that Rafa doesn't have his day. 

Q.   Congratulations for the victory.   I'm talking about the same thing, tomorrow's match against Rafa.   It's a quarterfinals tomorrow.   Does it benefit you to you play in quarterfinals instead of a final?   Do you feel less pressure playing in a quarterfinal instead of a final?
DAVID FERRER:   No, not at all.   I wish it was a final because I would get more points and that would mean that I had won more matches. 
But there are only eight players left.   You cannot choose.   They all play really good.   It's pretty clear that Rafa on clay is the favorite without doubts, especially now with Djokovic not here or Roger Federer even more.
They're not here, so even more. 

Q.   What happened in Acapulco, does it affect the way you face tomorrow's match against Rafa?
DAVID FERRER:   No, each week is different.   Each day things change and each player has different feelings.   I could have had good feelings over there.   Today I didn't have as good feelings in the second and third set.   Tomorrow, who knows.   I cannot predict the future. 
Rafa in Acapulco did a very good match.   He was better compared to me.   Tomorrow we will see.   If he plays as he did in Acapulco, he will be the winner. 

Q.   Nadal has had a quite easy victory today.   You've had to play three sets.   Have you used a lot of your physical energy today? 
DAVID FERRER:   I don't know.   It's been a really tough match.   The important thing is that everything sums up.   I've played to win today.   I'll try to recover as good as possible.   I'll try to be 100%. 
After all, this is tennis.   You know, sometimes you are more tired; other weeks you're less tired.   But it's all part of the game. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.

Q.   You had a similar match with Haas in Indian Wells and he had the break.   Here you kept playing tough.   Did the other match help you somehow, give you confidence that if you did it there you could do it here again? 
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, I think it was different match maybe.   Maybe similar in the third set like Miami, no?   But, you know, with different surface, different feeling about my tennis. 
I think today maybe we play better than Miami.   We serve better than Miami.   And also I always with Tommy Haas is close matches. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish.

Q.   There is a problem if the courts are slippery.   What do you think?   Can you compare the small court against the central court?
DAVID FERRER:   Well, you know, the small court is a little bit quicker.   You know, as being smaller it makes you have less space to run.   Normally central courts are slower.
The courts are really good.   This is the best year of the courts.   If they slip, you know you've got altitude in Madrid and it's much more difficult to defend here.
You have to be much more focused.   To play here to changes compared to playing at sea level or other tournaments on clay courts without any doubts.
