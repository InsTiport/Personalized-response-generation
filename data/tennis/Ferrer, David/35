D. FERRER/A. Murray
  2‑6, 6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   It seems like you played much more stable compared to yesterday.   Is it because you managed to adjust your form or because Martin Klizan's strategy proved to be more challenging for you?
DAVID FERRER:   No, every match is different.   Of course, today I played different than yesterday.   Yesterday was first round.   Never is easy.   Martin, he was with confidence. 
But today, Andy Murray, I need to play my best tennis. 

Q.   How much are you thinking about the ATP World Tour Finals in London?   Are you playing each match with this in mind, that it's a goal for you?
DAVID FERRER:   Yeah, of course is my goal, and the goal of Andy sure in these moments.   I think this match was very important for both players. 
Now I am in quarterfinal.   I am fighting for the Masters Cup in London.   It's important for me, no? 
I will be focused for tomorrow.   We don't have too many tournaments.   We have only three tournaments more for being in the Masters of London.   So today was a good victory.   But I am ninth now in the Race.   Nothing else, no? 
It was a good victory for my confidence and, of course, for the Race.
