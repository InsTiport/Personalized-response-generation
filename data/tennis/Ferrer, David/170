Q.  Nadal said for the first two sets you were the better player.  Do you agree with that?

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, but in the end I lost.


Q.  So the explanation for that?

DAVID FERRER:  In the first two sets I felt I was controlling the match, I was in charge.  But then towards the end of the second set I had a little doubt in my mind, and that was the key of the match; that's when it turned around.


Q.  So it's a mental problem?

DAVID FERRER:  No, no, mental, no.  Yesterday I came back from four matchpoints down to win, and today I came back when he had the first two matchpoints.  So I almost won again today. It's not mental.  I mean, all players sometimes are scared of winning.


Q.  You said yesterday that Nadal is like a gladiator.  Today there were two gladiators; you were also a fighter, too.

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, I have to be a gladiator on court.  I'm not going to win matches with my serve, so I have to play that way.  I have to be a gladiator in my life.


Q.  Today you showed that you are close to Nadal, and Nadal is a big favorite for Roland Garros, so you should have ambitions for Roland Garros.

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, I mean, it's a good moment for me right now.  You just have to wait and play each match and take one match at a time. Rafael, obviously, I mean, the results show that he is the favorite.  Roland Garros, anything can happen really.  I mean, I wish that Rafael or another Spanish tennis player could give our country a lot of joy by winning.


Q.  You believe you can do the job yourself?

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, yes, certainly.  One Spanish player - and if it's me, then better (smiling).
