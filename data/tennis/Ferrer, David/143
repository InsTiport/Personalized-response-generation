D. FERRER/I Andreev
  7-5, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Well played. Your thoughts on the match?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, it was my best match in this week. I played very focused, and maybe the key wasn't in the first set. No, I did three times break and by fault, and it was very tough for him.

 Q. Do you guys train at the same club in Valencia?
 DAVID FERRER: Yeah, we play in the final in Valencia. 

 Q. He trains there. Do you train together with him sometimes?
 DAVID FERRER: Yeah, we practice together. We practice together. It's a good pairing.

 Q. Your thoughts now; do you hope to do better this time?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, now, it's important for me to play very regular this season. I'm playing very focused all the matches, and this is important for me. 
 But I had bad luck. You know, I did two semifinals with match points up. I lost, and now I would like to do my best, but I know it's not easy because good players everywhere I go.

 Q. Because Murray has withdrawn --
 DAVID FERRER: Okay. 

 Q. -- do you think it will be easier for you now?
 DAVID FERRER: Sorry? 

 Q. It will be easier to reach the final? 
 DAVID FERRER: No, of course not, no, no. There's very good players, and the last time against him, you know, Gasquet, it will be very tough. 

 Q. Were you surprised to hear that Murray had retired?
 DAVID FERRER: Why? 

 Q. Because he started, doing very well, and, suddenly, (snapping fingers), gone.
 DAVID FERRER: I don't know the reason. 

 Q. Do you feel that your hard court game has improved over the years, since you spent your whole junior career on clay. Did you change anything to play well on hard?
 DAVID FERRER: No. Of course I play well on clay court. It's my surface. 
 But you know, how you have to play very good on all surface, you know, because to stay Top-20 or Top-10, you play more tournaments on hard court. 
 But I'm comfortable in hard court. I play five years in this, more tournaments on hard court, and I don't have any problem. 

 Q. Do you think your game is for all types of courts, because you won on grass, also, last year.
 DAVID FERRER: Well, it was a surprise for me, to win in grass court, but it's very different, hard court to grass court. It's another game.

 Q. And how do you feel going into the doubles match tonight?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, now -- I feel good now. But now, I don't know, I am going to take a shower and relax, 30 minutes, and go to ready to play doubles.
