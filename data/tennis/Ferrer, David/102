THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you just give me a comment on how you feel you played today?  
DAVID FERRER:   I feel good.   It was not easy match, no, with Anderson.   He's a really good player.   He has very strong first and second serve.   
I'm happy, because I play good in my first round.
