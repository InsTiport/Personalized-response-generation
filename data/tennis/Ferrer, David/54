THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   This is your ninth straight quarterfinal at a Grand Slam.   Is it something you've almost come to expect at this point?  
DAVID FERRER:   I am proud for that, no?   The last four or five years I played very good in the Grand Slams.   I was maintain top 10.   So I'm very happy for that.   
   
 Q.   What were you thinking after the first set, the tiebreak?   What were you thinking going into the second set?  
DAVID FERRER:   Today I was more quiet with my serve.   When I lost the first set, I know I was not playing bad.   
In the second set I play better.   I start really good.   It was not easy in one side of the court because it was windy.   
But, well, when I won the second set, it was close.   In the third and the fourth, I move better, I did less mistakes, and I played with power with my shots, no?   
   
 Q.   Berdych or Anderson, who would you feel more comfortable with?  
DAVID FERRER:   Every day I am playing better.   Today was my best match this week.   Now I am in quarterfinal.   
Well, I hope the next match I have the chance for play similar like today, no?   
   
 Q.   Do you care who you play, which one?  
DAVID FERRER:   I will play against Tomas Berdych or Anderson.   Of course, Tomas is a top‑10 player.   Always when I play with him, it's very close.   
But Anderson, he has a very good serve.   
With both players, I have to play very good and I have to maintain my level.   
   
 Q.   Do you believe you can win this tournament?  
DAVID FERRER:   I never think about if I have chance to win the tournament or not.   I am only focus with my next opponent, with Tomas or Anderson, no?   
Me, I'm always going step by step.
