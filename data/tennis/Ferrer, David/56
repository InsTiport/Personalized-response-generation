  6‑3, 6‑4, 6‑4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 
Q.   How did you find the pace of the court today? 
  DAVID FERRER:   The court was okay.   Of course it was faster than other years, but it's okay.   It's nice.   The center court is very nice to play there. 
Q.   What about the weather, the heat?   The conditions? 
  DAVID FERRER:   The conditions, well, it was very hot, sure.   Nothing else, no?   The match, it was a close match.
  Anyway, I won in three sets.   In the second and the third I was a few times break down, but in important moments I played better than him.
Q.   Do you like the very hot weather to play in?
  DAVID FERRER:   Well, I prefer not too hot, but I think everybody prefer that.   But it's for everybody.   I know here in Australia every year it was very hot. 
  You know, I know tomorrow is gonna be more hot, and after tomorrow again.
Q.   Can you tell us why you left your coach after such a long time?   And something about your new coach.
  DAVID FERRER:   Well, we broken both because we were a lot of years together, and we decide to stop.   Nothing else.   Just that.   Nothing personal.   Nothing. 
  You know, Javier is very special for me.   He's a good friend, and just we decide to stop.
Q.   And about your new coach?
  DAVID FERRER:   Yes.   I back with JosÃ© Altur.   I know him.   You know, I work in the same academy.   I travel with him sometimes, so I know him and he know me.
  Q.   You said last week was one of your worst matches of your career when you lost in the semifinal.   Were you pleased with how you responded and came back?
  DAVID FERRER:   I think every week is different.   The last match I play very bad, but it's just one match.   Now I am in another tournament, other conditions. 
  I'm well today.   Today I play good some moments the match, and I have to be positive. 
Q.   Looked like you wanted to get it over pretty quickly.   You raced out to a pretty good lead.   Can you tell us what happened after that?   You started about 5‑Love, I think. 
  DAVID FERRER:   Well, it's important win the matches in three sets, no, for myself, because my game is very fitness and I need power for my next match. 
  Anyway, the most important is win.   And today maybe I didn't play my best tennis, but I won.   That's important.
  Q.   With the draw the way it's fallen, looks like a good opportunity for you to go deep again. 
  DAVID FERRER:   I don't know.   I will have to play against Mannarino, and it's gonna be difficult match.   He's a lefty hand.   He play very flat with his shots.   I am only focused with after tomorrow. 
  Now I want to rest.   I want to enjoy this moment and be with my team, and tomorrow I will talk with my coach about my opponent.
Q.   A lot of the media aren't really giving you a chance in Melbourne.   Does it take the pressure off moving forward?
  DAVID FERRER:   No, no, my pressure is for my next match against Mannarino.   I don't care about this, I am No. 3 of the world or No. 2 or No. 5.   I know I have to improve my game, and I will try do my best for to improve my game.
