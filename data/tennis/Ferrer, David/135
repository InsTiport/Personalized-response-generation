N. DJOKOVIC/D. Ferrer
  6-2, 6-4

 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. Could you just give us some comments about your performance today? Was it difficult to get into the match after the break from last night? How do you feel going into Shanghai?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, no, no, because I have one day for relax. I did very tough match against Ljubicic, and so it's good for me, no? One day of relax.
 So I think he plays with no mistakes and normally I make little mistakes in the second set with 4-3, and I had my chance there. I don't do it, so with one top 10 or like Novak, it's difficult.

 Q. (Through translation.) You're going to fly to Shanghai to attend the Shanghai ATP 1000. The delay of the finals in the tournament will have any impact on your next tournament in Shanghai? What is your expectation in Shanghai?
 DAVID FERRER: I never have expectation when I go to a tournament. Now I want to focus with the next match against Llodra tomorrow, and I will try to do my best. Nothing special, like another tournament.
 It's very important for me for to go to London as the Masters Series, so I need to play very good for will be there. 

 Q. You say in the second set there you were there 4-2. What was it? Did you lose concentration or did Novak just step it up a gear?
 DAVID FERRER: Well, I think with 4-3 I had chance with two advantage and I did one double fault. But he plays well. He plays well this game. Me, maybe when I lost this game, I lost a little bit my concentration. I can't come back to play very well again. 

 Q. You missed the doubles with Nicolas in Shanghai. 
 DAVID FERRER: No.

 Q. No? But I see from the website that he changed his teammate. 
 DAVID FERRER: No, I didn't play doubles. I don't play doubles in Shanghai.

 Q. So you don't know about this? Okay. 
 DAVID FERRER: No. David Marrero and Nicolas Almagro is the doubles.
