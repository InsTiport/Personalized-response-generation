N. DJOKOVIC/D. Ferrer
  7‑5, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   It was a huge fight today out there.   Do you think losing the 4‑1 lead in the first set maybe changed the dynamic?
DAVID FERRER:   I think was the first set, because I got more chance than him with 4‑2, balls for 5‑2; 3‑0, Love‑30; 4‑1, Love‑30 also, and I didn't take any chance.
So when I play with No. 1 of the world, I have to take my little options, no? 
Anyway, Djokovic in important moments play good.   End of the first set he was playing very good with his shots.
Well, in the second I think he was better than me.   I tried to do my best, but I am a little bit glad with the first set, no? 

Q.   You played with Novak many times.   What makes Novak so hard to beat?   Is there a particular aspect of his game that you find really difficult to manage, or it's just an overall game? 
DAVID FERRER:   Every game is different, and I think tonight, my tactic, it was good.   My performance was good, playing aggressive with my forehand.   But I think it's difficult beat Nole when I am playing with him in the night because the ball is bigger when we are ending the set.   And he has more power than me.
Anyway, for beat Nole, I know I have to play perfect in important moments, play aggressive.   And maybe tonight, the first set in important moments I didn't play aggressive, no,   with my forehand.
