6-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Looking for your overall thoughts in the match.  The match, how tough was it physically in these long rallies?
DAVID FERRER: It was very tough.  I was with -- you know, we are with players, very physic, our game.  The court is slower, and is not -- is not easy win, with the short rallies and winners.
Well, anyway, it was a good match.  I feel that we play very good also Pico, Juan Monaco, and the key, well, it was in a little bit moments.  And in the fourth I was 6-2, but it was close, not the result as really in the game.
Q. Next up you play Feliciano.  You have done well against him recently and it will be a different match?
DAVID FERRER: It's going to be different match, sure.  Lefty hand.  He has very good serve, so is very important for me and my return, and I will play the same that I played tonight and two days ago, try and play my game obviously with my forehand and intensity, is my game.  And with Feliciano I have to -- I have a chance to win.
