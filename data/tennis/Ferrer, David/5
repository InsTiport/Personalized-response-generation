6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Dustin Brown mentioned yesterday that he thought that the grass courts were not as fast as he was expecting them to be.  Have you noticed a difference this year at Wimbledon?
DAVID FERRER: Well, I don't know.  I thought that it was the same court as last year.  Depends of the balls.  The balls the last seven, eight years, it was different, are different, so maybe that was the key.
Q. But to you it's the same, is it?
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, for me is the same.
