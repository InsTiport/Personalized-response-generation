THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please.   
   
 Q.   It seems at the beginning it was a little bit tough; then you managed to recover.   Talk about his game.   Were you surprised?   
DAVID FERRER:   No, no, he's a really good player, especially on clay court.   I knew there were going to be some long rallies.   He started playing really well.   Then I started playing a little bit shorter, and he didn't know how to take his advantage.  
In the second set he had a little bit of physical problems, and that's all.   
   
 Q.   Normally you play in the central court.   Today there were a lot of players playing.   They told you to play during the night and you didn't want to?  
DAVID FERRER:   Yes, yes, they asked my if I want to play in the central court in the night or another court in the day.   The organizers treat me really well.   I decided myself to play before on another court.  
Everyone has told me what I could do, and I just wanted that.   I rather play earlier and finish the day in order to have more rest.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel on that court?   Is there a lot of difference?  
DAVID FERRER:   No, the courts are laid down very well in general.   All of them are very well laid.   The ball bounces very well.  
In a big court you have more space to move.   The distances are different.   You know, the court is not so small.   It's bigger, but it seems it's faster.   
But, well, it's fine.
