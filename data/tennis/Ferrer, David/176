THE MODERATOR:  Questions in Spanish, please. 


Q.  It seems you need to have a difficult match to start playing well. 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes.  Actually, I was a little bit nervous yesterday.  I felt not very well during the training.  But gradually in the match, I gained confidence.  It was a difficult and tough match. 

Q.  Last year in Bucharest when you were most known, is it difficult now to play a good game on the circuit?  Do you feel pressure?

DAVID FERRER:  I think this year has been very regular with lots of peaks.  There's good weeks and bad weeks.  It's not consistent like last year.  The level is high, and it's logical that you have to give more. 

Q.  Here the advantage is you have won in the quallies.  What do you think you can achieve in the main draw?

DAVID FERRER:  It's true that the quallies help you get used to the tournament.  I don't know where I'm going to get in the tournament.  I just want to go match by match, point by point, without worrying about where I'm going to get to.  At this level, it's difficult. 

Q.  Against Grosjean, what is your tactic?  Not to give him the initiative or what? 

DAVID FERRER:  That's a difficult question.  He has a very good forehand.  He's a very fast player.  I don't know him well because I have never played against him.  But initiative could be very, very dangerous.

Q.  How do you see the courts here?  Does it work well for your aggressive tennis?  I don't think it's as fast as other indoor tournaments.  What do you think?

DAVID FERRER:  You have to take care of the ball because the court is not really fast.  Sometimes it could be, but it's not really fast.
