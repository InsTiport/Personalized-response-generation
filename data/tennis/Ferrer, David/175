THE MODERATOR:  Ladies and gentlemen, David Ferrer. 


Q.  How much of a surprise is this?  I mean, you've never really done that well on the hard courts. 

DAVID FERRER:  I'm very surprised.  I played well in Hamburg, but I wasn't expecting to do so well in one of the Masters.  I'm very happy. 


Q.  Hamburg was clay, right? 


Q.  Are you good amigos with Rafael Nadal? 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes. 


Q.  Talk about the last time you played him. 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, we're friends.  We've played and I won 7-5 in the third.  I hope to play against Rafael, because that way at least a Spaniard will go on in the tournament.


Q.  No Spaniard has ever won here.  Moya and Bruguera made it to the finals.  You could be the first Spaniard to win here.  That would be a thrill, obviously. 

DAVID FERRER:  I would sign on right away, and if it's not me, at least it will be Rafael; at least it will be a Spaniard.


Q.  Did you have three matchpoints against Rafy in Stuttgart?  

DAVID FERRER:  (In English) Three match balls for him.  5-4 in the third set.  After, I won 7-5 in the third. 


Q.  What happened, did he choke, did he play bad, or you lifted your game? 

DAVID FERRER:  It could have gone either way.  It was 6-2, 5-3 and it could have gone either way. 


Q.  Today's match, it seemed like you were muy contento to just hit the ball back.  You weren't really going for anything.  Were you just content to wait for Hrbaty to make mistakes? 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes, Hrbaty is a rock.  It would be easier for me to play defensively, just keeping the rhythm, keeping the play. 


Q.  Last question for now, do you feel like you have a weapon, or is your weapon your legs and your defense? 

DAVID FERRER:  Yeah, I depend on my legs.  My legs are a big strength.  I depend on being physically active.  I trained two years in Valencia.


Q.  So that's where you learned your defense? 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes. 


Q.  Would this be a happy birthday for you if you went on to win this? 

DAVID FERRER:  Yes (laughing).  If I win, drinks are on me.
