T. BERDYCH/D. Ferrer   
7-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What do you think you were missing today?  
DAVID FERRER: Well, first set was very even, and perhaps in the second set I lost the first break easily and then I was always behind him.   
Perhaps if I had stepped in and been ahead I could have been able to dominate.  Tomas was better than me today.   
 Q.  In general are you happy with your performance, because you fought until the last ball?  
DAVID FERRER: Well, not just because I fought, but because of my level.  I'm not playing a bad level.  I've played three matches.  Some of them I played better; others I didn't.   
Overall it's been a good week.   
 Q.  Apart from today's defeat, what feeling do you have after this week?  You haven't played in Monte-Carlo or Barcelona.  How do you feel physically?  
DAVID FERRER: Yeah, well, it had been a month since I played last.  It's always important to keep up and get rhythm, because now we have to go to Rome and Roland Garros.  So it's important to be with rhythm so that I can compete.   
Talking about my injury, I'm fine.  I didn't feel anything.  That's the most important thing.   
 Q.  Let's say that here your goal was to play a couple matches.  What is your goal for Rome?  Do you have a bigger goal for Rome?  
DAVID FERRER: You know, I always ask the most of myself.  Today I wanted to win the match many in Rome we will see.  I don't think further on.  I just thinking about going home today, staying calm, and recovering.  Next week of course I'll try to do my best to be at my top level.   
There are times where it just doesn't matter because the other players are going to try their best.  It's never easy.
