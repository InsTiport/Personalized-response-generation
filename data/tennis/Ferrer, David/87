THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome and we'll start with questions. 
Q.   It looked like a very easy game.   Was it? 
    DAVID FERRER:   No, of course not.   I played very good match.   I played obvious very consistent with my game. 
    Maybe was one of the best matches of my career in Davis Cup.   I'm very happy for that because this match, it was very important for me and for my team. 

Q.   You looked very relaxed out there.   Did you feel any pressure going into the match?
DAVID FERRER:   Of course I have pressure before the match, no?   But I try to focus every point, to do my game.   I was playing with very confidence with my game the last weeks.   This week also I played with very confidence with my game. 
Q.   This year you won all your matches in Davis Cup.   You won seven titles on the ATP Tour.   Is this your best season?
    DAVID FERRER:   Sure, it was my best season on my career.   I never won seven tournaments in one year.   This year I play my best tennis in my career, sure. 

Q.   David, was that the most comfortable win you've ever had against Tomas? 
    DAVID FERRER:   No.   Maybe I played with him in Paris Bercy one time I think three years ago.   I won 6‑3, 6‑2. 
    But this time it was tough match, sure.   No, no, I think in Paris Bercy it was easier.

Q.   Were you not a little surprised to win in straight sets?
    DAVID FERRER:   Yes, of course.   It's very difficult to beat Tomas in three sets.   But, you know, I played one of the best matches of my career in Davis Cup.

Q.   Can you imagine playing even better?   Is there anything you need to improve in your game now?
    DAVID FERRER:   Of course not.   Me, every year I try to improve my game.   But the end of the season, it was a surprise play like very good in Valencia, Paris Bercy, Masters, and now in Davis Cup, no? 
    I am in a good performance, no? 

Q.   When Tomas was talking about you, he compared you to Novak Djokovic; that during the autumn you are the two top players who are really over the other ones. 
    DAVID FERRER:   Well, thanks to Tomas for his words.   But I can't compare with Novak Djokovic.   He is better than me. 
    Today, sure I played a very good match, one of the best of my career.   Also Tomas, he's amazing player, no?   Maybe he was a little bit tired.   Is normal.   He played more hours than me in this Davis Cup, so I had more advantage in that point. 

Q.   Can you tell me what you think your strengths are?
    DAVID FERRER:   I don't know. 

Q.   You must have some idea. 
    DAVID FERRER:   I try to work hard every day.   I try to improve my game, my physic, my mentality. 
    Of course, I am older.   I have more experience with my game.   Now I enjoying more than the other years playing tennis.
