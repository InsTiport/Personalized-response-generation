AOYAMA-SHIBAHARA/Kalinskaya-Kuzmova
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations.  Fantastic win.  Just talk us through your very hard-fought match today.
ENA SHIBAHARA:   Yeah, it was a really good match.  We haven't really played, like, two matches in a day, so I think it was both physically and mentally challenging for us, but I think regardless of that, we played pretty well.  Our opponents were hitting pretty, like, big shots.
I think we just had to play our game and try and be as aggressive as we can.  I think we did well.
