O. HERNANDEZ/J. Benneteau
  6-4, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Tell us about your match today. 
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: I have the weapons to beat that type of player. I already did, either on clay or on hard. The score was 6-4, 6-4, but the match lasted a long time, 1 hour and 40 minutes. Every point was very tight. 
 I need to find my rhythm on this type of surface. 

 Q. You once were in the quarterfinals of the French Open. Does it seem very far away?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: No. It was three years ago. But I wasn't playing that well when I reached that stage. I already had played better than that. 
 But the French Open is at a different period. We generally play for five weeks on clay before reaching it. Clay is a different surface. 

 Q. Why didn't you go to Casablanca?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: Because I just came back from Miami. The season is very short. If you don't prepare at the start, you miss your preparation. 

 Q. What was your best result in this tournament here?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: I'm not so sure that I was once in the Round of 16. I lost several times first round. 

 Q. So it's always difficult for you to start playing on clay?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: You can put it that way. 

 Q. What is your next step?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: Practicing. Well, maybe I could try playing the quallies in Barcelona, but I would need to ask for a wild card. I must find myself a Spanish grandfather very fast. But it's good to talk to you. You are giving me good ideas.
