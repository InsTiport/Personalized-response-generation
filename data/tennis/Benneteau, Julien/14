  6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.   
   
 Q.   Question about Davis Cup.   The entire French team seems like lives in Switzerland.   They are playing Switzerland.   Does this strike any of you as strange?   No?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   No, it doesn't change anything for us.  
   
 Q.   Why do you all live there?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Because we like to live all together and we love the country.  
   
 Q.   How much time do you spend there?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   A lot of time.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   In the second set you came back, you broke back.   Did you feel at that moment that you could play better, or did you know it was going to be too difficult?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   No.   There is a real match being played at that moment.   I was playing well in all parts of the game.   Of course I was behind in the score, but I thought if I could make it even he might be angry or frustrated and everything he's been doing during the past weeks might be a problem for him and I could have a chance.   
I was really into that match.  
   
 Q.   The first set was difficult against him, wasn't it?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Well, it is a global thing.   He's an extremely consistent player and a complete player, too.   
He played many matches, had many wins, and I thought he was more aggressive than before.   His returns were a bit sharper.   He was making many first serves and being aggressive.   
I was a bit tired.   I was a bit late.   I made mistakes I shouldn't have done.   Of course the score shows that.   I was also behind, so it was very difficult.  
   
 Q.   Apparently Murray is the only top 4 player you never beat.   Is there something in his game that bothers you?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   I know against him I have to change certain things.   I have to play in different parts of the court.   I think my game matches with his game, and often I play on his strong shots.  
So what I have to do against him is to do what I did against Nishikori in Kuala Lumpur, or like I did in the second set.   I shouldn't think about him.   I should focus on my game.   
And with the level of game I have in these past months, I can really play at his level.  
So what I need it better tactics against him, but my level of game has to be very high against him.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel mentally?   Are you tired just before the Davis Cup?   How are you going to spend those weeks now?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Physically I'm okay.   There I have no particular problem.   I feel good.   I was able to work, because I stopped for one or two weeks, and with LoÃ¯c and Edouard, we decided to see each other tomorrow.   We are going to try to see how we can organize ourselves the best way possible.   
I mean, what are we going to do?   Should we do more fitness or more tennis?   When I will be in London I will of course play my matches and be focused, but I will have the Davis Cup in mind.   If I need to do physical training, I will do that.  
   
 Q.   You will end the year top 30.   Is it important for you?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Yes, it is important for me.   Well, let's say it's not incredible, but I think I'm top 26.   I think.   And the results I had yesterday and today are favorable.   I think it's done.  
It's good because I will be a seeded player in Australia.   It's no guarantee for anything, but it's going to be the first time in my career that I will end top 30, within the top 30 in singles.   This year was a very good season for me.  
   
 Q.   How is it going with the Swiss players?   Is there more tension than usual?   Stan came here and he was sort of saying that you were talking too much about Davis Cup and every loss was an excuse and everything.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Some players talked about it.   I think Stan wanted to give some answers, but I didn't feel anything special.   We were both of us in the locker room very early this morning.   There were no problems.   
I also met Roger.   We just shook hands and I said congratulations for last week, for yesterday, and he made a joke or two.   So no problem.   
Roger is talking about the Davis Cup, too.   He played on clay.   This is a sign.   And Stan is talking about it, too.   
He's saying it's not because he's going to lose that he's not going to be ready for the Davis Cup.   So of course, yeah.   No tension between us.   No problem.
