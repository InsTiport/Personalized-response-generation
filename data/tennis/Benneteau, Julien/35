N. DJOKOVIC/J. BENNETEAU
  6-7, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How is your knee?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: It's okay. It's a little bit swollen. I hope it's just an impact and nothing serious, but I will know more tomorrow morning.

 Q. What were you thinking when you had to call the trainer on match point?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: I told him, from the moment he put some ice on my knee, it was better. But when I hit the wall behind the court, it was very painful, so I didn't know. 
 I did not know what it was. But I did not hear something crack, so I was pretty sure it was just an impact. 
 But on the moment it's very painful. And I told him, when he puts the ice on my knee, I say, Okay, I have one match point to serve now. It was a funny situation. 

 Q. How did you manage? You saved the match point. How did you do that?
 JULIEN BENNETEAU: I just concentrate to put my first serve in. Then he hit a not-too-good return. So I had a good option to go into the net, and I hit a winner. So it was a good point.
