M. RAONIC/J. Benneteau
  6‑3, 4‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you feel you played in the match tonight?
JULIENNE BENNETEAU:   I felt great.   I like to play this kind of match.   It's good to be on a big stadium like this with a lot of people, even if the people is against me obviously.
But after a lot of years on the tour, to be able to play these kind of matches, it's always a great pleasure.

Q.   You've played him before, and in the second set it seemed like you were figuring out his serve more.   You broke him twice.   What happened going from the second to the third set where it just became a little bit more difficult?
JULIENNE BENNETEAU:   His serve was the same.   It's just my very bad game at 0‑0 in the third.
But I just started to see a little bit better his ball, especially his first serve, and I missed some shots behind his serve.   I was opportunistic on one or two points, one passing shot, one return winners.   To put in some pressure, he's not used to that on his serve game.
I managed to do that.   And I tried after, in the third, but it's more complicated when we play this kind of player.   When they have the lead they are more and more confident and their game is better. 
It was tough for me in the set to come back.

Q.   Were you surprised you were given a warning by the chair umpire?
JULIENNE BENNETEAU:   Yes, because he did not ‑‑I was surprised because I think I was late on this point.   Nothing to say about that.   And the rule is the rule. 
But he did not tell me once before, during the changeover or something like that, Be careful, Julien.   On some points, you are a little bit late.   Okay. 
And I told him, Why? 
He told me, Because before that you were always on time. 
I say, Okay. 
So for once, at Love‑30 at one game like this, you put me a warning?   It's easy? 
I was mad because it's easy to do this to me, because I'm 40 in the world and I am 32 and I'm not one of the star players of the tour.
But Djokovic, Nadal, when they are delayed for the first time, they never take a warning.   They take a warning now but never for the first time. 
And the chair umpires, they do always a different ways.   Yesterday I played doubles, these guys, our opponents who are late, the chair umpire told them, Be careful, you are a little bit late. 
Okay, it's fair.   Why one chair umpire is doing this, another chair umpire is doing something else?   It doesn't make any sense. 
It's like yesterday when GaÃ«l Monfils took a warning for the same against Djokovic.   It's crazy.   How can you have a warning for time violation against Djokovic or Nadal?   These two guys are late, late, late every point.   You cannot have a warning for time violation against these guys.
Once again, it's easier with kind of players.   That's why I was mad. 
He was right.   I was late.   This is the rule.   But come on.   When it's the first time, I think you can have a soft warning at the changeover, okay.   Then everybody is happy.
