  6‑4, 3‑6, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   What did you expect from him?   He had surgery.   Did you have any information about his level of game right now?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   I didn't know whether he had a very high level or not, but I knew he had postponed his comeback.   That means he waited to be totally fit before playing again.   
Of course, it was difficult for him to have reference points on the court because of the lack of games, but I knew he was going to be competitive since he entered a Masters 1000 tournament.   
I knew he would have ups and downs, like he always does.   I played him here already, so I know.   
He started the match very well, but at the end of the first set his level dropped a little and I was able to take advantage of it.   
Neither myself nor LoÃ¯c focused on him because he's a good player.   He had a high ranking before, so he was anyway going to be competitive.   
   
 Q.   Like the other players who were in the Davis Cup tie, you didn't have much time to prepare.   Are you pleased with this result?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   I'm happy that I won.   I'm happy that I played at this level.   I know that I didn't have much preparation, but I tried to hang in there and set the foundation for my clay court tennis.   
I was able to play on Tuesday, which is good, because I had two extra days.   I was able to hit once or twice last week.   But there was not much intensity there.   
Winning a match in three sets in three hours is the best practice you can have, especially if you win at the end.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about Robredo next round?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Yeah, he's a specialist.   
   
 Q.   You beat him in Rome once.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Right, in 2007.   I want the video.   It was 6‑1, 6‑Love.   I find that during the past eight months or 12 months, he won Casablanca last year, that he raised his level of game.   He's a much more complete player and he adapts very well on hard courts, too.   
In Melbourne with high bounces and a very slow surface, he did very well.   And in Miami, with that very small court, he also adapted well.   I saw his match against Goffin.   It's typical of him.   You know exactly what he's going to do, but still you get trapped in his game.   
This match is going to be a very good test.   
   
 Q.   Is he the worst?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   There are many of them, but he's very complete.   He's very fit.   He's very strong mentally.   He fights till the end.   He believes in himself.   He was able to turn around many difficult situations.   
I saw him play against Richard, and that was typical.   He brought Richard into his own game.   So he is solid, but he does have weaknesses.   I will have to be careful not to be trapped into his game.
