Q.  Did you cramp?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yes, a little bit. 
 
Q.  When did it start?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  At 5-all in the third. 
 
Q.  With the leg?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  The quad and the calfs.  But, well, it's not like cramp, it's just spasm.  It's not really cramp. 
 
Q.  How quickly did it make it difficult to play? 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  After my serve, when I served, after a long rally, I felt my legs very tight.  For me, it was very difficult to play the points after this one.  From 5-all until 6-5 it was very difficult.  When I called the physio, it was very good but the first point after he make the dropshot and after lob.  And on the lob, I... 
 
Q.  It was painful even for us to watch you run after that.
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  (Smiling) thanks. 
 
Q.  But you got there anyway. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  You did hit it back. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah.  But two or three points at the end of the match, I didn't have all my lucidity. 
 
Q.  You weren't thinking clearly?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah, lucidity.  
 
Q.  It's a very good word we Americans don't understand (laughing). 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Oh, okay.  So it's like this.  
 
Q.  How much did the French challenger tournaments help you coming into this tournament? 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Well, first of all, with this victory in challenger I could play the quallies.  Because my ranking before, it was very tough to play the quallies.  Then after, I took a lot of confidence in my game with these two victories, so...  these victories in this final.  But it helps me a lot now on the court.  I know that I'm able to play very good level and with a good guy in front of me, guy of Top 10, which was the first time for me I played a Top 10 guy.  But I saw that I can play, even I can beat him. 
 
Q.  So by winning nine matches in two weeks in France, you came to this tournament, and maybe your confidence level is high?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Of course, yeah.  It's sure.  
 
Q.  Where did you grow up? 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  In France.  
 
Q.  Right. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  In Bourg en Bresse, near Lyon, 50 kilometers from Lyon.  
 
Q.  Good food. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yes, the chicken.  
 
Q.  You were raised on chicken, right?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yes, yes. 
 
Q.  Every day, chicken?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Not every day, but every week (laughter).  
 
Q.  Are you tired of chicken?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  No, no, I love that.  
 
Q.  Even for breakfast?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  No, no.  
 
Q.  Did you think at one point before the cramping began, did you think at 5-2, for example, "I'm going to win this match"? 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  No, I did not lose the game because of my cramp, and I did not lose the game at 5-2 or 5-3; I lost the game in the first set, even before the tiebreak because I did not return very well.  He's not a big server, but I did not return very well in the first set because I was very tight.  I saw that I have the opportunity to beat him.  Because when I went on the court, of course I went to the court for to win, but this time I had my strategy, my tactic to beat him, but I went to the court with little apprehension. 
 
Q.  Apprehension. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Because it was the first time for me on the big court, like this Stadium, against a guy from the Top 10.   And when I saw that I had the opportunity on his serve to attack him, to aggress him, I was very tight and I made a lot of mistakes.  Every game I start the game at 30-love.  I always lost the first two games on each game.  And when at the beginning of the second set, I was more relax, I can make some winners on my return.  It helps me a lot.  
 
Q.  On your serve, your second serve, you have a very high kick on your second serve. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  It's very effective against a short player like Coria. 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah, yeah, it was... 
 
Q.  You made him step back in the court a little bit.  Did that help you?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah, it helps me, but sure that I could make some serve and volley with my kick.  But with this strategy, two points to win the game.  So I don't know.  It's sure that my kick helps me on this game, but he is very good with his backhand so is dangerous with these shots. 
 
Q.  Where we can see you next?  Where do you play next? 
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  I don't think I will go to Valencia in Spain because I'm going to take some rest.   But in Monte-Carlo, the quallies of Monte-Carlo.  
 
Q.  Do you have to qualify there?  Everywhere for a while?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Not everywhere now because I think on Monday I am going to enter in the Top 100, so I could enter in lot of tournaments.   But for Monte-Carlo, it's too late.  So I have to play the quallies.  
 
Q.  When you have time maybe tomorrow or the next day to think back without the emotions you have now, will you see this as a turning point in your career?
 
JULIEN BENNETEAU:  Yeah, for sure.  For sure.   I never feel like this on the court.  It was something special for me to lead against the No. 4 in the world on the Stadium in Key Biscayne.  Even if I lost today, it's for me my best match ever.  Because from the beginning of the second set until 5-2 in the third, I played very high level, I think.  It was very close this time, but maybe next time...
