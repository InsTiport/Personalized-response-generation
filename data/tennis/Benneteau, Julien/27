  6‑4, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   So you had two breaks against you in each set.   What is your reaction?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   I had a bad start.   I played badly during the first two games.   I made many unforced errors.   I had trouble adjusting my game.   
But then I found a good rhythm and I was able to play my shots exactly where I wanted them and I made no mistakes.   I found the right compromise between being consistent and being aggressive.   
Even in the second set when I was broken, I stayed solid and I was able to break back quite quickly and then he became more nervous.   
   
 Q.   So it was a good match?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   A very good match.   
I also served a high percentage of first serves.   I hit a few aces, but that was not my goal.   I tried to put a lot of power on my serves so my opponent would have to move back.   I never tried for an ace today.   I just used a kick serve and mixed it up a lot and I had a high percentage of first serves.   It worked well.   
   
 Q.   You know journalists like to compare the levels of players.   So how do you rate yourself on clay?   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   It's difficult for me to rate myself because I only played two matches.   
   
 Q.   But today you really seemed to have reached a high level.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Well, yes, I was able to make things happen.   I played a solid match.   For example, when I was down 40‑Love, I hung in there, I got back to deuce, and as soon as I had an opportunity I went up to the net.   I was able to concentrate on each point.   This is what LoÃ¯c wants me to do.   
Of course, I already played better matches than this one on clay.   But I must say I'm quite happy with my level today.   I was able with my footwork, with the way I was sliding.   It's a good match for the start of the season.   
   
 Q.   You've been working on your attitude on the court.   Was that a typical example today?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Well, yes.   LoÃ¯c tells me, Don't be negative about things.   You have to encourage yourself.   In the beginning I was able not to show my emotions and really to close down.   But I was frustrated because I was not able to play simple tactics.   I was down 2‑Love.   It gave him the opportunity of taking the ball early.   He starts playing well when he's up.   If you start challenging him, then he starts making errors.   
But maybe I was too down on myself and I should show my emotions a bit more.   
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you will need to play your best tennis.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Yes, I will have to play a very good match.   Even when he plays badly, he still is very solid.   He makes no unforced errors, so I will have to play as well as today or better but be more patient.   I will have to work more for each point because he gives nothing away.   
   
 Q.   Every time you played him, you took a set.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Really?   I played him twice.   In 2006 I should have won.   
   
 Q.   So you know how to play him.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Well, the Cincinnati match was more recent.   You can maybe use that as a reference.   But then he was not playing his best tennis.   It was an interesting match.   One rally lasted 58 shots.   I remember he made several double‑faults there.   
I realized playing that match that his shots do not really hurt during the rallies, so I know I don't have to panic or try for too much.   He likes controlling or dictating the game.   He's very good at changing the rhythm.   If you play fast, he plays fast.   But I know I don't need to be afraid and try to do too much on his softer balls.   
I did that and gave him several breaks because I was trying to do too much.   He pushes you to play exactly right because he can attack, he can defend perfectly well.   
   
 Q.   How is it perceived among the players that he is now working with Lendl?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   I haven't seen any difference yet.   Have you seen one?   But lately I haven't been watching tennis.   I've never seen him play with Lendl or anything on the court.   I know Lendl and Connors were the players I used to admire when I was young.   But, as I've said, I've never seen them practicing together.   
   
 Q.   Murray is playing one of his first matches on clay this season, whereas you had the Davis Cup preparation.   It's better to play Murray now than to play him in the French Open, don't you think?  
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Of course, I agree.   Tomorrow I will step onto the court with the desire to really win that match.   But I will have to play well or even very well.   When you play against a top player, you must play your best tennis.   
   
 Q.   And physically it's going to be tough, too.   
JULIEN BENNETEAU:   Yes, it's a big challenge.   I've been working a lot on my fitness.   Like yesterday I had a day off.   But after hitting a little bit, I went to the gym for physical training.   This is something I want to do for the next two weeks.
