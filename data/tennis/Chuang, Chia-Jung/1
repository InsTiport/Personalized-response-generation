 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What was working for you guys today? 
 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: Well, first, they start so well. They was crossing, like moving so fast. Then I think CJ started moving so much on the net. At the end of the game even, I start moving, too. 

 Q. Talk about winning your first title of the year. Got to be exciting. 
 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: Well, it's our first together. We didn't play too much this year, so...

 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: Yeah, very happy. 

 Q. How do you think your game is setting up for the Open next week? 
 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: Well, I think we did pick up like every game better and better. So I think we're in pretty good shape. 
 But everybody playing well. 
 CHIA-JUNG CHUANG: We'll try our best. 

 Q. When you don't play together as much, is it difficult to find a rhythm and a groove together? 
 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: I think it also depend against who you play, so... It all depends.

 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: Yes. 

 Q. Pretty nice present?
 OLGA GOVORTSOVA: A really nice present, yes (smiling). 

 Q. Was it warm out there? How were the conditions?
