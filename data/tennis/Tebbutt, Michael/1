Q.  How did you see your volleying today?  Seemed to let you down?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  Yeah.  I had problems with my toes all year.  I have had trouble playing in that whole match.  Every time I went to plant, felt a lot of pain. That's part of the reason. 
 

Q.  What caused the turnaround in the match, in your opinion?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  Well, I guess he played me pretty smart.  Start of the second, instead of giving me room to tee off, he started playing into my body. .  I just fell apart basically.  I was playing great, concentrating; just went really flat. 
 

Q.  Service was still with you pretty well?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  Yeah.  I didn't serve too bad.  I mean, I really had trouble moving.  I've had trouble with it before, but I've never had this.  In a practice, if I've had problems with it, I've felt it.  In a match, because you're concentrating, the adrenaline, I guess, you don't feel it as much.  Today, I was feeling it a lot.  Maybe because I was feeling it so much, I started harping on it.  I was thinking about that more than playing.  Maybe that had something to do with it. 
 

Q.  What exactly is the problem?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  Well, I don't know if it's the shape of my feet or what.  Every time I plant my feet, my toe, I had problem with my toenail, kind of ingrown toenail on one of them.  It won't go away.  I've had problems with it all year.  I will get it taken out when I get home. 
 

Q.  Was that annoying from the start right through?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  No.  I don't know when it happened.  At some stage I must have planted really hard, I don't know, felt it then.  Concentration went with it. 
 

Q.  What's next for you?
 
MICHAEL TEBBUTT:  Heading home.  I don't know, taking a few weeks off, play doubles here and see how that goes.  Got three weeks off at least before I play again.
