M. CILIC/D. Goffin   
7-6, 6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  First set was quite a battle, then what happened?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it was tough today.  It's tough.  I tried to do my best.  But, yeah, Marin was playing well from the second set.  Then the third, I started to feel my arm a little bit again.  It was tough for me to serve 100%, then I had the chance to take the first set at 5-4.   
It was not easy to give everything on every point.  When you start to think about your arm, you're not focused 100%.  Then Marin started to play much better.   
At the end, yeah, a straight-sets win.  It's bad luck to finish the tournament like that.   
 Q.  Into the fourth round, any kind of bonus or positive out of that?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, the last two tournaments was a great level.  I played some good tennis.  Yeah, there was a lot of positive things to take from Cincy and from here.   
Now just the priority will be to recover from this tournament and to be ready as soon as I can.
