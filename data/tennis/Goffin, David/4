7-5, 6-0, 6-3
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. When you saw the draw, did you always think this was going to be a very difficult first match?
DAVID GOFFIN:   Of course, of course, I knew it was going to be a difficult match.  I know how he's playing.  I know the level he can have.  We practiced a few times.  We practiced a lot.  I know how well he can play.
But even if he played well today, I mean, it was not a good match, of course, on my side.  It's tough to lose a match like that, but it's a great player.  When I saw that I was playing against him first round, I knew it was going to be tough, especially on the first round when you have no rhythm, I didn't have a win on the clay.  Not easy, no.
Q. When you look at all of 2020, what has been the most difficult thing for you this year?
DAVID GOFFIN:   For me it's the motivation, I would say.  You feel like kind of worried all the time.  Before every tournament you don't know if there will be, like, a wrong test or you will be positive, negative.  It's the same for your staff.  Every week it's different rules.  Every city is different, how to travel with the staff.  In your private life also it can be just not easy.
The most difficult for me, it's like to be fresh mentally on the court and to save energy to give everything on the court.  That's why I think today it was the toughest part.  It's just that I was a little bit empty, no energy today.
