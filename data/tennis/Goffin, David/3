  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Tell us how you're feeling to be back in Australia and what are some of your goals for the Australian season?
 DAVID GOFFIN:   I'm feeling great to be back.  I think first the quarantine went well, was not in a hard quarantine so I had the chance to hit some balls every day with Grigor Dimitrov, so we had some good sessions, good practice sessions.  Just to see the sun and just to practice, to move a little bit every day it was easier if you compare to the guys that were completely locked in their room for 14 days.  So it was great.
 Now I'm free, free to practice, free to go out.  It's a great feeling.  I'm feeling great.  I'm practicing well.  I hit the ball well.  Everything's fine for the moment.  So I'm excited to start the first tournament here.
