6-4, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It's not about the match, but I am from Japanese media.  Where did you see the match last night?  Was there any conversation with Kei before and after the match?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, saw the match in the house here in Wimbledon Village yesterday.  Just saw Kei this morning before his match, because he was playing first, I think.  So I just saw him two seconds in the morning in Aorangi.
Q. Did he punch you?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, but I think he was disappointed about the match yesterday (smiling).
Q. Do you feel like you represent Belgium when playing Grand Slam or is it something different?  Is it only during Olympics like you played in Rio?
DAVID GOFFIN: I have a stronger feeling of course when I played Davis Cup and the Olympics, but, yeah, I'm Belgian and everywhere I'm representing my country.  And of course I'm playing for myself when I play on ATP tournament, but, yeah, it's kind of like -- it's kind of representation of my country, of course.
