GOFFIN/J. Del Potro   
6-2, 4-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
 Q.  What do you think was the difference in the match?  Aside from the injury he had, obviously, what was making the difference in letting you hang in there?  Especially after being in a big hole in the second set.  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, I started the match really well.   
I played really good tactic, making him run a lot from both side.  Going to his forehand on the right shot and staying on his backhand.   
So, I think, yeah, it was a great tactic.  A lot of first serve.  And, then, yeah, really good first set.   
And then, yeah, I don't know what happened.  All of a sudden in the second, he felt something.  I don't know where, leg or the back or I don't know because I didn't see the treatment.   
And then when he came back, he started to play well, to play full, to try to come back in the match, to stay solid.   
And he can be really dangerous when he's like that.  I saw so many matches when he did the same.  Always he looks like tired, but he's not.  And he's really dangerous in that case.   
So I tried to stay there.  I tried to come back, as soon as I lost my serve.   
But it was great intensity in the second, with some great point.  I was feeling much better physically.  I was running really well.  I was feeling really, really, really great.   
And I was surprised when he stopped at 5-4.  But probably he felt second time something in his leg or, I don't know.   
 Q.  How do you keep your confidence when he's pounding these enormous forehands past you sometimes?  And you might feel like you have no control over the point sometimes with him.  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, I knew before the match that he can go for the shot from every part of the court.  He can go for a winner with his forehand.  So, I knew that I had to go on his forehand, the right shot, to make him run a lot, to open the court.   
And, yeah, sometimes when you -- when he takes his forehand, you cannot do anything when he's hitting so hard, take his forehand in the middle of the court.   
And then it can go really fast.  But, you have to stay really focused and be ready for the next point.   
 Q.  The last one, there's been several first-time Masters champions recently; Sock, Isner, del Potro.  Do you feel like there's a chance for you to join this group soon?  Maybe here?  
DAVID GOFFIN: We will see.  I just try to --   I think my -- in my game, the best thing is just try to stay consistent the whole year.  And in big tournaments.   
And then, we will see if maybe I have an opportunity one day, like Jack had in Paris, I will try to take it.  But, I will try to be ready.  And every tournament, every Masters 1000.  And then we will see if I have the opportunity, if I have a gap in the draw, I will try to take it, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think you need a gap, though?  You can beat everybody.  
DAVID GOFFIN: Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes you're playing well, you're playing the best match of the year.  And then you have another opportunity, and you still continue to play well.   
But, of course, if you're playing Rafa like I played him in Barcelona, it's tough.  You have to play the, yeah, the best match of your life.   
But, you never know.  Sometimes you have a good opponent, you're feeling great, and you never know.  But I have to be there in every tournament.  And, why not?  One day.
