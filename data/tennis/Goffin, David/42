THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How tough was that match?  Seemed his serve, seemed to be really on.
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it was not easy.  It was a tough match.  He was playing really fast.  It was tough for me to move 100%.  I couldn't move 100% today, so it was not -- it was tough for me, because he was playing really fast, left and right.  He was really aggressive, so it was tough.  It was almost impossible to win today.
Q. You have been playing well lately.  How disappointing is it?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, I was playing well.  My tennis is there, but -- yeah, since my injury at the French Open, I have never played a match the way I was 100% physically, so it was tough, but I'm going to take time to be 100% as soon as possible.
Q. Of course you didn't have your good day, but how do you see his potential?  What makes him tough to play?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, he has a good potential.  He's playing well.  He's playing really well.  Has a good forehand.  He's hitting the ball really hard.  He takes the ball early also in forehand.
He's really aggressive, so he's a great player, he has good potential.  He can improve in every part of his game.  But he's only 19 and he's playing really well.
But it's not only him.  There is another really good generation under 21, and I'm curious to see who's going to be the best.
