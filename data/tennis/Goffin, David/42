D. GOFFIN/R. Nadal   
7-6, 6-7, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You're the first Belgian to win against the No. 1 in the world.  Do you think this is the best win of your career?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, on the paper it's the best win of my career, for sure, to beat Rafa.  But, yeah, I saw that he was struggling a little bit with his movement on the court, and his knee was suffering a little bit.   
But anyway it was tough.  It was tough even if he was not moving 100%.  He was hitting the ball really hard.  It was not easy.  It's never easy to finish a match, to finish a set against him.  Even if I lost four match points in the second, I had no regret.  I kept going in the third.   
Yes, it is the best win of my career, but it was, yeah, a special one against Rafa who was not 100%.   
 Q.  What do you think you'll have to do to stay calm after such a huge victory?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, I have to continue to play like that, to continue to play my game, to stay focused on what I have to do on the court.  I think I was feeling the ball really well tonight.  Now the next match will be tough.  Every match is tough here.   
It's not because you won the first match that you are safe for the next one, no.  You have to restart again, prepare the match as always, and be ready for another big fight.   
 Q.  Forgetting this was your first official match here, tell us a bit about it.  
DAVID GOFFIN: It was better match than last year because last year, yeah, it was a great experience.  It was tough to go on the court on the last day of the round-robin match against Novak.  So I'm really happy that I found my level tonight.  That's a good match to start the competition.  It give me some confidence for the next one.
