6-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Your opponent, what is your opinion of him?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, first of all, it's never easy to play a qualifier on the first round.  He had three matches, so there was a lot of confidence.  It's never easy.  He was playing with some flat shots from both sides, and especially on forehand.  It was really fast.
It was not easy to find the rhythm, and especially in the first set, even if I served for the first set.  I felt it was a little bit better in the second and then in the third.
But, yeah, he was aggressive, and sometimes he was, yeah, he was to the net, some good volleys and from the return.  So it was not easy.  I was a little bit too far from my baseline in the first set.  Didn't find my rhythm.  And then after that, was a little bit better.
I felt during the warmup that it won't be easy with the wind is turning a little bit.  You never know if you are with or against the wind.  Was not easy for the serve.  Also for the ball toss.
But at the end, yeah, I managed the win.
