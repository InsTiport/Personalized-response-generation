  6‑4, 6‑3, 2‑6, 6‑1 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. How are you feeling about your form and your performance today?  
DAVID GOFFIN: I'm feeling a little bit tired. Last two days was tough with the rain. It's tough to wait in the locker room.   
You try to eat, you try to stay calm, and you never know when you're gonna go on court and stuff. It's tough.  
That's why maybe in the middle of the third set I had a small down (smiling). I lost my concentration, but it wasn't physically. It was more mentally. So maybe that's why it was tough at the end of the third set.   
But at the end I'm really happy to get through the fourth round for the second time here, and it was a great match.  
Denis, even if it was two sets to love, he started to play much better in the third, and, yeah, I just tried to stay calm. At the end I'm so happy to win this one.
