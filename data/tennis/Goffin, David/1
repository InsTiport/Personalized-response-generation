 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Obviously you just won a title recently.  You look confident, playing well.  How are you feeling right now?
 DAVID GOFFIN:   I'm feeling great.  I'm taking a lot of pleasure on the court.  I'm feeling more relaxed, confident in my choices, with my serve.
 So it's a huge difference.  I mean, in the game and in the results it's a huge difference, but when you're trying to find it, it can come in one match, to come from no confidence to confident.
 Now I feel more confident, more relaxed, I'm serving well, returning well, I'm solid.  I'm feeling sharp for the moment.
 So it's great.  It's great.  Even if last week I lost to Jeremy Chardy in Rotterdam, it was two tiebreak, 6 and 6.  He's also playing well for the moment, but I stay positive and I try to continue.
 Tonight it was a really good match because Filip was playing well.  I think he was feeling the ball well from the start.  It was not easy.  Then I had the first break, so it change a lot the match.
 But I'm happy the way I'm feeling, moving, and playing on the court now.
 Q. When you're confident and you're moving your feet so well and taking the ball early and all of that, how much of a difference does that confidence make in your game, do you think?
 DAVID GOFFIN:   A lot, because instead of going on the side on my groundstrokes, I just cut the angles.  So it makes attack time to my opponent, I have more angles.  I'm more confident, like I said, to cut the trajectory and go more for the line maybe so I'm more aggressive.
 I think my opponents, they feel it.  They feel it.  They feel more pressure.  They feel that I'm more into the court in front of my baseline.
 And when I serve like tonight also it help me a lot.  If it gives me two free points every service game, it's a huge difference.
