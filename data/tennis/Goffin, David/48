An interview with:
DAVID GOFFIN
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Today was a good beginning for the tournament.  He told us you were the stronger player today.
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, I played well from the start.  We had long rallies.  I was solid.  I made him run a lot.  I was playing very well tactically.  I was playing the right way.  I was able to protect my serve with my second serve.  I was very solid.  I'm very happy with that.
It's never easy to play against a friend.  Lately I've been playing those matches pretty well.  They are special matches.  But you still need to play them as any other match.
Q. You were able to come up to the net, off balance sometimes.  Have you been working on that?  Is it coming naturally now?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, it comes more naturally.  I was hitting well today.  That helps me be ready to come up to the net.  I was able to use that on important points, like breakpoints.  In the beginning of the second set I did that also.  I started the set pretty well.  I was solid mentally at the net also.  Very satisfied.
Q. The transition to clay went pretty quickly for you.  Are you surprised?
DAVID GOFFIN: I'm not surprised because I adapt to clay pretty quickly usually.  Also I know this tournament very well.  I know the conditions.  I like this tournament.  I like the balls.  I like the clay.  The courts are very good here.
Starting with a tournament like this one is very good.  It's easier.
Q. What do you think about your next round, if it's Almagro?
DAVID GOFFIN: Almagro didn't play a lot this year.  He got injured.  He retired several times.  He played on clay a few matches already.
He's extremely dangerous.  He has a very good arm.  He hits well from both sides.  He has a lot of talent.  He serves big sometimes.  I saw that in the French Open last year.
He's a tough opponent on clay.  I will need to play a good match.  After my match today, I feel pretty confident, so we'll see what will happen.  It's not going to be easy anyway.
Q. You are always very solid on the court.  How do you work an that aspect of the game?  Also, what are you hoping to improve still?
DAVID GOFFIN: You can always improve.  I want to work on my strong points.  Of course, I have weak points.  But it is important to work on your strong points.  I'm not just going to play serve and volley or change totally my game.  I want to go in the right direction and adjust some details in order to improve year after year.
It's not in two weeks that I'm going to suddenly play beautiful volleys.  I have to do this bit by bit, use those shots during the matches.  That is important.  I'm also working on my baseline game.  This is the basis of my game, with my backhand.  Year after year I learned to be more aggressive, to use my returns, to step into the court.  I'm improving my volley.
But I still need to improve my serve.  I'm working a lot on that.  It's becoming better.  I have to keep being more aggressive, taking the ball early to put pressure on my opponent.  This is what I have to work on.
