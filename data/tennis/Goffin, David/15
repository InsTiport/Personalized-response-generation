D. GOFFIN/D. Medvedev
4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That must feel incredible to come through that one from 4-1 down, both playing at such a high level.  What were the feelings there?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it was an amazing feeling.  But I felt that I was a little bit, I think, the better player during the whole match.  If you see all the rallies and how I felt during the match, I was feeling good and during the rallies I was a little bit more aggressive.
But you never know with a player like Daniil, who sometimes is aggressive in just a few points, and then he serves, and then few aces, could be 4-1 like in the fifth.
But I felt like I had the game and the shots to come back.  Physically I was feeling great, as well.
So I had the energy to fight, to come back, and I think that that was the key to come back in the fifth with a really good game, to come back at 4-3, a good service, a game to hold.
And at the end it was tough to finish, but such a nice battle, and I'm really proud of the way I fought today.
Q. What did Thomas have to say to you afterwards?
DAVID GOFFIN: He was really happy, and of course it was a good match.  The game plan was really good.  I tried to use the slice a little bit more against Daniil, and it was an important shot to be easier in the rallies, and it was effective the whole match.
No, I was happy, and he was really happy.
Q. And lastly, you've got Verdasco next.  How are you looking at that match?
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it will be a tough one.  It's the fourth round, so we will be both really excited and really focused on what we have to do, but it's completely different match, different opponent, a lefty.  He can play really well on the grass.  I remember he played once the quarterfinals.
So he's really tricky.  We had a lot of nice matches against each other.  But it's the first on grass, I think.
But the good thing is I will have two more days to recover, and then be ready for Monday.
