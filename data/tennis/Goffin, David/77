 D. GOFFIN/M. Baghdatis
  6‑3, 6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   That's your second time in the fourth round of a Grand Slam.   Congratulations.   
DAVID GOFFIN:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Baghdatis didn't seem to have a lot of answers to what you were throwing at him today.   
DAVID GOFFIN:   Yeah, I think today was a very good match.   Of course only the second time I'm in the fourth round so I'm really happy today.   
It was a good match against Marcos.   I have been really aggressive today.   I didn't let him play, and I served really well, also.   Not the first game, but after it was better (smiling).   
Then from the beginning until the end it was a really, really good match.   Like I said, I was more aggressive.   I make him run a lot.   Even if he had problems with his calf, I think it was okay.   
But I'm really happy the way I played today and the way I managed every important moment.  
   
 Q.   You came in with some form after making the final in 's‑Hertogenbosch.   Are you feeling comfortable on the grass at the moment?  
DAVID GOFFIN:   Yeah, I knew I had the game to make some results on grass that I didn't in the past.   This year I came from the clay, I came with a lot of confidence on grass and I knew I had the game to ‑‑I had the legs, I had the strokes to play really high level on grass, and I'm really happy that this year I can make some result.
