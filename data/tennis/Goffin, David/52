THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  That was, I suppose, a tough start to the tournament earlier in the week.  You must feel like you're starting to settle into a groove now?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it was not easy.  When I start the tournament, you don't have the rhythm.  Played against Opelka first round, so it's never easy to find your ground strokes.   
But after the second round, the match against Stepanek, I was feeling much better.  And then today it was almost a perfect match against a guy like Ivo, who is serving bombs all the time.   
And every time I was on the ball, it was a great return.  So I did some good shots, and I was really solid.   
So now I'm feeling really good, and I'm really happy to win in three sets.  Because to have that kind of score against Ivo, it's not every day that you can break him four times.   
 Q.  Where does the biggest part of your improvement come from?  Do you think tactically you've gotten better?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, after a match like Ivo, I don't know if there is a lot of -- of course there is a lot of positive things to take from that match.  But the most -- the best things I did today was just the attitude, with the experience I had on the tour.   
Now I was more calm, was really aggressive when I had to take, to be on the ball and, when I had to, take the point.   
I was really calm on my serve and really positive.  So that was the best things to do today.   
 Q.  So you were worried about being dragged into a long match today?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, I was ready to fight until midnight if I had to (smiling).  Yeah, I'm a little bit surprised of the score.  But I knew that I had all the weapons in my racquet to beat Ivo, but not in straight sets.   
I was ready for a lot of tiebreaks, also.  But at the end I'm happy the way I broke him in every set, and twice in the second set, so it was a really good match.   
 Q.  How positive are you now with your chances heading into the second week?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, first of all, I'm really happy to be back in the fourth round this year.  I'm feeling good.  I had last two matches was really quick, so I'm feeling fresh.   
Now I have a good match against Dominic Thiem or Benoit Paire.  I beat both players at least once, and we will see.  I'm feeling good.  I'm fresh physically.  Mentally, also.  I have never been that great in the second week.
