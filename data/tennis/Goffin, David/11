R. FEDERER/D. Goffin   
6-2, 6-2, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously a tough match. How difficult is it to play Roger when he gets into a lead and a rhythm?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yeah, it's never easy. I start okay. I started with a break. But, you know, I was not feeling that great. He gave me the break.   
It's tough because against him you don't know why you miss easy shots. You have 20% of first serve. You don't know why you missing everything, easy balls. All of a sudden he's playing well. As soon as he's ahead, he has a set, then another set, then it's getting tough.   
For me, I knew two sets to love down, you have to take the next three sets against him, it's tough. It's tough mentally when you not playing well, you miss everything, and you absolutely don't know why.   
 Q.  Is it sort of something where you're trying to figure out a solution for your game and his game at the same time?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Of course, but he's playing so fast. He's serving on the line all the time. You don't have a lot of rhythm. You don't have a lot of rallies. As soon as you have, like I said, a chance, you miss the forehand or you miss the backhand or an easy passing or easy attack. Then it gives him a lot of confidence for the next service game.   
Yeah, he doesn't give you the time to play.   
 Q.  You faced him many times. How do you rank his performance today?  
DAVID GOFFIN: It's tough to say because I gave completely. Of course he was great, but I gave the whole match. It's tough to say. But, yeah, probably my worst match against him I played, yes.   
 Q.  A couple of tough losses this year. You lost to Novak at Wimbledon, then here today. In some ways have you felt bigger expectation on yourself because you're having such a good year, you want to be able to push them?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, of course. Sometimes you're like, Okay, I'm feeling maybe ready now to make a good match against him, try to make some good things on the court.   
But as soon as you there, first match on Ashe against him, you can feel all the 20,000 people are behind him as soon as he hit the ball. All of a sudden every shot is 10 times tougher than usually.   
All of a sudden what you felt the day before during practice or the last matches, it feels completely different.   
 Q.  Talk about the differences between Roger, Novak, and Rafa, who you fear the most.  
DAVID GOFFIN: The three players are completely different, different games, different mentality. They are better on different surfaces, as well. It's nice to have those three because they are so good and so different. It's nice to see those players.   
But it's so tough to play them. Against Novak and Rafa, you have balls to hit, but they are so physically really tough. And Roger, he just take position in the court. He try to go forward all the time, go for the winners. Then you just don't play tennis against him.   
No, they are just mentally really, really strong. They want to win everything. They want to stay there. They want to win trophy all the time. All the time they are improving. Even if they are more than 30, more than 35, they are still there physically.   
It's tough to beat them for the moment.   
 Q.  Can you say which is toughest, Rafa on clay, Roger grass or Novak hard court?  
DAVID GOFFIN: It's tough to say. It depends how good they can be. Sometimes they are at their best, and it's tough.   
For the moment, I would say, yeah, Novak is probably the best for the moment.
