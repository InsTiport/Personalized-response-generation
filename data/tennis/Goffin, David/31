D. GOFFIN/C. Moutet
7-5, 6-0, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. Beginning of the match was a bit difficult, like when you were playing Robin Haase.  You played twice left-handed players that you didn't know that well.
DAVID GOFFIN: No, he was very motivated with the public.  He wanted to do well.  He hit good shots.  Little by little, I realized what he did well and what he didn't do that well.
I was able to counter him and adjust myself and get into the match.  When I was at 5-All and I got back to 5-All, I realized that he didn't really have any proper option, because none of his shots are very strong.
I realized that on his higher shots, I could move more and more, and I could move forward.  I was able to line up the games as I saw that his serve wasn't that good.  I managed to win five games in a row and I gained confidence.  Once I understood how he played, it went much better.
Q. Precisely 15 games in a row, has that ever happened?
DAVID GOFFIN: No, never.  It had to be in the Grand Slam.
Q. After the five sets and the emotions of the first round, now you played in three sets and for the recovery it will be better, of course.
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, for sure.  Once I realized that I was on top of things, I didn't give in, and I managed to line up one game after the other until the end without really slowing down.  And I'm happy that it went in the right direction until the end of the match in three sets.
There were long rallies, especially in the beginning, and little by little, I felt well, and I maintained the pace.  It was a win in three sets, which makes it easier.
Q. Do you think that now you're really in the tournament?
DAVID GOFFIN: I hope so.  The first two rounds, when you play opponents that you don't really know, such as today, and then you have tricky ones, like Robin Haase in the first round, it's always a bit difficult in the first round with tension, the conditions are a bit different, and you have to find the right balance and adjust yourself.
But once you're past the two first rounds, you're well in the tournament and I hope it's going to continue.
Q. Is it nice to leave Lenglen like that, just like last year?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, of course, I prefer to play like I played today than to leave in a wheelchair.  I'm happy to have played like I played today.  It's a court with a really nice atmosphere, and I'm happy to have won today.
Q. And what about the continuation?  It will be either Monfils or Klizan.
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, GaÃ«l Monfils, this is probably the tournament he's best at here.  It's very hard to win after the two rounds, but if he beats Klizan, he will have had two wins in a row, and he will have the public with him on a large court.  He's very difficult to control and to handle and to overcome.
Klizan neither is an easy player.  He's had great performances before.  He's a left-handed player, and when he really releases his forehand, he can be very strong.
Obviously GaÃ«l is the favorite, but for the time being, he doesn't really have confidence, although his record in Roland Garros is pretty good.
Q. We saw you sign Liege?  How did you learn about the tragedy?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, it was really strange, because my parents live right there, really 15 meters away, and I heard of this in the car on a news channel in France, and I looked on the Internet to see what had happened.
I don't know anybody.  Unfortunately for the family, I don't know who died and who died in the tramway.  It's really sad, because it's right next to me.
Q. Did you phone your acquaintances in Liege?
DAVID GOFFIN: No, not really.  I just followed the news.
Q. We know that you really love your city, Liege, and it has been really deeply affected these last years.  Do you have a message to comfort the people?
DAVID GOFFIN: No, I think you have to really keep on living and trying to leave the tragedy behind.  That's not going to stop us from living normally.
Q. These are things, as you know, large cities and capitals.  Are these things that you think about, that you fear?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, we have it in our mind increasingly, but I try not to think about it.  Obviously you can run into tragedies at any point, but that's not a reason to stay in your house and not go out.
I think that we do take planes and we do think about these things.
Q. More closer to the tournament, Rafael Nadal said that the clay surface was much more slippery, and he felt that he had much less of a grip on it.  Do you feel the same?  Is it the same on the Suzanne Lenglen Court?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, it's hard to say.  When it is much more humid and when it's really hot, when it's rained more, when it's really hot, it's a bit more slippery.
And when the clay is a bit drier, you don't slip that much, but behind the baseline, it becomes very slippery, it's true.
Q. Can you tell us about your new T-shirt, which is black?  Why did you choose black?  Because it's a hot color in the heat.
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, but I'm not the one who chooses.  It's the design, the trend today.  It has a system to breathe in the back and refresh you in the back.
It is just a statement to say that even if you're wearing black, you still remain fresh.
Q. I have a football question.  If you were a selector, would you have selected Nainggolan?
DAVID GOFFIN: I won't answer that question (smiling).
Q. Why?
DAVID GOFFIN: Because this is very controversial (smiling).  There are pros and cons.  He's a player that I really like.  I never met him in Rome, because I know that he does come from time to time.
But I don't think I can say.  I'm not competent.  Roberto Martinez must have his own idea and I can't say.
Q. Who is your favorite Devil?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, there are quite a few of them.  But I'd say Witsel.
