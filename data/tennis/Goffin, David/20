THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you just kind of explain your mindset heading into Day 3 tomorrow with the Cup on the line?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, I think we're in a good position.  You know, obviously today was a great day.  I mean, obviously for both teams.  I mean, we're in good spirits.  Everybody is ready to go.  Just going to come out here and do our best.
Q. What's your favorite part been about this experience so far?  You have been here for a couple of days.  What's stood out to you?
DAVID GOFFIN: The team spirit during the whole week.  We are practicing together.  We have spent time together.
There is a lot of atmosphere on the team and also on the court.  So this format is really nice.  Every point is important.  It's not over until the last match on Sunday, so I think we are ready for tomorrow.
Q. Obviously you came out really strong as a team.  With these last two losses, what do you do to recover as a team and what do you look for moving forward?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, first of all, we just try to, I mean, to just sum up the day a little bit, see what we did good, what we did wrong, and kind of put up a plan for tomorrow.  You know, that's the final day.
So as I said, everybody is feeling great, a great atmosphere.  I mean, that's the best part of everything.  You know, if you feel down, there is always somebody to pick you up.  I think this is also what that event means and also what it represents.
So as I said, right now everybody is, you know, in a good spirit.  We don't need to reassess anything.  We just need to look forward and ahead for final day.
Q. What did you each learn from playing with each other tonight?
DAVID GOFFIN: Well, it was not the first time.  Grigor is the only player on the team I ever played with.  We won some matches this year, and, yeah, it was a good opportunity tonight to play again together.
Yeah, didn't work like we wanted, but we have, I think, complementary games.  I try to play more from my baseline, to make good returns, and Grigor has more the serve and also take more space at the net.
Yeah, I enjoy a lot to play with him.  And we will see.  Maybe we have another opportunity to play together.
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I think, as he said, we really complete each other, so to speak, on the court and in different areas.  I mean, we have played obviously in the past months quite a few times.  And, yeah, obviously it didn't work tonight.  We were hoping for a better result, but, hey, we are looking on the bright part.
I think every day is a learning, especially out here, among all these unbelievable players, we all learn something from one another, from, you know, personal points of view to something that has to do with tennis.  I think that's the beauty of it.
Of course when we get out there, we always want to challenge each other and, you know, at times it is what it is.  But now we are just united.
