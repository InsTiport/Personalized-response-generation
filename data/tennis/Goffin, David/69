6-2, 6-1, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Were you expecting such a fast-paced match and this amount of winners?  
DAVID GOFFIN: Yes, of course, I expected that.  But not like this.  It's always tough to play on a court you've never played, like Rod Laver Arena.  It was tough to feel my timing on my baseline.  He was playing really good from the beginning.   
When you start to feel better after two sets, one break down, it's tough to come back.
