THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Ashley, just talk about the experience, a little different coming back here for this than for Continental Cup, I would think?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Yeah, I guess like Continental Cup was much different than this.  I play Orange Bowl here, too, and since then I feel like I've gotten much better.  But today I played much, much better than I did in Orange Bowl and everything, so... The experience out there was  -- I felt I would be more nervous than I was, so I was happy about that.  And I played pretty well today. 


Q.  Is this your first seniors event?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: It's my first main draw, biggest tournament.  I played US Open, but only qualis. 


Q.  What were you feeling, you won that first set.  What's going through your mind?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I just thought that  -- I just think that, "Just start the second set like a new set, just like the first set."  I got down 4-2, then I came back to 4-all, and she had a couple of good volleys and good serves.  I had my chances at 4-all, but I couldn't get them.  And I played maybe just a little  -- not as well as the first set.  Started not playing so aggressive; she started playing more aggressive in the second set, coming to the net more. 


Q.  You were having good luck with the passing shot early, then had a little trouble getting some of those to fall.  Was that a difference for you?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: My passing shots weren't as good as the first set.  I felt she was putting far more pressure on me in the third set, and I put too much pressure on myself.  I felt like I had to make them too good. 


Q.  Where have you played all your tennis? Tennis schools or...?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I used to play in Georgia until I was 13 or 14, then I moved to Tampa.  I trained at Saddle Brook Tennis Academy. 


Q.  Who were your heroes or heroines, rather?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: As a tennis player?


Q.  Yes.

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Probably Martina Hingis, I like Kournikova a lot.  Maybe I like  -- I think I like Kournikova better than Hingis.


Q.  Why is that?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I really don't know.  I like to watch her play, and  -- but I feel like Hingis is, you know, a very good player. 


Q.  People have kind of mentioned your name in the same breath of Kournikova for other reasons than just tennis.  Does that make you feel awkward at all, or flattering?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: It doesn't make me feel awkward.  It's  -- they just want there to be like a Kournikova but from the US I guess.  I mean, I hope I can be that. 


Q.  Plus win some tournaments presumably?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Yeah.  (Laughing.)


Q.  What have you done the first three months of the year since Continental Cup?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I've been training only, and then I played an ITF Group One in Paraguay.  This was a week before this tournament.  I won that, now I came here. 


Q.  What's with the red shoes? Are those off the shelf somewhere? Special deal?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I haven't seen them on the shelf.  This is what they gave me to wear.  I don't know if it's special just for me.  I have only seen Davenport wear them and that's it. 


Q.  Are they your sponsors?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Nike, yes.  And Babolat.  


Q.  What's next?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I think I go to Atlanta to play a 25,000.  Then I go to Europe for two tournaments and the French, then I come back home, then I go for Wimbledon and a warm-up tournament before Wimbledon.


Q.  You don't have to do any school?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I have to do school on the road. 


Q.  Do you take a tutor with you?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: No.  My dad. 


Q.  Does your dad  -- is he a teacher?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: No, but I mean he can help me.


Q.  Is it like a correspondence course?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: No, I go to Saddle Brook Prep.  I go for one hour a day and I do the rest of my school work at home. 


Q.  If you play in Atlanta, would it be in the main draw? Would you have a potential wildcard there?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Now it won't be.  Maybe if I would have  -- I have no more wildcards left until I turn 16.  And hopefully if I can get in the qualis. 


Q.  Do you feel impatient to get started, or are you quite happy with this age? You used to be able to turn pro younger?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Nowadays, I think it's much harder to, you know, like Capriati, make it to the semifinals of the French Open at 14.  I mean, the game has changed so much since then.  I'm pretty content where I am right now.  Sometimes I can get a little impatient.  I would like to be doing better or things like that.  I've only played three pro tournaments this year, and I'm doing all right I guess. 


Q.  Do you know Capriati or any of her family well?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Yeah.  I train with her.  We practice together sometimes because she trains at Saddle Brook.  I'll play, you know, I've played matches with her a couple of times.  I've hit with her.  Lots of pros come in and out of Saddle Brook I get to train with. 


Q.  Do you ever hit with Martina?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: I used to hit with her a lot.  She's not there very much right now.  She's just been playing tournaments. 


Q.  Who was the person who encouraged you when you were younger? Was it your parents?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: My dad.  Yeah.  More of my dad.  He's always there most of the time.  I travel there for a while with the USTA and by myself, but now he will come with me everywhere probably. 


Q.  What's your father's name?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Danny. 


Q.  Danny?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Uh-huh. 


Q.  Does he not work?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: No, he doesn't work. 


Q.  He gave up his job to be with you?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Yeah.


Q.  What was his job before?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: He worked at a printing company. 


Q.  Still call you Pebbles?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Not really.  Every now and then when articles come out, they'll use that.  I'm not from there anymore though. 


Q.  How long were you in Georgia before you moved to Saddle Brook?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: My whole life, twelve years.


Q.  You've only been in Saddle Brook for a couple years now?

ASHLEY HARKLEROAD: Yeah, two years.  It will be two years in August.
