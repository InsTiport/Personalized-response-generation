   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  Has it hit you yet that you won the championship?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah, I still can't believe it.  It's a wonderful feeling.  It's amazing.  I can say nothing.   
  
  Q.  You had to fight very hard.  What was going through your mind at the very end?  Were you just trying to fight as hard as you could?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah.  First set I was very surprised because it was Love-3.  Then 6-3.  It was a surprise for me that I won six game in a row.  Then it was 1-6.   
 She played good.  I just want concentrate every point third set.  I want to forgot on second set and stay in the match.   
  
  Q.  It was a good atmosphere out there?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Were you using that to play better?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah.  I feel Radwanska  has many fans.  On my side was my coach and my friends.  So it was amazing match.   
  
  Q.  How many friends did you have there?  Seemed like a lot.   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah, a lot.  But my still fans, they didn't come today because they had to work today.  But I have a lot, yeah.   
  
  Q.  You went over and gave them all a hug afterwards.  Who were you hugging after the match?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  My coach and friends.   
  
  Q.  Did you have family here?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  No, no.  My family is at home.   
  
  Q.  She said you were crying after the match when she hugged you at the end.  She told you not to cry.  Do you remember that?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  I don't know if I cry.  It was shocked for me, the last ball.  I just fell on the court.  I don't know what's happen then.   
  
  Q.  What did you do differently this match from Wimbledon?  You told us it was dark, it was grass.   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah, uhm, I don't know.  It was hardcourt, so it's different.  It was first match we play on hard court, so it was open.  I just played every point.   
  
  Q.  You two seem to play very exciting matches together.  Do you look forward to playing her in some ways?  Do you know it's going to be a good match when you play her?   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Can you see maybe playing more in the future?

  Q.  She ran you from corner to corner.  You managed to stay with her.   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah.  I played so many points just straight to the court.  It was different because I didn't play so on the line.  I play straight court.  It was hard.   
  
  Q.  Afterwards you went on Arthur Ashe.  Tell us what that's like to be out there.   
 KRISTINA KUCOVA:  Yeah, it was my dream.  I was so happy that I can be on Arthur Ashe, see on the television up.  It was so, so nice really.
