GREG SHARKO:  With Sebastien reaching his first ATP Tour final, he'll break into the Top-50 for the first time in his career when the ATP Tour rankings are released on Monday.  First question for Sebastien. 


Q.  Were you nervous before this match or did you just come in thinking, "I have nothing to lose here, I'll play my best tennis"? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I didn't have no pressure.  I have nothing to lose.  I try to play my best tennis, to have fun on the court. 


Q.  Did you have fun?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Not when he was serving (laughter). 


Q.  Did you have fun when you hit that spinning forehand down the line for a winner?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes.


Q.  Can you tell us about that shot?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Which one? 


Q.  You had to spin completely. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  With the lob, yeah.  Yeah, it was a nice point.  But it was 40-Love, and I try to hit the ball like this.  But I have fun because everybody clapped.  It was nice.


Q.  What is it like standing in there against his serve, when he gets into a groove?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I try to choose one side when he was serving very good because he serves on the line all the time.  He serves too fast.  So I try to found one way for return his serve. 


Q.  Sebastien, you could see he was not feeling well during the match. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, but he was serving better.  He was tired, and he served better than the first set.  He hit hard on the return when I was serving.  I think I had a chance in the fourth set when I had a set point, but after he broke me again, he served well after.


Q.  Because he wasn't feeling well, did you try to make the points long?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  I try to play some, you know, rally.  I hope he was tired, to try some rally.  But his serves are very good, so he didn't feel tired when he served. 


Q.  What does a tournament like this do for your confidence now for the rest of the year?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Now I can think I can win a tournament because I play the final in a Super 9.  I hope to play well on clay court now.


Q.  Did you have to buy a lot of tickets for everybody at the restaurant to come down here today?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I asked to the organization for more tickets.  They gave me some.


Q.  How many?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know, 15.


Q.  You're moving to Boca Raton?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes.


Q.  Who are you training with there?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know because I didn't move yet.  There are a lot of tennis centers in Boca Raton, so I don't know where.


Q.  You move next month?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, after Monte-Carlo.
