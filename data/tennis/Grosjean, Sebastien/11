THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Third round.

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.


Q.  You've been there once before.

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes.  Only once, yeah.


Q.  Why have you never done better at this tournament?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  That's a good question. I don't know.  It's a tough tournament after, you know, a few big tournaments before coming here.  I never really had a break, you know, before Wimbledon -- I mean after Wimbledon. I don't know.  It's tough.  I mean, it's five sets, it's humid.  There is many, many good players even in the first round.  So I think I lost against good player always here.


Q.  Do you feel comfortable here?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to play here.  I mean, there is many fans.  I mean, it's a great atmosphere to play well.


Q.  Robredo.  Can you go one more?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I hope so, yeah.  I never play -- I think I played only once on hard court against him.  It was indoor and I beat him, but I lost twice on clay. But it's gonna be big fight.  I mean, the guy is playing well, and he likes the rallies.  So I have to play aggressive and stay close to the baseline.


Q.  Two very fast players on the court.

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he hit the ball maybe with more topspin.  And, I mean, I have to be aggressive against him because the point, you know, starting, he really like to play a lot of balls.


Q.  Could it be a match where you have to get to the net to finish points?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I will say to get to the net, or really be aggressive with my forehand and even with my serve, and take risks on his second serve.
