THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  When you took the service game off Roger, did you think the momentum had swung back your way and you could extend the match into a fourth set?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Not really, because the game before I served two match point.  I knew it's going to be tough.  You know, it's really windy.  It's tough to serve.  No, I try not to keep playing the same, hit the ball first, you know, and play aggressive because when he was, you know, hitting the ball, it was difficult.  So, you know, I try to keep the way.  Even if he broke me back, I had the chance in the breaker. 

Q.  Do you think he's playing in a style of play that he's going to be unbeatable in the final?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  He's playing very well, for sure.  But, you know, maybe against Roddick, I don't know if he won, but it's going to be difficult.  He's serving so well.  So he can keep his serve, as well.  So he's maybe favorite, but not that much.
