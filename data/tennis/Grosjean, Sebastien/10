THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Were you surprised by the relatively easy win you had, given that he had beaten you last time you met?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It wasn't an easy win.  You know, he had a break in the first set.  After I won eight games in a row.  But it was tough.  It was pretty hot.  You know, he's a great competitor.  It's never easy to beat him. 

Q.  You'll be thrilled with the win?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, really happy.  It was really hot today.  You know, it's not easy between points.  You try to find a shadow on the court, you know, to stay cool.  But, you know, I'm glad to win.

Q.  Did the heat affect the standard of your play at all?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I had a tactic to put a lot of pressure on his serve, you know, even on the first serve, to be really aggressive.  You know, he cut his finger during the match.  At the beginning of the third, was 1-All.  I stay five minutes inside, so it was good. 

Q.  Was it an advantage for you, the serve?  You served 130, 140 all the time. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, he didn't really serve well today.  I put a lot of pressure on his serve.  Even in his first serve, I was really aggressive.  He's feeling pressure after and he make many double-fault. 

Q.  Must be feeling pleased with the way that you get to progress to the next round. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, yes, it's a good win.  I mean, Coria is a top 10 player for like three, four years now.  It's a good win.  It's never easy to beat him in those condition.  I'm, you know, really happy to be in the quarterfinal. 

Q.  It does a lot for your confidence?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, when you beat a top 10, it give you a lot, yeah. 

Q.  How do you feel about playing your friend, Paul-Henri in the next round?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  That's funny, I never play Paul-Henri, I think.  Never play.  I play all the French, but never Paul-Henri.  So is going to be the first time.  Is going to be strange a little bit.  But now you have to deal with it. 

Q.  What has the interest been back home?  The French have had such a good tournament so far. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, there is like many French players at the beginning of the tournament, plus, you know, a few guys who qualify.  It's great to see many, many players, especially from France, doing well here. 

Q.  What do you do now after such a taxing game?  How do you recover now?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Bike a little bit and then stretching.  I have to eat and drink.  I don't really like to eat on the court.  You know, massage, try to relax. 

Q.  Plenty of fluids?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.

Q.  Does it give you confidence knowing that you've been in the quarterfinals here twice before and also a semifinalist here?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, I like to play here.  That's a first major of the year.  I did well in the past.  It's a great condition.  I like the atmosphere here.  I like, you know, the people who comes and watch, you know, all the players and they're really into it.
