   THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Sebastien.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about your performance today, how happy you were with how you played.   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I was happy with my serve.  I served pretty good all the match.  I returned very well.  Against a player like Max, who has a big serve, really good at the net, it was tough to stay focused all the match.   
 I'm really happy with the way I played.   
  
  Q.  How did you find the conditions out there today?   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Was okay.  Wasn't too hot or too humid.  You know, I practiced before in Florida, and it was worst than that.  Conditions, they were great.   
  
  Q.  Just talk about the crowd in New York, the atmosphere at this particular tournament.   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I like it.  I like the court.  The fans are really close to the court.  Even during the point, they talk and they scream.  That's nice.  I like it a lot.
