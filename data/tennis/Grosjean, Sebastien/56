ATP:  Questions, please.  
 
Q.  How did you see that match?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It was an uneven match.  It was very difficult, given the conditions.  The balls were very heavy and we had to hit hard to hit a winner.  I tried not to give him any free points, and I worked well because he was making the mistakes.  
 

Q.  It will not be an unforgettable match?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, but I played well.  It was not a very good match.  
 

Q.  Was it difficult that you didn't know when you were going to play?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, that was difficult.  But I knew I was going to play outdoors.  We warmed up several times.  Once on the court, it was okay.  
 

Q.  He let go the second set.  Were you surprised?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, I was surprised.  It was 2-1 and 3-1.  I had a double break.  I succeeded in keeping my serve, holding my serve.  The first set was more difficult.  We broke each other all the time.  But the second set, I served a lot better. 
 

Q.  Was it difficult physically as well as technically?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Physically, it was very difficult because you had to hit very hard the ball if you wanted to hit a winner.  You had to feel good physically to play long rallies.  
 

Q.  You seem to have started well again.  You had only a few days' rest, although you wanted more.  Are you ready to go to the end of the season now?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, I'm ready.  I have a good feeling on the court.  I didn't rest a lot, but now I feel I want to play.  After Rome and after playing two tournaments in the United States, I will have a week break before the French Open.  
 

Q.  What do you think of your next opponent, Philippoussis?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It's going to be difficult because he serves very well.  Everything will depend on his serve.  I will have to hit hard.  I will have to feel good physically, to return well, make him hit some shots before the end of the rally.  It's going to be difficult because he serves well.  It's going to be a good match, I think.  
 

Q.  But it's better to play against him here than on hard courts?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Of course.  
 

Q.  Did you see the match, Marseille-Bologna yesterday evening?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, I saw the match on an Italian channel because I didn't have Canal+.  It was not a very good match and we were a bit lucky in the end.
