Q.  What did you think about the match? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It was a difficult match.  He was coming from the quallies.  It's an important match because you are trying to get into the semifinals.

Q.  Did you prepare yourself physically for this match?  You were a long time coming to the press conference.  Was it for any reason? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I had been doing some cycling after the match, then I went to eat something.  No, I didn't have any problem. 

Q.  What is it that decided the match?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Today we played more on the serve.  And I had a better serve. 

Q.  You were in good form.  You have to be very solid. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Well, he's very solid from both sides.  You had to face him well.  I tried to play aggressively, but it wasn't only being aggressive; you also had to control the points. 

Q.  You said you need to be more aggressive.  You've been saying that for a while.  What is the balance between controlling and being aggressive? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  My strategy was not so much to be powerful, but to distract the other and to play a bit of cat-and-mouse.

Q.  How do you find the surface? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  About the surface  -- the difference of the surface from last week, it's more or less the same, but the ball bounces higher. 

Q.  Do you have any special wish for the end of the year? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Well, reaching the semifinals  -- having reached the semifinals is good.  In Rotterdam, I played quite well.  I think I'm in good condition, but I have to play a good match tomorrow. 

Q.  For tomorrow you have either Agassi or Ferrero.  Tell us what will happen.  What are your feelings about that? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Well, both of them, they hit very hard.  They like to take control.  I'll have to stop them from controlling too much. 

Q.  What is the difference between Agassi and Ferrero? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I find that nowadays, maybe Ferrero is a bit better, plus he will have the crowd behind him.

Q.  How do you compare your physical conditioning to last year at this time? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It is the same. 

Q.  Will you lose your focus because the crowd will be so loud?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I think Ferrero's motivation will be higher than Agassi's.  But, no it's not so much the crowd, but his own motivation.  Ferrero's motivation will be much higher because he's in his country. 

Q.  Gonzales admires you a lot.  What do you think about him?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  He's made good progress.  He hits the ball very hard.  He's not an easy opponent because he puts a lot of pressure on you. 

Q.  What do you think of his future? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I think he's showing a progression from the tennis point of view, but the mental focus will have to follow
