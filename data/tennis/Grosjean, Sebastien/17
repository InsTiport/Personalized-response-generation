THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Your opinion about your opponent for tomorrow. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  He's a good player.  Just beat Roddick in two sets, so he's playing very well.  He hits the ball really hard.  I'm going to try, you know, to play maybe my game because he like to be aggressive and to be on court and hit the ball with his forehand.  So I'm going to try to put pressure open his backhand, try to keep my serve. 

Q.  What is his strongest things?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You know, he has his forehand and his serve, he's really powerful. 

Q.  Do you think he's one of the favorites to get the medal?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Now there's eight guys that can get medal.  You know, he is one of the eight favorites.
