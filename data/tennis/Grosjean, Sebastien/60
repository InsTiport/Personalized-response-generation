Q.  How exciting is it for you to beat the No.  1 player in the world?

Q.  What was the reason you won?  It was close. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Maybe I wanted more than him to win.  I don't know.  But it was very close at the tiebreak.  He had some match points.  I don't know.  I don't know why I win, but I win.


Q.  What would you say your biggest win before this was?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I beat Mantilla and Bjorkman.  Both was around 10 when I beat them.

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Boca Raton, but in one month.  I'm going to live after Monte-Carlo, I come here.


Q.  Why do you want to live here?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Because there is a lot of French players.  It's very nice to practice in Florida.  We can play outside all the year.  That's a great time here.


Q.  Where does this win rank for you in your career?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I told him.


Q.  You already answered?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, I beat Mantilla and Bjorkman.


Q.  Where does this win personally?  Is this one of your great wins?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, he is No.  1.  That's my best win.  I don't understand the question.  It's the more important because it was very close.  It was a very tough game.  Yes, it's my best win against Carlos.


Q.  There was a point in the tiebreak, a long rally back and forth, back and forth.  It hit off the edge of his racquet.  Do you remember that point?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No.


Q.  Came to the net, it kind of dinked over off the end of his racquet. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  In the tiebreak?  It was match point for me? 


Q.  I think so. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I came to the net, make a lob.  After, he came to the net.  It was a dropshot volley.  It was a lucky shot.  It was match point.  I had to finish on this match.  It was a great point.


Q.  Did you feel confident throughout the match?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, I have to.  If I was a little bit nervous, it's difficult to win.  I try to keep cool, play point-after-point, try to win.


Q.  This is his first time at No.  1.  Do you think he was nervous out there?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  Maybe, because he miss two or three match points.  He miss one easy forehand at the first match point.  Maybe he was a little bit nervous.  Maybe.


Q.  Of all the French players out there, do you think you're the fastest?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.


Q.  What do you think?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  If I am the faster? 


Q.  Yes. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I don't know.  There is one or two more players who run fast.  I don't know if I'm the faster. 


Q.  Before this match, you perhaps were thinking either, "This is a great opportunity for me, I can get a lot of points by beating this man"? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes.  I have to think like this.  If you go on the court and you think you have no chance to win, you don't have to go on the court.  I believe in my chance, so I try to win today.
