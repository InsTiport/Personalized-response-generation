MODERATOR:  Questions for Sebastien. 


Q.  Looks like you were very happy after three hours to beat him. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  You know, was a pretty good match today.  Karol played well.  Had a chance to win the fourth set.  He was a good level today.  Yes, I'm pretty happy to win this match. 

Q.  You mentioned before the match that his weakness is when he's under pressure and the other player is dictating the points.  Do you have a feeling that he was more aggressive today than you expected? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Not really because he didn't, you know, put me pressure on my second serve, and I was surprised.  No, he was playing very well.  You know, he's taking the ball really early.  At the end, he was a little bit maybe under pressure.  He missed a few shot when he was winning 5-4, and that's help me a lot at the end. 

Q.  You beat him easy before, three matches, six sets, quite quick sets.  Did he surprise you with some way?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You know, against Karol, it's always tough.  Even if I beat him three times in two sets.  I played him in St.  Petersburg and he was really close anyway.  I had a chance to kill the match in the beginning of the fourth, but he played better and he came back.  After it was really close.  I can win easy the fourth set, but I can lose as well.  It was pretty close at the end.

Q.  He was here today and said that he ranks you pretty high.  He considers you one of the favorite in the tournament.  How far do you think you can go?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  I want to concentrate on my next match and don't think about the after.  You know, I have to play better and better if I want to go very long in this tournament.
