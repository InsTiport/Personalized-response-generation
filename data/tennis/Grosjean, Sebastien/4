   THE MODERATOR:  Any questions in English?   
  
  Q.  Just give us a bit of an update on the injury or the problems you had during the match.   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I hurt my leg like the end of the second set, and it was getting worse and worse.   
 So I knew if I can't win in three sets it was over.  And, I don't know.  I have to do an exam and I will know more.   
  
  Q.  Was it a flare up of the continuing problems you've had with your groin?   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  I tore a groin in the left leg.  So I don't know what is it.  I will know more tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that Nalbandian is mentally and physically stronger than other players?   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No.  I think Nadal is more stronger.  But after two sets he was almost tanking, he doesn't move.  So no, I don't know if he's stronger, but mentally he's good.   
  
  Q.  What's up with three match points that you had --   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I mean, three match point, I mean, nothing to do.  I mean, he got better than me those three points and that's it.   
  
  Q.  But do you think that's part of the injury?   
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No.  Like I said, I start to feel the pain at the end of the second set.  So no, even if I won that match, I won't be able to play in two days so it's the same.
