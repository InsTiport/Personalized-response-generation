THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please, for Sebastien Grosjean. 


Q.  Am I right in understanding that you didn't feel you were at your maximum level today? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I didn't play my best tennis, but I think I was solid.  You know, when you play a young kid who you don't know who's playing very well, it's never easy.  So, no, I played okay, you know.  I served well on the big points, and I keep pressure on him, you know, when he was close to the end of the set.  And is good to be, you know, in the second week here.

Q.  You think there's plenty left in your game?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, yeah, I think I can play little bit better, you know, more aggressive also.  So, you know, I gonna try to use, you know, my day off to play better for Monday.

Q.  You certainly feel at home here, don't you? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I like to play here.  I like to play here.  It's not home, but, you know, each time I come here, it's great, you know.  I like to play on grass and I like to play here in Wimbledon.  So I enjoy myself on the court here.

Q.  Do you like the general atmosphere around the club?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, yeah.  The facilities are really great now.  You know, there is more space.  Even the weather, you know (smiling), is great. Only yesterday rain.  So it's good for all the tennis player and for the fans also.

Q.  Just one last one.  Are you slightly disappointed or relieved not to be playing Tim in the next round?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I have great memory against Tim here.  It was a great match, you know, two years ago (smiling).  But he lost against Tursunov and I have to focus on play Tursunov instead of Tim.
