THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Sebastien, you make the shot of the match, a running backhand down the line to help you win the second set.  All the momentum is yours.  What happened all of a sudden? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't think I lose a match in the third set.  Three set points in the tiebreak.  I should win in two sets.  No, at beginning of third set, you know, I was little bit down, you know, less concentration.  And after I played better. 

Q.  I would have thought you would be excited going into the third set? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It's never exciting to go in the third set when you think you can win in two sets.  But I think Gaudio played a pretty good game today.

Q.  Will this match ultimately help you straighten out the little problems in your game? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Even if I lost, I think I played better than the first round, you know.  And, you know, I'm pretty happy to lose and play a good match.  It's a goal and I try to play my game.  I played much better against Gaudio than against Gaudenzi. 

Q.  The first set you hit four balls then an error, five balls and an error. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  In the first set?

Q.  Yes.  Second set got much better, you seemed much more confident in the second set.  Then there would be like some crazy miss, a short ball you'd hit out or something. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't think, you know  -- in first set I think both of us serve pretty well.  You know, only one breakpoint in twelve games.  So it's good.   And no, I had a chance in, many chances in tiebreak, of course.  But it's always tough when you have to fight every time against a guy like Gaudio who's playing well and move well. 

Q.  When do you predict that you'll be back on the form that you showed at the end of last year?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  That's a good question, no?  I cannot answer.  I don't know.  You know, my game is better than the beginning of the year.  I play better and better.  So I need, you know, a few victories and that's it. 

Q.  When do you leave for Europe?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I play doubles tomorrow. 

Q.  After that, after this tournament?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  Depends of Davis Cup.
