MODERATOR:  Questions for Sebastien.  
 
 
Q.  Are you surprised about how easily it looks, the result, today?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, a little bit.  I think I played a very great first set.  You know, I had many winners.  I didn't miss a shot, so I was very, very fine on the court.  And then second set was very close.  I had a chance to break him at 4-All.  I was surprised, yes, to win easily.  
 
Q.  Do you think that to play indoor in a way favored you because Carlos Moya normally doesn't like that much indoor?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  But for sure it change everything because we starting to play, you know, our first round outdoor, it was windy, so condition was completely different.  Yes, for me it's nice to play indoor because there is no wind.  It's easily for me to play indoor.  But Carlos make final at the Master indoor also.  I don't know if it was good for me.  I don't know.  
 
Q.  Is it faster, the surface, when it's indoor, or is it exactly the same?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, is the same.  There is no wind, but I think the court is the same, same speed on serve.  Everything is same.  
 
Q.  You seem to be taking it all very level-headedly.  How are you feeling inside?  You seem to be taking it calmly. 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I'm very happy to be in semis.  The end of my last against Norman was more exciting today because I was only one break.  Today I was two breaks.  I was serving very well.  I was comfortable at the end.  
 
Q.  I tried to find some information about you from my French friends.  I know you are funny person, very clever.  What can you help me in my job?  What can you say new that we don't know about Mr.  Grosjean, maybe about things you like?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I like soccer, football.  You can write that.  No, I don't know.  I grew up close to Marseille in mountain, so I used to skiing.  I don't know.  I love Olympique de Marseille.  
 
Q.  Why are you a tennis player and not a skier?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  Because my father used to play a little bit soccer and tennis, not really doing skiing.  I starting to play after tennis.  I like much better. 
 
Q.  Why do you live in Boca Raton?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Why (smiling)?  
 
Q.  For taxes?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No (laughter).  No, I have a wife and a baby, so it's easier in Florida.  Life, it's easier.  I don't know.  I don't really like the weather in Paris.  In Florida it's much better. 
 
Q.  Carlos just said a few minutes ago if you keep playing like that, then you have a chance of winning here.  Do you feel that you can maintain that level of tennis? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I hope so.  I don't know.  Yes, today maybe I play my best tennis of the week, for sure.  I don't know if I can play better because on the first set, you know, I did not miss a shot, I make many winners.  I going to try to keep this level on semis and maybe in final. 
 
Q.  When was the last time you played that well? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Oh, I played well in Stuttgart. 
 
Q.  Stuttgart?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, Masters Series.  I played two great matches there also. 
 
Q.  Against?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Kuerten, yeah, Kuerten and also against Haas.  
 
Q.  Tomorrow it's either Kafelnikov or your friend Clement.  Can you talk a little bit about both, tomorrow or the next day?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  If I play Arnaud, it's going to be tough for sure because we know each other very well.  We used to practice together.  If I play Kafelnikov, I played him twice, and I lost twice.  No, it will be a different game for sure.  
 
Q.  Is it true that you were discarded by the French Federation when you were young because you were too small?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah. 
 
Q.  And they didn't think you had chances to become a good player?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  How much did you suffer for that?  Your reaction was positive because of that? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I had already reaction when I won the junior championship in France.  But now I forgot it. 
 
Q.  You forgive them?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah (smiling).  
 
Q.  How long ago was that? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Seven years ago.  I was 15, yeah.  
 
Q.  Clement was considered more promising than you?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No.  He wasn't really in sports school, tennis school.  He was home.  He's doing his school and tennis after.  He wasn't, you know, in a good level under 18.  He was really good after 18, yeah.  
 
Q.  But first you were always beating him and now is more even or what?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No.  I think it's maybe 2-All or 3-All.  One time I beat him, and the other time it's him.  If we play semis, it's going to be fun. 
 
Q.  Arnaud said you had a bet which one of you would lose a set here first.  Did he come and collect?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, I had to invite him at a restaurant.  No, it was fun because we were playing very well at the beginning of the week, not losing a set, so we make a bet like this just for fun. 
 
Q.  Your goal at the beginning of the year?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Make a quarters at a Grand Slam.  It was my goal.  I played well in Masters Series, other tournaments, but not really in the Grand Slam.  I just play one last 16 in Wimbledon, '98.  It was my main goal this year, you know, to be in quarters in the Slam.  
 
Q.  You can stop now?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Oh, I don't know. 
 
Q.  Why?  Why? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Exactly. 
 
Q.  Have you always, since you're a junior, played with your cap backwards?  Has that been a trademark thing of yours?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, yeah, because when I was younger, I was always long hair, so it was easier like this.  When I serve with the cap like this (indicating forward) with the sun, I don't really like.  It's much easier. 
 
Q.  They actually said to you, the French Federation, "You will not make it because you are too short, too small"? 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes. 
 
Q.  Was that Patrice Hagelauer?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, no, no (laughter).  No, no, no, it's not him.  You can keep it.
