MODERATOR:  Questions for Sebastien. 


Q.  What happened in the end exactly?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It was an ace, and the net machine was on, so he was a let.  I didn't hear, and Magnus didn't hear.  He said, "It's okay, I did not hear."  He gave me the point.  Is very nice from him.

Q.  Has that ever happened to you before?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, first time.  Not in match point.

Q.  Are you ready to do it in the future to someone else?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You mean? 

Q.  If it happened to you, in place of Norman. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, but we were together at the net, we were talking.  He said, "I did not hear."  I don't know if I will do the same thing, but he did, and it's very nice.

Q.  Why do you think he did it?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Why? 

Q.  Yes. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  He's a nice guy, you know.  He never try, you know, to cheating, something like that.  No, he's fair play. 

Q.  That is your best performance in a Grand Slam.  You must be rather happy. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Oh, yes.  It was one of my goal of the season to play quarters in a Slam.  It's very nice.  I'm very happy to be in quarters now. 

Q.  What happened in the third set?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  I was two set to love up.  I didn't start very well.  Magnus, you know, keep going and keep playing better and better.  I wasn't very in good shape in the third set, and he starting to play better.  I had to fight in the fourth to win in the fourth set.

Q.  Can you talk about your opponent in the quarterfinals, Carlos Moya?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I played him twice.  I lost at the French Open and I beat him at Key Biscayne.  He's a great player.  Since the beginning of the tournament, he's playing very well.  He beat great players.  He has a good confidence, so is going to be a tough match for me.
