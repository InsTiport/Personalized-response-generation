   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  How did you play today?  How do you feel about your upcoming match? 
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I played pretty well today.  I really enjoyed the game.  It was tough because Olivier played very well.  He's a really talented player.  He was pretty close.  I mean, it was a big battle. 
 I'm really happy to be in the third round now.  It's going to be an exciting match. 

 Q.  Two brothers in two successive matches.  Odd situation. 
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Olivier beat me in Doha the first week of the year, and I played the brother here.  First round Christophe was injured, so it was easier.  But today was a tough match.  Sometimes you have to play them, and that's okay. 

 Q.  Have you played them before like that? 
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, never.  I almost did in Davis Cup because I played Olivier the first round.  Because we won 3-0, I didn't have to play against Christophe. 

 Q.  Didn't think you were seeing double? 
 SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, because Olivier didn't look like Christophe.
