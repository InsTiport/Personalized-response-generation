MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Pretty crucial time in the race now to get to Sydney.  Pleased to win first up, start getting valuable points. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, this tournament and Bercy are really important for all guys who are really close to the Masters.  But I'm going to try to focus on my game and win my spot to Sydney.  I'll see.


Q.  Do you keep an eye pretty closely on the other results?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I don't want to see all the results of the other guys.  I going to lose my concentration.  I prefer, you know, think on my game and focus on just myself.  Is going to be more important for me. 


Q.  You're playing Wayne Ferreira next.  I know he beat you in the semifinals here last year.  What are your thoughts on playing him?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, is going to be a tough match for me.  Wayne didn't play very well this year.  In this tournament, he won it last year.  He beat two good guys in the first two rounds, so is going to be a tough match.   I'm going to try, you know, to play my game and win this match because, you know, if I have a chance, I have to play well here and in Bercy.
