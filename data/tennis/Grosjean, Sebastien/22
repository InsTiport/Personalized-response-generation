MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  What happened out there today in your mind? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, I think Mark served big today.  It was tough for me to return.  And I had pressure on my serve, you know, especially in the beginning of the second set.  So I had to maybe serve more first serve today, and I didn't really serve good.  And, you know, after under pressure, it was difficult.

Q.  Do you feel tired at all? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, little bit.  You know, I play every day since Monday.  I have only two days' rest since the beginning of the tournament, so it's not easy.  But Mark played a great game today. 

Q.  How difficult does he make it?  How much pressure does he put you under, a player under, with his serve, his ground strokes?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, he serve really good.  I had only two breakpoints in the match.  So when it was tough for me to return, you know, take chances on my serve because I didn't serve so good.  It's always tough for me to keep my serve and stay in the match. 

Q.  Does it make it particularly disappointing that your overall game was so excellent against Tim? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, yeah.  I played pretty good against Tim, but Mark serve maybe a little bit better than Tim today.  You know, even on the second serve, he was hitting the ball hard so it was difficult to return.  And even when I was returning good, he volley good. 

Q.  Are you disappointed with the way you played today, or was it just very, very hard to get into the game because of the power you were facing at the other end? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You know, I had chances maybe in the breaker in the first set, you know, I was 3-2 up.  I missed two easy shot.  After, you know, it change a little bit.  But it's always tough when you don't return well, and because of the serve of the other player.  And, you know, after, on my serve it was tough, under pressure, and...

Q.  I noticed that you're sponsored by X Box.  

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes.

Q.  Do you sort of ever play any games or tennis games, anything like that?  You were not up playing Mark Philippoussis last night?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  There's a tennis game coming out in September.  Yeah, we did the game last year.  

Q.  Have you had any involvement with that?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, little bit.  We did the game in Miami last year, so it was  -- that's a real forehand and backhand. 

Q.  Do you play the computer game?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I used to.  Not anymore, I don't play a lot. 

Q.  You say it was tough to deal with the serve.  You won your first three service games at love.  You seemed to be just breezing along with your serve.  Did you accept that that was not going to remain as it was for long?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, maybe, you know, the match was, you know, in the tiebreak in the first set when I was leading 3-2, and I lost this tiebreak, five points in a row.  And, you know, I was thinking a little bit in the changeover of, you know, those points, and I didn't start the second set good.  I left, you know  -- I lost little bit my serve, not a lot of first serve in the game.  So maybe the game was more in the tiebreak in the first set.

Q.  What do you think it will take to stop Mark in the final now? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  I don't know against who he gonna play, but, I mean, if he serving big, the other guy gonna have difficulties to break, yeah. 

Q.  I've got a very easy question.  I'm doing a piece on glamour and hair in the tournament this year. The ladies have been stealing all the headlines as far as this is concerned.  What do you think about men's glamour and hair in this tournament?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Glamour, I don't know (smiling).  Is not easy question, I mean, huh? 

Q.  How do you keep your long locks in shape?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You mean my hair? 

Q.  Yeah. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  You like? 

Q.  Yeah. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah?  Thanks (smiling).

Yeah, no, it's...

Q.  Can you take your hat off?  Can I see.  Very nice. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Thank you.

Q.  Any tips? 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, no, I like that, no?  It's pretty good.
