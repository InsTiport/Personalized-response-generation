THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 
 

Q.  It was tough out there?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yeah, I played him twice and it was difficult to beat him.  I put pressure on myself and he has a big serve so he's playing better and better.  He's a really good player, and it's tough to beat him. I played a pretty good game today.  
 

Q.  Were you disappointed by the first set? You had some chances.  You got back in the game. 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yeah, he broke me and I broke back.  I didn't serve very well in the first set, so it was easier for him, you know, to put pressure on me and keep his serve.  After, I started to just have better percentage on my serve and then return better.  
 

Q.  You've had a couple of years of living in Boca, what's it like?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I still enjoy the life here.  You know, I stay home yesterday night because I play first match.  But I enjoy the life, it's easier to practice, still practicing at Evert  it's good condition there.  You know, the weather is perfect.  So I enjoy the life here.  
 

Q.  Living in this kind of weather, hot, humid, does it in any way get you ready for Key Biscayne?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yes, maybe.  But, you know, I try to practice for lot here, but sometimes is difficult because, you know, there is many tournaments as well in Europe.  But I think that that's help a lot because, you know, keep practicing when it's hot, humid.  Some time it's windy, and it's kind of same condition here. So that's helping a lot I think, yeah. 
 

Q.  Do you find it easier to play now in this kind of weather than when you did when you first came to Florida?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yes and no because here it's windy, and you know, I grew up in Marseille and it's a windy city, so it's kind of the same. But yes, it's easier because I use to practice when it's humid and it's good condition, yeah.  
 

Q.  Tell us what the baby's doing now.
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: She's doing well.  She's two and a half and, yeah, she speak English much better than me.  And no, no, she  -- I think it's easier for her here because just the weather, there is many public park, some playground.  So it's easier for her than in Paris in winter. 
 

Q.  Has she hit her first tennis ball yet?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: She has a racquet.  But no, she doesn't, you know, when she take the racquet she doesn't want to play now.  So... 
 

Q.  Have you gotten off to a better start in your career this year?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Well, yeah.  I start the year very well.  I practice hard in December here and maybe it's  -- when you practicing, keep practicing and try to improve your game, something happen. So I play well and I try to keep, you know, my level like I played in Australia but it's difficult because I played really well there. But I keep playing.  I have good results since, you know, January after the Australian Open, so it's good for my game.  
 

Q.  No matter who wins, your next opponent will be very different from Max Mirnyi?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yes, will be different but is gonna be tough anyway.  A lefty or right-handed, the same player on the baseline.  But Vinciguerra is a young player.  He's had really good results.  So gonna be Vinciguerra probably is gonna be a tough match for me. 
 

Q.  Did you play either Andrei or Andreas before?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I played once in Marseille.  
 

Q.  Versus Pavel or  --?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: No, Vinciguerra. 
 

Q.  And Pavel?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't play  -- I never played him I think.  
 

Q.  Very long rallies?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Against Pavel? 
 

Q.  Against Vinciguerra.
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I play on indoor, so not really big rallies but a few.  
 

Q.  Do you find with him that in that match that it often comes down to who's fitter because you're both gonna get into long baseline rallies if you can?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Yeah, I don't know.  I'm gonna try, you know, to take my game and, you know, put pressure on him because he has a good first serve.  But his second serve, I can put pressure on him. So I think the serve can do something to me Sunday.  
 

Q.  How many years have you been in Boca now?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Two years.  
 

Q.  Three?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Two.  
 

Q.  And what first attracted you to the area?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: What I'm doing there? 
 

Q.  Yeah.  Why Boca, I guess?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Why Boca, I don't know.  I used to go to Jupiter when I was younger, but now in Boca because there is few French players and I visit the area, good practice there.  So now I'm there.  
 

Q.  Have you ever run sprints, 100 meters? Did you run at all when you were younger?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Younger, no, was shorter.  Like 30 or 40 meters.  I didn't really do 100 meters. 
 

Q.  You never ran track and field?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Sometimes, sometimes. 
 

Q.  Do you have a best time over 100 meters?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: Oh, no.  Long time ago.  I don't remember.  
 

Q.  You're so fast, I just wondered how fast you were. 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I don't know.  Maybe I did, but I was 13 or 14. 
 

Q.  So if I put you out there and asked you to run 100 meters today, how fast do you think you could do it in?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: That's a good question.  I don't know.  Twelve seconds?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Twelve, no? You think what? 
 

Q.  I think the world record  --?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I know the world record, 12, 13.  
 

Q.  Try it some time. 
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: And you? (Laughter.)
