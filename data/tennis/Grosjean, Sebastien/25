MODERATOR:  Questions for Sebastien. 


Q.  He said it was a tougher match than the score indicated.  Is that how you felt during the game?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  It was pretty long for three sets, a lot of advantage.  But Andre was playing well.  It was tough for me because I didn't serve.  I don't have free points on my serve.  Against Agassi, if you don't serve well, it's very difficult.  I hit the ball pretty well today, but my serve wasn't at my best level. 

Q.  Based on what you've seen today, what sort of form is he in at the moment?  Is he in a position to win this?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yes, I think Agassi in each tournament he can win.  Yes, he's ready.  He's hitting the ball very hard.  Don't normally spend a lot of time on the court.  It's good when you're in semis.  I don't know against who, but I think it's going to be a tough match in the semis for him anyway.
