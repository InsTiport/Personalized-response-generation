THE MODERATOR:  First question in English, please.  
 

Q.  What was the turning point for you today?
 
SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN: I think it was when I broke him back at 5-3.  It was a very important game because first I had made the break and then he broke me back, then I broke him back, so it was three breaks in a row.  And it was a very important moment and important not to lose the first set, not to let him win this first set, because he had twice the breaks, so it was a decisive moment.
