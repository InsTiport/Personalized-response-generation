GREG SHARKO:  Sebastien advances to his first ATP Tour final, and he's the first Frenchman ever to reach the Lipton final in its 15-year history.  He'll be taking on Richard Krajicek.  They played once before last year. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  In Marseille. 


Q.  In this something that has sunk in yet or is it kind of a dream?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, it's like a dream, you know.  I play my best tennis.  I play some very great player.  I going to play my first final on the Tour, it's on a Super 9, it's wonderful for me.  It's a dream. 


Q.  Why do you think you have come through the way you have?  I mean, you had a good tournament in Europe before you came here, but just the last few weeks. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  You know, I practice a lot in winter.  I played well at the beginning of the year.  I won a few matches.  I won a Challenger.  I came here with confidence.  I don't know why I play very well now, but I'm very happy to play good on the Super 9. 


Q.  Who have been the players that you admired when you were playing as a youngster?  Whose style did you like?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Stefan Edberg.  I don't play like him (laughter).  He was my favorite player.


Q.  Who do you think you play like the most, among the top players?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Maybe like Michael Chang, you know, because I'm smaller like him.  Maybe I'm playing like him.  I don't know.


Q.  Yet you come to the net more. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah, I try.  I try. 


Q.  Krajicek has been in pretty impressive form. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  I watch his semi against Enqvist.  He played a great tennis.  He played also all right against Pete Sampras.  He's in confidence.  He's playing very well.  It's going to be a tough match for me on Saturday.


Q.  Is this the toughest match you would have ever played in your career?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Against Krajicek? 


Q.  Yes. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I twist my ankle against him.


Q.  No, because this is a final, because Krajicek is playing so well. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  I don't know.  Maybe I will be  -- it will be more difficult for me to play against him in final than a first round.  But I don't have to think it's a final, so I going to play without pressure. 


Q.  You don't appear to be a player that gets nervous. 

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  No, not really.  I have one day off.  It will be very good for me.


Q.  I was in the restaurant last night.  They gave you a big welcome.  You're in a final.  What do you think will happen after that?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  We'll go there now.  We'll are have a dinner at Le Bouchon.  It was very nice yesterday night.  It will be great tonight.


Q.  Were you surprised to hear the French cheers tonight?

SEBASTIEN GROSJEAN:  Yeah.  They support me.  It's very nice from them.  When you are on the court, it's very nice to see some French people to support you.
