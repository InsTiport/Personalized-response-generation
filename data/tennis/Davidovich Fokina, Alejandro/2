7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: May I present this year's 2017 singles boys champion.  Questions, please.
Q. That was a real slugfest in the opening set.  What was the difference?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: In the first set?
Q. Yes.
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Well, we play very good both.  And was very tough for both to play with the return.  We serve very good today.
In the tiebreak, I think I push more tie game.  I push him more to attack to him.
Well, I was thinking, Okay, you win now or you will go to a third set or you will lose second set.
I was thinking, Okay, first set, you have to win the tiebreak, the first two points, to make more comfortable with me.  And was very, very good for me.
Q. He threw a few bombs at you, 135 mile-an-hour serve?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Yeah.  Later on I was talking with him.  I say, Man, you serve so hard, I can't see the ball.  Was like I can do Karlovic.  I don't know what he's doing with his serve.
But he play really well with his serve.  Was the tiebreak decision.
Q. Did he weaken in the second set?  Did he tire?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Him?
Q. Yes.
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Well, he start with the physio in 2-1 or 3-2, I don't remember.  I think we play the same level.  Well, I think I push more my mind to win this set and don't go to a third set.
Was very tough.  Was very hard, too much flat shots, too many flat shots.  Then was very tough to play against him.
Q. What was the atmosphere like when you walked out?  Were you nervous with the huge crowd?  Was it what you expected?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: No, well, I was thinking, Okay, I will not think about that.  I will think, I want to win this.  I want to show to the people who I am, that I want to play tennis, professional tennis.  I want to show them what I want to do with my life.
I was thinking, Okay, you be yourself, and just enjoy.
Q. How did you prepare for grass this year different from last year?  Last year you didn't do so well in the opening rounds.  Did you prepare differently, practice?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Well, I didn't practice.  I two days' practice in grass (smiling).  I was, Okay, let's try.
But I was thinking, I feeled very good the grass this year.  No more fall downs like last year.  That was too many.  Was very funny because we prepared two days only for the grass to the tournament.
Okay, first match, Colombian guy, very good.  He did very well in Roehampton.  I was okay with my serve.  Just volleys, just that.  Nothing special.
Q. You don't adjust in any way from clay?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: I had two weeks in hard court before Wimbledon.  Then is a little bit more the same with the hard.  Not the same, but no is like clay.
I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.
Q. Can you tell us more about you, how you started playing tennis, why it's your favorite sport.
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Okay, I start with two years old.  I compete five years.  I was training four, five years to compete.
Can you repeat?
Q. How did you start?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: I start with my father in the beach, in the sand courts in my city.  Was my father who push me to play tennis.  Later when I have five years or six years, I was with my first coach.
I was, like, doing something more with my results.  That's it.  I don't know.  I was two years old, then I don't know what I am doing.  But I'm now here.  I'm very happy to win.
Q. Were you watching somebody in particular when you were growing up?  Would you like to do the same as Federer or...
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: When I was five years or six years, Federer won Wimbledon.  I saw the match.  Somebody calls me, Who is your prefer player, favorite player?
I cry with Roger when he won the Grand Slam.  Then now more is more Djokovic.  I look more Djokovic, his game.  But I think I start with Federer to pushing me to play tennis.
Q. Now you're a Grand Slam champion.  Do you think Novak has to agree to have a practice with you?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Who, Novak?
Q. Yes.
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: No, I don't know.  Ask him.  For me will be, like, one honor to practice with him.  If we can to meet, to practice, is fun.  If we can, is very good for me.
Q. You're the first boys champion at Wimbledon from Spain in 50 years, Manuel Orantes.  Can you talk about how that feels.
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: In Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, You make history, you make history.  But I don't want to think that because, who knows, the next generation could be a new champion in Wimbledon from Spain.
But now I'm very happy to be the second junior championship of Wimbledon.  Like, I'm in shock.  I'm not thinking about that I win.  I don't have time to realize.
Q. Is being No. 1 in the world of juniors important to you?  Will you play the US Open?
ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA: Well, I don't know what I will do now because I think we will not planned that I will win Wimbledon.  Now I don't know if I will play more futures or I will play more juniors to US Open.  I don't know.
I want to be I think No. 1 on the juniors.  You are No. 1 in juniors, you want it, but I don't know.  I have to talk with my coach and let's see.
