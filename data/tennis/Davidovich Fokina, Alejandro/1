  A. DAVIDOVICH FOKINA /K. Khachanov
 6-3, 2-6, 6-2
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I wanted to find out, your match was moved from the central court over to a smaller court.  Did that make any difference to you in terms of playing conditions or the atmosphere?
 ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA:   Yeah.  The Court 1 is faster than I would like, okay, then I have to be more focused in my return, because he's a great server.  I was thinking, okay, if I play in the center court it will be slower and I can have more chances to return.
 But I think I did well to win Court 1.
 Q. Why do you think you won tonight?  Why were you the better player out there?
 ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA:   Well, I'm playing very well in the baseline.  I think I'm very solid there.
 I think it's my point.  When I move fast I think I am doing my game very good.  And I stay a lot better and better and improving every day, and that's it.
 Q. Does this win over a top-20 player like Khachanov give you a lot of confidence going forward?
 ALEJANDRO DAVIDOVICH FOKINA:   Yeah, it's my second win against one top-20 and my first win in Masters 1000.  I'm very happy.  Feel every day better.
 I'm with so much confidence.
