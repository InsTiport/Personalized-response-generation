S. TRAVAGLIA/H. Hurkacz
3-6, 6-3, 7-5
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. That was a very close and a very good win for you out there today.  What worked well for you out there?
STEFANO TRAVAGLIA:   It was a really complicated day because two matches in one day, matches like at that level.  It was really tough, but I think I adapted very good, and I played my best tennis today, more in the third set against Hurkacz.  But thinking for tomorrow, I hope to play like this.
