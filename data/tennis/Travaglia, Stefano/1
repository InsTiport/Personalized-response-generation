J. SINNER/S. Travaglia
7-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Bad luck on today's result; however, congratulations on a wonderful effort during the week.  How do you assess your performance today because it was a very close match between yourself and Jannik Sinner?
STEFANO TRAVAGLIA:   Yeah, first of all, it was a really good week, so I'm really happy to reach that results.  Unfortunately today I didn't play so good because there was a lot of things, maybe tired, maybe tension for the first finals, but even was a really good match.  I can improve from -- I can take the positive things from this final, and tomorrow is another day, and I'll be focused for first round of the Australian Open.
Q. I wanted to ask how proud are you just about this week and what does it give you for your confidence moving forward?
STEFANO TRAVAGLIA:   Yeah, this week was really, really tough because a lot of difficult conditions.  One day they stopped the matches, so we have to play twice in one day, and it's not easy.  It's different to play five sets.  We play two sets in the morning, three sets in the evening, so I was really tired.  First match on Monday I played 3 hours, 20 minutes.  It was a very difficult week, but I'm really happy because I reached my first final, first ATP final.  Unfortunately today I lose, but I'm really happy and for sure that gives me confidence for looking forward and for play tomorrow first match of Australian Open.
