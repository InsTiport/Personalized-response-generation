6-7, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Talk us through your match.
STEFANO TRAVAGLIA:   Yes, my match today was really strong from the beginning and a totally different match from the first match that I played on Monday.  So I have adapted, there was different condition.  Monday it was windy and colder than today.  Today is sunny and hot, so different player.  But I think I feeling good from the beginning and I use a lot of my service to stay on the match, in the match.  I think that was the key to win it, because I did not return so good, but I was every time up with the score for my serve, because I was serving really good -- 14 aces, I think -- and a good percent of the first serves.
So I think the key was my serve and my mind because I was every time focused even if I was down on the tiebreak on the second set and on the third.  But I'm really happy and I will be focused for tomorrow.
