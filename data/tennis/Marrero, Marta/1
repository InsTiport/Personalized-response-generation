Q. Would it be fair to say that this was not one of your better performances of your career? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: I think that I don't play very good game today, but it's okay.  
 
Q. Nervous? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: Yeah, little bit. Is hard to play with something like Serena. It's difficult to play with someone like Serena, you know.  
 
Q. Did you at all think that she hasn't played in eight months, maybe she's not at her best so you could take confidence from that? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: I think just that she play very good today.  
 
Q. How did you prepare for this match? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: I just talk with my coach and he say me that I have to play like relaxing, I no have nothing to lose. But I was so nervous today on the court.  
 
Q. You played so well. Playing her in the first round, how tough was that to get ready for? You have to play Serena on Stadium Court. Was that tough? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: Yeah, it was difficult to play on this court. Also today was so windy, but it's okay (smiling).  
 
Q. Did you feel like you had nothing to lose? Your coach said that, but... 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: I don't feel this today (smiling). Was nervous, yeah.  
 
Q. What was your general impression of Serena? You've seen her play, of course, before. But being on the same court, what was your feeling? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: I think that she did a good match today, and she serve very well today.  
 
Q. Have you played against anybody that served that fast? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: No (smiling).  
 
Q. When you saw the draw, what did you think? "Why me?" 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: (Laughing). No, I want to play with, you know... It's good to play with some like her, you know. It's good experience.  
 
Q. Good experience? 
 
 MARTA MARRERO: Uh-hmm (smiling).
