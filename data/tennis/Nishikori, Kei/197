  K. NISHIKORI/P. Andujar6-4, 6-1 (ret.)THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. How do you feel about your confidence for advancing in this tournament?  And did you know about Leonardo Mayer, who could be your next opponent?KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's been a good two matches.  It's unfortunate for Pablo today, but I have been playing well; had good two sets today. Yeah, Leo, we played in Wimbledon I think last year.  I know he has big serve and big forehand and big strokes, so he's very dangerous player. Yeah, we see who wins today and we'll check out some tactics tomorrow.Q. Would you prefer to play best-of-three sets instead best-of-five sets?  I don't know if you know what happened yesterday with Wawrinka.  There was one person in the crowd who was talking all the time, and he asked him to shut up.  Do you think this tournament is too loud?KEI NISHIKORI: Not really.  Maybe in that case, you know, I might get, you know, a little bit stressed, too.  But for now, for me, I have good crowd, good support from all the Japanese people and also, I don't know, American or different countries, too. So it's very fun to play here.  I always enjoy coming here.  Crowd gets, you know, very, you know, happy sometimes. But it's fun.  It's different than other Grand Slams.  It's good to have something like this.Q. What about best-of-five sets or best-of-three sets?KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I don't care.  You know, the Grand Slam is five sets.  I don't have any choice. You know, I think I have good enough to play five sets, you know, good.  Physically I'm strong.  You know, I don't care if it's three or five.
