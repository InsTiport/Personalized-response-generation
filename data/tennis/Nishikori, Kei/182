K. NISHIKORI/B. Tomic
  6‑0, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That was a very impressive first set.   Tell us about it. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Singles?   Doubles? 

Q.   Yeah, singles. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I mean, I took first couple games really well.   Return well.   Same time I was aggressive after the return and serve.
Looked like he kind of gave up last couple games, but he start a little better serve.   I was get a little bit tight and had a couple easy mistakes, but overall I don't think he has any break points with my serve.
So I was serving really well.   I think it was good match for me. 

Q.   You stepped it up a level from the second round?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it was better than first match.   For sure I was more confident and comfortable playing on this court. 
You know, it was different player.   Today there was more rally and I was able to hit more balls with my groundstrokes.   That's what I want to do, you know, if it's first couple match of the year.   So I think it was great matchup against Tomic today.

Q.   A very different match again for the semifinal. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's going to be tough.   It was great match today against Sam and Raonic.   We played a lot of times already.   Last year we played like four, five times.   We know each other, so it's going to be tough match.
