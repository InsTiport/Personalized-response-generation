 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. We have the chance of talking virtually when you are playing Dubai Duty Free Championship to play four matches there.  I'd like to know the difference between the matches that you played there in Dubai and here in Miami regarding the conditions, the climate conditions here in Miami.  It's really, really tough to play, I think?
 KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I would say here is very slow, the court surface, and the balls are heavy so it's tough to hit the winner here.
 Very windy and humid, very hot.  I think I haven't played long time with this kind of weather.  Not easy.
 But, well, I think we both having tough time on the court.  We had many long rallies, and many deuces, two hours and 50 minutes' match.  It was tough, very tough.  Physically and mentally, too, because it was windy, too.
 Q. Tell us about the expectations of the tournament.
 KEI NISHIKORI:   The tournament?  This tournament?
 Q. Yes.
 KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.  It's a great tournament, of course.  I live very close from here, so I feel like home.
 Only thing is the weather is very sticky, like very heavy and very humid.  Humidity is very high.  I think that makes a little bit tough playing here.  And also in slower conditions you have to play many long points and long rallies.  That's the only tough things.
 But everything else is good.  Good hotel.  Many courts here.  Very easy to being here.
