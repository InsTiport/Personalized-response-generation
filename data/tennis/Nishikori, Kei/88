R. FEDERER/K. Nishikori
6-7, 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How were you feeling physically during the match?  How does it feel overall, the loss?
KEI NISHIKORI: Physically I'm okay.  Yeah, really disappointed to lose like this.  Especially started really well.  I miss some chance from 5-2.  You know, I think I let him come back little bit.
Well, he was playing good tennis, I think, especially in the middle, second and third sets.  I maybe had some chance in fifth set, you know, to came back in the match, but he was way too strong.
Q. Do you feel he's playing any differently since he's come back than he was in the previous matches you played against him?
KEI NISHIKORI: No, not really.  Still playing aggressive.  He was serving really well today.  I don't know.  I don't think it was much different.  I feel like he was playing good tennis again.
