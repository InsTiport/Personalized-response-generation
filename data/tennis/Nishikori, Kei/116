K. NISHIKORI/R. Ram
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How pleased are you with the way you played today?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think it was good.  First set played really good tennis, and second set I think he started play more aggressive and serve and return really well.
I had some tough time, especially Love-40 I had -- I think it was 3-2 or something, I don't remember, but, you know, there were some tough games.  But, I mean, overall played good tennis.  This score shows, you know, dominating a little bit.
It was good match today.
Q. Physically you feel fine?  You must have been a little bit concerned starting the tournament with your problems.
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I think it's good.  Well, still not maybe 100% yet but feeling pretty strong.  I mean, first match from three weeks, three or four weeks ago.  I mean, never easy but feeling pretty good.  Well, we'll have to see after couple more matches, but right now I feel good.
Q. Doesn't get worse when you play?
KEI NISHIKORI: No.
Q. You could play Karlovic in the next round or Dimitrov.  Everybody is having trouble against him lately.  He's playing fantastic.  I don't know how much you have played him.  What's the key if you do play against him?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  He's been playing really well these months, even on grass.  On hard court he's beating Cilic straight sets.  So that's something that shows, you know, he's playing great.
Well, yeah, return is going to be really key.  If I can step up, his second serve, you know, and first serve sometimes you have to let go sometimes.  And also my service game.  You know, I think I have to concentrate more than anybody in my service game.
And, well, yeah, Dimi is playing good tennis, too.  We will see who's gonna win.
