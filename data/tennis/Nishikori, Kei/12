6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What will be your key to beat Federer?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I'm sure that I have to play good tennis to beat Roger, because he's best player on the grass.  I think he seems to be playing good this week, last two weeks, so...
I'm sure it's going to be tough, but I feel like I am very confident this week, playing good tennis, even though today I think Kukushkin is not easy player on grass.  He was playing good tennis.  I did really well to manage, you know, his tennis.
And, yeah, I'm happy to playing Roger now because I think I'm in good shape now.  I know it's not going to be easy, but I will enjoy for sure.
