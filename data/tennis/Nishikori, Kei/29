THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you feel about that point in the tiebreaker, taking up so much attention from such a marathon match?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, that was important point, too, but, I mean, you should ask how I came back from two sets down.  That was only one point.
I mean, maybe affect him, but, you know, he took some time and maybe it could affect me.  I mean, I'm really glad how I came back.  Yeah, I don't even know how I come back but very happy to win today.
Q. Two times in five-set tiebreakers.  Are you glad they have been introduced in Australia now?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, maybe.  Getting used to this super-tiebreak.  And, I mean, both times I came back from, you know, break down.  Yeah, happy to be finished like that.  You know, there was many tough moments.
Yeah, I just tried to fight through every point, and luckily I got five points in a row last tiebreak.
Q. Is that an illustration of your maturity as a player, that you can block something like that episode out of your head and win all those points in a row to finish off a match like that?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, very unusual to win five points in a row.  I think played really great points last two points of his service game.  I was very focused.  I was there and finish with my serve, you know.  So everything was working well in the fifth set.
Q. Can you describe what was in your mind during the break after the second set?
KEI NISHIKORI: I mean, of course I was really disappointed.  I should win the first set.  I had so many chances first set.
And second set, I mean, he was playing better.  Credit to him, but I just tried to play good tennis again.  I wasn't thinking too much, and I just tried to play one game at a time.
Maybe I change my tennis and a little bit of tactics, but yeah, started getting more confidence from the third set and start playing better.
