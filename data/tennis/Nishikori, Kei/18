6-2, 6-7, 6-2, 6-7, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Benoit Paire said you should have win in three or four sets, but he should have win in five.  Are you agree with that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I mean, yes.  Yes.  But, I mean, it's happen to be play five sets, but -- I mean, if I look back, yes, but I'm just happy to win today.   
He almost had the match, you know, serving for the match, 5-3, and I'm just happy that way I coming back from 5-3, I think I played, start playing much better from 5-3, playing more aggressive, using my forehand.   
You know, not easy after losing especially fourth set 7-6.  I had match point, and I could win in four sets, but somehow I lost the set.   
Yeah, mentally not easy after that tiebreak.   
 Q.  What do you think about the match against Rafa in quarterfinals?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, not gonna be easy.  He's the best player on the clay.  Yeah, but I try to do my best.   
 Q.  Do you feel lucky to have win today against Benoit?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Lucky?   
 Q.  Lucky.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Maybe, yes (smiling).
