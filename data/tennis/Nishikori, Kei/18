D. SCHWARTZMAN/K. Nishikori
6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had beaten Diego, 3-0 before today.  What was different about him today?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, obviously he was playing good.  That's for sure.  Credit to him that he able to maintain his level first set and second set.  Maybe he drop his level from 5-0.
If I could get 5-4 game, maybe things change.  But he was playing aggressive, hitting good backhand and forehand, too.  He came in very well.  Yeah, he was playing a little bit little more aggressive.
Q. How are you feeling overall about your clay court season heading into Roland Garros?
KEI NISHIKORI: It's been okay.  Maybe not the best result I wanted.  Yesterday last two matches was good.  Couldn't maintain my level today.  But, yeah, now everybody is playing well and it's getting tougher.  Not easy to play well every tournament.
I think I'm getting better every tournament from Barcelona.  Yeah, looking forward to play French.
