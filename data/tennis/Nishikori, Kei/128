K. NISHIKORI/R. Gasquet
6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I think you lost to Richard something like six times in a row and now you've beaten him twice and won very well.  What's the biggest change?
KEI NISHIKORI: That was I think I played two years ago last time and I played last week, too, but on clay I think it's a little bit different condition, and I think it's a little bit better for me, you know, to play on clay because I have more time and I can play aggressive and also have good defense on clay.
So obviously I think I'm being different player than last few years ago, and I have good tactics before the match, you know.  And last week and today, too.  I think that's the biggest difference.
Q. It's obviously a busy time of the season, very demanding with big events back to back.  How are you feeling energy-wise, fitness-wise?
KEI NISHIKORI: Today was good.  I felt a lot of energy.  I had a good rest yesterday.  Yeah, these two weeks are not easy, especially I did semifinal last week and coming here Sunday.  So not easy, but I try to fight one more week before French Open.
Q. Were you expecting to face Roger in the next round?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I mean, I was waiting for, but I think Thiem is also really tough player on clay.  He won a title this year on clay, I think.  So, you know, really tough player.  Yeah, I try to prepare well for tomorrow.
Q. Do you know Doi?  She's in the quarterfinals, too.
KEI NISHIKORI: Oh, she won?
Q. What about can you say about her?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, she's been playing really well this year, I think.  She's a lefty and good forehand, she has.
Yeah, it's good to see especially on clay  she's been playing well.  Yeah, hope she can do well these tournaments.
