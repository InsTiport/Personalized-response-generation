R. BAUTISTA AGUT/K. Nishikori
6-4, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you put today's loss more down to your opponent playing well or you not playing well?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think both.  I couldn't maintain my level high enough, you know, to beat Bautista today.  I think he served well every set.  Was really tough time having my return game.
I had many chance, but I think he played well the important points.  Yeah, I think mix of both.
Q. Do you think you could have been more aggressive?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.
Q. Would it be fair to say that grass is your least favorite surface to play on?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  It's not easy.  I don't have, you know, good result on grass.  Yeah, got to work on every year.
