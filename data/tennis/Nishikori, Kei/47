THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the match?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I thought I started really well, played very aggressive.  I thought I was dominating from the baseline.  Everything worked well first set.
Second, he started pretty good.  I mean, second game he took some risk.  You know, he was playing better.  I was not struggling, but there were many rallies.  I made some unforced errors, you know, got little bit tight, tight game.
Well, unfortunately it finish for him.  We always battle.  Play great match all the time.  So he's, like, my rival.  It's always fun to play against him.
It's sad to finish like that.  I mean, for me, there's many positive things.  So happy to going through.
Q. This result is unexpected for you?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  Suddenly it came.  He was up, the score.  I mean, he almost had second set.  I wasn't expect it.
