THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You had a medical timeout for your ankle.   Is it okay?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's good.   
   
 Q.   You play either Ferrer or Baghdatis next.   You have a winning record against Ferrer but a losing record against Marcos.   Your thoughts on either?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I mean, both is going to be tough opponent.   Ferrer is playing well.   He's always, you know, tough to play.   He gets every ball and not easy to beat.   But, you know, I beat him before.   
Yeah, Marcos is also playing well.   You know, we were in same tournament, Brisbane.   I saw him playing well.   He beat my friends two days ago.   
Yeah, it's gonna be tough.   
   
 Q.   Nice to get revenge?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I hope so (smiling).   
   
 Q.   There's a few Japanese players doing well this year.   Is there a lot of excitement back home?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's good for Japanese tennis, for sure.   And I'm more happy that, yeah, Kimiko is doing well.   He [sic] just beat second seed doubles.   That's amazing how much she can play.   
But, yeah, I mean, everything makes me, you know, happy, too.   And I'm one of them, too.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel your level of performance was today, especially at a point in time in the tournament where you want to be building?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I think I played well that important games.   It wasn't easy to play today with the winds.   The weather was nice.  
But, yeah, like the last couple games played really well and more confidence coming to play.   
So I think I'm in good shape.
