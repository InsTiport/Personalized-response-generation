THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   Talk about how you're feeling.   We saw you get treatment on your back during the match.   Also, was this just a lot of tennis in the last two weeks?   Were you feeling a little run down? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's not like any big injury, but I was feeling my hip a lot and also my back.   It's been hurting these last couple matches, maybe two or three matches in Tokyo, too.   But I was keep fighting and end up winning the tournament. 
But today I couldn't really run the ball everything.   Also he played really well.   Couldn't really play my best tennis today. 

Q.   What did Jack do particularly well tonight?
KEI NISHIKORI:   For sure he served really well.   I usually able to return and get more chance on my return game.   But today I think there was almost no breakpoints for me. 
Also he gets a lot of balls back.   He has great footwork.   He has big forehand.   He played really good today. 

Q.   What is your game plan now?   Will you go back to Japan, back to the States, Europe? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Go back to States, try to get my body fresh again.   I've been playing a lot of tennis from US Open.   So try to recover well.   Yeah, two more tournaments coming up.   I hope I can make London. 
I think important is I been playing well.   So try to get fresh again, physically get strong, and hopefully I can make London. 

Q.   You're going to play Bercy?   You're not playing any tournaments before Bercy?
KEI NISHIKORI:   No, Valencia.
