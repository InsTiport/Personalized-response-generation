5-7, 6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Looked like a really tough match today.  What made the difference, do you think?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, after first set I tried to step in a little more, and I think in the first set I wasn't aggressive enough to keep him move, you know, side to side.
Yeah, I think second and third I start hitting much better backhand, start playing angle, down the line, and everything worked well after first set.
Q. You come here off semifinals last week.  How confident do you feel?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I mean, tennis-wise I'm happy what I'm doing.  I think I'm serving well, return well.  You know, just little things, you know, to make some adjustment to get little more better on clay.
Yeah, if I can keep it up, I think I will have a good chance here.
Q. What do you like more in Rome?  You visit the city?
KEI NISHIKORI: Maybe I do after the tournament, but during the tournament I usually don't do too much.  I just try to focus on my matches.
