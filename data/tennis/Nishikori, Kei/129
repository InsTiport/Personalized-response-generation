N. DJOKOVIC/K. Nishikori   
2-6, 6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are the emotions after playing a match like that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I mean, right now just very shamed to lose.  There was only few points in the tiebreak, so, yeah, really disappointed.   
 Q.  Could you tell us what do you think made a difference tonight?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think I was playing really good tennis in the first set.  I was playing aggressive.  I think I stopped doing that in second set.  Also, he start playing better, too.   
Yeah, in the third I think I could be little better, and he was giving me a lot of pressure and I wasn't making much first serve like these other matches.  So that was costing me a lot of points.   
Well, I think in tiebreak I made too many unforced errors and, like, three in a row from 3-All.  So that was the biggest mistake I had today.   
 Q.  Really great match.  Fantastic effort.  Djokovic talked about maybe having more experience on the very key points, on the very crucial points.  Can you talk about how he plays on those key points?  Is he more conservative?  Is he more aggressive?  How is he able to play so well on those?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think a little bit of both:  aggressive and also consistent.  He's not going to give me easy points in important points, so that's, I think -- he always does well.  All the top players does.   
Maybe, you know, there was couple points that I could be little more focus, you know, tried to make more balls on the court.   
Yeah, maybe I just need more experience, but that's always -- he does well in the important points.
