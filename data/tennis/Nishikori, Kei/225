  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You've been knocking on the door of the top 10 for a while.   What are your goals for the year?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, hopefully I can finish top 10.   Something trying to do it this year.   I'm getting close, but I feel it's something I have a lot of things to work on more.   
I feel still long way to be top 10.   But, yeah, something I'm trying to work on it.  
   
 Q.   Is a Grand Slam semifinal next on your agenda?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   For sure, yeah.   To get to a quarterfinal or semifinal, that's next goal.   Yes, something I have never done before.   
But I have to beat top four guys to get semis.   Yeah, but if I can do it, it would be great.   
   
 Q.   Nick Bollettieri said you had the shots to beat anybody in the world.   He also compared you to Rios.   What would you say to that?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I'm very happy to hear that.   Of course, Rios was one of the most talented player in the history.   
I'm glad to hear that, you know.   
   
 Q.   How was your preparation coming into Wimbledon?   Can you talk me through that, what you've been doing.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, played couple matches yesterday and day before, you know, against Murray and Nadal.   I think it was good preparation for next week.   
Played Halle.   I lost the first match, but I had a good week practice of here this week.   
I think it's getting better.
