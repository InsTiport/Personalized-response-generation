THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did do you explain that?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, he played good, I think.  I didn't play perfect today, but I think he was playing good serves.  Yeah, better than I thought.
Q. At the end of the first and second sets, you had leads in both.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I mean, with this wind and this surface, not easy.  I mean, of course, I didn't serve well when I wanted to.  I mean, it happens.  With these conditions, it's never easy.
I think he really played well in the important games.
Q. What do you think you didn't do so well today that you normally do?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think just the serve.  I didn't make much first serves when I wanted to.  Yeah, that cost me some important points.  But, yeah, he played well today.
Q. What is going to be next for you as far as the season goes?  Any reason to be worried?
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I try to find some reason why I lost today.  It's too early.  I try to fix little bit.  I mean, I didn't play really bad.  I just need to fix something and ready for Indian Wells.
Q. What do you tell yourself when you're up 4-0, the guy comes back, you're forced to close it out at 7-5?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it was tough situation.  Usually don't happen much.  But up two breaks, he came back from 5-2.  I just tried to focus my serve.  I mean, things got better after 5-All.  I just tried to be little positive.
Q. There's no health or injury issue?
KEI NISHIKORI: No.
