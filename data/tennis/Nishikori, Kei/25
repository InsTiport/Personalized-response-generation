THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What did you think was the difference in the match today?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I mean, he definitely raise his level second and third.  He start playing more solid from the baseline.  He wasn't missing much like first set.  He served well in the end.   
Maybe I didn't play quite my best today.  Yeah, credit to him today.   
 Q.  This time last year you were still coming back, then you had the great end of the year, top 10.  Does this bother you at all or are you still confident from all of those wins you got at the end of the year?  
KEI NISHIKORI: It's obviously tough loss from last week, not playing quite best.  But, I mean, I'm not playing bad or terrible.  I try to keep head up.  Clay court season is coming.  It's completely new season.   
I try to have good practice, two more weeks, and be ready for Monte-Carlo.
