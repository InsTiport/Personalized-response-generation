THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What do you think happened the during the game that you can't win?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I think I really had one bad game at 5‑4.   I think until then I was playing better.   I think I was, you know, dominating the strokes.   I mean, he was hitting good serves, but, you know, I had all the chances. 
Yeah, but just one bad game at 5‑4.   I think that's all that matters today's match.
