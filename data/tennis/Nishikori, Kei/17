K. NISHIKORI/Q. Halys
6-2, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you give us your thoughts on your performance today?  And also, what will it take for you to do well at Roland Garros here this year?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I thought I played good tennis today.  Started really well, winning two sets easy.  I think third set he start playing a little bit different, playing little more aggressive, and he was making more than first and second set.
But, yeah, many up and downs, maybe a little bit for him.  Maybe I started, you know, hit a little bit short and he was stepping up a little bit.  But last couple games I started playing better, using my forehand and playing aggressive again.
Yeah, everything was good today.  Very happy with my performance today.
Q. Congratulations on your victory today.  I hope you don't mind if I ask about your successful relationship with your coach.  I know it has been several years, but could you explain how you have most benefited from working with Michael Chang.  And particularly given his anniversary of winning here 30 years ago, if he gives you anything special on the clay?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, he's given me so many great things that helps me to raise my level, and it's been I think five, six years now with him.
Always, always he giving me good motivation and good little things that, you know, something I'm missing.
And also, yeah, it's very, very still amazing that he won this title when he was 17.  That's I don't think something is gonna happen in the future.  Very happy for him.  And, yeah, happy working with him and Dante.
