K. NISHIKORI/A. Kuznetsov   
6-3, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  This is a fast win for you.  Do you think you play better from the first match?  Tell us about the match.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I think today was a much tough opponent.  He started very good hitting inside of the baseline, and I know he hits really well in the flat, both sides.  After 3-1 down I tried to change it up a little bit and start working better.   
Second and third I think I played pretty good tennis.  Happy with my tennis today.
