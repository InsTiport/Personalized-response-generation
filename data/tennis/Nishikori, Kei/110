THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk about how happy you are with your game against Ivo.  Did Ivo seem a little off today or were you just ready for him?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I just, you know, focus my tennis.  Today I return really well.  That's for sure help my game today.  Able to get the break, you know, first and second set early.  So that makes me a little more relax.   
And, yeah, my serve was much better today.  Able to hit a lot of first serve in.  Third set, it was a little bit tight in the end.  But, yeah, really good focus today.  Happy with my win today.   
 Q.  For a big server like Ivo, did you work on your return?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's never easy, someone serving like Ivo.  You know, great first serve, and second serve too.  It's never easy to return those kind of serves.   
I mean, I practiced little bit yesterday.  But, you know, I tried to stay down.  I been returning well, so that's also helping today's game, too.  Yeah, especially today I think play one of the best match, serve, return, everything, groundstrokes.  So was good match.
