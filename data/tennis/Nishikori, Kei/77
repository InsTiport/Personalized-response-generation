THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  What's your assessment of your performance?  How far do you think you can go here at Roland Garros?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, today was tough match.  I think he played well at certain moments.  I think in third and fourth set I start playing little better.   
Yeah, feeling pretty good.  I mean, wasn't perfect match, but still, I think for first match, it was good start of the tournament.   
 Q.  For the next round, you will play against Jeremy Chardy.  A few minutes ago he said that when you were young he has beaten you, and now it's the reverse, no?  What do you think about Jeremy?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Oh, Jeremy, I think we play many times.  He has great serve, big forehands, very aggressive player.  I think always, you know, dangerous player, you know, to play.  And especially he's home here  so not easy.   
So, yeah, I try to prepare well tomorrow and ready for the match.   
 Q.  Have you got a goal for this Roland Garros in terms of results?  Do you have a minimum result as a target or not?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I mean, always try to win the tournament, whole thing.  You know, I think always when you play a Grand Slam that's what you're playing for.  Try to win the whole thing.   
 Q.  Semifinals, if you stop there, you are satisfied or depends or disappointed?  
 A. Well, if I lose, I will get disappointed, anyway, so...(smiling).   
 Q.  You had some problems with your wrist earlier this year.  How is that feeling now?  Is that completely healed and feeling good when you play?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I think so.  Feeling okay after playing, you know, four sets today.   
Yeah, after Madrid, Rome, it's getting much better.  Physically I'm feeling strong again, so I hope it's not coming back, because, you know, there is chance to come back inflamed again.  So I try to take care all the time and, yeah, hopefully will stay healthy.
