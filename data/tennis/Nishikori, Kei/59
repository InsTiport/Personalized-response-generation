THE MODERATOR: Do we have any questions in English to start out with?
Q. Kei, good start in the first set.  But in the second and third set, you seems a little bit tired.  Normally, you increase your level.  And you have made many unforced errors.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I think I played great tennis in the first set, playing aggressive.  And he started --  I think he started to change his tactics, and he was playing much better than first.
