K. NISHIKORI/G. Dimitrov
7-5, 7-5
Q. Kei, for you, obviously last year you had your ups and downs, but you started to get towards this part of tournaments towards the end of the season.  What changes about the tennis when you're in the quarterfinals, semifinals, finals for you?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I'm just very happy that I started with these tournaments, and I think I've been playing really well these last two matches, and I thought I had a good preparation the last three weeks.  And yeah, today was much even better than first match, and yeah, hopefully I can keep going.  Jeremy is tough opponent.  I think especially on this surface he can be more dangerous.  So I will try to be more focused next one and hope I can get a title this week.
Q. He is obviously dangerous no matter what.  He's been around for a while.  But you've beaten him the last five times that you've played.  What works well for you against his tennis?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think it's going to be a key my return.  He has great serve.  Obviously very aggressive player, big forehand.  So hopefully I can make as many balls as I can.  And I think I've been serving really well.  Today was one of the best service games I had last couple years.  Serve and return is going to be the key, I think.
Q. Lastly, you mentioned this on the court and you just said it here, too, that obviously you want to win a title no matter what event you play in, but you've said it earlier.  Are you aware that you want to sort of snap that streak for yourself and hoist a trophy again?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I think it's going to come some day soon.  I mean last year I had many great results, and maybe I didn't get a title, but able to finish Top 10.  And I mean sometimes that's not the most important thing, you know.  But I mean hopefully I can get the title sometimes.  But, yeah, I feel like I've been playing well this week, so I try to focus every match, and yeah, hope I can do well the last two more matches.
