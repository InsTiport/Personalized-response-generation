THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How frustrating was that, to let the lead slip away?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's not easy, you know, after losing five set.   It was really close match.   
He raise his level I think in the fourth and fifth set.   He didn't give me much unforced errors, served well, so I didn't have much chance to break him.   That's the reason I lost today.   
   
 Q.   You had a couple of timeouts for treatment for the pain on your back.   How bad was the pain?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it was really tight, my hip and my back, you know.   It's on grass, so you have to stay low all the time.   
But it gets tired, of course.   Yeah, it was okay.   
   
 Q.   Was the injury something that happened during the game or were you already feeling it before the start of the match?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I had it before.   
   
 Q.   How long have you had it for?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Few days after first match.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you were playing in some way less than 100%?   How badly was it affecting you?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   No, didn't affect much.   I was playing well, so, you know, didn't affect.   
   
 Q.   Would it have any impact on your schedule now?   Will you have to miss any time?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   No.   Should be okay.   I have one month after this just train and get healthy again, you know, stay strong for the U.S. series.   
   
 Q.   What will your next tournament be?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Washington.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you can make a big impact on the hard courts?
