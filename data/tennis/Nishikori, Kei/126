6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you feel after this victory?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I mean, first of all, very happy.  Tough, tough five sets.  He start playing much better third and fourth, and even first couple games in final set, too.   
So it wasn't easy, but very happy to win.   
 Q.  What do you think made the difference in the fifth set?  You didn't look very nervous.  Were you nervous?  What do you think?  It was a tough fight, as you said.  What made the difference, do you think?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think I start hitting much better, deep, and step in little more.  I think third and fourth I let him using his forehand too much.  Also, I have to say, he was playing good tennis.  Even the final set, too.   
Like I said, it wasn't easy to pick up my rhythm again.  I think I start doing after 2-All, breaking his service game, and I got a little more relaxed in the serve, winning little more.  Everything start working better after 2-All game.   
 Q.  Your next opponent is Richard Gasquet.  What do you think of your next match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, we have been playing a lot, two times already, Madrid and Rome.  You know, I tried to prepare well.  First of all, I have to recover well from today's match.   
Well, he's from here, so, you know, not easy.  But, you know, have a good feeling against Richard, especially winning last two matches.  So tried to play good tennis.   
 Q.  Verdasco said in his press conference, Court No. 1 is a little bit fast.  Are you agreed with that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, could be.  I mean, it was sunny, too.  I felt a little bit small.  You know, sometimes I want to go back a little more.  But small -- it's a bit smaller than other, these two courts.  Yeah, could be a little bit faster, too.
