S. QUERREY/K. Nishikori
  2‑6, 6‑1, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You were in control early on, completely in control.   I noticed you had a medical timeout.   Then you missed an overhead in the second.   First of all, what was the problem?   Why did you need the medical timeout?   Can you talk me through the match afterwards. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   It was my ankle, my right ankle.   It was bothering me from last week, whole week.   Even yesterday was hurting.   But I play through.   Was already hurting during first set.   So I took medical. 
I tried to play, but he had a good serve.   I broke him first in third set, but couldn't finish the match.   It's disappointing, but I was close to win with this injury.   Nothing I can do. 

Q.   Looking forward, do you feel under more pressure now being seeded higher in tournaments, particularly after your most recent success?   How has that changed your approach to tournaments? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Uhm, no, not much.   You know, have more confidence than pressure.   I have to handle pressure always, especially when you get higher ranking and you play with the lower ranking players. 
Yeah, it's going to be there, for sure, the pressure.   But, you know, I have to play one match at a time, and hopefully my ranking's go up.
