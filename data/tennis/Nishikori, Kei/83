THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How is your wrist?  Are you completely recovered?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's getting better.  I would say I'm not hundred percent yet.  But, yeah, I'm happy to be back here.  I have two more days.  We'll see how I recover.   
 Q.  With the injury in mind, what are your expectations for this tournament?  How far do you think you could go?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, actually, you know, the body is -- you know, I don't want to risk it too much this week.  I will see how it goes first couple rounds.   
Hopefully I do well here.  I always play good this tournament.  Little bit altitude, too.  Little bit easy to hit, penetrate with my groundstrokes.   
Yeah, it was unfortunate to withdraw in Barcelona, so hopefully I do well these two weeks.   
 Q.  You always had very good results in this tournament.  What do you think about the venue and Madrid as the host city?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I love this tournament.  This is one of the beautiful city, too.  I love Spain.  I always love to come here.   
Well, I mean, like always, everybody is playing these tournaments.  Always tough.  Yeah, everything is beautiful, the courts, locker room, food.  Everything is good.  So I love being here.
