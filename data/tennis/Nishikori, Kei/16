THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I noticed in Hurlingham, you had an underarm serve and won the point.  Talked about it a bit in Paris, a bit of a joke, honoring Michael Chang.  Is that something you might consider doing more?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yes, I steal it from Michael.   
Maybe.  I mean, if I have chance.  If somebody staying really back, I don't think it's going to happen on grass, but...  Yeah, I saw many guys are trying.  They win the point.   
I may.  I may not.  But it's depends who I going to play.  But, yeah, if I have chance, I will.   
 Q.  How is your fitness?  How is the arm?  Feeling much better and stronger?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's much better.  It was unfortunate to withdraw Halle, because I love that tournament and I need it kind of for good preparation for this tournament.   
I really wanted to play, but, yeah, my elbow was not quite 100%.  I didn't want to risk too much.  But now I'm feeling very, very good.  Physically I feel like I'm rested after getting two weeks off.   
Yeah, very looking forward to play this week, next week.   
 Q.  Are you someone who looks at your draw or just focus on the first round?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I never see the draw, so please don't tell me (smiling).  I know who I'm going to play Monday or Tuesday, but I don't know next one.
