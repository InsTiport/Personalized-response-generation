THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did it feel to be back on court after a few months with injury?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   It was good, actually.   It was a little up and down.   I was up 2‑Love, and he came back.   That kind of stuff, you know, it happened couple times this match, but I finished strong.   It was good, the match.  
   
 Q.   Did you have any nerves beforehand after being out for a while and worried how you might come back?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I was.   I was nervous.   You know, it's always tough to play first match when you come back.   It took two months to heal my injuries, so I was worried, but played a couple exhibition matches last week, and I think that helps.  
   
 Q.   Was it a bit of a hard process to come back on grass, especially, in your first match?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   It's, you know, Grand Slam, too.   So it was hard to decide, but, I mean, my injury is getting better now, and it's only time I could come back.   
So I tried to play Halle two weeks, but I couldn't.   So, I mean, nothing I can do.   So I tried this tournament.   It's first tournament to be back, but I try.  
   
 Q.   First‑ever win at Wimbledon.   It must be a great moment.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, true.   Yeah, it is a big win for me, and especially I came back from injury and it's this one means a lot to me.  
   
 Q.   You had a great run in Australia.   Is it in your mind that you could emulate that run here, do the same again?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, for sure.   I got a little confidence from Australia, to be top 20, I get seeded first time here.   So I have, you know, a lot of confidence.  
   
 Q.   You called for treatment at one point during the match today.   What was the problem?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I twisted my ankle a little bit, and my knee was bothering me a little bit.   But now it's fine.  
   
 Q.   It won't affect your second round?   You'll be able to play okay?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't think so.   Hopefully not.
