6-2, 2-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you tell us what the injury timeout was for and how serious it is.
KEI NISHIKORI: It was my hip.  I'm not sure how bad.  For sure, it will take a couple days.  Well, in the match, I felt it in the second set.  Still hurting during the second set.
Well, sort of it was okay, but, well, yeah, a little bit sad to finish like this.
Q. I guess that rules out playing tomorrow in Sydney, does it?  What do you feel about for your Australian Open chances?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, tomorrow I'm not sure if I can play.  We will decide tomorrow.
But I think it was great week to start of the year.  I had good four match here.  Well, I try to stay healthy next week and hope I can be ready for next two weeks.
Q. Is it an old injury that's recurred or something new?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I was feeling it these couple days.  Well, like I said, it's no big deal.  Should be okay.
Q. You really had the momentum at the end of the second set when you went off.  Did you think about not coming back for the third set?  Was it that serious?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I don't know how I get second set, because it was hurting like 2-All, 3-2.  Well, I think he had a couple easy mistakes, and that helps me to get two breaks.
Well, yeah.  Third set I think he was start playing better.  I had a couple bad decision, especially it was 3 -- 3 or 4, or something, and he played another good level in the third.
Q. You were 3-0 in meetings with him.  Was it something he did today better or different from what he did before?
KEI NISHIKORI: Maybe he using more forehand, his forehand, playing aggressive, and he was serving great today, I think.
