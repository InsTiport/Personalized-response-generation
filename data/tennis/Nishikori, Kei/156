  7‑6, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. Your feeling about fighting against a big server.   
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, was tough match. I think he served really well until the end. I didn't have any chance for break. I think he went for first and second serve, so I didn't really have chance my return.   
But I thought I was playing well. It wasn't bad game for me. I think he just played good tennis. I think it was good tennis for both of us.
