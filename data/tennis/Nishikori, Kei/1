THE MODERATOR:   I know it's not the result that you wanted for Team Japan during this week, but what positives can you take out?
Yoshihito, we'll start with you, and then Kei after.
YOSHIHITO NISHIOKA:   Yeah, well, you know, this is the first tournament for us, and I couldn't win for my singles, which is not best start in 2021.
But today much, much better tennis.  Better than against Russia.  Little by little getting better to play.  I play on Monday for Australian Open, so I think I can play more better after two days.
I couldn't win today, but feeling not too bad, so hopefully getting much more better in after two days.  You know, it's really good for play two matches and one doubles, which is good for me before Australian Open, as well.
We couldn't win the match, but still, good way for Australian Open.
THE MODERATOR:   And Kei?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes, not the best way to start of the year.  I didn't play a match after French Open last year, and I felt like it's been long time and still missing a lot of things, but at least I played two matches.
I didn't play top 10 players last year, so that was good thing I able to play with them and feel how they play.
Yeah, not the best start, but I hopefully recover well tomorrow and ready for Open.
