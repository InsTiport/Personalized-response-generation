 6-3, 3-6, 6-1
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Despite the loss today, what are the positives that you take out of Miami?
 KEI NISHIKORI:   Well, some moment I played good, but I couldn't keep it up for three sets.  I think he was more consistent.  Started well and I think I was playing better in the second, playing aggressive, and I was making many balls in.  But third set I think I made too many unforced errors, and he was more consistent playing all sets.
 But, yeah, it wasn't bad match.  I think it was good tennis for both of us and tough, but it's not like I didn't play, you know, bad.  So I try to keep it up next tournaments.
 Q. Talking about the next tournaments, it's the clay season ahead.  What are your expectations?  Do you know what tournaments are you going to play?
 KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know yet.  But, I mean, clay, I like to play on clay so I'm looking forward to.  Yeah, it's been long time after French, so I try to have good preparation.  I had four weeks now playing tournaments in a row, so I will rest a little bit and, yeah, I will train a little bit on clay.
 Q. How are you physically?  Are you feeling okay after this?
 KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.
