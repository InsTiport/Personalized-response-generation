  6‑4, 6‑4 
   
 Q. (In progress. )  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I was trying to be really aggressive because I know his game.   A lot of slice.   I know I have more advantage my strokes.  
It was kind of similar game with Raonic too (indiscernible) and big serve.   
But I tried to, you know, make‑‑ I was concentrating the important points, those two games that I played his serve.  
Yeah, I finished well today.  
   
 Q.   How is your back?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Should be okay.   I don't know.   I only have half day to recover, so it's going to be hard.   
Hopefully I will be okay.  
   
 Q.   Just feeling pulled?   Not like anything serious?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't think so.   Just sore.  
   
 Q.   You are the first Japanese player to make it to the top 10 the rankings.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it was big goal for me to get top 10, but it's just only one week for now.  
So I have to keep playing better tennis and keep this ranking.   My goal so not to get one time in top 10.   Hopefully I can keep this ranking.
