  7‑6, 7‑5, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What do you take away there the match today?
KEI NISHIKORI:   You know, first of all it's really disappointed because had some chances to at least get one set, and I couldn't.   I mean, both tiebreaks he was playing much better.   He raise his level and he was playing good. 
But, yeah, a couple points was amazing points.   Yeah, I thought I was playing good.   Some important points I couldn't get.   You know, the games can change completely. 
But, yeah, I think I was playing well to not beat them but have some chances to, you know, at least win one set. 
So, you know, I think that was best game I have against Rafa this four or five times. 

Q.   So there's some satisfaction?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I think so.   Yeah, I think that was the closest game I had against Rafa.
