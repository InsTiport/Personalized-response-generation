THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What do you think made the difference in that fourth set?   You were close to kind of breaking it all the way back open.   What happened?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I mean, whole day I didn't hit my serve well.   In the return I should have go inside.   That works in third set, but I kind of step back in fourth set and he made all the balls and I was running side to side.   
Like I said, it wasn't easy for my service game because I wasn't making first serve.   Yeah, it was, yeah, tough game for me.  
   
 Q.   Are you still working with Brad?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   No.     
   
 Q.   What are your goals for the rest of the year?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Hopefully.   I want to keep my ranking top 20 end of this year.   I have a big result end of last year, so I have to defend a lot of points.  
But, yeah, it's going to be in the Asia tour for this one month, so it's gonna be more comfortable for me, I guess, playing Kuala Lumpur, Japan, Shanghai.  
Yeah, like I want to, you know, keep my ranking.  
   
 Q.   I noticed you were changing your socks quite often.   Is that to prevent blisters?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.
