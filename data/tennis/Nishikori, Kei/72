K. NISHIKORI/H. Chung
7-5, 6-4, 6-7, 0-6, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Perhaps more mistakes than you would have liked?  69 unforced errors?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, yesterday I think I made too much unforced errors, that's why he came back serving fourth, and that's something I tried to avoid today.
Make more returns.  You know, don't give him too much, I mean, free points.
Yeah.  I think today I think I was playing much better than yesterday, end of the set yesterday, and it was really, really tight game but really happy to win.
Q. Do you have any problem at all with your right wrist at all?
KEI NISHIKORI: No, all good.
Q. Any injury problems at all at the moment?
KEI NISHIKORI: No.
Q. When you had time to think last night, what was your thought process about how you would approach today?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I think the rain helps me a lot, because I was really down in the fourth set and mentally I wasn't ready.  I knew I had to change something to beat him today, so I think I made some adjustments to make little better than yesterday.
Yeah, mentally I was a little more fresh, and physically, too, little more have energy on my legs.  That helps me a lot.
Q. What is your assessment of how you have played this week?  What will you be looking to improve going into week 2 here at Roland Garros?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yesterday was really tough one.  I think today I made some adjustment and play much better than yesterday tennis.  So, you know, I think I have to be a little more positive all the time during the match.
But, yeah, I think I'm feeling pretty good tennis-wise.  And I try to keep, be more positive and hopefully I can play another good one tomorrow.
