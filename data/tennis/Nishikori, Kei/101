THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  If you could go back in time to yesterday's match with Murray, would you fight for 100%?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is it just a question that you are tired, more tired, after yesterday's match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I mean, I wasn't thinking too much yesterday about going semis.  There is points, if he wins, you know, you get prize money.  I just played full 100% yesterday.   
Yeah, was tough rest, especially at the night, late.  I have to get motivated again today's match.  Physically it wasn't easy.   
Well, I mean, today I think Novak played pretty awesome.  Well, nothing I can complain.  But I wasn't ready to play against Novak I think physically.   
Well, yeah, I tried to play good tennis, but I couldn't today.   
 Q.  Tonight is a hard loss, but the year has been in general good for you.  How do you feel in that perspective?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I think it was one of the best year for me.  Play a lot of matches, you know, beating those top players this year a lot.  I get a lot of confidence this year.   
Maybe this is not the finish what I wanted to finish, but still I think it was good year.   
 Q.  You've played both Andy and Novak this week.  Who would be your tip for the final?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think physically Novak is much fresh, you know, going to tomorrow.  Well, I think it's going to be a good match.
