K. NISHIKORI/D. Kudla
7-5, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Start with any questions in English.
Q. Kei, how do you feel about that to start off your season?
KEI NISHIKORI: I thought it was a good match, tough match.  He was playing good, especially first set.  Serving really well.  Really having a tough time with my return game, so I thought he was playing good tennis.  And after 5-5 I think he dropped a little bit his level, and I also able to play better.  I start playing better, playing more aggressive and started getting more rhythm, and my serve got better in the second.  So, yeah, I think it was good first match.
Q. And so you haven't had a lot of time to prepare for a quarterfinal since Grigor.  How do you feel your condition is for that?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I didn't watch his match today, but I saw the first match against Yoshi, and he was playing good tennis, so I'm sure it's going to be a tough match.  But, yeah, excited to play Dimi.  He's obviously a good player.  And I'm sure it's going to be a great match, so hopefully I can have good tennis again, and yeah, we'll see tomorrow.
