THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It's been a tough week for you.  Do you think you were a victim of your form coming into the tournament, a bit tired, conditions?  What has made it a tough week?
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I think I was fresh.  I mean, I was really tired after Paris, but I took some rest.  I think I was fresh.  I don't know, I just didn't feel the ball this week.
Could be the court or the ball.  I don't know.  But, yeah, just didn't play well this week.
Q. Last week was the Next Gen in Milan.  Your thoughts on what you think of the next group of players coming through, young players?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I think there is many good players.  I think those two players in the final, I think they gonna really come into the top player.  I'm sure.
I don't know, there is too many, too many good players now.  So I think I excited for the whole tour that we can see more new guys next year.
Q. You had a couple of chances to break back in the first set.  How crucial did you think that passage of play was?  Did you lose it after that?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, just today, I mean, I was same at last match, too, but there was too many unforced errors for me.  I think made it really easy today.  I mean, he was also playing well.
But I think I gave him too many free points that couldn't get the point like two or three point in a row.  Yeah, he was playing solid, too.  There was not too many chances for me today.
