THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a tough start out there for you, but you managed to turn it around.  Describe to me how the match went and how you feel right now.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it was a very tough one.  He obviously playing good, very solid from baseline.  He was very aggressive in the first set.   
But second set I start grinding little more, and playing little smarter, I think.  I have to say little bit lucky for me.  There was couple net and on the lines.  Sometimes I need some luck to win.   
But second and third I'm very happy with my tennis.  Play really good tennis.   
 Q.  How did you feel physically, considering that you were six or seven weeks without playing with the wrist?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Felt pretty good.  Yeah, that was my first match of the clay.  In the beginning I wasn't playing hundred percent.  But second and third I was feeling pretty good on the court, moving well.  So I was very happy.   
 Q.  You play David Ferrer next.  You have a winning head-to-head record with him.  How do you feel about that matchup?  What do you expect in the next round?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, that's something I have a great rival with David.  We played so many great matches, long matches.  You know, I always love to play him because I can challenge myself.   
I know it's going to be tough one again.  So I try to prepare well and, yeah, hopefully I can win the match.   
 Q.  The Japanese Federation announced that Japan will play Davis Cup against Brazil in Osaka.  Have you made plans to play this tie against Brazil or have you not yet decided?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  It's still long time to go.  I haven't think actually anything.  I mean, if I have chance, I will play for sure.  You know, I know it's going to be tough schedule-wise.  We'll see.
