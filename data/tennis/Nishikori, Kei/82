6-3, 4-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Congratulations on your win.  Do you think how you're coming this year you expect to get to No. 1?  Is that your goal in the short period of time?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, hopefully.  No. 1 is still far away for me, but I think every year I'm going right way.  Hope I can win some big tournaments sometime soon.  I think that's my biggest next goal.
Q. How do you feel?  In tournament you had to have the intervention; you're not feeling well.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, should be okay.  It's always tough.  Sometimes you have to fight with yourself, with your physical condition, and also you have opponents opposite side of the net.  You got to fight with couple things.
Yeah, I'm definitely -- well, it's a little bit tough condition, but I will fight for last couple matches.
Q. Now you're getting closer to the finals, is there a different preparation especially for the physical condition as you mentioned?
KEI NISHIKORI: Not so much.  You know, still three more matches, four, three more matches coming up.  Try to play one match at time.  Every match is going to be tough from now on.
Try to prepare well, and especially I have two tough matches before today.  Hopefully I can recover well.
Q. At any point, what is going through your mind at some point that you lost a set?  Did it ever made you rethink or what it was going through your mind during the match?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I tried to stay calm and focus again.  I knew I have a lot of chance after losing the set.
And also, even though was down a break, 2-1, but I was focusing well.  I knew if I fight through I will have some chance, so I just tried to concentrate one game at a time.
