THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be the first Japanese man to reach the third round at Wimbledon since Matsuoka in '95, 17 years?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   It feels good.   
   
 Q.   Did you know that stat before you went onto the court?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   No (smiling).   No, but it feels good.   Always proud to get a new history.   Yeah, feel good.  
   
 Q.   I read that you went to a tennis camp that he ran when you were a young boy.   Is that true?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   When I was in Japan, I think I was 11, 12, I did, yeah, a couple times a year I went and trained with him.   I think that helps me a lot.  
   
 Q.   Are you still in contact with him now?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, always.   He always send me an e‑mail after the match, how it goes.   He just send me now, too.   
So he's always, you know, helping me.  
   
 Q.   What did he say in the e‑mail?   Can you tell us?   He's happy for you, I guess?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I don't know.   I don't want to say, but...   
   
 Q.   That's fine.   Was he someone you modeled your game on?   Did you look up to him when you were young and tried to play the way he played?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes, no, but he's different body type as me, so he's much bigger than me.   He has more big serve and serve and volley.   
But I always look up, you know, to him when I was young.   He was the only star in Japan, and the camp that he's doing it's much helpful.  
   
 Q.   He reached the quarterfinal here that year in '95 and eventually lost to Sampras.   Do you feel you could get that far this year?   The way you're playing, you look in good form.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I'm trying.   It's always my goal to get quarterfinal here.   I mean, every Grand Slam.   
But, yeah, I play well today.   I will have tough draw anyway.   I either have to play Del Potro or have to play my friend, so it's both tough match for me.  
   
 Q.   If it's Soeda, is he a guy that you practice with a lot when you're on tour?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   That will be very hard then to play him?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's always hard to play with friends, even if it's Japanese or anyone, because we know each other and we both want to win.   But try play my tennis.  
   
 Q.   You have to put it to one side, the friendship, forget about it?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Can I just ask you, all slams are important to you and you've been in a quarterfinal before, but how important is it to you to be this far through the draw at Wimbledon?   Is it a special slam?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes, it is.   I think this tournament, Wimbledon, is every tennis player look up and I think that all the tennis begins from here, the grass court, and everybody's dreams this tournament.  
For me, also.   So, yeah.   It's, yeah, important tournament for me.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it will be big news back at home?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   I hope so (laughter).  
   
 Q.   These guys will make it.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.
