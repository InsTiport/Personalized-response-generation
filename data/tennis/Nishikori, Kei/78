K. NISHIKORI/D. Ferrer   
7-5, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  A difficult first set.  Smooth second set.  How were you feeling on the court after your injury?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I felt pretty good.  It's a little bit different condition from last week and here, so I got to make some adjustment.   
Yeah, in the match there was many up-and-downs, especially first set, but I think overall I played a pretty good match.   
 Q.  In terms of percentage of form, would you say that you're 50, 70%?  Are you feeling on form?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty good  feeling.   
 Q.  Physically?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, much better than last week.  My wrist is okay now.  I assume to be 100% now.   
Yeah, just play one match at a time and we'll see.   
 Q.  So you're feeling 100% right now?  
KEI NISHIKORI: (Nods.)   
 Q.  One question from Austria before you answer the Japanese questions.  Yesterday you decided to play at the end of October in Vienna.  It's the first time that you play in Vienna.  What do you expect from this tournament from Austria?  Have you ever been there?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, first time.  I always loved to play first time of, you know, anywhere in the tournaments.  I heard it's beautiful city and beautiful tournament.  That's why I chose to play.   
I always play Basel, but sometimes it's good to change something.  Yeah, never been there, so I'm very excited to go there.   
 Q.  What can you say about our Austrian local hero, Dominic Thiem?  You will face him in Vienna.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  Well, I think that's going to be tough.  I think Andy is playing also.  Thiem has been playing very good.  Especially last week he played a couple of amazing matches.  For sure, you know, to play against him, it's gonna be tough match.   
 Q.  Since the 2014 US Open, you haven't been back to a Grand Slam final and still haven't won a title.  Where do you think you have the best chance maybe this year to go back to the final and win the title?  What is maybe still missing in your game that you haven't won a Grand Slam yet?  
KEI NISHIKORI: You know, I think that I missed this chance in Madrid, Barcelona, and I got injured, my wrist.  So it was a little bit shame because I love this clay court season.  I mean, hopefully I can, you know, do good in French.   
You know, I think I like hard court still.  So the summer season is going to be important for me to get some points.   
Yeah, hopefully I can make big jump to win Masters sometimes this year.  That's gonna be my goal, to win Masters or Grand Slam sometimes in the future.
