6-3, 6-0, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  The way you played during one hour was just amazing.  What was the feeling?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, today was very good match, especially winning 12 games in a row.  I think I was feeling very confident, so I was dictating a lot with my backhand and forehand.   
Well, after 3-Love he was coming back strong, so it was a little bit tough in the end.  Yeah, overall I think I played really good match.   
 Q.  You make the physio come at 3-0 in the third set.  What was your problem, and how do you feel now?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I felt a little bit sore, my shoulder.  So I had a little bit treatment, but I think it's gonna be okay.   
 Q.  It was something you had during the match, or you suffered before?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I had it before first match, and I still feel it.  I called trainer.  But I hope it's gonna be okay.   
 Q.  Do you suffer more or less than in the first match from your shoulder?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, it's been same.
