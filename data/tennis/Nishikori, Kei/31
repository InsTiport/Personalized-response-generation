N. DJOKOVIC/K. Nishikori   
6-1, 4-1 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you tell us exactly what the injury is.  When did you first get it before the match or just today?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Before the match, I was okay.  Of course, I wasn't, like, fresh, fresh.  I thought I was going to be okay.  After third game or fourth game when I was serving, I felt pretty heavy to my right leg.  After that I couldn't really bend my knees and couldn't jump up.  Yeah, I decided to stop.   
 Q.  How did that cumulative effect of playing so many hard matches affect you prior to the match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I'm sure it comes from my past matches, especially last match.  I was moving a lot, waste too much energy.  Could be from that and also, yeah, something happen today during the match.   
So disappointed.  Yeah, had a good couple matches this week, so...  It's tough to lose like this, but I try to head up.   
 Q.  Do you think if you hadn't lost the first set so lopsidedly, the player you were playing wasn't the No. 1 ranked player in the world, won the title six times, you would have been able to find some reserves to keep playing in the match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I was trying.  Like I said, after couple games, I couldn't really move, couldn't hit my serve well.  Yeah, I don't think even if it's Novak, I couldn't beat anybody with my one leg.  It was just too tough.
