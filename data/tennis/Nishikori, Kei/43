R. FEDERER/K. Nishikori   
6-4, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You were leading 4-1 in the tiebreaker.  Could you talk about what happened after that.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, he hit two good serves.  Yeah, I had one forehand I should have maybe go for it, but I couldn't.   
Well, he played some good tennis after that, and I don't think I did anything really bad, you know, after that point.   
I mean, credit to him.  Yeah, maybe things changed after if I won second set, but you never know.  I thought I was playing better in the second set.   
 Q.  You haven't played with Roger for a few years.  Could you compare his level to the last few times you played with him?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, felt kind of same, same level as last time maybe in Melbourne.  Lost in five sets.  He was playing, you know, good level, I thought.  I mean, second set I think we both played good tennis.  But sad to lose like that, but maybe next time.
