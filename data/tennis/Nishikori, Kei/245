THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You had the control of the game, of the match, except in the second set.   What was the problem in the second set?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I think he started very slow today.   He was trying to, you know, hit more and get inside the court second set.   One game he broke me and he was really aggressive.   I couldn't do anything.   
But, yeah, he went for it I think second set.   It was tough, second set.   Yeah, luckily I got the tiebreak.   
After that I was, you know, very confident.   
   
 Q.   It's your first time being seeded at a slam.   How does this feel different for you?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   No much.   I try not to think about it 'cause if I start thinking, you know, it's get more pressure.   So it is different, but I try to not think about it.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel added pressure being sort of the leading Asian man by some distance at this tournament?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Never.   Never feel the pressure.   Maybe, you know, my ranking is 25 or 26.   That gives me a little bit of pressure because I feel like I have to win with these guys.   I have to play with lower‑ranked guys now.   That gives me a little bit of pressure.   
But I never felt like.   You know, Tomic is coming now.   A lot of Asian coming, so I'm proud that I'm one of the guys.  
   
 Q.   Can you describe how life has changed for you in Japan since getting this higher ranking and breaking through the Project 45?   What is your popularity like at home now?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   It's tough to say myself.   Yeah, it changed little bit after I get to top 45.   I went back November two weeks.   Yeah, a lot of guys are congrats me.   
But usually I stay in U.S. so I never felt like the crowd.   But it feels good sometimes, you know.   
   
 Q.   This is an Olympic year for you.   How much of a goal is that, to do well at the Olympics?   With there being no other Japanese men near the top, have you thought about playing mixed doubles there?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I would like to play mixed doubles if we can get in.   That's the goal for us.   But, yeah, played last time in China, 2008.   I played horrible match.   I felt a lot of pressure in Olympics.   It's only once a four years.   
But I'm excited this year 'cause my ranking is up now and I'm really confident.   I don't know if I can get the medal, but if I can do well, if I can play my best tennis, then I think I have some chance.   
   
 Q.   Have you talked to any of the women about mixed at the Olympics?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   Never.   But, yeah, I want to play.   
   
 Q.   Is Brad Gilbert traveling with you now?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   We finished.   
   
 Q.   You finished?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   At the end of the year?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Kind of, yeah.   
   
 Q.   So who is your full‑time coach now?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Dante Bottini.   We travel last year, too.   This is second year with him.   
   
 Q.   The best result for a Japanese player in a Grand Slam is quarterfinals, correct?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you're ready to do the same?   What is your ambition?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I hope so.   Yeah, that's one of my goal.   I played US Open 2008 and I made 16.   That's next goal for me.   
But play one match at a time always.   You don't know what's gonna happen.   It's always tough opponent.   
But, yeah, that's my next goal, I think.
