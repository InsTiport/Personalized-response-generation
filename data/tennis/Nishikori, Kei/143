K. NISHIKORI/M. Kukushkin   
6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the match?  Are you starting to feel comfortable at this tournament?  Comfortable and confident?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I thought it was pretty good match.  You know, not easy for me playing first match of the tournament always.  But, yeah, I felt good rhythm there.  It's always a little bit windy, especially on stadium.  It don't look like windy, but it is.  I feel a lot of windy on the court.   
So, you know, not expecting perfect match.  But, you know, it's not easy match against Kukushkin.  You know, he hits flat.  Not easy to hit hard with his balls.  I stayed patient, and I thought it was pretty good match.   
 Q.  You say it's never easy for you playing the first match of any tournament.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.   
 Q.  What are you looking to achieve in each first match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: You know, I think the really important is the first couple games.  I try to focus a lot and I try to get first break of the match.  You know, try not to hit, you know, too crazy shot.   
You need to get good rhythm first, and then if you feel comfortable, then I try to hit hard or try to hit winner; try to be patient first couple of games.   
 Q.  In America you do very well; you do very well on hard courts.  This one maybe not as good as some of your other tournaments.  Why do you think this one gives you more trouble than other American hard court tournaments?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think a little bit of everything.  This Penn ball flies a lot.  A little bit grippy these courts, so bounce high.   
If you play against, you know, big server or someone can hit, you know, kick serve and first serve, you know, it's always tough.  You know, a little bit altitude, so flies a little more with the ball.   
So, you know, a little bit of everything.  I start feeling comfortable today and this week practicing, so I hope I can go, you know, further than last couple years.   
 Q.  In Memphis, why do you think you do so well at Memphis?  You haven't lost there in four years.  That's a remarkable accomplishment.  What is it about Memphis that you're able to dominate?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I don't know.  I feel always comfortable there.  It's always relax.  I mean, I have to say there was no top 10 or top 20 players this year, so it wasn't really tough year.   
But still, you know, it's always good to win the title in Memphis.  I don't know.  I like indoors, and I feel good tennis there.   
 Q.  Every year you win a guitar there.  Do you know how to play guitar?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No idea.   
 Q.  What are you going to do with those trophies, start a band or something like that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, couple more years I think I can get more guitar and I can, you know...   
Right after winning title it's go to Japan, you know, the trophy, so I never see them.  (Smiling.)   
I try a little bit this year after winning the title, but I have no idea.   
 Q.  Try a little to play the guitar?  
KEI NISHIKORI: To play, yeah.   
 Q.  Is that something you may do after your career when you have more time?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.
