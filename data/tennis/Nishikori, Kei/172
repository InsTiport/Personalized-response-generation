  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What is your expectation for this tournament?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   I mean, you know, try to play good tennis here again.   I really like this tournament. 
Hopefully I can do, you know, good tennis this week and next week.   I did really well last year, so, yeah, I have been playing, you know, good tennis. 
So whatever is possible.

Q.   How do you feel that the weather is important for you?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, this is tough condition.   Really hot.   I been practicing these two days.   It's really humid and hot condition. 
But, you know, try to do whatever I can, you know, to not get injured or something.
Yeah, really important to stay healthy here.

Q.   I was wondering what you thought of the many fresh young faces, teenagers, including your countryman, Nishioka?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, he's really talented player.   He's still young, I think 20 or something.   We train same place. 
Yeah, it's great to see someone young from my country.   He's doing really well right now.   Hopefully we can see couple more, you know, especially from Asia.   It would be great.

Q.   For you, you want to be No. 1, No. 2?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.

Q.   In the world?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.

Q.   How do you think you can do it?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Well, it's going to take some time, you know, to get No. 1. 
Novak, you know, right now he's like top player right now.   It's not easy to beat him or, you know, Roger and Andy start playing well right now.
But, you know, slowly I think I'm coming.   I'm playing good tennis and feeling much stronger mentally and physically, too. 
Might take some time, but hopefully I can get there as soon as possible.
