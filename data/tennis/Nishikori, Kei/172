THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Three matches; you only lost 10 games so far.   Can you comment on that?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I don't think it usually happens, but I have been playing well so everything is going well.   My serve, my return, my strokes.   
I feel a lot of confidence playing good.   You know, really going well these three matches.   
   
 Q.   From last year where you played also very well until the injury in the semifinals, how can you compare the level?   Are you much better this year?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I'm not sure.   You know, it's different opponents.   It's tough to compare, but, yeah, maybe I have been playing a little better than last year.   My ranking went really high last year, and, you know, everything changed after US Open.  
So, yeah, I mean, for now I have been feeling really comfortable playing this week.  
   
 Q.   I suppose you like Miami; you live in Florida.   What do you do off the court?   Anything that's different here in Miami?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I'm not sure.   Not much, actually.   I mean, I like to go to the beach, but, you know, when you're playing it's not easy to go out.   And maybe playing golf sometimes.  
   
 Q.   You have been playing?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I'm not good, but yes, sometimes.
