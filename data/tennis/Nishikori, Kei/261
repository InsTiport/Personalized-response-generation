 KEI NISHIKORI: No, no. I didn't know, no.   
  
  Q. Could you tell us a little bit yourself? You practiced at the Bollettieri Academy. Why did you choose that academy?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Um, because there is more players, top players. Many pros are practicing there, and many coach.

 Yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you get any sort of sense of why he retired? Did he seem to have an injury, or do you know what was in his mind?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know why he retired, still. But he wasn't moving well. Seemed his legs, I guess.  
  
  Q. Can you just talk about your match today, how you played.   
 KEI NISHIKORI: I tried to go to the net more often, because he was using slice a lot. I tried to make more first serve. He get more pressure when I hit, when I make first serve. Yeah, tried to go aggressive.
