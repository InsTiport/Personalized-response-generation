  6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you feel for this first match?   You must be very satisfied, but how did you approach the match?   How did you feel?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I felt really good on the court.   Really confident. 
It was little windy, but the weather was actually good.   You know, it wasn't too hot, too humid.   It was easy to play. 
And also I was almost dictating the court against Misha, and serving well.   Everything was good.
So really happy the way I'm playing today.

Q.   Seemed like you were content to have long rallies.   I think even the first point of the match was 10, 12 shots.   Was that part of the game plan today?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Well, yeah.   You know, he's not the guy hit winners every point.   So, you know, I was expecting a little rallies.   He used slice a lot. 
But, you know, my plan was always trying to be aggressive and come in sometimes and using a lot of forehands.
Yeah, plan was good, I think.   Everything was working well.   I did a great job today.

Q.   You have an aggressive play style and always go for your shots.   How do you strategize for defensive players on the tour?   How do you deal with that?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I always try to look for the chance when it's short.   If I think I can come in or try to step in, I try to, you know, put inside of court.
You know, it's on and off.   You have to have good defense.   You have to also, when you are being defense you have to see the chance, you know, to come in sometimes.
You know, you have to have good mix‑up defense and offense.
