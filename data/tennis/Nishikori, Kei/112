THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Are you happy with the way you're playing?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  Maybe not everything, but it wasn't easy match.  He served really well second and third sets.  Having really tough time with my return game.   
But after rain delay, you know, I change some tactics and start working really well.  Yeah, it was really tough match but happy to win.   
 Q.  How much had you played before the rain came?  You played the morning and then you had to stop?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.   
 Q.  That's nothing new, but did that affect your momentum at all?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, it's never easy.  It took maybe two, three hours between rain delay.  And that time I start playing little better, I started getting my rhythm.  Then rain came.  It wasn't easy moment for me.   
You know, I think I concentrated well after rain delay.  I took first two games, and I got third set.  Yeah, I think I recover really well after rain delay today.   
 Q.  Mahut in the next match.  Talk about what you expect in that matchup.  
KEI NISHIKORI: We actually never played before, so we have to see in the match.  But, yeah, he's tough player, aggressive, comes to the net a lot, having great serve.   
Yeah, it's going to be a tough one.   
 Q.  Where do you feel right now you are in terms of where you want to be in a Grand Slam event?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think I'm getting closer to 100%.  I'm feeling good physically and also mentally.  You know, tennis, I think it's going to come after a couple matches.   
Yeah, I think I'm in great shape and hope I can go second week.
