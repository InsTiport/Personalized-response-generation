K. NISHIKORI/D. Young
6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Your match today, in the second set when you had to come back, is that the kind of thing that's useful in your later matches, or would it have been better to be able to...
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, you know, it's always happen.  He start playing much better in the second set, beginning of the second set.  I think he was stepping in a little more.  And, for me, I think I backed up a little bit.
And, well, from the 4-1, I think I started playing much better, stepping in a little more and playing aggressive.  And, you know I think it's a little bit unusual, you know, to win the five games in a row, but first set I was playing great tennis.  And I'm very happy the way I'm playing right now.
Q. We were talking to Stan and you're in kind of the same situation.  Your part of the draw in terms of seeded players looks more open, especially compared to that bottom quarter that everybody is talking about.  Stan says, for him, it doesn't matter who he plays.  It's all about how he's playing.  Do you feel the same way, or do you sort of look at the draw and...
KEI NISHIKORI: Actually, I never see the draw, you know.  Right now I know kind of, but in the beginning it doesn't matter.  I think same as he say.  It doesn't matter who is coming up.  You have to play your good tennis on the court.
You might have to change a little bit.  Depends on who opponents are, but for me I usually have to concentrate on what I have to do on the court and not think too much, you know, who is coming next, so, you know, whatever think after the match.
So, well, you know, sometimes you need luck for the draw, but usually I don't really care, you know, who is coming or who is, you know, next opponent.
