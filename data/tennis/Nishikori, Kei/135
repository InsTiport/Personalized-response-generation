THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Before starting the tournament did you expect this result?  
KEI NISHIKORI: For quarterfinal?   
 Q.  Yes.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I mean, of course I want to go farther.  I always play good this tournament.  It was really tough match today because I never beat him before.  I was really ready for today's match.   
And, yeah, I thought played a good match again today, so happy with my result.   
 Q.  In your opinion, what is your level this year?  Two years ago you played the final.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  So...  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, I think it's better.  I'm better every year.  I think I'm more consistent than ever before, so I think I'm playing good tennis.   
And also, physically I think I'm little more strong.  I feel good on the court, so I think I'm very fit than these last couple years.   
 Q.  You said this is the first time you've beaten Gasquet.  It's the seventh match.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you try to change anything from the previous games that worked today so well?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I mean, when you lose six in a row maybe you have to change something to beat Richard today.  I think I did pretty good everything:  serve, return, and using my forehands a lot and I was playing aggressive.   
So I think it was good tennis.
