6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough match tonight.  What do you think was the biggest difference?  Because those sets were so close, so tight.  There was only one break.  What was the big difference for you?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I just had couple bad games that cost the match, both sets.  I think he start playing better after couple games.  I had a good start, but, yeah, he played very good tennis.   
 Q.  Do you feel you have enough match play heading into New York, or what's it look like between now and then?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, just going to keep working one more week.  I mean, I wish I had, you know, couple more matches, but, you know, now I lost.  I try to have good practice next week.   
 Q.  When you're not able to get the match play you want prior to a big event, other than obviously having a hitting partner, do you simulate matches where you literally, you know, are playing a set or two and keeping score and doing everything like you would in an actual match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I think I just need to, you know, keep practicing, keep playing, keep playing matches if I can.  And, yeah, I think I just need to get, you know, used to play more matches.  I think that's going to gives me more confidence, more feeling.  I hope I can get it before US Open.
