6-1, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You have reached another semifinal here.  Congratulations.  This quarterfinal was probably the most straightforward of the ones you have played.  How do you feel after that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I felt pretty good on the court today.  Well, actually, he was, I guess, a little bit tired, for sure.  Against David, he was playing great match.  And maybe he wasn't 100% today, but for me, I think I played one of the best match so far, really dominating from the baseline and serving good today.  Everything was working well.   
 Q.  In terms of your preparation for the Australian Open, would you like to stay fresh or do you like to have grinding matches to sort of improve your condition before a Grand Slam?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I want to be always being fresh.  I mean, stay healthy is the most important this week.   
But same time, I want to play some matches, spend more time on the court here.  That would be nice.  But, you know, staying healthy, I have one more week next week, so just try everything 100% this week and I go easy next week.   
 Q.  Wawrinka has had a far tougher road to the semifinal, and he had another tough match today.  Do you think the differing paths you have taken works in your advantage?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  Well, it's just only two matches.  I mean, I had a tough one first match, and I thought Kyle had a match today because he was playing great tennis in the first set, but, you know, Stan always play strong and tough.  So, you know, it was great match to see.   
Well, it's gonna be, you know, tough one, for sure.  We played in London few months ago, and, you know, he's been playing top player.  I'm expecting another tough match tomorrow.
