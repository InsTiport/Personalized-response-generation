THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You said a couple of times here now after five-set matches that you feel like you can take confidence from it into the next round.  Is it the way you have managed to dig yourself out of trouble which gives you confidence from a match like that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Sure.  I'm sure, yes.   
Today I think he almost have the match, especially in the fifth set, and, yeah, it was really tough match.  Could go both ways.  Also the tiebreak, super-tiebreak could go his way, too.   
I don't know how I managed, you know, to save couple of break points, but very happy to win today.  You know, I think this means a lot.   
Yeah, I'm really happy to go through to next round.   
 Q.  You said that you had probably faced more aces from him than you would serve in a year.  Obviously a joke, but what was it like to be on the receiving end of that many aces in a match like that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, never easy.  I felt like first couple sets I was returning really well.  I was guessing right and hitting well.  But after third set I think he mixed up really well.  Even after few sets he was serving still really well, and there was, yeah, too many aces and frustrating, too, you know, for my side.   
But I tried to keep it, you know, simple and focus what I can do, my service game.  And, I mean, yeah, he was really serving well today, I think, even the second serve.   
 Q.  So a long two matches going to five sets.  I know the first one finished when your opponent retired.  Do you feel like that's too much tennis in the first two rounds of the tournament or are you confident you have the legs to play another five?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I rather do three sets, but today he was playing well, and first match, too, the guy was playing really solid.   
Yeah, these two matches can go, you know, I could lose these two matches.  So yeah, I just need to recover well.  But, I mean, it's only two matches yet, so I'm not too tired yet.   
 Q.  Do you feel you get more support from traveling Japanese fans in Australia than you do at other majors, or is it about the same?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, for sure, for sure, I feel more support here.   
You can tell there is so many Japanese.  And also many Asians.  I'm sure I feel more comfortable playing this Grand Slam than other Grand Slam.   
Yeah, I feel very exciting on the court, and also happy to be here.   
 Q.  After your progression in the last three Grand Slam tournaments, you've gone up one round every time.  Obviously that must be your aim here in Australia, is it?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I hope I can do well these big tournaments, Grand Slam and Masters.  I think it's going to be very important if I want to reach top 5 or top 3.   
Yeah, my goal is to do well here and other big tournaments.
