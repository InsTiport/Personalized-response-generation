An interview with:   
KEI NISHIKORI   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Your first serve was not very good today.  Was it because you were not in good shape or was it because Novak was projecting too much pressure on your game?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Could be little bit everything.  Obviously I didn't make any first serve today, so that cause lot of, you know, pressure that he always have a good return.   
I thought didn't play bad.  I had great points with groundstrokes.   
I think my serve was the key.  Both sets I lost my first service game.  That gave me a little pressure to come back.   
I mean, he also played unbelievable tennis.  Very ashamed with this score, but have two more matches.  So I try to keep it up my serve tomorrow and next match.   
 Q.  Did you feel at all at any time in that match that you had a chance to win?  Secondly, you've beaten Djokovic before.  Is he playing at a different level, do you think, than last year or a few months ago?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, today couldn't do anything.  Even start of the match, it was half my fault, too, because didn't make any first serve.  He was attacking my second serve.  I was defense all the time.   
But he did great defense so many times that usually I hit the winner or I get the point.  But he was having great defense and also he makes me run side to side.  Didn't feel any chance today.   
But, you know, strokes, I was having good tennis too.  I think, yeah, he was playing great tennis and also my serve wasn't there much.  Yeah, hope I can keep it up for next one.   
 Q.  It's now two years since you've been working with Michael Chang.  It was big news when you announced you would be working with him.  Looking back over the two years, what has he brought to your game?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think I got better everything.  I have more confidence than few years ago, before we started two years ago.  My tennis I think getting much better, more aggressive now, using more forehand, coming in sometimes.  That I not used to do before.   
Yeah, mentally also I got strong, too.  So I'm very happy working with Michael.   
 Q.  Physically, are you 100%?  Is the surface playing the same as last year and the same as Paris last week?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, that could be why, too, I didn't have good serve.  I didn't practice much these last couple days, especially my serve.  But, you know, I think surface is same.   
Paris maybe was little bit slower, but it's really tough to finish the point with this surface, especially against great defense like Novak.  It was tough to play.   
But I had couple good points, too.  Yeah, I hope I can fix my serve for next one and try to have good two more matches.   
 Q.  A question about the Olympics.  How do you look forward to the Olympics both in Rio and the view to Tokyo 2020?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's exciting.  Especially Japan is coming in five years.  I'm going to be 30, so I think I will get a little more experience.  I think if I trying better, physically I will get more stronger.   
Yeah, can't wait to play Tokyo Olympics.
