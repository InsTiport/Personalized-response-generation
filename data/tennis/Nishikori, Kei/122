R. GASQUET/K. Nishikori
6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. The conditions were too heavy for everybody, Richard, because the match stopped with you leading, 4-2, and then it changed.
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, yeah, could be the reason why he played well today.  You know, it was heavy, and I couldn't really dictate with my forehand/backhand.  Maybe it helped a little bit, you know, with the heavy condition.
But, well, yeah, I think he played good tennis, you know, to play first and second, and especially last set he start playing much better.  I have to give him credit.
Q. Do you have any regret about this game, maybe being more patient or something like that?
KEI NISHIKORI: Oh, yeah, I was missing too much.  I couldn't really get my feeling today.  And also he played good.  So, I mean, no excuse, but I couldn't really play good tennis today.
Q. The results that you have in clay demonstrate you -- you have won two times in Barcelona, for instance, and Madrid and so on.  Are you going better in every surface?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, especially on clay I have been playing well these couple of years, so that's why it's very shame to lose like this, and I know I have a good chance, you know, against Richard.  So it's not easy loss today.
