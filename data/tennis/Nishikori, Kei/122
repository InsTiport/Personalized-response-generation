THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. What were you pleased with the most in your game today?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Today I think certain moment I was playing aggressive. You know, he could be a really tough player, especially here. He hit very flat. Especially third set, he started playing much better, playing more aggressive. He was making it same time.   
It was a tough third set. But I try little more, you know, aggressive, took a little bit time with changing with slice. Serve, too, I change little bit. Start working better.   
I think play one of the best game today.   
   
 Q. In general, there are lots of people saying tennis is a difficult sport for Asians. But you are. What do you think?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, first of all, you have to be really strong. Especially if you are Asian, you have to do a lot of training in the gym. Physically you have to be strong. Otherwise, like me, I got lot of injuries in the past, you know, playing against those big guys, a lot of power.   
I've been spending a lot of time in the gym. Also mentally you have to be really strong, believe yourself. Well, it's not easy for I think most of Asian people with the body‑wise.   
You know, like me, or David Ferrer, he's very physically strong. When you believe yourself, I think you can be top 10 even if you are anybody.
