THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  After your injury last week in Madrid, how ready are you feeling for Rome and Paris?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.  Yeah, very unfortunate to get hurt again last week, but it's not too bad.   
Yeah, I have been practicing, you know, easy these couple days, and it's getting better.  It should be okay for the match.
