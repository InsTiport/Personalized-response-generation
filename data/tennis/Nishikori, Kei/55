D. THIEM/K. Nishikori
6-2, 6-0, 5-7, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Can you just talk us through your match?  The first two sets, obviously you were not there, and then you put up some fight, but it was just not quite enough.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I felt if I had, you know, couple more chances, I could go fifth set.  So, you know, very sad to lose like that.
But, yeah, first two sets, I don't know.  I just wasn't there and maybe little bit nervous.
And he was hitting very deep.  And I kind of lost, you know, what I have to do on the court.
But, yeah, I felt like I was almost there to go fifth set.
Yeah, a little bit weird match today.
