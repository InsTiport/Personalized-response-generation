6-4, 6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Congratulations on that first round.  You play an American next who you know pretty well.  Can you talk about your relationship with Austin?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  Actually, it's great to see him, especially on Grand Slam.  We can play each other it's great because, you know, because we train together when we are really young, like when we were junior.  So it's good to see him, you know, with this stage.
Think we play Memphis last year.  It was tough match.  He's very aggressive player.  Good serve.  Coming to the net a lot, I think.
It's going to be not an easy one.
Q. He said that he taught you some English and that you taught him how to eat sushi.
KEI NISHIKORI: (Smiling.)  Yeah, I guess.  We went a lot of times Japanese restaurant in Sarasota.
Yeah, it was great time with him.  He's one of the nicest guys on the tour, too.  He was very nice.
Q. Is it hard at all to play a friend in a Grand Slam?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's always tough to play with friends.  Actually tougher than maybe top 10 players.
You know, it's not easy when play with friends because we know each other a long time.  We have to fight each other on the court, and, yeah, especially Austin, you know, we know how to play each other.
But, yeah, I think I have to think about it tomorrow, talking with my coach, and prepare for next match.
Q. How did you find the conditions out there today?  It's pretty hot.
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it was.  It was hot, but luckily I got finished, you know, quick.  It's very dry here so actually I didn't sweat much.
It wasn't too bad.
Q. Was that a real focus for you, getting on and off as quickly as possible before it did become an issue potentially?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I think that's important, especially if you want to play two weeks here.  I think I'm going to play a lot daytime, so I hope I can finish quick every match.
Q. There was a report today which suggested there was a problem with match fixing in tennis.  Would you be surprised to learn there was a problem with match fixing on the tour?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it is.  I didn't know anything.  It's a little bit surprised, but, I mean, obviously I never, you know, involve with this.  Actually I have no idea what's going on.
So it's -- yeah.
