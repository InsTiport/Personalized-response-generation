  6‑1, 4‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Congratulations.   You looked quite in control for the first set and a half, and then it became really complicated.   How did you feel?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I was kind of dominating the first set.   I was playing really well and hitting ball really clean.   Everything worked well.
But he start playing well.   Maybe I stop hitting a little more, but he was start hitting more forehands and using big serve.   Couldn't do anything my return game.
So, I mean, he gain his level for sure.   But tried to focus all the time in the I'm not third set, because he had couple break points with my service game.   You know, could be his winning, so very happy to win the last game. 

Q.   You're getting closer and closer to London, too.   Do you feel the pressure of this race also? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Not so much.   You know, I just tried to play this tournament for good motivation.
I think it's great that I'm enjoying this moment for first time chance to go London.
Even if I lose this chance, I did really well this year.   Hopefully I can finish strong this tournament and hopefully I can make it. 

Q.   I have two questions:   First of all, would you consider this was your best year until now?   And the second one, can you please tell me the advantages and disadvantages of being a player of your height, not that tall like the others on the circuit. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, so far it's been my best year.   I won four title this year and I was first time in final in Masters, in US Open.   And beating those top players, that's given me a lot of confidence.   I have best ranking so far. 
Yeah, sometimes it's not easy to play big guys like Milos and John Isner, but I have something that they don't have.   I have speed and good footwork and I think that's tennis.   Everybody plays different way, and I think that's the fun thing for also the crowd.   They can see different tennis. 
But I never felt it's disadvantage, because I been winning against those big players.   So yeah.   And you see like David. 

Q.   I was just thinking about the match against Cilic. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I mean, the last one he just play well in US Open.   I beat him before already, so it's not like, you know, I don't like to play him.
So, yeah. 

Q.   How has your life changed since the US Open? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's been big change, especially in Japan.
I think also the players see me different way.   You know, I been in top 10 for couple months now, so I have to be ready for mentally strong little more.
Yeah, was a little bit crazy when I went back Japan.   There was a lot of people that show up in airport.   But it's really exciting thing for me.

Q.   What do you mean the players?   How did you notice them seeing you differently?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Maybe when I play them they try to research more, you know, how I play.
You know, maybe they respect more.   If I can be there all the time top 10, I think that's very important for me to stay there.

Q.   You have Ferrer next.   Thoughts on that match. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's going to be a really tough match for sure.   He is very consistent from the baseline and never give you easy points.
Yeah, played couple times this year.   Maybe he likes this slow, hard court, so he's going to be tough match.
