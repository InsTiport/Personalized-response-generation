THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Cruising right along there and hit a snag in the third set and were able to turn around in the fourth and final set.  Assess the match, what happened in the third, and generally how satisfied are you with the result?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Actually, I'm very satisfied with tennis today.  You know, I think third set he start playing much better, little more aggressive, you know, that he didn't do it in the first and second.   
I think that the one game I didn't do well is the last two games.  I kind of slow it down, and, you know, when I give him little chance then he was attacking really well.   
So, you know, I think, you know, credit to him, you know, that he played really well third and fourth.   
But I step it up last two games.  I play little more aggressive.  You know, I took the little chance.   
Yeah, like I said, it was great match, and I think good start of this week.   
 Q.  Obviously you're two years removed from being in the final.  You knocked off some of the top players.  You know you can do it and you've done it on this stage before.  Coming into this tournament with good results.  How confident are you that you can get back on that stage again?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I think there is a lot of chance, for sure, if I can play good.  Well, yeah, I got a lot of confidence from Toronto and this summer in Olympics, too.  I played some good tennis.  You know, beating Rafa, it was great experience I had in Olympics.   
So I think I'm feeling pretty good.  I took some days off after Cincy, and mentally, physically, I'm ready for these two weeks.  I hope I can, you know, come back, you know, later these two weeks.   
Yeah, it's going to be a big goal for me to get this title.   
 Q.  You have played in the Grandstand.  How do you like it?  
KEI NISHIKORI: It was good.  You know, a lot of people show up.  I feel very big, you know, huge, huge court.  They make a lot of great courts.   
Yeah, it was good feeling.
