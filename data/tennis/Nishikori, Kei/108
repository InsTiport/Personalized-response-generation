THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you feel about the win today?
KEI NISHIKORI: Very good.  It was tough first set.  Didn't start quite well today.  But second and third start returning well, everything start working well.  Was good match.
Q. How do you feel going into the next round?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, hopefully I can recover well.  That's the most important.  Yeah, Jared is playing well.  He's upcoming.  Ivo is always tough opponent, especially here.  Little bit quick and bounce high.
Yeah, either one, it's going to be tough one.
