  K. NISHIKORI/N. Almagro  6-4, 7-6, 6-2  An interview with:  KEI NISHIKORI   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   Q.  Do you think that you have taken your game to another level that's more suited to the majors?  KEI NISHIKORI: I think so, yeah.  Getting close to next level.  Obviously was really tough, tough first match.  He could be seeded player, and I know he was injured, but still was tough match.  Yeah, was a little bit windy, so we both didn't play maybe 100%.  But I was getting more balls, especially third set, and I was play much better third set.   Q.  And is it right that you did a big block of training over the sort of Christmas period above and beyond to get ready for this?  KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I had a good three weeks.  Always train with Michael and Dante, and I did a lot of conditioning stuff, too.  So I think I should be ready for this week.   Q.  Li Na just said you will definitely win a Master in your career.  How encouraging is that to hear from her?  KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, that's a good thing to hear from her.  It was very sad to see she's retiring, because I was -- she was big, big leadership for especially Asian tennis.  I think I'm getting close to -- not really -- but getting close to her.  Hopefully I can win a Masters.  For sure that's going to be my next goal.  Hopefully I can come back Grand Slam final again.
