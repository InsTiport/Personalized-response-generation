A. MURRAY/K. Nishikori   
6-7, 6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you feel after that match, very long match, very tough match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, it's never feel good, you know, after losing the match.  I know it was close.  I mean, definitely disappointed.  But there's much is coming into this, so try to be ready for that.   
 Q.  Did you start to run out of strength a little bit at the start of the final set?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, no.  I was okay.   
 Q.  Just wondering how much you think it's taken out of Andy Murray going forward?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, he's tough player, so...  Think it was great match, both of us.  Also for me, played really consistent, playing with good energy.   
Well, I'm sure he's going to qualify for the group.  I try to aim for the second spot.   
 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about playing Cilic on Friday.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I just had one lost recently in Basel.  Not going to be easy.  He has great serve.  That match he play really aggressive, so have to really focus to beat Marin.   
Well, yeah, I will see how he's going to play today.  You know, just ready for next match.   
 Q.  Playing in the O2 here in front of Murray's home crowd, loud support for him, how challenging was that?  Did it make a difference to you at all?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, no, I was okay.  I mean, it wasn't too loud.  I think in France gets more crazy, but here very nice crowd.  Well, I was really focused, so I wasn't hearing too much besides my team.  I was playing comfortable.   
 Q.  The way the format works, the way you and Andy are playing, you could play again on Sunday.  How do you feel about that if it comes to it?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, that's too far to think, you know.  I still have to win, I mean, Friday.  Yeah, we will think after that.   
 Q.  At this stage, who would you back to be world No. 1 at the end between Andy and Novak?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I think both guys are playing well this week.  Think it's great to see who is going to end No. 1 this week.
