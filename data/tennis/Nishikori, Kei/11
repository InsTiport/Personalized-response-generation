THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Going into this matchup, Yoshi called you his hero.  He said you were a hero to him back home.  What does that mean to you?  Did you embrace that matchup today?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it was a tough match for me.  I think he played good tennis.  Served well.
But, yeah, still happy to play with him.  It was first time.  Good to see he's getting stronger, growing up.  You know, I think he has a lot of chance to get more of his ranking up.
Yeah, I think he can play with anybody now.  Happy to see that.  He's playing well.
Q. You guys have practiced together at the IMG Academy before.  What have you noticed in his game that has gotten better over the years?
KEI NISHIKORI: Everything.  I think serve too, and also -- I mean, he was already good.  He has great legs.  Getting a lot of balls back.  He has good defense.
But I think he's more solid, more baseline, from the baseline, and he can, you know, sometimes can be aggressive.  Yeah, I think a little bit of everything he's getting better.
Q. You mentioned his serve.  He hit a 122-mile-an-hour serve down the T.  Hadn't seen that power all week from him.  Is that something he's gotten recently, you think?
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe he's working on his serve.  For sure that's something he needs for his game, and also, you know, like me or him, you know, we need to have good enough serve to get more free points.  Yeah, for sure he's getting better serving.
Q. Can you talk about how you were feeling out there?  Looked like you were feeling better in the second set.
KEI NISHIKORI: I was -- I don't know what's happening.  Last two weeks I'm having tough condition, having tough to breathe, some reason.  I've got to go check.  I don't know why, but I will see.
