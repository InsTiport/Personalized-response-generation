THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you change the momentum in the second set?   
KEI NISHIKORI:   The first set I was really aggressive.   I was hitting at the baseline and I was hitting into it.   
Second set I start, you know, coming back little more.   He had much more time to hit big forehand and heavy forehand to my backhand.   Yeah, I was up a break, but he played well.   
Yeah, I was nervous at 5‑4 and rain delay.   Then I start playing to his backhand, heavy, using my forehand, moving well.   I finished good.   
   
 Q.   It's your first win in Monte‑Carlo, right?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   How many times did you win in the European clay?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Not much.   This is first time for me.   Even Madrid, Rome, played first time last year.  
   
 Q.   So it's your first win on the European clay?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   During the winter, you decided to play in South America.   Was it a good idea to play there?   Why did you choose to do that?   Most of the good players, they don't play in South America.   They prefer to stay on hard court.   
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I always played Memphis, one more in U.S.   But, yeah, I decided to play on clay because I thought it's good for my tennis, the grind, it's good for the physical, too.   
Yeah, those two tournament for all this season for Europe, yeah, I have to start playing on clay, yeah, because I haven't play much tournaments.   
   
 Q.   You were a finalist in Houston last year, correct?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   So you can play on clay.   What are your expectations?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I'm getting better.   Yeah, I cannot say it's my favorite surface.   I have to still work on it.   I need to get physical.   Yeah, I need more experience, I guess, to play on clay.   
THE MODERATOR:   It is not his first win on European clay.   He won at Roland Garros.
