  K. NISHIKORI/P. Mathieu  6-3, 7-5, 6-1  An interview with:  KEI NISHIKORI   THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   Q.  What can you tell us about the crowd?  It was very alive and they were cheering a lot during the match.  Did it affect you?  KEI NISHIKORI: Not really.  I mean, I think it's normal to play French people, you know, against French people, you know.  And especially here it's gonna be like this.  I had a match before like this, so it's okay.   Q.  I know that the booing wasn't necessarily directed at you but the turn of events.  Did you hear the booing and did you process that at all when you went to change your shirt?  KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know (smiling).  I usually don't hear too much in the match when I'm playing, so it doesn't affect me anything, and I usually concentrate pretty well in the match. I know here it gets a little bit, you know, louder and a little bit crazy sometimes, but I try not to listen too much and just concentrate every time.   Q.  How are you feeling playing?  Because in the match you had a tough second set.  The third one you really shined through.  How do you feel playing today?  KEI NISHIKORI: I think it was solid match.  Second set he started playing much better.  He was hitting the ball pretty well, especially his backhand. But, yeah, after that I was playing some good tennis on the court, and, you know, I think it's not easy to play three straight sets easy.  So, you know, there is some up and downs, and I think I fight through pretty well.   Q.  I don't know if you have already been asked about the stronger contingent of Japanese players here.  I think it's the first time since 1967 that there are as many Japanese players at the French Open.  What does it say about the state of tennis in your country?  KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's great to see many Japanese players here, and I think men's tennis got much better right now in Japan. Yeah, those two young guys, Taro and Yoshi, is playing great tennis.  They qualify US Open, too.  Now, they qualify here, so it's great to see for Japan tennis.
