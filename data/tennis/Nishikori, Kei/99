A flash interview with:   
KEI NISHIKORI   
 Q.  Kei, how was that?  
KEI NISHIKORI: It was fun.  I love prawns, and I love shrimp.  So it was good.   
 Q.  Do you do much cooking at home?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Not much, actually.  Just a little bit when I'm home.  When I have some time, I do some.  But not too much.   
 Q.  Is shrimp and prawns your favorite cuisine?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I love everything.  I love seafood.  I love meat.  Yeah, especially prawns, I like it.   
 Q.  Just on your next match, you've got Aussie Jordan Thompson.  Did you see much of his match yesterday?  What are you expecting?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I think it was great match against David.  I think he's playing great, great tennis.   
It's gonna be tough, but I hope we have a great match tomorrow.   
 Q.  Will you be eating seafood before your match tomorrow?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I do always eating sushi.  It's not unusual.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, we practice together many times.  I think we never play in a match, but I think we know each other.   
He has great serve and very steady from the groundstrokes.  He doesn't miss much.  I think it's gonna be many long rallies, I assume.   
I saw yesterday against David, I think they both playing great tennis.  Yeah, it's not gonna be easy.   
 Q.  You'll raise a few eyebrows, playing Jordan.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I think it's great for tennis.  A little bit shame for David, maybe, but he's up-and-coming player.  I think he's been playing really well from last year.  His ranking has been raising a lot from last year.   
It's great to see someone like that.
