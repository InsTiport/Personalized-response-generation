  6/3, 6/2, 6/1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That seemed like a pretty flawless performance for you today.   Is that how you would see the match?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   Yeah, it was almost perfect game for me.   I able to break his serve early each set.   I had more, you know, relax.   Also I can able to attack, you know, his groundstrokes.   Also return was well today.   He didn't have, you know, like big serve, so I was able to make some pressure for his service game. 
Yeah, everything work well today. 

Q.   I heard that John McEnroe made a suggestion.   Maybe you already heard about that.   He's thinking about tennis without referees.   What do you think of this suggestion?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   I won't say too much. 

Q.   Is that something you can imagine?
KEI NISHIKORI:   No, it's going to be really tough for me to think that way. 

Q.   You've had most of your success in your career on hard courts.   How does grass feel for you?   Do you feel comfortable on this surface and you're improving?
KEI NISHIKORI:   This year, yes, especially after clay court season I gain more confidence.   My tennis is changing, more consistent, and everything is going well.   Even on grass, my serve is getting better. 
Also, you know, I can be more aggressive from the groundstrokes.   I try to come in more on grass especially. 
Yeah, feel really comfortable to play on grass. 

Q.   Are you feeling very motivated?   You've made the third round a few times now and never passed that.   Is that a big motivation for you to improve?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's been almost perfect first and second round.   It's going to be tough one next opponent if Philipp wins.   He's playing really good on grass.   He's great player.   Going to be tough. 
Hopefully I can go win next one and make some big jump here.
