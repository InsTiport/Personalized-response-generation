6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tell us your thoughts on the match.  You got off to a good start, but then Rafa got into a rhythm.  What were your thoughts of the match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I think the beginning I was stepping in little more and was hitting using my forehand.  My serve was hitting really good serve, first serve, second serve, and maybe he start hitting more deep.  I start backing up a little more.   
You know, I think everything changed after, between that first set.  Yeah, thought I had couple chances first set and second set, too, but, yeah, some unforced errors.  And, yeah, he played good tennis.   
 Q.  Your thought on Rafa's level?  Because obviously he's been working his way back, trying to get back again.  What do you think of his level today?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think it was pretty good.  Especially here, these conditions.  It's not easy to play with his ball and bounce high.  Not easy to play against Rafa here.   
But he seems like serving well and everything was playing well.  Yeah, I'm sure he's better player than play before.
