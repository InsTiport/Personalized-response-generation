 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Coming back from injury, how did it feel to be here today?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: Um, I'm disappointed how I played today. But, yeah, I have to -- had to enjoy this moment.  
 Just like couple months ago I was struggling still with my injury. Just came back just I guess four, five months right now.   
 So it was fun for me. Actually, it was first time centre court in Grand Slam, and, yeah, I have to say I was enjoying the moment.  
  
  Q. And how did that feel, appearing or centre court?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I was nervous, of course, before the match. But after couple games I was into it, in the match.   
 Yeah, I was enjoying it.   
  
  Q. And how did it feel to test yourself against a player like Nadal?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: It was, yeah, really tough match. You know, he's No. 1 now, and if I hit one easy shot, he's gonna hit winners. So it wasn't easy for me.  
 I think he was playing really well today, yeah.  
  
  Q. What did you feel the good points were from your performance?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: I had a couple chance. Although he breaks my game, I had a chance. I think I was 40-Love, 40-15 every game, so I had to finish the game.   
 But it was really tough. Like he got big forehand, and, yeah, it was tough match.  
  
  Q. Have you ever heard someone speaking of the previous very good Japanese player whose name was Jiro Sato? No, never heard about?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: No.  
  
  Q. He was world No. 3.   
 KEI NISHIKORI: Okay.   
  
  Q. But in my time, in the '30s. You never heard about him?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Sorry.   
  
  Q. What a pity, because it could be an example and could encourage a young player, no?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Sorry.  
  
  Q. What's next for you now?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: I'm going back to the U.S. couple weeks, and Atlanta and all the U.S. series. Atlanta, L.A. everything ATP.  
  
  Q. I read when you came to the U.S. you couldn't speak a single word of English; is that true?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  
  
  Q. How did you behave? How do ask what's for dinner or piece of soap?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: Actually, I couldn't speak English, but there was two more guys with me, Japanese guy. My friends went to academy, and my coach was Japanese, so...   
 Yeah, it was tough for me. Couldn't speak any and couldn't make friends for couple months. It was really tough.   
 But, you know, Americans are like really open, so that was...   
  
  Q. And then an old friend of Bollettieri, did he behave gently at least, or was very stiff? Sometimes he's very stiff.   
 KEI NISHIKORI: The academy, because of all the international people coming, it's not just American, so it was -- I had some laugh moment.   
 But all the friends I have, it's very, very good. Yeah.
