M. CILIC/K. Nishikori   
3-6, 6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Was that quite a tough match to come into knowing you'd already qualified for the next round?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, I wasn't thinking too much.  I just try to focus today's match.  I mean, unfortunately tough loss.  But hope I can play better tomorrow.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to tomorrow, you have a pretty poor recent record against Djokovic, losing the last nine.  How are you going to prepare for that?  How do you feel you can win that match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, try to think tonight or tomorrow what I have to do to beat Djoko.  I mean, obviously not playing bad.   
Will think tomorrow maybe.
