0-6, 6-3, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. I suppose there is a lot of regret because of what happened at the end of the match.  What do you think happened on these two match points?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I mean, he played a good point in match points.  Can't say excuse.
Yeah, last two sets I don't think I played the best tennis, and also he started playing better.  First set he started really slow.  So he started playing better in the second and third.
Q. Any special reason why you didn't play so well at the end of the match?  Do you feel tired or mentally exhausted?
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I think he start playing better, so that's why kind of push it back.  I lost some important points.  I have like a match point.
Well, yeah.  I will give him credit.  He started playing better.
Q. You seemed to be a bit annoyed by the crowd on the court.  Could you describe to us what happened, please.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I mean, not too bad.  They always be like this, you know, playing French here.  It's never easy, you know, with the crowd, especially playing French guys.
Yeah, unfortunately we have to stop a couple points, but, you know, they always been like this.
