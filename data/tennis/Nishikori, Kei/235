THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Kei.   
   
 Q.   You just won in Japan, so you've been playing quite a bit of late.   You did really well here last year, so maybe you have some confidence going forward in the tournament.   How are you going to treat your body to make it through two straight weeks of playing tennis?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Obviously it's not easy thing to play, you know, after winning the tournament.   You want to rest.   
But I had a good day today.   It feels all right, my body.   Physically it's not going to be a hundred percent, but I'm good enough to play a match.   Hopefully I can play good again tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   There's been a lot of talk about security at this tournament in the last couple days.   I'm curious, what have you heard about the sort of anti‑Japanese rallies that occurred in Shanghai three weeks ago?   Was there ever any concern for you to maybe not come to this tournament?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   No, I'm all right.   I never think about it.   It's almost settled down.   You know, I played well last year, so there's no reason to not play here.   
You know, I'm here to play tennis.   Sports can make all together.   It has big power.   Even last year, a lot of fans show up to my match.   A lot of people cheering for me.   
I love to play here.
