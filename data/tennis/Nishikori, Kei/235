  6‑1, 6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   There are four Japanese players in the draw, which is a record.   It seems like tennis is becoming more and more popular in Japan.   Do you have any explanation?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's, you know, good to see all the Japanese players on tour, especially Grand Slam.   It's, you know, great.   Ito and Soeda is doing well, getting to top 100 and almost getting to top 50.   I'm very happy to, you know, be in that position. 
I heard all the children start playing tennis and happy to hear that, you know, some kind of news like that.

Q.   Do you think one day maybe Japan could become one of the major countries in tennis?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Hopefully.   Hopefully, you know, one day tennis can be big.   Me and Kimiko used to be in the top, but still soccer and baseball still two biggest sports.
Yeah, I like to see tennis, you know, to get major.

Q.   Do you feel responsible for all the kids who are talking to play tennis?   Do you think you have a big impact on them?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I hope so.   I hope I can be one of the hope of those childrens wanting to start.
I know one guy 15 or 16.   He's very good, and we practice in Florida.
Yeah, I think a lot of juniors getting better.
