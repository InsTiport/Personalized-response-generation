4-6, 6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I just wanted to know what you think about your match and what you think about your opponent?  Second time in two weeks.  What makes him tough to play?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I started good today, I think.  But obviously he played much better second and third.  He start making more serves.  He was playing more solid from baseline.  I think he was feeling the ball much more than first set.   
Yeah, I mean, obviously he was, you know, playing everything better, you know, playing aggressive and serving better.   
If I could get, you know, few points, maybe the things change, but I couldn't.  Yeah, credit to him today.
