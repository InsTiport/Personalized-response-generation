THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Kind of a tough day for you out there.  What in particular wasn't working?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think he serve really well.  I was having really tough time with my return, missing a lot, and giving him a lot of short balls.  And he was attacking really well, first and third sets.
And, you know, little, lazy mistakes for me, I think.  Too many unforced errors especially in the third to give him too many chances, you know, to break.
And, yeah, I mean, obviously, I didn't play my best tennis today, but I think he played good tennis also.
Q. What was it about his serve that made it kind of difficult for you?  Was it the pace?  The placement?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, a little bit of everything.  The placement for sure.  And he was mixing up a lot of, you know, kick serve in front and, yeah, he was mixing up pretty well.
Q. You had gotten this far without dropping a set.  Do you feel like there was a drop off today or was it mostly to do with his game?
KEI NISHIKORI: I think a little bit of both.  I don't think I played good enough to beat Jack today.  Started a little bit slower, you know, to give him 3-Love.
And also, like I said, I think there was too many unforced errors and I wasn't, you know, playing aggressive enough to get more chance.  Think a little bit of both.
