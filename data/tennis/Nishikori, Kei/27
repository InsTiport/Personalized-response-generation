K. NISHIKORI/A. Mannarino   
6-4, 4-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was a little tight there at the end.  How did you manage it?  Was it good to have a match like that early?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah.  I mean, I have to say he was playing really well.  There was many long rallies and he defends really well.  He made me play, you know, one or two extra balls many, many times.   
I mean, I think it was good match.  I didn't play bad.  For the moment I could be more -- could be play better and may be able to finish in two sets.  But, yeah, like I said, he was playing good tennis, also.   
I think we both played good, and I think the tiebreak I played best tennis as today's match.  Yeah, really focused last tiebreak and happy to win today.   
 Q.  When I was younger, a 29-year-old was a guy we would start to ask about whether or not their career might be looking at winding down a little bit.  Your game is so predicated on movement and good health, and you've had your issues.  When you watch Roger and Rafa and these guys playing so well into their 30s, do you consider that to be something that you look forward to doing, as well?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, for sure.  Everything is getting, like, smarter and better, like, training, the treatment.  You know, I think everybody start doing more training than used to, like, ten years ago, that's for sure.   
And also see these guys, you know, playing better still, and, you know, looks like they still growing.  You know, like Roger, so many guys around 35, they still play pretty tough.  So that also gives me motivation to stay longer on the playing tour.   
And, yeah, for myself, I still feel like, you know, I'm still young, and I can see so many opportunities, and I can get better every year.  I'm really looking forward to play couple more years.
