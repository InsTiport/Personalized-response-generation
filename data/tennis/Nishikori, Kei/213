K. NISHIKORI/M. Matosevic
  6‑3, 5‑7, 6‑2, 4‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How was it today?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I'm happy to win, I mean, first of all.   You know, it was not easy condition with the heat and with the wind. 
Yeah, it's always tough to play, you know, first round.   You get tight and, you know, anything can happen. 
But I'm happy to win in fifth set.

Q.   Was there any point in the match where you had some problems with the heat?   Because you played five sets, three‑and‑a‑half hours, I think, 3:40. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Actually, not really.   Brisbane was much tougher.   It was no wind and humidity was high.   Here it's, you know, with the wind and it's dry, so it wasn't too bad, actually.
