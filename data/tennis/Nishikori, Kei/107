THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your form and your fitness arriving in Paris?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Feeling not bad.  Maybe -- I mean, a little tired from playing five matches, but I think I'm playing well and I think it's going to be important if I can do well here this week.   
So I try to put, you know, 100% here this week.   
 Q.  Have you set yourself any goals or targets for the last two tournaments of the season in Paris and in London?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, you know, like I say, I try to put everything.  Hope I do well.  I mean, nothing particular, but I try to win a lot of matches.   
 Q.  What do you think about the crowd here in Paris and all the atmosphere here?  
KEI NISHIKORI: It's great.  I love to be here in Paris.  Second time this year and I always enjoy being here.   
Great city.  Great tournament.  It's a bit different, you know, other tournaments.  You know, this week little more -- you know, little fancy, and I always enjoy playing this Bercy.
