 7-5, 7-6, 6-2
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Can you sum up today's match, please?
 KEI NISHIKORI:   Well, tough rust because I thought I was playing well but Carre√±o was playing better today.  I thought I was playing pretty high level.  For me, I played, I think, one of the best tennis so far, including last year after coming back.
 I was kind of happy, you know, the way I'm playing with this level, but still not enough to beat this guy.  I tried to keep playing, and hopefully I can start winning more matches.
