4-6, 6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had medical out for your wrist.  Is it okay?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I got to see.  It's not great but, I mean, first match on clay, you know, I'm expecting little soreness.
Well, yeah, hopefully I have day off tomorrow.  If I have to play tomorrow, I got to be ready tonight.
Q. What do you expect from this clay court season?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, hopefully I do well.  It's actually great to come back this tournament, to start.  I haven't get a lot of match done this year.  Hope I can put more matches on clay.  I always enjoy this Europe season.
Yeah, hope I can have good preparation these couple tournaments, and hope I can finish great in French.
Q. Do you still take matches like this as a test, knowing what you've come through?  Were you nervous at the beginning of the match maybe?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, not really.  I been playing, you know, enough after coming back from injury.  Well, first tournament on clay, first match today especially, so it's never easy.
You know, I feel like Tomas was struggling little bit in second, and third too.  Nobody's expecting I think 100% from first couple match.
But for me it's good, you know, I'm winning start today.  Hope I can get more confidence on clay and, yeah, do well these five tournaments on clay.
Q. Did you speak about why you called the medical for the wrist?  I missed maybe your first answer.  Can you explain what was going on.
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, it's little sore.  But, yeah, we'll see.
