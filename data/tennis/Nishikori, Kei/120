THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. How is your rib injury and how much is it affecting your game?
KEI NISHIKORI: No, it was good. It was no problem today. 

Q. You had the physio on in your last game. You're not feeling it at all now?
KEI NISHIKORI: No. 

Q. When you were feeling it, what particular stroke made you feel it? Was it every stroke or what?
KEI NISHIKORI: No, I said it was fine, so... 

Q. How far do you think you can go in this tournament?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I mean, my goal is I got to go to quarterfinal. That's going to be my first goal. 
Yeah, I've been feeling good on grass, especially today. I started playing much better after second and third set. You know, little by little I'm getting more confidence on grass court. 
Well, yeah, play one match at a time and hope I can reach to second week.
