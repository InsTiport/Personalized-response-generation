6-4, 2-6, 7-6, 4-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Tough conditions this year at Roland Garros, quite a few players getting injuries.  How do you see playing that many sets going forward, you could end up with a fifth set going long?  How do you feel about the tiebreaker?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, tiebreaker -- I had many chances and just little, little few step I think I should do well.  But he step up really well, especially fifth set.  I think he played good tennis, really credit to him.  I think he played much better in the end.  But, yes, I could finish three or four sets.
