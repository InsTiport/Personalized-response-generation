THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Could you tell us what happened exactly in Washington.  You seemed to ask for medical help, but didn't get any.  How are you feeling right now?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I did ask for medical?   
 Q.  Did you?  It seemed like you did.  
KEI NISHIKORI: No.   
 Q.  There was confusion on TV then.  
KEI NISHIKORI: I was fine (smiling).   
 Q.  Two years ago you made it into the semifinals against Andy Murray.  Last year you made it into the final against Novak Djokovic.  Following that logic, do you think this year is going to be the one for you where you actually make it through the finals?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I hope so.  I'm not still, you know, looking there yet.  I got a tough first match.  I try to think one match at a time.  If I can reach those moments, I will start thinking.   
But, yeah, I think it's going to be tough.  Rafa and Roger, you know, is playing great right now.  A couple young guys are doing well.  It's obviously tough tournament.   
Even though Djoko and Stan is not here, I think it's still tough.  But, yeah, I try to focus for myself.   
 Q.  Novak and Stan will be off for the rest of the year.  Andy is not here.  Does it feel like the top of the ranking is opening up a little bit?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Maybe, yes.  But I think, like I said, Sascha and Domi, those young guys are coming up now.  I think Andy is still going to be tough player.   
Well, yeah, I think more people is coming up to getting stronger.  But for sure, you know, we going to have more chance to get top five.  It's a little bit sad to see Djoko is injured.  He was doing really well last couple years.  Maybe sucks for tennis.   
For sure we going to have little more chance to get top.   
 Q.  Could you talk a little bit about how Michael Chang has been a mentor and his influence on you.  Also maybe the conversation about breaking through and capturing that first major...  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, we always talk about big goals, winning Masters or Grand Slam.  Yeah, I feel like, you know, still long way, but every year is getting closer.   
Yeah, he's giving me a lot of good advice, good influence.  Yeah, I think for me it's a great coach, so he's helping me a lot to get to next level.  Yeah, still needs some little more to go to get top five.  But I think every year is improving with working with Michael and Dante.
