THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you explain what you need to improve over the next years?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I guess I was making too much unforced errors today.   I have to improve.   Not many easy points to give.   
The serve wasn't good today.   I have to keep practicing well, high percentage, a little more speed.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you can climb the rankings up to which spot in the next years?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Hopefully to get top 10 maybe this year or next year.   That's my next goal.   
But it's not easy to keep this ranking.   I want to stay this ranking, whatever I can.   Everybody's close.   Hopefully couple years to get top 10.   
   
 Q.   It was only your second visit in MontrÃ©al.   What is the main reason?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I mean, it's big tournament, so everybody want to do well.   Yeah, these two Masters really important for us, especially for me.   I like hard court.   I didn't get much points last year, so hopefully I can do well here.   
   
 Q.   Can you describe the best moment of your career at this point?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   I think winning Japan Open last year.   It was some big memory for me, winning my home country.   First time in history.   I was really happy.   
   
 Q.   Who was your idol when you grew up?  
KEI NISHIKORI:   Roger.
