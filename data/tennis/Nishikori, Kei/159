THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. Is there anything wrong with you physically?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Sorry?   
   
 Q. Is there anything wrong with you physically, injury‑wise, sickness?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I mean, definitely wasn't good day for my body. But, I mean, I had a little matches before coming here, so it wasn't easy to play today.   
Yeah, I think it was good week, you know, beating Rafa first time. You know, play couple good matches.   
Yeah, unfortunately couldn't play 100% today. But I'm happy with my good week.   
   
 Q. Is it an injury or only you're tired more because of yesterday?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I think it's more tired. Everything was sore these couple days. Today got little bit worst so I couldn't really move 100% today.   
   
 Q. At what stage did you feel it was getting worse and you couldn't perform as you wanted?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Especially after first set, I was feeling more and more. Yeah, I mean, beginning of first set was okay, but after that I wasn't same player.   
   
 Q. Is this a leg injury? Do you have something, a physical problem?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, should be okay. You know, I'm going to take couple days off. I hope I can play Cincy.   
   
 Q. But there's a problem with one of your legs?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, that's fine.   
   
 Q. Does this have anything to do with the calf injury from Wimbledon?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No.   
   
 Q. How did you feel about the crowd reaction in the second set? How did you feel about it, the crowd reaction?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know. I wasn't hear anything, so...
