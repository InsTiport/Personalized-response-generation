  6‑7, 7‑6, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you have any regret on this match, or do you think there was nothing to do? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I think about he played really well; good serve.   I mean, like a lot of aces, so, you know, not much I could do.   I was playing okay.   Lots of good serves.
There was no breaks.   There was I think only few points that in tiebreak I should have done well, better.
I think it was good match.   He took some risk in tiebreak hitting good serves, good second. 
I think it was good start of the year for me. 

Q.   Do you see any change in his game since the US Open and the big match that you had? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   I mean, he's always aggressive, dangerous player.   He hits a lot of big forehands, and serve, obviously always hitting big serves.   It's not easy always to return his game. 
I don't know.   I don't think there was not many changes.

Q.   You've obviously got a lot more people following you around now media‑wise.   How conscious are you of how important you are for Asian tennis?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's great to have a lot of media around me.   Hopefully I can bring good news to Japan or Asia.   I hope Asia can make some more big players, good players on the tour. 
I think Australia is doing really well right now.   A lot of good, young players, and hopefully they can make top 10 players. 

Q.   When you made the quarterfinal at the US Open in 2012 to reaching the final in New York last year, obviously a couple years to get to that stage.   Were you starting to doubt you were capable of that, or did you always feel confident?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, took some time.   I actually didn't do well these couple years in Grand Slams.   Last year I did great, but last couple years I was a little bit struggling on Grand Slams. 
But now I have more confidence and playing better tennis and physically I'm much more fit.   I think I can make little changes hopefully this year.

Q.   How close do you feel to winning a Grand Slam? 
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   Winning might take some time, you know.   You need some luck too when you play.   But hopefully comes one day I win a Grand Slam. 
That's my dream, so hopefully I can do in few years. 

Q.   What do you take out of a match like today with three tiebreakers and no breaks of serve?   Is it a hard way to lose?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, it's always hard to play someone like him because there is not much rallies.   Today he hits like 30 aces.   Not really I could do. 
So it's really frustrating, but it's sometimes people like this, you know.   It happens.   I been playing really well this week, so hopefully I can have good preparation in Kooyong and hopefully I do well in Australian Open. 

Q.   What do you take going into the doubles final tomorrow?   Is that still important?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I think it's my first final on the ATP doubles, so very exciting.   We been playing really well with Alex.   We played first time here, but he's great doubles player. 
I'm having really fun on doubles.   Hopefully I can enjoy tomorrow.
