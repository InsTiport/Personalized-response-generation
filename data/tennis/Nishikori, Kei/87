An interview with:
KEI NISHIKORI
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just would like to get your general thoughts on how things went today, how you felt.
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, everything was good.  I think.  Returned well, obviously, to break his serve two times.
Well, it was, you know, tough match.  Obviously he's been playing well.  I know, you know, he can play great tennis, and when he was playing aggressively he was pretty tough to play.  But I think I managed really well from the first point until the end.
And my serve was -- making it in on the first serve, and I'm happy with my service game also.  So I think it was good start.
Q. What was your reaction to hearing that Andy Murray had lost last night?
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  Big surprise, for sure.  But I didn't see whole match so I cannot say anything.  But, you know, possibly -- he's, you know, good player, great serve and great, aggressive player.  So, yeah, was a little bit surprised, for sure.
Q. Do you mind playing the first match each day?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, if I have to.
Q. Would you rather be playing later, is what I'm getting at, or it doesn't really bother you what time you play?
KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, personally, I don't like to play too late, because, you know, I want to get good time to get treatment and good sleep before the match.
But, I mean, I think these two tournaments are very nice to have couple days off during the first couple rounds, and especially with this tough, tough opponents.  You know, you might use your, you know, energy a lot on the court.  So it's good to have a couple days off during these tournaments.
