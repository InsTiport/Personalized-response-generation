 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You're superstitious. I heard you don't call your parents when you are winning.   
 KEI NISHIKORI: No.  
  
  Q. You still don't call them?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: No. I want to, but I can't.   
  
  Q. Do you have other superstitions?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: It's almost same thing, but I don't talk to anybody, like almost friends during the tournament, yeah.   
  
  Q. A question about Japan and the culture. What is your favorite part of Japan's culture, manga, sushi, sake?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I used to read comics, manga. Yeah, I love sushi. I love Japanese food.   
  
  Q. Do you take pictures?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I do.   
  
  Q. Your jumping forehand is fun. Did you invent it yourself?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I used to do it when I was like little. I love that shot, so.  
  
  Q. Which shots are your favorite?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Forehand, that's my weapon. Backhand is getting better now. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. Your transfer from junior to senior tennis was smooth. What was the recipe, because many young people are not as successful as you are?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know. When I was 13, I came to U.S. I practiced with all the good players, like pros.  
  
  Q. Who did you practice with?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Tommy Haas, Max Mirnyi, Stepanek. All the top players. I guess that's why.   
  
  Q. Was the match as much fun as you hoped?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I wasn't ready to get the set. I surprised same time. I got, yeah, little tired.  
  
  Q. Because you closed out the second set with an ace. You looked very confident.   
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I was playing well. I wasn't good on grass. Like I wasn't moving well. I don't have big serve, so I was little struggling. But was playing well today.   
  
  Q. A lot of players have said that the courts are very slippery. Did you find that?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: A little bit, yeah.
