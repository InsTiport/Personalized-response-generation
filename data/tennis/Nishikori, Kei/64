7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Before we go to Japanese, any questions in English to start?   
No questions in English.  Okay.   
Actually, no.  For the transcript just, Kei, if you could talk about the match, the win for you today on clay.  In English just for our transcript purpose.   
KEI NISHIKORI: Okay.   
Well, yeah.  It wasn't easy match.  It was windy.  And, also, he used a lot of slice and great serves.  And, yeah, so tough condition for both of us, but I think I handle well his slice.   
And I think first set can be -- can go both ways.  I think he was playing good tennis, too.   
Yeah.  I mean, luckily I got first set.  And after that, I was more confident and I was playing better tennis.
