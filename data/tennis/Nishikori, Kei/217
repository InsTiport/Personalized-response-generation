  6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Very disappointing result, I guess, for you. 
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   I mean, of course, you know, it's not easy to lose first round in a Grand Slam.   But, yeah, I didn't play well and he played well.
You know, nothing I can do.

Q.   Were you surprised at all by the level that he played at?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.   Yeah, I didn't play well these three weeks, two Masters.   I thought I was getting better, but still, you know, serve wasn't there and, you know, there was a lot of unforced errors that I shouldn't do. 
And plus, you know, he played good serve and good returns.

Q.   Did you know much about him before?   Had you seen him?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Not at all.   I mean, I seen his name.   I guess he's playing well these challengers, but never seen him play before.

Q.   Were you surprised on court about how well he came out and played such a big match his first US Open?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah, I think‑‑ I guess he has no pressure.   He was playing a little aggressive, and I was kind of, you know, tight.   Tight start, and that makes difficult game for me. 

Q.   Do you have any physical issues this summer?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Not really, no.

Q.   Do you plan to play Davis Cup?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Yeah.

Q.   I mean, which way these results or these weeks impact the chances of Japan in the next tie?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   Hopefully I can play well, better than, you know, these matches.   I try to practice these two weeks and try to be ready for next tie.

Q.   How do you see Tokyo for the Olympic bid, and if you spoke with Rafa or David?
KEI NISHIKORI:   No.

Q.   How do you see Tokyo for the Olympic bid?
KEI NISHIKORI:   I don't know.   Hopefully it comes, but I don't know.   It's still long way to go, so hopefully it comes to Japan. 

Q.   Do you think that Japan is going to be the favorite in the Davis Cup tie?
KEI NISHIKORI:   Um, I don't know.   It's close.   I mean, the Colombia has good team, good two singles and good doubles, and it's going to be tough.
Hopefully it's in Japan, so hopefully we have, you know, good support and hopefully we can win match.
