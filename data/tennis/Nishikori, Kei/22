(Transcribed from recorded ATP audio.)   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the match, playing Taylor, essentially playing twice today.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Feel very good.  Very good start.  It wasn't easy match because the court was little bit quicker for him a little bit.   
Yeah, played very solid match first and second sets.  I haven't played two matches in one day long time.  I will see how it goes.  Luckily I finish quickly.   
Yeah, should be okay physically.  Looking forward to play next one.
