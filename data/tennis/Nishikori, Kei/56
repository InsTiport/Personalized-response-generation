THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What do you like about the game on grass, and what don't you like about it?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, points finish much faster than the other courts and surface.  I mean, everybody has to play little more aggressive, I guess, more than the other surface.   
I like to play at net.  It's been working well.  Yeah, I think serve and return is very important here.  Yeah, you got to really commit yourself to play very solid tennis.  Yeah, if you give them one chance, the game will change soon.   
But, yeah, I mean, so far I don't have good result yet, but I like to play.   
 Q.  How has it been to knock out your friend and training partner?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, not easy.  I mean, if I can have choice, I don't want to play with good friends.  He's having really tough tennis life.  He has so many injuries, you know, he can't do anything.  But he's coming back all the time.  He's one of the hard workers on the tour, I think.   
Yeah, I see him all the time with injuries.  It's kind of similar to me.  More than me, but...  He's having really tough time.  Happy to see him on main draw here.  I mean, not easy to play with.  Happy to see him.  He was playing good tennis again.  Hope he can keep going.  I'm sure he's going to break top 100 soon.
