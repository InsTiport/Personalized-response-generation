 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Did you feel like you were under a lot of pressure to win that game today? Did the pressure affect you?   
 KEI NISHIKORI: No, I didn't have any pressure 'cause, of course, he's good and he's seeded. It was a little windy. But, no, I just didn't play well today.   
  
  Q. What happened after the 5-3 lead?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I went too fast, I guess, tried to win too early. Too many unforced errors. Yeah, I had so many chance, but...   
  
  Q. Then the match quickly got away from you after the first set?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I went a little down mentally I think, couldn't make any balls. No first serves. So, yeah, I couldn't play well today.   
  
  Q. Was the heat a factor?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Little bit, but was okay 'cause went too quick, so...   
  
  Q. Maybe because you lost the first set you went mentally down because you thought you had to play three more sets in that heat to win the match?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I thought little bit. But, still, yeah, it wasn't too bad.   
  
  Q. Do you take any positives out of this match?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I had a chance in the first set, 5-3, 5-4. So, yeah, if I had to get the game, maybe change, hold the game.   
 But not many things today.   
  
  Q. Your nickname at the academy is Project 45. Do you feel there's a lot of expectation on you or that you put on yourself?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: No, it's one of my goal, but it's not like final goal. I counted like my ranking sometimes. No, it doesn't give me pressure or something.   
  
  Q. Like the other guys joking around with you about it?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: What do you mean?   
  
  Q. The nickname, is it one you take seriously or is it a bit of a joke?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know. Someone just made up, so... I'm not really into it. It's one of my goal.   
  
  Q. What about all this media attention from your home country, does that give you extra pressure?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, not many guys to get like this chance. It's good feeling.   
  
  Q. You enjoy it?  
 KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, I'm enjoying it.
