  K. NISHIKORI/L. Mayer6-4, 6-2, 6-3THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. How happy are you obviously to get through to the next round?KEI NISHIKORI: Quite happy (smiling).  Played, yeah, another good match today.  It was a little bit struggle in the third, but finished well.  Looking forward to play next round.Q. How healthy are you?  Are you 100%, or are there things still bothering you a little bit?KEI NISHIKORI: Actually, pretty good.  Only the first match was a little bit I was nervous about my injury.  I was kind of trying to find out how much I can play, but now very confident.  A little bit sore everywhere, but otherwise it's almost 100%. Feeling pretty good.Q. How will playing Milos be different here than it was at Wimbledon?KEI NISHIKORI: Yeah, hopefully I can get more returns in, because last match he was hitting so many aces and hitting good serves and, you know, I couldn't do anything my return game. For sure it's going to be different game here.  Still, you know, fast court here.  It's going to be tough to get his serve.  But, you know, I have been playing well.  Try to focus my service game and try to play another good match.Q. What do you different returning his serve than returning most other players' serve?KEI NISHIKORI: Well, obviously really fast.  I think he has very good control his serve.  He mix up kick serve and slice.  That's what he does good. But, you know, I been hitting good returns here.  Little bit different because he had a great serve than other players. But, you know, stay focused and try to stay down and try to make many as I can.Q. What part of your game do you like this week?KEI NISHIKORI: Actually, everything is going well, especially -- I don't know.  My backhand is going well.  Stepping in a lot.  Try to be aggressive for both forehand and backhand. It's been very decent, you know, everything.
