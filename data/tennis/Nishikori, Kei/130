6-3, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How satisfying to be in another semifinal?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  It's great feeling.  First time semifinal here, and I played another good match against a tough player, against Thiem.  So very happy.   
 Q.  You have some ice on your leg there.  What happened?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, a little bit sore.  I've gotta see how it's gonna react tomorrow, but I hope it's okay.   
 Q.  Is it a new problem or something that happened during tonight's match?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No, during the match.   
 Q.  And your general level, the way you played during the course of the match, were you happy with it?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah.  I think it was tough opponent.  He hits very heavy both ways.  Great backhands, also.  Not much weakness.   
So it was really a battle of groundstrokes, baseline.  But I think at the moment I played really well.  I return well.  I tried to stay back, because, you know, I knew he has a great serve, great kick serve, too.   
Yeah, I tried to make some adjustment and it worked.  Very happy the way I'm playing.   
 Q.  Assuming you're okay to play tomorrow, I mean, what will you learn from your previous semifinal with Novak in Madrid that you can apply tomorrow?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, it's gonna be another tough match, but I felt really close last week against Novak, so I'm really looking forward to play again.   
Well, yeah, I hope I can play good level.  If I can play, you know, good tennis I think I will have some good chance.  So try to focus well and recover well tonight.   
 Q.  How concerned are you by the injury, though?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  I've gotta see.
