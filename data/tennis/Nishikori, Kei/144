THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did the match go, from your perspective?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I sort of have a good start.  But when I lost the game with my serve, everything start, you know, changing.  He start playing much better.  I lost little bit confidence, start missing a lot.   
Yeah, that was really important game that I lost.  You know, it's cause many, many things.  But, yeah, he played a good level.  He's playing good tennis again.  Well, I had some chance in third set, but couldn't keep up my level.   
Yeah, really disappointed for my game.  But he played good tennis.   
 Q.  Why do you think it was so difficult to hold serve after the break?  
KEI NISHIKORI: He returned well that game, both games.  I think I rushed little bit, too.  I was missing some easy shot that I shouldn't miss.   
Yeah, the third set I had most of chance, but I couldn't convert.  Yeah, couldn't keep up my tennis.   
 Q.  Was this the best you've seen Novak play?  
KEI NISHIKORI: I don't know.  Could be.  I think today was more my game.  You know, I was missing too much, especially first couple sets.  Lost many easy games.  I couldn't make him work hard today.   
I mean, yes, he's plays good.  But couldn't play good tennis today.
