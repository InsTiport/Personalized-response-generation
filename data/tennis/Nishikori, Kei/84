THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel physically out there today?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, wasn't 100%, but I mean, physically, I mean, it was tough condition for me.   
But, I mean, was also same for him, too.  He was playing a lot of the long matches, but I think he still played good enough to beat me today.   
 Q.  Do you have any specific injury?  
KEI NISHIKORI: No.  Just, I mean, couple spots really hurting, but I don't think it's big deal.  Should be fine.   
 Q.  What do you think about your serve?  Second serve looked a bit shorter than usual.  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I think I couldn't hit 100%, so that's why I tried to manage somehow.   
Especially with these guys, not easy to win the match if you're not 100% or 80% or 100%.   
Yeah, especially the serve was tough to hit today.   
 Q.  How do you plan to recover in the next few days?  What's the plan for the short-term?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, I have three weeks to Barcelona, so I have a lot of time to recover well.  For sure few days no tennis, and, yeah, try to recover well soon as possible.   
 Q.  Did he surprise you how well he played?  Catch you by surprise?  
KEI NISHIKORI: Well, yeah, I think he played good enough.  I don't think he played extremely well today.  I think for me, I had too many unforced errors and my serve wasn't there today, so I think that's cost most of the match.   
But, yeah, still, I think he played good tennis.
