A. RADWANSKA/A. Kerber
  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Did you ever really get into the match?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think it was a good match.   I mean, she played very well today.   I give my best, but she was better today. 
So, yeah. 

Q.   Is it more disappointing than your previous Grand Slam semifinal in the US Open?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, it's different.   I mean, I lost today also against a very good player.   She played very well. 
So actually it was a great tournament for me.   I mean, I'm in the semis here in Wimbledon.   I give today everything I can.   Yeah, so it's okay. 
I mean, sure, I'm a little bit disappointed, but yeah. 

Q.   Do you think your friend can win the final?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.   I mean she played a very good tournament here and she's still in the tournament.   I think she had for sure some chances in the final.

Q.   If she's playing Serena, what do you think she would need to do?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   She needs to play, yeah, her game.   I mean, she played very well.   She moves very well on this court, make not many mistakes.   So if she will play like today, I think she has a good chance.
Q.   Do you think you might have had to take some more risks today?   She's so steady.   Maybe you didn't take enough chances?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Maybe.   But it's tough to say.   I mean, I really try my best.   I think I was maybe one, two steps slower today.   I think that makes the difference. 

Q.   Looking back over the tournament this is a side issue ‑ there have been complaints about the footing and so forth.   Did you have any bad bounces that troubled you that you lost points?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Today? 
Q.   Today or earlier. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   I mean, it's grass.   You know that it could happen that the ball, it's maybe not bouncing like on hard court.   But it was okay.   I had‑‑ no, not really. 

Q.   Did you ever have any feelings you might slip because of the grass?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   It was fine. 

Q.   I hear you spent some time yesterday with Steffi Graf.   Did you know her before?   What was she telling you?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, I meet her yesterday for my first time.   We just spoke like 10 minutes about everything.   I mean, she told me just that I had good last months and playing very well, and also to go out there having fun and enjoying this.   Yeah, try my best, and doesn't matter what's happen. 
I think I do a good job also in the two weeks here.   I'm very happy about, yeah, reaching the semis here. 
Q.   Talk to us a little bit about the challenge of playing Radwanska. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, my plan was playing aggressive tennis and make the points, but she moved very well and makes not so many mistakes, so it was really tough to play really constant, you know, and make winners against her today. 
But I try to fighting until the last point.   I mean, yeah, what can I say?   I mean, she played a very, very good match. 
Q.   Will you make any changes in your training as you go forward toward the US Open? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   Nothing.   I stay with the same.
