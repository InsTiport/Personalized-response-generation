A. KERBER/Y. Wickmayer
  6‑1, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   1‑4 down in that second set, you said courtside that you were told by your coach, Have belief in yourself; keep focusing.   At what point did he tell you that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, he was coming to me and just tell me and remember me to the game plan which we had before the match, and just tell me just focusing on my game, playing point by point, and believe in my, you know, my game.
It helps me, actually. 

Q.   At what stage in the second set did he tell you that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   1‑4. 

Q.   At 1‑4? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.

Q.   Must be nice to get some wins under your belt after a tough Middle East swing for you.   So how is your confidence going into the rest of the tournament?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, it's for sure better right now.   Before the tournament I was, you know, not sure about how the back will feel after matches.
Now my confidence is of course back and I feel good, and I'm looking forward to play tomorrow again.

Q.   And the back is 100% now?   Like can you go out there and play and not think about it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Of course I'm still thinking about this a little bit, but it's much better, yeah. 

Q.   It's supposed to start to get hot this week.   You can feel it today a bit.   Do you change your routine at all, or what sort of in your mindset shifts as the weather gets warmer?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Actually, I'm not thinking about this.   I'm just try to ‑‑for me, it's I think better if it's like this, like today, and not too cold. 
I like to play in the weather condition like today, so I think it's good for my game.

Q.   What about when it gets even hotter? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   We will see.   (Smiling) I tell you later. 

Q.   Did you feel the earthquake this morning?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, I felt it.   I was talking with my coach in the garden and everything was shaking.   In the first moment we both were thinking, you know, it's like a subway here, but actually we are in the desert.   No way that there is a subway.
But, yeah, I was feel.   That it was my first one.
