6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Have you ever had that happen to you before match point?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No.  No, and you don't want that happen like this.  I mean, I didn't know what exactly happened, but she told me that she, I don't know, slide and with the head on the floor.   
But yeah, I mean, at the end it's good that nothing happen.  I think this is the most important thing.   
 Q.  This time of the evening, we have been lucky to get a full day of play, but can you just explain what the court is like as the shadow comes across?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it's not so easy.  I mean, the conditions are really tough.  Especially with the last days where we are waiting the whole days and walking on court, walking off.  Then it's sunny, and then we have half shadow, half sun on court.  So it was really tough out there.  Especially also now at the end of the day it was a little bit slippery because it's getting night, it's getting cold.   
Yeah, I mean, it is like it is (smiling).   
 Q.  Do you feel happy that you got some grass court play under your belt?  How do you feel now heading off to London?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think at the end it was a good match.  I mean, she played good in the important moments.  I think she served very well today.  I think that was the key for the match.   
Actually, I'm feeling good.  I had three matches right now before going to Wimbledon.  This was my goal, to have matches.  Yeah, and now I will try to make my focus on from tomorrow, just only on Wimbledon and, yeah, trying to improving from this week next weeks.   
 Q.  You spoke earlier about the pleasure of playing here.  Have you any reflections on this week?  Any amusing stories or any sort of warm anecdotes or warm memories?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: This week, no, just waiting and hopefully that the rain will stop (smiling).  I think that was the only thing we did the last days here.
