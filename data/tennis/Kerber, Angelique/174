THE MODERATOR: Questions for Angelique Kerber.   
 Q.  Could you tell us what went wrong, especially in the second set?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I think it was completely not my day.  That's actually it.  I was not feeling the ball.  I was not finding my rhythm at all.   
At the end, it was actually not my day.  I made too many mistakes.  It was not my game.   
 Q.  Did you feel that before actually the start of the match?  Is it part of the difficulty of starting again in a tournament after such a high that you had last month?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, for sure it's a completely new situation for me.  But, still, actually I was practicing very well in the last few days.  But today, also my practice this morning was not the best.  So I was feeling, yeah, not good from the beginning.   
So I think, yeah, you have sometimes days like this.  Of course it's sad that's the first round here in Doha for me.  Still, I mean, it was not my day.  That's all I can say today.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the disappointment of it today.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course I'm disappointed.  When you lose, you're always disappointed.  But, yeah, we try to not make big deal about this match.   
I mean, I've played so many good matches this year, so I will try to take just the positive things and also the good practice days I had here.  Sometimes you have days like this and, yeah.   
 Q.  Was it something you talked about with your coach, how it might be coming back to tournaments after winning the Australian Open?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, it's a completely new situation for me.  But of course I was trying to give everything I could.  But I think at the end, yeah, it's tough.   
But, you know, I have a lot of confidence from the last weeks and it's still there.  But today I was just feeling that nothing works.  I mean, I made too many mistakes.  I was not moving so well and my serve was not the best.   
So everything comes together today and that's why it was not my day.   
But, yeah, I mean, like I said, I will not make a drama about today.  Still I have few more tournaments to go.  We just start the year.  So, yeah, I think still everything is on a good way.   
 Q.  Next is Indian Wells?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I go to Indian Wells.   
 Q.  Your return in Fed Cup, was it a little bit easier for you to handle than this one?  I mean, it's totally different circumstances, but it was also post --  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's completely different.  I mean, I can't, like, you know, say what was easy or what was --- it's completely different because now here, it's a new tournament.  It was the next tournament after Australia.   
I tried my best, but it was not working because I was really not playing very good today.  I was playing really not good.   
 Q.  Was it a case of lack of match fitness or reacting to pressure for the first time as a Grand Slam champion?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know if it was the pressure or no.  I know, of course, pressures from the last years, but maybe it was both.  It was more like -- I mean, I can't say nothing else.   
I mean, I was feeling this morning also not good when I was practicing.  This is actually what I can say, I don't know how many mistakes I did today.  This is not my game, to make so many mistakes.  I was trying to go for it.  I think it was more like I was not feeling my game and not finding my rhythm.
