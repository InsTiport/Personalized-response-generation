6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just didn't really seem to happen for you today.  You came back a little bit in the first set, but after that you didn't really get into Elena's game.  Can you talk about it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think she played good.  I was not playing good.
It was actually not my day.  I was doing a lot of mistakes.  I was not moving, actually, good.
But it's happened.  I mean, she played from the beginning until the end good tennis, and she was aggressive.  So, yeah, she took the game on her hand.
Q. Is there anything positive you can take out of it?  You snapped the three-match losing streak, so there's some good come out of it.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, for sure.  I will take the positive things from this tournament.  And, yeah, I mean, I will just sit down later maybe with my team and my coach and we will discuss about the positives and, yeah, just going forward.
Q. Any reason you felt your game wasn't there today?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I mean, you have days sometimes like this.  And like I said, she played very good.  I couldn't find my game, actually.
But I was trying.  I was trying in the first set and also in the second set, but she played a good match today.
Q. Both 2015 and 2016 were long seasons for you in terms of the number of events that you played and, you know, you ran down every ball, and that's kind of your trademark.  But in terms of longevity and kind of, you know, maintaining a high level, that seems like a very high ask to sustain.  Are you looking at your schedule at all and are you thinking about maybe moderating it a bit?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I know my schedule right now actually for the whole year, because we know it every year we start the season.  So of course I'm trying to focusing more on the big tournaments and doing a little bit less.  But, I mean, there are a lot of tournaments of the year you play.
Q. So what would you consider a good year for you this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, a good year is always when I'm sitting down at the end of the year and I can say I did my best.
I mean, of course, for me it's important to do my best every single tournament.  Yeah, playing a consistent year.  You have always up-and-downs during a year.   I mean, to trying to improving my game is always a goal for me, so let's see what the year brings, beginning of the year.
Q. When you set such a high standard like you did in 2016, does it make it a bit tougher to...
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Sorry.  Can you say it again?
Q. You set a very high standard in 2016.  You won a lot of tournaments and a lot of matches.  Does that make it tougher when you don't meet that standard every tournament now?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I'm not looking back on the tournaments.  You know, it's a completely new year, new tournament, and every tournament starts from zero.  For me, I think I get used to the pressure and everything.  So I start every tournament from zero.  I going out there to play my matches, trying to win it.
And this is what counts for me.  So I'm not comparing this year to the last years.
