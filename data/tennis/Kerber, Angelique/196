A. KERBER/K. Siniakova
  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you feel about the match? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I'm feeling good actually.   I think it was a very close match.   I mean, the score was not so close, but every single game was like advantage, deuce. 
She played very well today, but I knew this before the match because I saw the matches from her.   And she beat also Andrea, so I knew it was be tough match. 
I was ready for that and very happy about my performance on grass right now.

Q.   What was the support like from the crowd out there? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, the crowd, it's amazing.   I love to play here on the centre court.   I mean, the fans are so nice and supporting you.   So it's always nice to play in front of so many guys that are supporting you.

Q.   Looking forward to the semifinal?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.   Yes, I'm really looking forward.   It's the first time in the semis here, and I really enjoy my week.   Yeah, since the like five years ago I was here my last time, so it's nice to be back.
I'm looking forward to play tomorrow my semis.

Q.   Feeling fit?   No niggles?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, actually I'm feeling very fit and ready.   I practice very hard in the last few weeks to be ready on grass, and it's good to have a lot of matches, close matches, before Wimbledon.

Q.   Do you believe you can go on and win this now that you've got this far?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think it's still a long way, but of course I will try my best. 
Right now I will just focus on my next match, and then let's see how far I can go here.
