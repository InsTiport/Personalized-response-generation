    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   If you could, just talk about the match.   She gave you a bit of a fight out there.   Just talk about it.   Does it feel good to get through that?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, I'm feeling good I won the close match.   It was not easy.   She was playing very good from the first point.   She is very young and talented player.
    It was not easy for me until the last point.   I needed to give everything I had today.   It was tough, but I'm very happy that I am in the third round now.

Q.   Talk about this tournament.   Each of the Grand Slams has sort of a different flavor.   A lot of people thrive off the energy and some people find it distracting.   Where do you fall on that?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   For me, it's one of my favorite Grand Slams because everything start for me here in my career.   It's always special when I'm coming back.   I have such great memories.
    I just take the positive energy from here and also from Manhattan.   And, yeah, it's a great city, great tournament, and I really enjoy my stay always here.

Q.   I know it's always one match at a time, but have you set a certain benchmark or goal for yourself in this tournament?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   So my goal is just enjoy every round.   So now I just really keep my focus from round to round.   Now I'm happy to win my second round, and I think today at the evening I will sitting down with my coach and think about the next round.

Q.   Is there anything that surprised you about her game?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I knew before that she is young and she is really talented, and I saw it today on court because she was playing really well.
    Yeah, I think she has a future, for sure, because, yeah, like I said, she played well until the last point.   It was not easy for me, so I'm sure she will play also good in the next tournament.

Q.   Were you a little bit tired at the end?   Do you think she was tired a bit, too?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I mean, I was not thinking about if I'm tired or not.   Of course I feel the match, but I was just focusing from point to point.   Right now I'm feeling good.

Q.   Was this one of your biggest wins of the summer?   You seemed very happy after, when you celebrated. 
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, because, you know, it's the last Grand Slam here, and it's of course a big tournament.   I really tried to play my best in every game and in every match. 
    So I was fighting, and I just gave my best until the last point.   Doesn't matter if I win or if I lose, I just said after the match that I gave everything I had.
    Of course, I'm a very emotional person, so I think I show it also today on court.

Q.   Is there extra motivation from having the success you did in '11 and '12 and then this year at the Grand Slams you haven't quite gotten to that level? 
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Of course.   I'm a lot of motivation also here at a Grand Slam, at the last one, because, yeah, you know, it's always a big one, and I will give everything I can. 
    Yeah, I also practiced very hard in the last few weeks, so that's why I'm also try to show it on court.

Q.   You have been playing near the top for a while now.   Do you feel like you're more used to the pressure?   What did it take to get to that point?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Of course I feel the pressure, but right now I'm not thinking about this.   I mean, when the year start I feel the pressure more.   I think I did the pressure more myself, you know, to go to the tournaments and wanted to win every match. 
    But right now I will just enjoy it again and having fun out there.   Try to give my best and not thinking about pressure, about points, about rankings, nothing.   I will just try to give my best and play my tennis and, yeah, and feel good.

Q.   How do you explain the second set when you lost five games in a row?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I don't know (smiling).   I don't know what happened there, but I think there was a little upset with my concentration, you know.   I was not focused enough after I won the first game in the second set.   After that I was not anymore on court.   I was, I don't know, with my focus around but not on the court.
    I was try to came back, but then it was too late in the second set.   And, yeah, and then I take the change break and coming back in the third set and just try to be there from the first point and try to focusing from point to point.
    I think it works well at the end.
