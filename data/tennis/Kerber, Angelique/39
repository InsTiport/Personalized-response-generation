THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how challenging was it to play a home favorite?  And what is wrong with your right knee?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know yet.  I have to check.
Then, yeah, it was not an easy match for me.  I was not feeling the best at the beginning of the match, but then I was playing better and better.  Yeah, at the end she played a good third set.  Yeah, she took her chances and played a really solid match.
Q. Do you think you are too tired to compete at your best level in the third set?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I think it was not because of I'm tired or not.  I think I tried what I could, but she had always the answer, especially in the third set.
Yeah, I think, like I said, she played a really good match.  Yeah, feels good to play here in front of her home crowd.  Yeah, I mean, at the end just one can win, and she won today.
Q. How much do you have in the tank physically and emotionally after this year, particularly thinking about the first half of your year, so many matches, highs, Wimbledon?  How are you feeling right now?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Right now I am feeling that I will go home, have few days off, and then getting ready for Singapore.  I know that I have one more tournament to go, and I will put everything in the next tournament what I have left in my body, in my mind, mentally and everything, try to, yeah, compete on my best in Singapore then.
