A. KERBER/L. Robson
  6‑2, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. A different outcome to the last time you played Laura. Talk us through how you felt that game went. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it was a different match than, like, few years ago completely. I think the first two games I need to start my rhythm. So after, like, the first few games, I was playing better and better. 
It's always tough to play against her because she's also a lefty. I remember, of course, a little bit the match few years ago. Yeah, I was trying to staying focused and playing my game, like the plan was, playing my game and being aggressive by myself. 

Q. A lot has happened since then. How much did the last match actually play in your mind?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Like, on the court, not too much. But before I was thinking a little bit about this match because I was playing against her and I was also with Torben, with my coach now. We spoke a little bit about the match yesterday. 
But, yeah it happened so much in the years after that I was trying, you know, playing from zero, a new game, a new day. That was actually in my mind. 

Q. It was just what you needed at the moment, wasn't it, a confident win on a big stage?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yes, always nice to play on the big stage, especially here in Wimbledon. I mean, I like this tournament so much. I have great memories. I reached the semis one year. 
Yeah, but it's always tough to play the first few rounds at the Grand Slam. I'm happy that I win my first round here, of course. After the first‑round loss in Paris, it's great to start the tournament like this. 

Q. Serena is headed for 300 weeks at No.1. You're one of the four players that has a mathematical shot to catch her. I know you're thinking one match at a time here. Do you see yourself as a player that can get to that No.1 ranking? Is it a dream of yours?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course, it's a dream. I reach already No. 2 in the world. The No.1 is the next step, I think. 
But still it's so far away right now. There are a lot of good players. You must play really consistent, good year to be the No.1 at the end of the year. 
Yeah, I mean, well done to Serena. She's the No.1 yet. Yeah, of course, it's a dream. Still I need to do a lot to reach this. 

Q. Are you playing doubles here?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, just singles.
