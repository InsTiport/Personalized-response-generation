A. KERBER/S. Stosur
6-4, 6-1
Q. How did you feel playing your first match here?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I think the weather conditions were a little bit strange and tricky today.  It was really windy.  The sun was a little bit on court.  At the end I think it was for both of us like that.  And yeah, I'm actually, I'm happy about the first round.  I mean the first rounds are always tricky, especially for me, so that's why I think that, yeah, it was a good match, good start of the tournament for me.
Q. Is it one of those matches where because of the weird conditions that it's harder to kind of get a sense as to how you're playing and, you know, the conditions and all that or do you feel like even getting through a match like that that you know kind of where your level is here?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think of course, it's tougher and like I am still not sure where my level is because I mean it was a little bit different than also when you are hitting the balls during the day.  But I mean you play points, you play matches.  You have situations.  So it's always good to have, yeah, the first match in your bag and, yeah, go on to another one.
Q. Physically, everything's good?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah.  I'm feeling good.  The match was not too long, and I was doing a lot of practice the last few weeks and few days.  So I'm feeling good physically.
Q. Got a big opponent coming up next in Konta.  So you've guys have had some battles before.  What makes her a difficult opponent and what do you think will be the key for you?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, it's always not easy to playing against Johanna.  I mean she played good in the last few months, and I think it's more important that I find my rhythm playing my own game like I was practicing and playing the last few weeks.  So I just try to focusing more on my game on my side of the court and not thinking too much about her game.
Q. And with the way that you started and the way that you've been playing in January, is it less nerve wracking when you take the court?  I know first round matches everybody says they're nervy, they're nervous matches.  But do you feel calmer on court these days?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah.  I'm feeling much more calmer.  I'm feeling much relaxed, and I know that I was working hard.  I know that I can, yeah, play good tennis and I think, yeah, the few weeks at the beginning of the year gives me the confidence back that I can fight, I can play, I can play long matches again.  And yeah, I think it's more that I have the feeling on court again.
