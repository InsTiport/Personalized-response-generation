A. KERBER/Kr. Pliskova
4-6, 6-1, 7-5
Q. How does it feel to be back on this surface again?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It feels good.  Always the first rounds are always tough.  I think it was a good match for both of us.  It's so nice to be back here in Eastbourne.  I mean, I played twice finals here.  So many great memories, the fans and on this court.
It's raining, but everybody is here.  So it's really great to have everybody here supporting us during the week.
Q. You worked very, very hard for the victory.  What made the difference in that final set?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think she was serving very well, and I was trying to really focusing on my return.  At the end of the match, I was focusing, playing point by point and just, yeah, trying to going for it if I had the chance.  I'm happy that I'm, yeah, through.
Q. And many right-handers don't particularly like facing left-handed players.  How is it for a left-hander to play against a lefty who also has a very good serve, as well?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it's a little bit difficult.  I mean, we are playing most of all against right-handers, and it's not so easy to play against a lefty, as well, especially if there are two on court.  But, yeah, I think I played so many matches against left-handers, so it's fine right now.
Q. We asked Novak how much he had been enjoying being here in Eastbourne and what he'd been able to get out and do.  Have you gone out to Beachy Head, as well?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, two days ago it was really sunny weather here.  I walked on the beach.  It's a great place to be.
There are a lot of places you can go for a coffee break.  Yeah, it's nice to be here.
