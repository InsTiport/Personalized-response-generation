An interview with:
ANGELIQUE KERBER
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Very nice way to start the tournament.  Are you happy with how things went with the match?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I feel very well from the first point.  I just went out, tried to play my game, and it works.  So I'm happy about my performance today.
The first rounds are always tough.  I knew it's not easy, but at the end I'm proud about my game.
Q. Talk about your expectations coming in.  You had up and down results this year.  You won on all four surfaces, obviously not the results you have wanted in the Grand Slams.  Do you feel right now you're ready -- you have been to the semis here before.  Do you feel right now you've got the game to kind of go deep in this tournament?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I have not really much expectation, because I came here to really looking from round to round and be ready every single day.
So then let's see at the end how far I get here.  But I will not make like my expectation too high.  So that's not me.  I'm here to try to get my practice, like how I practice, trying to make it during my matches, and then let's see how far I can get here.
Q. How important is it for you to have a bit of a run here to kind of finish off the year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, of course, I mean, that's the last Grand Slam of the year and it's one of my favorite because for me it starts everything here.  It's always very special to be here again.
I'm feeling good.  I practice very well.  Today I think I start the tournament very well, so I'm just looking forward to play my next matches.
