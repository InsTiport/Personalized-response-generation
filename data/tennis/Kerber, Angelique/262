  E. BALTACHA/A. Kerber 
6-3, 2-6, 7-5

 Q. Did you think you were unlucky to lose that in the end? 
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think so. But yeah, the third set was unlucky for me. She had so many nets. Yeah, normally I have a lot of chances in the third set. It was 4-2 for me, and I have two times at 5-4 and 6-5 my serve, and yeah -- she played well. She played good tennis today. But yeah, I was a little bit unlucky. She was happy and lucky, and well done for her.

 Q. You seemed to get a bit annoyed about a couple of calls, a bit dubious maybe?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: Maybe (laughing).

 Q. Did you think they were dubious? Did you think they were out rather than in?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think so, but what can I do? 

 Q. I mean, obviously she was the home player, the Brit. Do you think that sort of played in her favor a little bit?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, maybe, maybe a little bit. But nothing to do. What can I do?
