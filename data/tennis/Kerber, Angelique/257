THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You must feel that's the match that got away from you?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, but, I mean, she was playing very well in important moments and also when I had the match points.   So actually I couldn't do nothing.  
Yeah, she won the match, and she played very well today.   But, I mean, it was just a practice week actually for me before, and I had a lot of great matches, and I won also some good matches here, so now I'm ready for the next week in Wimbledon.  
   
 Q.   You had five match points.   That must be very disappointing that you couldn't...   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, but, I mean, I also had this year some matches where I was match points down and won the matches, so now it's me that's had the match points.  
But like I say, she played very well in the moments, and I couldn't do nothing.   So, yeah, well done to her.  
   
 Q.   You said it's a practice week.   In terms of that, you must be delighted that you've managed to get to the final?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, sure.   I mean, it was a great week for me.   Actually, okay, I lost today, but still I was in the final.   It was I think actually a good match today.   I do everything I can.   
But, yeah, she was better today, and well done.  
   
 Q.   How difficult were the conditions?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   The weather?   
   
 Q.   How difficult were the conditions?   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, it was better than yesterday.   I mean, it's still a little bit windy but not like yesterday.   I mean, it was okay for me.  
   
 Q.   You said you wanted to get the tournament out of the way.   Now your focus is on Wimbledon.   What are your thoughts on the tournament?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, now my focus is on Wimbledon.   I think I play my first round against Lucie Hradecka.   It will be another tough match against her, but I mean, I feel good.   
Now I have a lot of confidence to go to Wimbledon and hope to continue my good play there.  
   
 Q.   Would you expect to have a big, long run in the competition?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   In Wimbledon?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I hope.   I mean, I will look round to round and see what happen and see how far I will go in Wimbledon, but it's of course one of my favorite Grand Slams there, and I will for sure enjoy it.
