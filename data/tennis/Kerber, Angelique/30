6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A few words on today's match, generally how you're feeling.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I'm feeling good.  I think it was a good match from my side.  I mean, yeah, I was trying to playing, yeah, from the first point until the last one really, like, aggressive, serving good, really focusing on the moment on court.
I think, yeah, I was playing good.  Especially in the second set, it was a little bit close, that I was there and I really took the match in my hand.
Q. What is it about her game that can be challenging?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, first she's also a lefty, so it's always a little bit different to play.  Then she was serving good.  She really, yeah, hits the ball hard and tough.  So I was trying to, you know, bringing a lot of balls back.  Also, like I said, being aggressive.
Yeah, I mean, I think she's a good player.  I mean, she really played well.  It was, yeah, close games, as well.
Q. You play a young Australian next.  She's had a big summer so far.  Do you know much about her?  What are you anticipating there?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Not really.  I mean, I saw little bit the match today against Vekic, but just a little bit.  I mean, she has nothing to lose.  She is trying to playing her best tennis against the best players.
You know, I know it will not be easy.  She beat good players in the last few weeks.  For me it's more like the last two matches, as well, to focusing on me, to trying to enjoying my tennis and trying to taking the match in my hand.  That's more the game plan I have also for the next matches, doesn't matter against who I'm playing.
Q. When you do come up against a player you haven't played before, what is your mindset?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, first before the match I will talk with some people who knows the player, also maybe like watching few games of the opponent.  But, of course, it's always, yeah, different when you go on court, you step and you play against her.
Always need, like, few games, then you know, okay, she's playing hard, she plays more topspin.  Then you have the feeling, and, yeah, then you feel actually how she's playing.  But the focus is always more on my side.
Q. Would you like one year not to be playing on your birthday?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Every year it's the same.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a good omen to play also on my birthday.
