THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk through the match, how you were feeling physically, and what the challenge was that Lauren presented.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, I was trying to finding my game the whole match actually.  I was not really feeling good from the beginning.  I don't know why.  I mean, the energy was not there.
Yeah, she played good.  She played very well in the last set, as well.  Yeah, I tried.  She is also really tricky opponent.  Yeah, she played a lot of slice.  She moved good in the third set.
Yeah, I was not able to finish the match in the way I would like to.
Q. When you say the energy was a bit low throughout the match, when you woke up this morning, did it feel it was tough to get going or was it just once you got out there it was hard to get the energy?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, it was just when I went out there.  I mean, I was trying to pushing myself.  Also in the first set.  I mean, I won the first set, but I was not really feeling like that I'm playing good.  It was more that I was, yeah, trying to finding my game.  Also in the second set, third set.
Like I said, she played well.  She was going for it.  She took the match in her hand.  I was too defensive in the important moments.
Q. Karolina was in here and said that No. 2 court tends to play slower.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It is really slower, that's true.  It is slower.  That is also what I thought in the warming up already, that the court is slower.  But it's not an excuse, no.
Q. What's the overarching emotion?  Disappointment of course.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, of course I'm disappointed.  Of course, it's not the way I would like to finish here or to play here.  But you have sometimes days like that.  You have to accept it.  You have to learn from it, trying to forgot this as soon as possible.
