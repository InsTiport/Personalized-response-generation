  THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   What would it mean to you to qualify for the WTA Championships this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, sure, that's for sure one of my goals right now, but I think I need to win still some more matches to be qualified.
So I'm actually not thinking about this right now.   I'm just focused on this tournament and for my next round.   Of course it will mean a lot, I mean, to be at the top 8 at the end of the season in Istanbul, but I think it's still a little bit long way.
