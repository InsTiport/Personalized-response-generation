6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. That went well for you.  Obviously clay is not one of your favorite surfaces.  Tell us how your take is on today.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, actually I'm happy I won my first round here finally.  It was not so easy, especially because you play against a German, so it's always not the easy straw.
At the end I am happy how I played today.  I was focusing first point until the last one.
At the end it was a little bit tricky because she start to play better, and I was pushing too much the ball, just.  But, yeah, I won the match and I'm just happy to being in the next round finally.
Q. You say won "finally."  Obviously you can play on clay, we know that.  Was it actually beginning to affect you in a way that you thought, I'm never going to advance here?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I know that I can play on clay.  That's true.  And I played good also one week ago in Rome and also, like, in Stuttgart and also before.
But, you know, in the last two years I was not playing so good here.  That's why I was really focusing on every single point.  I was trying to go out, win the match, doesn't matter against who I play.  This was my plan.
This is what I'm looking also for the next round.  I mean, I'm just looking step by step, day by day, and this is my goal here for Paris, and then we will see.
Q. You have won two Grand Slams.  Been very successful throughout your career.  As we have touched on, Roland Garros is the only Grand Slam where you haven't reached a final.  So looking at the clay surface, is the challenge the surface or is it your approach and how you think about things?  Or is it a mixture of all those things?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's a mix.  I mean, of course it's a challenge for me, but I will try to take the challenge.  Also clay, I think, can make me also a better player, especially than when I go on grass, on hard court.  I think it's the combination of all of the things.
Q. You said you were pleased with how you played today and that you feel confidence.  You have had a good start to 2018, as well.  What are your expectations here at Roland Garros this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, my expectation, just playing match by match.  This is what I'm doing.  I'm here already few days before -- actually, one week already, and I'm just taking day by day, and that's my expectation to play every single day good tennis.
You never know with the weather, also, what's happen, but I will just try to make day by day, and then that's my expectation to be the best.
