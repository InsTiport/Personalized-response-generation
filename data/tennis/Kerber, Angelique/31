A. KERBER/K. Birrell   
6-1, 6-0   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk us through the match.  How do you feel going into the fourth round again?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I'm feeling good.  I think that I played really solid match from the first point until the last one.  I think, yeah, to playing also for her the first time on the Rod Laver, I think she was a little bit nervous playing in front of the home crowd.   
But, you know, she beat good players in the last few days and weeks.  For me, it was more important to really playing my own game like the whole match.   
 Q.  You said you were impressed with her.  You think she has potential?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think so.  Of course, she was a little bit nervous tonight.  You have to play one day the first time on the big stages.  I mean, that was her first step to get, like, experience about these big matches.   
If she's playing like this or like she played the last few days and weeks, yeah, I'm thinking she will have a good future.   
 Q.  Going to the next round, how do you think you'll match up?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it will be another good match.  I mean, I know her little bit.  We played once I think last year.  Yeah, she hits the ball really hard and fast.  She's fighting, as well.  She's never giving up.   
It's another match that I know that I have to take it in my hand, playing my game.  Yeah, I'm looking forward.   
 Q.  Do you feel bad at all breaking Aussie hearts on center court?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: If you are there, you are professional.  You are trying to playing your match, trying to focusing on the tennis on the way how you would like to play, and to winning the matches.  I'm not thinking about something like this, so no.
