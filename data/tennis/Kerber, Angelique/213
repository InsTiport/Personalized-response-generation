E. BOUCHARD/A. Kerber
      6‑1, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   It was a straightforward match.   What do you think makes it so tough to play Eugenie?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, she's a great player.   She played very well today.   But I actually didn't find my rhythm.   I was completely not on the court.
    I didn't play my best tennis today.

Q.   Do you think Genie could have a shot at the title?   I mean, now the women's draw is so open. 
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think for sure.   I mean, everybody who is still in the draw has a chance.   I mean, everybody is playing good tennis here, so I think it will be interesting who will be in the final then.

Q.   What do you think you could have done maybe a little bit better?   Physically, were you 100% and fine?   Was there any issues there also?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, I'm fine.   But of course, I mean ‑‑actually, I was not in the game.   I was trying, but I had no rhythm.   I don't know.   I make so many mistakes.   I actually was not moving very good. 
    So, yeah, I just can say that it was not my best day today. 

Q.   It's a big occasion on center court a little bit early though.   Do you have any idea before you come out that you're not feeling ‑‑that you're a little bit out of it, or is it just something that all of a sudden the match starts and you realize, Well, my legs aren't there and I'm just not here and what can I do to change it?
    ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, I was feeling good before, but it starts during the match.   I mean, I went there and I was trying.   But actually, I was not feeling the ball and I was trying to come back, but it was tough for me today.
    Yeah, but I think she played very well today, so congrats to her.   That's the sport.
