THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I spent the first 20 minutes sitting with your group of Chinese fans.  I asked them what they liked about you the most, why they supported you.  They said that you were charming and you have great spirit, that you never get down.  Do you have a message in particular for your band of fans here?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, it's great to have the fans, especially here, how they are supporting me during my matches and also during my practice sessions here.  It's quite nice.  I really enjoy it, to play in front of them.  I mean, it was actually quite nice questions to them.  I had no idea why they are supporting me.  Now I know.   
I think, yeah, I'm just happy and proud that I can play like I'm playing, but also having the fans.  The message is just, I mean, I'm really thankful that they are supporting me over the year.  It's great to have fans like that.   
 Q.  There was quite a big difference between the first set and your second set.  What changed for you?  Was it more mental or physical?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think we both play on the first set good tennis.  The conditions with the shadow on court was also not so easy to play in the first set.  In the second set, I was just trying, you know, to keep going, like I finished the first set, just trying to stay in the match, yeah, playing even better than in the first set.  Actually, I was just more focusing on my game.
