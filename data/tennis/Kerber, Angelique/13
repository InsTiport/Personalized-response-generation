A. KERBER/S. Halep
6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That was a very good performance today.  From your perspective, what's it like to face Halep on grass?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It's never easy to play against Simona, but I was playing from the first point really good today, especially in important moments.
I was hitting the ball good, really deep, moving well.  Yeah, I think it was quite good match from my side.
I know to play against Simona you have to play until the last point because you never know what's happen.  She's always fighting until the last one, so I was trying to staying focused the whole match.  And it's great to have another really good match on my belt before Wimbledon.
Q. Your movement is very key to your game, so what changes do you make to your movements specifically with grass?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Nothing really special, because I'm just feeling good on grass.  I mean, for me to having good matches, a lot of matches, that gives me the confidence to moving good, as well, on grass.
I was, yeah, practicing a lot already in Mallorca with the movement, because -- I mean, the movement is the same like here, of course.  The bounces and everything is a little bit different, but the movements are the same.
So I was trying to taking, yeah, there already the chance to practicing with the movements and especially going to the corners, because, I mean, on grass you don't have too long the rallies, so it was important for me to, yeah, starting already there to have, like, one more tournament before Wimbledon.
Q. Do you feel close to top form, or is there still a little way you can go and play even better than that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think I'm feeling good so far here.  I mean, of course, every tournament it's different.  I'm right now focusing on my semis now tomorrow and not thinking too much ahead to Wimbledon.
For me, it's important to have here another good match and, you know, going with confidence to Wimbledon.  That is the goal for me.
I just try to take it also as a practice week.  I mean, like I said yesterday, it's better to be here.  It's a little bit quieter than in Wimbledon right now, so I prefer to stay here a little bit longer (smiling).
Q. You have got Ons Jabeur next.  She took out Jo Konta.  It will be a first-time meeting for the two of you, so what do you know of her and what are you expecting?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, we never played against each other.  So I think it will be interesting match, because always if you play someone you never played before, it's a challenge.
But, yeah, she's playing good here.  She beat good players already, and she's feeling good on grass.  But I will just try to continue like I played the last days and not thinking too much against who I'm playing.  It's more about me, about another good match, and about another good day here.  Then we will see.
Q. Today it was announced that the Fed Cup would change the format to like the Davis Cup.  I was wondering what are your thoughts on the new format?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, for me, it's nice that we are still playing at home and it's the same rules.  You know, it's more, for me, I love to play Fed Cup, and if you play at home in front of your home crowd, it's always really special.  We will have this in February, as well.  Yeah, I'm happy that we have still the same, like, the same situation now.
Q. I know you're not looking forward to Wimbledon, but obviously as a defending champion you must have some perks now?  Posh dressing room?  Towels?  What are the perks of being defending champion?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I don't know.  I think right now really I'm not thinking about Wimbledon, to be honest.  Because I know that when I am in the car to Wimbledon, a lot of emotions will come, a lot of memories.
But Wimbledon, for me, it's something special, something magic.  I will now try to really staying still here.  If it's here, I finish here, I will be with my whole focus with my heart in Wimbledon and this is -- this is the step-by-step thing for me right now.
Q. Mentally, for you, how important is it for you to stay in the present and not think about what's been and what's coming up?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It is really important, especially for me, to really not putting too much pressure and staying here in the moment.  With all the experience over the last years, I know that this is sometimes the key to really playing good tennis, performing good, yeah, giving your best out there when you are on the court, on the center court, and not thinking what's happened last week, what's happened yesterday, just being in the moment.  And also not thinking too much ahead that in a few days Wimbledon is starting, and, and, and.  So it's more to staying here and, yeah, doing my best what I can do right now.
