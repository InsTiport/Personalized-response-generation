A. KERBER/S. Peng
7-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Angelique Kerber, please.
Q. You must be pleased to have gotten that out of the way.  How do you feel?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, it was a tough match because I know against Peng, it's always tricky to play.  And the first matches on grass are always not so easy.
But I was feeling good.  I was serving very well the whole match.
And, yeah, after the rain, it was a long break.  So I was trying to stay focused and, like, trying to reading a book or something.  Something to do different.  Because what you can do?
So it was not so easy.  But in the end, I'm happy about the game I played today.
Q. How do you feel about your movement?  You didn't look like you were moving quite as well as you normally do out there.  Was that because of the surface?  The slipperiness?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, against her, it's always tricky because she's really playing flat and fast.
But after the rain, I was a little bit careful with my movement because you never know if it's a little bit slippery in the corners.
I think I was feeling well with my movement, so it was not too bad for the first match.
Q. You had that net cord at end there, which obviously gave you the break.  A bit unfortunate, but I imagine you thought it was a bit of luck for you.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, that was little bit luck more on my side.  But I think, yeah, there's always luck on both sides.  Also, like in the first set, she was a little bit lucky with Hawk-Eye where the ball was on the line.
So it's always up and down, so, you know...
Q. When you got clouds coming over all the time, is it easy to be districted by that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I was trying not looking on the clouds.  I was really trying to staying in the moment and focusing every point each, and not thinking also to making things faster.
When I was also up 5-3 in the second set, I think it was little bit raining starting.  So I was trying to not thinking and staying in my rhythm.
Q. Playing against her with this double-handed style, is it very hard to read and is it important to deny her the opportunities to attack?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it's really hard to read the balls because she is playing really good when the ball is coming to her.  So that's why I was trying to moving her a little bit.
Like I said, she's playing really hard and deep, so the first few points against her, it's always important to staying in the rally.
Q. Tiebreak was obviously crucial.  You played that well.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I was starting really well in the tiebreak.  But I knew that the first few points in the tiebreak against her, they're really important.  I was trying to just going for it, playing my game and being more aggressive than her.
So I was really fast up 3-0, then, yeah, the tiebreak was playing good from my side.
Q. There was like maybe three breakpoints in total in the match.  Do you actually feel relief having gotten through a tough player first off, especially on grass?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yes, I think today, I had everything in the first match, so...
But it's good to have matches like this before going to London because you never know how the weather is, you never know who you play against.
On grass, it's always tricky.  Sometimes you play against opponents who are serving really well, not giving you the rhythm.
So it was a good, yeah.  A good match for me against her today.  But, yeah, the first matches are always tough to play.
Q. You're known for being able to hang in on long points.  But on grass, obviously it's going to be a lot quicker.  Why do you think your game adapts so well?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think because I'm moving good.  I think that helps me also on grass.  I like the lower balls when they are not bouncing so high and bending my knees low.  This is what I actually like.
That's true, they are really quick rallies, so I'm trying to going for it and just trying to change my game a little bit on grass.  Not too long the rallies, just trying to take the first chance to going for it and being aggressive, which on grass is very important.
Q. Did you get your second Porsche yet?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, not yet.  I'm still waiting.  I know it takes some time.  I know from last year, it takes few months.
Q. Have you taken Petko out in the other one?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, no.  No, not yet.  Not yet, because we was thinking to going for a drive when we played Fed Cup, but we was playing in Romania --
Q. Road trip?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: That was, yeah, bad luck in the end, but we will find the time.  And then I have two, so she can pick up (Smiling).
