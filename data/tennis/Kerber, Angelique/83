A. KERBER/C. Giorgi   
6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  They said on court the roll continues.  It does.  You're undefeated now in -- eight matches?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.   
 Q.  Another great win tonight.  You must be so pleased.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I'm really feeling good.  It's just the beginning of the year, and to reaching the first final, my first tournament -- actually, I mean, I played the Hopman Cup, but it was not a tournament.   
So, yeah, I'm feeling good and I have, for sure, a lot of confidence.  The goal was to have a lot of matches before going to Melbourne, and I think, yeah, it works.   
 Q.  When you were down 3-Love in the second set, you kind of banged your racquet onto your knees.  Were you starting to feel maybe the fatigue or the strain of so many matches straightaway?  And then how were you able to get out of that?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, actually, no.  I'm feeling physically not bad.  Of course, I had a lot of matches, and the weather conditions are also every day a little bit different, but, you know, I think that when I was down 3-0, I was just not playing like I played in the first set.  I was a little bit too defensive.   
Then I start to being again more aggressive, playing actually a little bit deeper and moving good, so actually, that was, I think, what you mean.   
 Q.  You have Ash Barty in the finals.  What do you make of her?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, Ash is a great player.  She played unbelievable last year.  I played the last match of 2017 against her, so it was not so long ago.  I know what to expect.   
Actually, I'm looking forward for the final.  I think I will try to enjoy it, as well, but also going out, focusing on my game like I did it in the last few days, and just trying, of course being aggressive and trying to win another match here.   
 Q.  Do you change any of your approach to the match or do you just play your game?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, first of all, the plan A is always playing my game and playing what I can the best and just going out, focusing on me, and yeah, being aggressive and, yeah, trying to just have another good match before going to Melbourne.   
But of course I will sit down with my coach, as well, and we will speak a little bit about the match tomorrow.   
 Q.  The last time you played Ash wasn't that long ago, Zhuhai, but it seems like your form and mentality has come along so far in -- it's really only two months ago?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it's not so long, no, no.   
 Q.  What will has kind of flipped that switch so soon?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think we have 2018.  This is what change (smiling).   
I mean, I'm really trying not looking back on 2017.  Of course the match against Ash or the matches in Zhuhai was not my best where I was playing my best tennis, and I really forgot about this tournament so far, so I'm just looking forward.   
I had a good preseason.  I had good matches in the last few days.  I know what to do on court.  Yeah, I enjoy it, as well, playing my tennis again.  I'm fighting, and I think this is what counts:  being on court, having my heart on court and just, yeah, being back like I played in 2016 and the years before.
