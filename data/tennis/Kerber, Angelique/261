 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. This was your first time on the new court, 17. Did anything about it strike you? Was it different? 
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, it was my second match there. Yeah, it's a nice court, but I was concentrate just by point and I try to play my best.
 And, yeah, I won.

 Q. Because it's sunken, does it have a different feel, the surroundings?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, no, it's feeling good. So I feel good there.

 Q. There has been a lot of talk here of the young Americans and who's going to replace Serena. I wonder if there is a lot of talk in Germany about the young Germans and who is going to be the next Steffi. Do you hear that at all?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah. But I mean, Steffi is Steffi, and we are the next generation. I think we have now a lot of players which playing very well. And, yeah, for the German tennis, it's great.

 Q. Can you explain how you all sort of kind of came up at the same time?
