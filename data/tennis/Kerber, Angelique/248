THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You played her in the past.   This year she switched to a different racquet.   Does her shot seem better, more powerful, spin or whatever it is, her serve, her groundstrokes?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think I was trying to give my best, and it was very close and hard match also in the first set.   But, yeah, the balls from her were very difficult for me, and also the spin.   
I just tried to be aggressive, but in the important moments she was better.   Yeah, I mean, she beat me and it's okay.   I do everything I could do today.  
   
 Q.   But did she seem stronger this year than she had in the past?   You played her last year, the year before; do her shots seem harder?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I mean, I have played her actually just this year.   I don't know how she was playing like few years ago.   This year she played very well, and, yeah, improved a lot.   She's a very good player.   
   
 Q.   Is it hard to play someone who mixes it up so much, like every point you're sometimes getting some high balls and just dropshots?   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, for sure it's not easy to play against opponent like this that mix the game.  
I knew this before the match.   I know that she will play a lot of spin and also some dropshots, but, yeah, I tried to be aggressive.   She was better today.   What can I say?
