K. KANEPI/A. Kerber
  3‑6, 7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tough one, I guess.   Did you feel like you were in control in that second set? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I mean, I had my chances in the second set but I didn't take it.
So, yeah, in the third she was playing unbelievable and I couldn't do nothing.   I mean, she won today.   Yeah, well done to her.

Q.   Did you feel like you did anything wrong in the tiebreak, or was it just that she found her form when she needed it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Maybe I could, I don't know, play a little bit more aggressive on one or two balls, but she played good in the important points. 
So, yeah, for sure I had my chances.   Also maybe in the couple of the first games in the third set where she broke me 2‑0.
This is tennis.   Yeah. 

Q.   I guess she's a very tough player on this surface.   Her game really suits grass, doesn't it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Of course.   She is a tough player and she plays very well on grass, too.   What can I say?   I lost today, so...

Q.   How tough is it waiting for the rain?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Of course it's not easy to wait two days, but for her it was the same.   We knew this before we coming here because it's London and the weather can change from one hour to the other.
But I think this was not the point why I lost today.

Q.   How did you find the court?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   The court was good, yeah.

Q.   Can I ask you one about Laura Robson?   You played her two years ago here.   I guess you might not be surprised to see her doing well. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, she's a very great young player and she plays well on grass.   For sure she has a very good future. 

Q.   Did Kanepi surprise you somehow today?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   I played once against her and I lost also.   But I knew before that will be tough one.   She won today against me.   She played better in the important moments.
Yeah, that's it.

Q.   What do you think is the potential for her now?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   We will see.   I think she can play also the next few rounds good, but we will see.

Q.   What happened with your game today?   You are disappointed in some tactical, technical issue? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, I think I tried my best and I was fighting until the last point. 
Like I said, she was playing if the third set unbelievable and I couldn't do nothing.

Q.   Did you do some background, watch previous games?   Your coach was, obviously?   What he told you? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I don't know because I was not talking to him right now. 

Q.   Before the game how much did he know about Kanepi? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, that she had a good serve and I need to try to move her a little bit.   But it was not easy because she has very deep balls. 
I tried, but it was not working today.   Too good in the third set.

Q.   You're another seeded player to crash out.   Many surprises this year.   Was it just another one?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, maybe.
