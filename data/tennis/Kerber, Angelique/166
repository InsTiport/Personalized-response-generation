THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. What are your thoughts in general about today's match?  How do you look back?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, the first set she played good.  In the second set I found my rhythm again.  I played my tennis.
But in the third set, she starts very well.  Yeah, and then -- yeah.  She won the last point.  But of course, I'm disappointed that I lost now here the first round, but that's sport and that always can happen.
Yeah, that was for sure not my best tennis I played today.
Q. How did you feel coming into Paris and just physically, mentally, and everything?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, I was ready.  I was practicing very well here, but, yeah, the first rounds are always tough in the tournament, especially for me, but, yeah, what can I say?  It happens.
Q. This was your first major as a Grand Slam champion.  Did you feel any pressure on yourself or anything?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I came here to play round by round, and I know that you must play your best tennis in the first rounds, as well, because everybody is a tough opponent to play.  I was trying it.  It was not my day.  I tried to fight also in the third set.
But, yeah, she played good then in the important moments.
Q. Second time this year you played Bertens, of course.  How impressed were you by her level today?  How conscious were you of her hot streaks?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I knew actually how she's playing, because I played against her in Miami.  That was the first time on clay, but I know that she's a tough opponent.  I was ready.  But, yeah, at the end she make the important points.  So, yeah.  And the last one.
Q. Can you talk a bit about when you went off with your shoulder?  How is it?  Is it the same injury that stopped you from competing at Nuremberg?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, the pain is the same, but I don't know if it's better or good.  I mean, I just left the court.
I hope it's not so bad, but, yeah, I start feeling it in the second set.  Yeah, it's getting worser and worser, but I hope it's not too bad.
