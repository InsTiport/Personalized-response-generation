A. KERBER/K. Flipkens   
7-5, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about the match today, how you felt it went.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it was not an easy match, I mean, especially against Kirsten is always tough to play because she plays good on grass with the slice.   
Yeah, I couldn't find my rhythm in the first few games, but then I was trying to moving good and playing the ball back.  It was for sure maybe not the best tennis that I played, but I was trying to fighting again for every point, and I think that was the key at the end.   
 Q.  How are you finding the grass?  Some people are saying it's very slippery this year and stuff.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's a little bit slower, but I think it's also because of the weather here.  I mean, this week, the weather is much better than the last years, actually.   
But I'm feeling fine with the grass.   
 Q.  Have you seen any of the footage or heard what happened to Bethanie Mattek-Sands with her knee?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No.   
 Q.  She blew it out on the court slipping.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Oh, really?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I didn't know.  No.
