THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How disappointing is it not to be able to sort of get another match under your feet ahead of...
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, it's for sure not the way I would like to reach the final, for sure, because to getting another match on my belt before going to Wimbledon, that was the goal.  But of course I hope that she recovers soon and she is ready for Wimbledon.  I mean, I hope this.
You know, for me now it's okay.  I have a day off, I practice a little bit already, and now the focus is for the finals tomorrow.
I mean, it doesn't matter against who I'm playing.  It will be another good final, I think.  It will be a good match.  So it's, yeah, the focus, it's for the final right now.
Q. You have got a winning record obviously against Karolina, not against Kiki but you have never played her on grass.  Some thoughts about either of those opponents and how you think they'll match up?  Have you seen them play?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, they just start I think now.  I saw a little bit the last few days, but I was more focusing on my matches and my schedule.
But, yeah, against Kiki I never played on grass.  I think it will be interesting match, because she's playing as well good on grass, especially the last few matches.  She has a lot of confidence.  You know, I think to playing against her it's always tricky for me, but, yeah, I think it will be a good match, as well, like always against her.
And against Karolina, yeah, I mean, we played a lot of finals already against each other, a lot of matches.  She knows what to expect from me; I know what to expect from her.  She's serving good.  She hits the ball very fast and deep.
Yeah, I think, like I said, it doesn't matter against who I'm playing.  It will be a good match if it's against Kiki or Karolina.
Q. Mentally, how do you cope with having built yourself up to go out and play?  Is it like a disappointment when the game is canceled?  And how do you get over that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I was, yeah, going on my practice court after this and just hitting some balls, sweating a little bit, and trying to, you know, just thinking on the positive way that I have a little bit day off today, and I can save my energy for the match tomorrow.
This is actually what I was thinking straight after, to really taking this as a positive for me to, yeah, being ready for the final then tomorrow.
Q. I guess it's probably better for you that it's happened now, because you have had some days playing already so you're able to cope with that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, I was ready to play.  This was actually the goal to having another good match.  But, yeah, I mean, what can I say?  It's just like, you know, a long day today.  I'm still here.  So also with my mind I'm not thinking about Wimbledon right now.  It's just another good day here, and, yeah, let's see.
Q. What have you made of the Wimbledon draw?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I just know against who I'm playing the first round.  I just heard about this, against a German.
Q. Looks like you have a tough side of the draw.  You could meet Serena in the fourth round?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, but that's tennis.  I'm not thinking about fourth round, third rounds or whatever.  I mean, everything can happen during such a long tournament.
So for me, it's the first round, but right now it's the finals tomorrow (smiling).
Q. What is it like when you face a fellow German?  I know that in the past you have always found it a little bit tricky to play some of your compatriots.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it is always tricky to playing Germans.  I have played so many matches already against German players.
You know, I think for me it's more like that I have really focusing on me and not thinking that I'm playing against a German, against who I'm playing.  It's, yeah, someone really I know very well.
It is also a little bit tricky mentally, but I think I have so many experience from all the last years playing against German that the most important thing for me is to finding my rhythm, my game plan, and trying to playing like I played the last matches on grass and trying to continue this in Wimbledon.
