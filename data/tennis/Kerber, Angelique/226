THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Last year you won five games first match, and this year four games.   What is difference between last year and this year, this match with Serena?   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think just two separate matches.   Today she was playing unbelievable, and I had actually no chance.   I mean, she was serving great and also returning unbelievable.  
So I was just giving all I could, but yeah, it's tough to play against Serena like this.   And also here like the first match, she's the No. 1 in the world, and of course she deserve to win, because today she was   much better than me.  
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you have a day off.   Is it maybe will be better for you to play, or is it good to have a day off tomorrow?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think it's good.   I mean, I will go tomorrow again on practice court and try to practice hard again and prepare for my next matches.   
I will fight here every single match.   I have two more to go, and then we will see.   Of course I will give everything in every single match.   
   
 Q.   Talking about tonight's game, obviously Serena was very dominant in every aspect, but could you talk a little bit about what went wrong on your part?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   On my what?   
   
 Q.   Yes, on yourself.   What went wrong on your part?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   On my what?   On my side, okay.   
I don't know.   I mean, I think I served very good, but she was returning unbelievable.   Actually, she didn't give me a small chance to breathe, and I had, in the whole match, I had actually the feeling that she was ‑‑she give me the pressure all the time.   
And I was trying to, you know, to maybe change the rhythm also, but she played everything so good today, so there was no chance to change something.
