A flash interview with:
ANGELIQUE KERBER
Q. We are at the Big Wheel here in Brisbane.  What do you think?  Are you okay with heights?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I'm okay with heights.  And actually, I'm really enjoying it when I'm up in the air.  Yeah, it's great to do something besides the tennis.
Q. You have one of these at home, a Big Wheel?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think we have one, but in every city, actually, I -- like when I'm in London or Singapore, but this was the first time since I think few years that I'm doing this again.
Q. Start of the new year.  What did you get up to on New Year's Eve?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, we went here, so we arrived here afternoon, late afternoon, and I celebrated here in Brisbane.  It's always nice to see the fireworks and have the great dinner.  Yeah, starting the new season with my first tournament here.
Q. Thursday sees you meeting young Australian Ash Barty here on her home soil, her home court.  What do you expect from that match in front of the local crowd?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I'm really looking forward to play against a really young Australian girl.  I mean, I think the crowd will be there, and it's of course a tough match.
I mean, I will try my best and going out there to win it, that's for sure.  Yeah, it's great to have my first match in few hours.
Q. It is a few hours away.  In 2017, what are you expecting for the whole year as far as your titles, your ranking, your performance?  Do you see things coming your way?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I'm really trying my best.  Let's see what happens this year, but of course I will try to continue my run from last year and trying to win a lot of more titles.  Let's see after this year what's happened.
Q. Do you think in Melbourne, the Australian Open, you can retain that crown?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course I'm going there to defend my title, but it will be tough.  I think I'm ready, and I'm here to have a lot of matches before going to Melbourne.
Yeah, let's see.  I'm really enjoying to be again in Australia.
