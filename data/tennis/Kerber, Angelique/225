THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Seems like you did everything well in the match.   How did it feel?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I'm feeling good.   I was really playing very well today, and I knew before that it would be tough match against Aga because she's a great player, but, you know, I was trying to play my tennis and I was concentrated and focused from the first point.  
I was playing very good, so I'm just happy that I won this match here.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel physical advantage because she played third match in a row and you played only second match?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   You know, actually, I was not thinking about this.   I was just focusing on myself and preparing for the match like for everyone.  
You know, the loss against Serena two days ago, I think I take just positive things and I was practicing yesterday very good.  
So I was not thinking about that.   I was just try to focusing on myself.   I think it works very good.  
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you have a match with Petra.   What do you think about that?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, tomorrow it will be next tough match, and, you know, I will just try to play like today, go out there, try to enjoy it, having fun and try very good tennis and be focused from the first point and moving very well.  
Yeah, just trying to concentrate on myself and then let's see.
