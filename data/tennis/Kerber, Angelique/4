 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What was the challenge of having such a delay to your match start with the super long match before you, how much that was making things difficult today?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I don't know.  Maybe a little bit.  But, yeah, I couldn't find my rhythm, especially at the beginning of the first set.  She plays very well.
 Yeah, I mean, the first few games, you need to get used to it.  Of course, the conditions then, it was dark.  Yeah, it was not so easy for me, especially with the movement.
 Yeah, I don't know if it was before we wait so long.  I mean, of course I can look now for a few excuses.  Yeah, that's not me.
 Q. What were you doing to try to stay warm during all that time?
 ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think I was warming up more than 10 times.  Yeah, it was not so easy.  Yeah, I mean, at the end I know how it is.  I'm so long on tour, so it can happen.
