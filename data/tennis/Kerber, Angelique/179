6-4, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Good win.  Physically how do you feel you got through that match?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, it was a tough one, that's for sure.  I was not feeling so well after the first few games.  I don't know.  It was something with my stomach, and I was a little bit -- it was hot.  Was a little bit tired and my power was not there actually, so I was not 100%.
But at the end I was just try to win the match, you know.  I was trying to play point by point and try to just focusing on my game and not thinking too much about the weather that's really hot out there.
It was much different than in Brisbane last week.  I just arrived yesterday so it was not easy, but at the end I'm feeling now a little bit better.  I had the ice bath, food, everything, drinking a lot.  Now I need I think recovery, and it should be fine.
Q. To clarify, it wasn't something physical, it was more the heat?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it was more the heat, and like also yesterday the flight and the late, late play on Saturday.  So I think those it cames everything together, because on the morning I was feeling fine.  So I think it was more the heat.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think so.
Q. You really turned your game around in the first set to the second.  Did you have to adjust your game plan?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, in the second set I was try to be more aggressive, and she maked also more mistakes than in the first set.  I think the first set was very close and there were just like two, three points which decide the first set.
Then in the second set I was trying to put more my first serve in.
Yeah, I tried also in the third set.
Q. You had a good Brisbane tournament and now a strong first round.  What are your goals for this year and the Australian Open?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, for the whole year, of course I will try to stay in the top 10 and focusing on the bigger tournament, but also to try to improve my game.  Here I will just try to have few more matches before going to Melbourne.
I mean, I'm looking from day-to-day and enjoying the season already.  Again.  (Laughter.)
Q. Quite a few players have pulled out for different reasons at different tournaments.  You already have a good number of the matches under your belt.  A little bit of a struggle today.  Was there ever a thought maybe today or maybe yesterday, you know, let's just pack it up and go to Melbourne?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, yeah, I had few -- I mean, I had a lot of matches last week, but that was actually also my plan, you know:  to came to Australia, to have a lot of matches, and also to playing here few more matches.
I don't know how far I can get.  Yeah, that was my plan, and I will stay on my plan.  Let's see.  I mean, I'm healthy.  I have no pain anywhere.  Today it was a little bit more the weather and the travel and everything, but now I'm feeling better.
So let's see.  I will just try to recover and see how I feel tomorrow.  But I'm feeling -- my body feels good.
Q. You said that the conditions were different today than Brisbane all week.  Does getting yourself through a match like this in that sort of heat potentially prepare you better for the Open?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think the match was good for me because it was different than in Brisbane, and I know that Melbourne will be hot as well in the next few weeks and days.
Yeah, it's good to have a match like this under my belt, that I know what's going on in Melbourne if it's hot.  It's always hot in Australia.  I think it was a good match to prepare for Melbourne.
