 A. KERBER/K. Flipkens
  3/6, 6/3, 6/2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Heading into the second set, what was your thought?   Did you change your game plan at all?   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I think in the second set I was trying to, yeah, keep going, to believe in myself that I can turn around the match, and just keep going, be aggressive, and just playing point by point.  
I think that was then at the end the key of the match.  
   
 Q.   And Flipkens, her forehand is very solid.   How did you deal with that?   Looked at first like it was a little bit uncomfortable for you, and then you dealt with it better.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, she is a great player.   She was last year in the semis here and she's playing good on grass.   Yeah, she as a big forehand and also like a good slice.   
At the beginning of the match I was a little bit confused, but, yeah, you know, I was just trying to play my game and just keep going.  
Yeah, it works at the end, so that's good.   
   
 Q.   How can you sum up your first week?   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I think I had good matches in the first week.   Yeah, I'm in the second week right now, so it's good.   I'm still trying to improve my tennis and trying to play like, you know, better from the first point.  
Yeah, let's see what's happen then in the next match.  
   
 Q.   Your next match, Sharapova.   
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I think it was be a nice match.   You know, I have nothing to lose, I think.   I will go out there, try enjoy the match, and try to focus just on myself.  
I will not focus on her or against who I am playing.   I mean, I will go out there, try my best, do my best, and just focus on my way, how I'm playing, and then we will see.   
   
 Q.   So the game will be very much discerned by her game plan as opposed to trying to stop...  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, I mean, I know I need to play on a high level to beat her.   I will just be focusing on myself and not on her, I think.  
I think that is also the key of the match when I'm playing good.   
   
 Q.   And your current form, are you looking beyond the Maria Sharapova match?   Do you think you can go all the way, or is it just one game at a time now?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Just one at a time and then let's see.
