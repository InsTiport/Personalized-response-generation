A. KERBER/K. Siniakova   
6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  In the first game of the second set, there was a challenge that would have ended.  You seemed to be kind of upset.  What did you say to the umpire?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, it was actually nothing about this.  It was because the camera, which is like flying, was a little bit moving during the game.  I was telling him he can maybe tell them that the camera have to stop during, yeah, the ball, during the point.  So actually that was my discussion with the umpire.  Nothing about the challenge.   
 Q.  That point, along with an unbelievable passing shot you had in the next game, seemed to be a big shift in momentum.  How did you feel moving forward after those two points?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I was trying after the first set, because the first set was not so easy, I was trying to staying in the points and in the rallies.  So that was actually in my mind.   
I think those points were actually really important to start the second set really well.   
 Q.  There seemed to be a lot of shifts in momentum from your opponent.  How did you keep a level head throughout the match?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, she played really well, especially in the first set.  I was trying to being patient and waiting for my shots and for my chances, just trying to moving her a lot, just going for it when I have the chance.   
So being patient, that was actually my goal.   
 Q.  How are the conditions out there for you?  How do you feel after getting the first win at the China Open?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I'm feeling good.  I think the conditions are really well.  It's not too hot.  It's not too cold.  I think the crowd, it's nice.   
So, yeah, the first win here.  I think it's a good start for this tournament for me.   
 Q.  After that long match in Wuhan, Petra went on to win the title the way she did.  Do you look back on that match differently now than maybe you did 10 minutes after the loss?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No.  I think it's still the same.  I mean, Petra was playing well.  I mean, this match decide just one, two points.  I could win the match as well.   
But, yeah, after that she played really good matches as well.  She won.  I think she deserved really the title in Wuhan.  She played well the whole week.   
When I'm looking back, I'm still thinking like 10 minutes after the match (smiling).   
 Q.  Today the air pollution levels were unhealthy.  Were you feeling it on court?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, I'm feeling okay.  I'm feeling not too bad, and I think this is good.  I'm trying to, yeah -- I don't know what I'm trying, but it feels okay for me.  I have no problems with that.   
 Q.  It was a pretty composed performance for you today.  You looked really calm and really focused.  It wasn't always the case in your career.  You changed that this season.  Did you ask for professional help?  Something clicked?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it came from a lot of experience, to being really focusing and trying to being more positive on court than negative.  So I was trying to change it, yeah, from a long time right now.   
I think I improved a lot.  I know that I can still improve this, but I think this is also one of the keys why I'm playing so good and so consistent, because it's really important to have your mind on the court and just thinking about the match right now.   
 Q.  There are a lot of players that try their best to qualify for the WTA Finals.  You are already qualified.  Does it make you feel less pressure to play your best tennis?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, it's for sure a better feeling to knowing that I'm already qualifying for Singapore.  I know that I don't have this pressure anymore.  But still I'm playing matches here to win good matches, as many as possible, and just focusing on my game, not thinking about Singapore because I know that I'm qualifying.  I'm focusing on this tournament because it's still a big one and I would like to play good tennis and win a lot of matches here.   
 Q.  Because we live in a world that is growing faster and faster, the next generation has more difficulties keeping its attention.  There's more talk of speeding up tennis.  What is your take on it?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Speeding?   
 Q.  Making tennis faster, faster matches.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, actually I was not thinking at all on this right now.  For me I think, yeah, right now it is like it is so I'm focusing more on this tradition which is right now.  It is like playing three sets for us, without no-ad.   
I don't know what will be in the future.  Let's see.  But to be honest, I was not thinking at all on this right now.
