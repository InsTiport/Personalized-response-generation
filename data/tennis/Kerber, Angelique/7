THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously a disappointment. Just talk about how the match went for you and your feelings about it.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it was not my best match, but, I mean, she played a good tactic against me. I played good in the second set and was up-and-down match.
Of course the first rounds are always not so easy especially I played not so well in the last few weeks.
Yeah, I was practicing good the last few days here. I prepared as good as I can. Of course it's, yeah, a little bit disappointed that I was not able to play a good match like I was practicing.
Q. Obviously this year you didn't play so many matches. Asian swing, are you going to play more matches including some doubles in your plan or keep it kind of...
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I mean, I don't know yet if I will play doubles. I'm just, like -- yeah, I don't know yet when I'm going. I plan to play Osaka and then Wuhan, then Beijing. That's my next schedule.
Right now I'm not thinking about this. I'm still here and of course the loss now will be, need a little bit of time to forget.
Q. Do you have a new coach? What does your team look like at the moment?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I don't have a new coach, no.
Q. Are you planning to get someone?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know yet.
Q. Obviously it wasn't a great year in the Grand Slams. Was there any similarity, stuff that kept happening? Was there no common problem or anything like that?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know. You know, every Grand Slam, it's a new tournament. And, yeah, this year it was not really the best year for Grand Slams for me.
But still, I mean, here I tried everything I could. Also, like I said, the last ten days I prepared as good as I can. This is tennis, this is sport, and we have to deal with this. I will deal with this as good as I can. Also with all the experience that I had the last years, and looking forward.
Q. Obviously knowing what you're capable of doing here and what you've done in the past, is it particularly disappointing to be here in New York in this particular Grand Slam where you have been victorious to have a first-round exit?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course it's disappointing, especially after all the years here where I played good, with where I had a lot of emotions.
Yeah, this is tennis. I mean, every year is different. Of course all the last years, every year it was different. Yeah, I have to deal with this situation this year, and trying to doing it better the next time. Yeah, forgetting the match as soon as I can.
Q. I know you were with Torben for a number of years before, and now you're not. Are you thinking you two will get back together?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I think Torben has a good job right now. And we are still friends and I think it's good like it is now (smiling).
