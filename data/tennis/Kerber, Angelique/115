THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What was your general impression of the match this morning?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, of course it's always tough to play the first matches after a longer break like I have.  But I was not feeling the best today.  I'm trying to find my rhythm.   
But she plays good.  I make too many mistakes in the important moments.  I think it was, for sure, not my day.  I was not feeling the best today.   
 Q.  Did it have to do with the weather or anything?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, of course, the weather, it can happen like this.  I think this is not a big deal.  Of course, we have to wait a lot.   
But, yeah, this is not a big deal I think for us players.   
 Q.  You'll be going to Dubai.  Considering your performance here, what are your expectations?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: For Dubai?   
 Q.  Yes.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think, first of all, I have to get, yeah, ready again and feeling good because, yeah, I was not feeling very good in the last few days.  I think this is the most important thing for me right now.  Then, of course, looking forward to the next week.
