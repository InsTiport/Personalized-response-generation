L. SAFAROVA/A. Kerber
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. How did you feel on court today? Just talk about the match and what made it difficult for you. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I was feeling not good. From the first point I couldn't find my rhythm. I was actually not there.
I was tight and I was not playing my tennis. Lucie played a good match for sure, but for sure it was not my best match today.

Q. There is some suggestion on Twitter, a few people have heard what you were saying to your coach in German. You're not very happy with the format here and you don't think it's fair. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, yes, I think it's not fair, because I think it's like on the football. Like when it's really counting for something, you should play like the same time. 
Afterwards like when they played, everybody was like‑‑ I was actually trying to be in my tunnel and just focusing on my match. But, you know, everybody around was okay, now‑‑ I actually was not counting because I told everybody I'm not counting. I will go out and play my match.
They were counting. Okay, she won one set, now you must win just one set. Whatever. I don't know exactly what they thought, but I think it's fairer like in football if you play in the same time. 
Yes.

Q. How are you going to do that with only one court? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, that's true. That's why they can't do it here. That's only my opinion. 

Q. Was it the coaches talking around you? Where was the noise coming...
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I don't know exactly the people, but some like people around, like, yeah. 

Q. So that just made you a little too tense?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Actually, not really. But, you know, you know the situation, and then you go on court and you try to be focus. I was trying it, but it was like too much at the end. 

Q. I guess it's the end of your season. Can we talk about your season as whole? Good season? Bad season? Great season? How do you put it into words? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's good season I had. I mean, I won four titles and I'm in the top 10 for fourth time. For sure it was another good season for me. I was not playing so well in the majors, but I'm looking forward to play better next year. That will be my goal for sure.
At the end I had a great year and I'm proud about that. 

Q. Just in the match, could you have said, Okay, I'm not happy at all, but I need to just calm down and play? Didn't seem like you were ever happy at all. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I couldn't find my game, my rhythm. I was tight. I was trying to play hard, but I make a lot of mistakes and I was a little bit too short, so then she was going for. My serve was also not the best today.
It was not the best day for me, but sometimes you have days like that. 

Q. Is it one of those things where the moment you wake up you already don't feel great or when you stepped on the court you were feeling okay? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, you have days like that. I will just try to forget the match as soon as possible.
At the end, I had amazing week here. I will just take the positive things to the next week, to my holidays, and, yeah, try to improve my game and everything for the next year. 

Q. When your coach came in and was talking to you, still seemed like you wouldn't talk at all. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Like what? 

Q. When he came up and was talking to you it seemed like you were getting madder and madder the entire time. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, no, no. Maybe it looks like that, but I was listen to him.

Q. Are you more frustrated or disappointed about losing today's match or not being able to play the way that you wanted to or not being able to make the semifinals? What's the thing that makes you the most sad or angry?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think the most, yeah, make me disappointed is it was not my day, you know. I really would like to play like a good match and play my game, but I couldn't play it. I don't know. I mean, I couldn't find my rhythm. 
So I think that's the most disappointed I have. I mean, doesn't matter. Most important for me is to always play good and try my best.
But, yeah, today that was one day, one not good day for me. 

Q. I don't know if it's important for you or not, but you are the top German player. Is that something that has some meaning for you or doesn't really matter that much? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, of course it sounds good. It feels good to be the No. 1 player in Germany. We have so many good players right now. I don't know how many in the top 100, so to be also like‑‑ to end like the best player in Germany for the fourth time, it feels good. 
Of course you have it in your mind. Yeah, it's a good feeling. 

Q. If I'm not mistaken, you spent some time training in Dubai in the off‑season last year. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Last year, yes.

Q. Are you going to do that again or do you have plans for the off‑season?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I don't know yet. I will do for sure a few weeks at home and then we still think to go somewhere or we will do the whole off‑season at home.

Q. Was it good for you in Dubai?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yes, because the weather is always great. That was also the reason why we get there last year.
