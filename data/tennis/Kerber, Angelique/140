A. KERBER/R. Vinci
7-5, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you tell us the first set, which you were behind three times and you were able to recover.  How was difficult?  Were you tense?  You started to play much better later.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think the key of the match was the first set.  I mean, it was really close and tough.  It's always difficult to play against Roberta.
I mean, she's a tough opponent with her slice.  Yeah, I was trying to staying in the match and not thinking that I'm the break down.  Just going for it, yeah.
Keeping my mind a little bit relaxed, and, yeah, staying in the moment.  I think that was my key also like for the first set to being a little bit more relax and had not too negative, actually.
Q. You were not so much relaxed in the first set, correct?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, no, because it was tough and I knew that it's really close now.  So that's why I talked to myself, Okay, stay positive.  Think about the good things you did in the first set.
And that's it.  After I won the first set I was more relaxed at the end.  I think in the second set what I did good that I played the first few games really tough so that I was up 3-0 very fast.
Then I could continue my good play, yeah, in the next few games.
Q. In the first set especially she used the dropshot a lot and you went to the net.  Sometimes it worked; sometimes is didn't.  How do you feel you did against that?  Do you think other players are going to use that going forward?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I know that she's playing like this.  I know how she play and I was actually prepared for that.  So, yeah, it works sometimes, but I think a lot of players are playing like that already.  Also me.
So I was not surprised that she was playing so many dropshots.
Q. Against a player like Roberta who hits so much variety and slices, is it especially important to stay patient and calm?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it was also important to have patience against her and wait for your shots, because she is actually a good mover and she brings a lot of balls back with her slice, as well.
So I was trying to moving good, and, yeah, keeping my eyes on the balls and going for it.  Because the spin is a little bit different than when you play against others.  They are just hitting the balls really strong.
Q. Did you watch her match against Serena last year?  What did you make of her performance in that one?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No.  I just saw the final.  I didn't saw the semis.  I saw a lot of matches after.  She is a great player and she played very good in the last few months, so I was trying to, yeah, watch the match.
And also, I talked with my coach a little bit because he saw the match before.  And, yeah, my plan was playing with patience and when I have the chance to going for it.
Q. This is becoming common for you now to get to this stage in a major.  How would you describe the transformation in your game and your thinking to get to where it is becoming common for you?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it's changed a little bit.  For me, I'm going out on Arthur Ashe, on the stadium, and playing against top player, as well.  I have I think right now more confidence to going out there.
I'm not thinking about quarters, semis, or whatever.  I'm just going there to playing a good match and to win the match.
I know that I can beat everybody, and this is what gives me also a lot of confidence and motivation for going out there and playing with a lot of emotion.
Q. So how different is your sense of belief in yourself right now than it was before this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It's bigger, for sure.  It's one of my best years now, so that's why my belief in myself is growing for sure.  That's why I think I'm playing like I'm playing right now, that I really going for it with a lot of belief in my game and myself.
Yeah, it's changed a lot in the last few months.
Q. You just hit on this in terms of thinking your way through a match.  Two years ago, three years ago, how different would this match have played out?  Do you think you would have been as mentally strong against an opponent who really throws you off?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I think this is a good question.  I don't know.  Maybe not, because I think I grow a lot in the last few years.
And also with my mentality, that I'm, yeah, staying more positive and believing in my game.  I think that, yeah, that right now I can win matches like that.
Also, the match before I played, just staying positive and believe in my shots.  That gives me a lot of confidence.
So I think I learned a lot from the last years.
Q. You were saying that you kept telling yourself today to stay in the moment and focus on right now, not look ahead.  How does that help you and how does that get more difficult and certainly facing your next round?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Today, that was I think the key for the match, to staying in the moment and not thinking ahead or like what's happen or whatever.
And I think this is also what I have learned in the last few months also, to not thinking ahead against who I'm playing or if it's the same as other final or first round actually.
I'm just trying to, yeah, believe and having fun out there, enjoying what I'm doing right now.  I think this is the best way for me to playing my best tennis.
Q. It's been five years since you were in the semifinals here.  It must be very, very good to be back at this stage.  How different is it going in now with the accomplishments that you have, the Grand Slams and great results you have had lately and the mental maturity than it was for the 23 year old who did it five years ago?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it's completely different.  I mean, I remember the semis here like years ago when I reached it for my first time.  That was maybe also a little bit surprise.
I had nothing to lose.  I came here.  I just played great tennis.  I think a lot of things, yeah, happened since then.
Now I'm a completely different player, I think.  I'm going out.  I have a lot of confidence.  I know how to win big matches.  I know how it feels playing on the stadium.
I'm also enjoying it more than years ago.  I'm trying to, you know, going there and enjoying the atmosphere and also win the matches.
I mean, years ago I came here and I had nothing to lose and my goal was playing good, and now my goal is winning the matches and this is a little bit different.
Q. When you had your quarterfinal press conference, when you were doing this five years ago, do you remember feeling a bit differently, maybe a bit more nervous or apprehensive, do I really belong here, as opposed to where you are right now sitting there talking to us?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think so.  Five years ago I was a little bit nervous.  I was sitting here and I had no idea what to answer, I think.  I was like, Okay, let's see.
But right now I think for me it comes normal to came here in front of you guys, speaking with you.  So it's like after every match it's the same rhythm.
Q. You're speaking in terms of positiveness and all mental, but of course the physical part, is your practice different now?  It's awesome what you're saying in regards to all the positive thinking and that is fantastic, but is your practice different now as opposed to how it was several years ago or a year ago or whatever?  What has changed?  And is there one strength in your game that has really made a significant difference in the past several months or so of this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think my practice change a little bit.  I'm trying to focusing just on one or two things during the practice and really trying to focusing on this and improving few things and not making things also too complicated.  To going out there and practicing like not maybe two hours, but just one hour, and full intensity.  I think this is what I change.
Yeah, my game, I think my serve improved a little bit more than like few months ago.  Of course that helps me a little bit more on my game style when my first serve, yeah, cames more.
Q. Question regarding Wozniacki.)
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Caroline is always a tough opponent.  I know this.  We know each other very well.
So let's see who will win the quarterfinal tonight, but for me, it's -- I will watch it a little bit for sure, but for me it's actually doesn't matter against who I'm playing.
I'm now in the semifinals, and if it's Caroline, yeah, it will be great match for sure.  I know how she is playing; she is strong again; she had great wins here.
So it will be a good semis.
Q. What do you remember about the matches against Caroline in the past particularly?  You obviously had some long ones; some insane long rallies in Indian Wells.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I remember long matches with her.  I remember we have tough rallies and always really tough ones.
So for sure it will be - if it's her again - really tough battle.
But, yeah, I'm looking forward to take the chance again with her to play and to take the challenge.  It's the semis, so it doesn't matter against who I'm playing.  I mean, it will be tough one.  I'm looking forward if it's Caroline.
Q. You're known for working so hard on your game, and your game has gotten better and better each year.  You still have a ways to go.  What would it mean to you to finally become the best player in the world?  What would that mean to you?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Um, this would mean a lot to me.  I mean, when I was a kid I was always dreaming to being the No. 1.  Let's see.  I mean, there are still matches to go.
Also, Serena has to play as well very good.  I mean, let's see.  I mean, I'm looking forward to play, first of all, my next match.  If the day will come, it will be amazing.
Q. As you mentioned, we don't know the name of your next opponent.  I'd just like to ask you about the specific challenge of each one, starting with Caroline.  When you face her, what do you consider to be the greatest challenge in her game for you?  And then the same with Anastaija?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: With Caroline, I mean, I know she's moving very well and she brings a lot of balls back, so I have to be really patient, like today, and waiting for the shots and being aggressive.  That will be for sure the challenge with her.
And against Sevastova, I think I never played against her yet, so...  But this is also -- I mean, she has nothing to lose.  She plays now also one of her best tennis.  She reach the quarters here, so she will give everything.  Yeah, actually, I don't know exactly how she's playing right now.
