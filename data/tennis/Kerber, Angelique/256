A. KERBER/E. Makarova
  6‑2, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Yet another semifinal this year. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.

Q.   How much of a distraction was it to have to stop when you did for the long break?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, it was not easy to manage this, because you don't know how long we need to wait, when it's stopping raining, but I'm happy to manage this and go out there after the more than two hours rain delay and win the match.
It was not easy, because she is also, I mean, a great player.   She won or she beat great players here this week, Petra, and, I mean, it means a lot to be in another semifinal this year.

Q.   How difficult was the court?   How slippery was it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, it was fine, actually.   Yeah, it was not slippery.   I mean, if it start raining, you feel if that's a little bit slippery, but after that it was fine.   No, it was good.

Q.   When you came back out to play, it was a little bit difficult for you?   You faced those break points.   Were you worried at that stage you wouldn't be able to continue the momentum?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, it was difficult for me to go out if I was 6‑2, 3‑1 up.   And also I was a little bit nervous, but she start also very well after the rain delay.   But, yeah, I mean, I just tried to focus on me, tried to make my game plan and to play until the end.

Q.   Do you have a special thing that you do when there are rain breaks like this?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Not really.   Just listen to music, reading, and just relaxing and waiting and hoping.

Q.   Get it off your mind, basically?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.

Q.   And you were the only player playing today that's won a title this year.   Does that give you a lot of confidence going into the semifinals?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, for sure.   I mean, I know that she played very well on the grass.   She won here the title.   Also, she beat, like I say, Petra here.   So it gives me for sure a lot of confidence.
It's good for me to have one more match or maybe two more matches before Wimbledon, and this was my goal here.

Q.   Do you find this is good preparation for Wimbledon?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   For sure.   I mean, this is my first time here, and I enjoy my stay.   Also, the courts are very good, so I think that's the best thing I can do before Wimbledon.

Q.   Have you sampled English fish and chips here?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Not really, but my coach does.   I just watched.   (Smiling.)
