THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. How are you feeling on the grass with a couple wins under your belt? Do you feel fully comfortable now?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I'm feeling better. I'm feeling better than the first round today. It's good that I have little bit matches also in Birmingham.   
I'm feeling always good on grass. This is why I love this tournament and looking forward to play next round.   
   
 Q. Are you surprised at all, as the No.4 seed and Australian Open champion, that you were on a small court today?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think, yeah, I heard a lot of discussions about this also. Venus was playing there. Petra was playing there I think yesterday.   
But you never know. It was rain delayed from yesterday. I know that they would like to have a lot of play and matches continue today, and also from yesterday.   
I think it's fine. I think it's good that these courts have Hawk‑Eye, so this is okay.   
   
 Q. When you say 'discussions,' who were you talking with?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I read a little bit on Twitter on this. I was speaking about this with my coach and a few others, so yeah.   
   
 Q. For you the court was okay?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I won, so it was okay.   
   
 Q. Could I ask you a few quick questions with one‑word answers for the fun of it?   
THE MODERATOR: Keep it to one or two, please.   
   
 Q. The player you most like to see play?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I like to see Roger to playing.  
   
 Q. The athlete who you haven't met who you'd like to meet? Pass. Championship in sport outside of tennis that you would most like to win?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I love to watch the footballs, so football games. But it's a team sport, so I like also playing on a team.  
   
 Q. Your favorite movie?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Notebook.  
   
 Q. And actress to play you in the movies?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Julia Roberts.   
   
 Q. If you had to eat one food for the rest of your life, what would that food be?
