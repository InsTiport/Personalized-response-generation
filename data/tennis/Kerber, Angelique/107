6-4, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You must be pleased with that performance.  Can you tell me your thoughts about the match, how you felt you played.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it was a good match for me.  I mean, especially after the last match I played, I'm really happy about the way I played from the beginning.   
I think it was a tough match.  I mean, the score is not maybe looking like that, but at the end every single game was really tough.  We both run a lot.   
I'm happy that I won it in two sets and I played like I played today.   
 Q.  We were talking to Karolina Pliskova yesterday.  She was saying some of the combined events, in the beginning it took her awhile to get used to them because there's so many people.  How do you find these tournaments?  Do you prefer them to the WTA only, or the other way around?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's always good if they are together, you know, because there are much more things happening.  At the end, of course, it's really tough the first few days.  That's why I try to stay here, then if I have the chance just go back to the hotel and just doing my things.   
But I think it's nice to playing with the mens.  It's always good.  Of course, it's more busy then.   
 Q.  It's not your best tournament.  You said it some days ago.  What do you expect now after qualifying to the second round for the first time in the last four years?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, it's now very good feeling because the last three years I lost here in the first round.  It was not the best tournament I played, that's true.  That's why I have no preparation.  I mean, every single round I'm going through it, it's actually good for me.  Yeah, I really was not playing so good the last years.   
But maybe change this year.  Let's see.
