THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What went wrong tonight?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I think it was not my best day.  I mean, I was trying to find my rhythm.  But especially in my serve, I couldn't find it.   
I think that I did too many easy mistakes.  I think that was at the end the key.   
 Q.  Overall a very good week for you.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think I had a good two weeks overall.  Of course, I am looking forward in improving after these two weeks.   
 Q.  How do you explain the difficulty against her sometimes?  What is tricky about her?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's -- I don't know.  Every match starts from zero.  I know I can win against her, as well.  I won against her before.   
But, yeah, I think just today I was not playing my best.  She plays good at the end, so yeah.   
 Q.  Overall it's been a terrific five or six weeks for you since the start of the year.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it was for sure a good start.  It's still the beginning of the season.  After these two weeks, I know where I am.  I know what I can still improve.   
Yeah, now the next one is Indian Wells.  I'm looking forward to play the next big tournament in few weeks.
