  A. KERBER/A. Tomljanovic6-3, 6-2THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.Q. You've had a great run in the last few weeks.  What do you put that down to?  You've done really well in the last few weeks, especially on clay.ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I think I was working very hard in the last few months. Clay was not always my, yeah, favorite surface, but right now I think I'm playing very well.  I have a lot of confidence from the last week, so I'm really happy about my performance here. I'm looking forward to play my next matches.Q. And you've gone back to your old coach also recently.  How much of a difference has that made to your game?ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, changed the coaches actually to my old one.  It was a good decision if the moment.  I'm feeling good on court right now, so it was at the end the best decision I can did in the moment, like few months ago.Q. I read somewhere that you also train with Steffi Graf; is that true?ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yes, I practice with her like after Miami before Indian Wells.  [Sic]  yeah, that's true.Q. What exactly did she bring to your game?  Did she just help you sharpen it?ANGELIQUE KERBER: No, I mean, I just went there and I played a little bit with her.  She came to my practice session, so that was actually nothing special right now I can say. So, yeah.
