6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Conditions looked a little bit difficult there at times, the roof was opened, closed, sunny, cloudy. How do you sort of manage conditions when you're out on court? Do you have to change your game style to match the conditions?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Not really. I mean, I'm already, yeah, get used to the conditions. I mean, it's Melbourne. You never know what to expect. So I was just trying, you know, to focusing on my game, playing how the game plan was, not really thinking about the weather conditions.
Q. Does the court play differently if the roof is closed compared to a sunny day outside?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course, it's a little bit different when the roof is closed because the sound is a little bit different. It's, like, more indoors. But the court is the same. I mean, the speed of the balls and everything is the same.
Q. Two straight-sets wins now. Do you feel that's helped you shake off any nerves you could have going into a slam?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, the first rounds are always, yeah, not so easy. It doesn't matter if you win in two sets or three sets. You always have to deal with the nerves with the first rounds.
Of course, it's a great feeling to have now two matches under my belt with two sets where I played a little bit better today than in the first round. Just improving step by step, trying to, yeah, playing good tennis in every single round.
