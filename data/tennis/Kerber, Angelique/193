A. KERBER/C. Witthoeft
  6‑0, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   That must have been unexpected to win by that scoreline today for you. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah.   I mean, it was 6‑0, 6‑0, but still I think it was a good match for me.
Carina was playing not bad, actually.   So the games was not like 40‑ 0.   It was very close, actually.
Yeah, I mean, I was focusing just on myself.   It's always tough to play against a German one.   It's always not easy.   But at the end I was going out there to try how I play on practice and it worked. 
I'm very happy about my performance in the first round.

Q.   Obviously you were just focusing on winning the match and getting into the second round, but at which stage, how long after the match do you have any sympathy for your opponent when you beat somebody 6‑Love, 6‑Love?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I mean, you know, yeah, I don't know when I won a match 6‑0, 6‑0, at least, but, you know, the first matches in the Grand Slams are always tough.   I was actually really focusing just on myself, not looking too much on her.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I was trying, playing just my tennis.   Doesn't matter what the score was.   So that was my goal, actually.

Q.   Can you remember losing a match Love and Love yourself?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   Actually, no.   Not really.   I don't know when it was.

Q.   Is this the first double bagel you ever had, was it, Love and Love?   First time ever you won?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No.   It was not the first time, but I don't remember my last time when I was... 

Q.   2007. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   '07? 

Q.   You are compatriots but are you good friends?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   We know each other because we are both from the north of Germany, so we know each other but actually that was the first time that we are playing each other.   So, yeah.   But we know each other, yes.

Q.   Your confidence must be very high, because you have done very well here in the past.   You have just won Birmingham.   How do you feel about going forward in this tournament this year?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I'm feeling good on grass, and I played always good.   Yeah, two weeks ago I won my first title on grass, so it's always good to come with a title to the tournament and to a Grand Slam.
But still, I mean, this is a completely new tournament.   Every match starts from zero.   The good thing, I had like a lot of matches on grass so far, and yeah, I'm happy to be back here.   I really enjoy my stay.

Q.   Would you say you're in your best form ever?   Because you have won three titles this year, which is as many as you've ever won together. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I'm playing good tennis right now.   That's for sure. 
But I'm still trying to improve my game every day.   This is my goal.   Of course going on court and to win matches, that counts at the end, and I'm feeling good so far.
