  6‑4, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   May 2011 you were ranked 71 in the world; now you're 7 in the world and you just beat Serena to advance to the semis here in Cincinnati.   Can you elaborate on how far you've come in the last year and a half?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, I have actually nothing to lose today.   I mean, the year is, it's unbelievable for me from the last years.
So, yeah, I mean, it's changed a lot.   I have a lot more confidence than last year and I improved more, so right now I think that I am other tennis player than I was last year.   I enjoy my game. 
I mean, today it was one of my biggest wins in my career, for sure.   Yeah, it's amazing to be in the semis here.

Q.   You have beaten Venus and Serena pretty close together in the last few weeks.   I mean, talk about that.   That's quite an achievement. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, I'm actually not thinking about who was my opponent and who is on the other side.
So of course I beat both of them in the last, I don't know, four weeks.   Yeah, for sure it's a great feeling because they are both so great players and won so many Grand Slams in the past.   They still playing so well.
Yeah, I mean, it's great that I could beat both of them.   Yeah. 

Q.   Has it gotten to the point where you're no longer surprised by these results?   You've won a lot this year. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I won a lot.   Yeah, I mean, the tournament is still going.   Of course, I mean, I'm not surprised, but I'm very proud about this, that I won this match.   And also in two sets. 
I mean, like I say, I had nothing to lose.   I enjoy the match, and my goal was just give my best and try to hit the ball and, yeah, move very well and get the balls back from her because they are so fast.
So, yeah, and I tried my plan and it works.

Q.   I don't know if you're playing New Haven next week, but I know Andrea Petkovic is going to be back.   How much have you missed your teammate the last couple months?   What's it going to mean to have her back on tour?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I miss her a lot.   Not every day, but every week we are still in contact.   I know she had a very hard last months with the injury and everything, but I'm sure she's coming back right now stronger than in the past.
So, yeah, I'm happy for her that she's back right now.   I'm sure she will, yeah, she will be back very soon and play very great from the first tournament.

Q.   Is there room for both of you in the top 10?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   For sure.   (Smiling.)   I think so.

Q.   What's your favorite thing to do in New York City during the Open?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I go shopping.   (Laughter.)
Q.Where to? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Tiffany's.
No, I mean, NewYork, everything starts there for me last year and I had such a great memories there, so I'm really looking forward to go there, play the US Open, and try to play very well there. 
Yeah, I had now a lot of good matches before, so I will go there with a lot of confidence and with great feelings.
Yeah, I'm looking forward.

Q.   Do you remember when you first came to New York, the first time that you were ever there?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   It was long time ago.   I remember that I was with my coach with which I practice right now, and I was one out from the quallies and didn't get in.   So I remember my first time in New York.

Q.   Was that as a junior or pros?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think when I was 16 or 17.   My ranking was like 200‑something.   I was one out to get to the quallies and nobody withdraw, so I was one out.   Yeah. 
I had like three days New York and then go back to Germany, so it was not so nice. 

Q.   Playing someone like Serena, do you have to make a conscious effort to tell yourself, It's just a tennis match, it's not Serena on the other side of the net?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, for sure.   I go out there, and I go out there and not thinking that it's Serena on the other side.   That's just the opponent and not thinking about her, just thinking about me and try to make my plan what I make with my coach, yeah, and do it.

Q.   What's the difference between playing Serena and Venus?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Oh, I don't know.   They hit both very good serve, and if they hit the balls, you have no chance to get them.   I think they are play similarly.   I don't know.   They play both very well.

Q.   You were saying that you went into the match thinking that you didn't have anything to lose.   You're the winningest player on tour; she had a 19‑match winning streak.   Why do you feel like you don't have anything to lose when you play against Serena?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Because she won the Wimbledon, she won the Olympics, and, I mean, she won everything, I think.   Yeah, I had nothing to lose.   I think she was the favorite, not me. 
So that's why I told me I have nothing to lose.   I think also I feel better to say to me I have nothing to lose than to go out there and say, Yeah, you need to win.   So I say better, You have nothing to lose.

Q.   I know players tell the media that I have nothing to lose, but is that something that inside you have to force yourself to think it?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   No, not really.   If I say I have nothing to lose, I go out there and just try, have fun, enjoy my match, and really try to play very well and show the people also that I can play very well.   Yeah.

Q.   Serena said that when she's not the favorite, she actually gets angry.   She feels like she should be, and people should expect her to win.   Do you ever get annoyed, given your track record for the year, that maybe sometimes you're not the favorite when actually you should be?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Maybe, but right now I'm not thinking about this.   No. 

Q.   Could you tell us a little bit about your coach?   You just mentioned that he was with you at the beginning of your career and then you have different coaches and then he get back.   How much he contributed to your success? 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   A lot.   I think he was my first coach if I got to the WTA Tour.   Then I had like some years a lot of more coaches, but right now I'm back with him. 
And, yeah, I mean, I feel very great with him.   He show me what I'm doing right now and talk to me about game plan and everything, so I'm very proud that I'm with him, I can work with him.   Yeah. 

Q.   Before the Open, you played the tournament in Dallas and you were in the finals and lost to... 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Semifinals, Rezai.

Q.   So what's your expectation?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I don't know.   I mean, I'm not thinking right now about Dallas.   I'm still here in the semis right now, and I'm focused right now for tomorrow.

Q.   Who would you like to see?   If you reach the final, who would you like to see in the final?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I don't know.   First I need to play the semis, and that's for me right now the important things. 
Yeah, before this match I actually didn't know against who I play in the semis.   I know right now that it's Kvitova or Pavlyuchenkova.   I don't know.

Q.   Did you and your coach think about your goals for the US Open?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   My goals are still the same.   I mean, my goals are to going out there and try to play my game.   You know, just enjoy to come back to NewYork with all the great memories I had last year and show that I can play maybe better than last year.
But I mean, I go there and just try to play round by round, and we will see how far I got.   So just play my game.

Q.   Will you write another blog today?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yes, I will do.
