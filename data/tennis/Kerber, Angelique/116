THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Just wondering what you have been up to since Australia and how you're feeling heading into the tournament.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: So, after Australia I went back home and I spent few days at home, doing nothing actually, just being at home.   
It was very cold.  But then I start again to practicing.  I came here little bit earlier to get ready and to get used to the courts, to the weather conditions.   
Yeah, I'm feeling ready to play again because it's, since Australia, a long time since I played matches.  It's great again to have matches here and then after Dubai.   
 Q.  How confident are you feeling following the defeat in Australia, the break, and now heading into this and next week's tournament?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, of course, I had like few weeks off where I played matches.  But I think it was not bad to get a bigger rest, to get ready for these two tournaments.   
I'm feeling good.  So, of course, the first rounds are always a little bit tougher because you have to get used to the tournament feeling again, to the match things.   
But, yeah, I think that I'm ready.  I really enjoy my tennis right now on the practice court.  So, yeah, for me the tournament can start already (smiling).   
 Q.  How keen are you on winning your world No. 1 back?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course, I mean, for me it's really important to play good tennis, to try to improving my tennis.  Yeah, this is actually my goal always.   
Of course, I will do my best in the next few weeks, few months.  If you play good tennis, I mean, then you have results.  This is actually for me the most important thing, to win matches again, getting the confidence back, then we will see what's happen in the next few months.   
 Q.  When you have a bye in the first round, do you look and see about your possible first-round opponents or do you wait till they win?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: My coach is watching the match, for sure.   
Actually, I know everybody.  I mean, it's not that I don't know the girls, the opponents.  For sure, when I have the time, when I can watch a little bit, I will maybe watch.  But at the end, yeah, I know how they are playing.  It's not a big deal.   
 Q.  Have you seen the draw?  Do you know who is your possible opponent?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yes, I know who.   
 Q.  I want to ask you about Dasha.  You played her already this year and she beat you.  What do you see in her game and what kind of potential do you see in her?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: This is tough.  I mean, yeah, I played against her in Sydney.  She played a good match.  I was not playing my best on that time.  For sure, I mean, she's a young player.  She improved a lot from the last year.   
Yeah, you know, it's always tough to play against the young girls that are coming right now.  But I'm looking forward.  I mean, she's a tough opponent.  If I have the chance to play against her in my first round it's, for sure, a good match.  Yeah, I ready to play.
