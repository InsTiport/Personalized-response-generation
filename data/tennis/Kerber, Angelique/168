E. BOUCHARD/A. Kerber
6-1, 5-7, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Very tough match.  Obviously difficult for you to lose.  But can you talk about Genie Bouchard?  Can you talk about how she played?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, I can just say something about me and --
Q. Please, then.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: -- about the match.
I can say that the first one-and-a-half sets I was completely not playing my game and I was completely not on the court.
So I was just trying to fighting back.  I was not play my best tennis, but of course I was fighting and the third set was really close.
But at the end she played good.  Yeah, she won the last point in the match.
Q. How much are you disappointed for this performance?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, actually I'm disappointed that I was not playing my best tennis.  I was playing not good the first set.  And also the second set was not my tennis.  So that's why of course I'm disappointed to lose here in the first round.
But, yeah, I mean, right now I will try to go back to my rhythm, fight in the next few days and being ready for Paris.
Q. Go straight to Paris?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know yet.
Q. No tournament next week?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: (shrugging.)
