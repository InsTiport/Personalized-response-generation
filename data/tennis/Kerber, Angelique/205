  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   So what do you think of the tournament so far and the city?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I mean, it's my first time in Wuhan, and I need to say it's a great city.   Facilities here are amazing.   Everything is new and everybody is taking care of you.   
It's really nice.   I mean, I'm looking forward to be here the next days and, yeah, let's see.   But in the moment it's everything perfect.  
   
 Q.   So as you go into this section of the season, I mean, is your motivation the finals?   Is that what kind of dictates the rest of the season for you?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   You know, actually, of course it's maybe a goal, but I'm not thinking about this right now.  
I mean, I try to focus until every single match right now.   I mean, there are still some tournaments left and it's the end of the year, so of course you are a little bit tired but you try to get motivate for every single match.   I think that's my focus right now, to just try to play my tennis like I played the whole year and try to, yeah, to stay in the last tournaments the same, confident and to play consistent‑‑ consistent, yeah, the last tournaments, actually.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   (Through translation.)   You have entered into the finals, at least three finals of the WTA tournaments.   Do you have any expectations?   Like do you want to make any breakthroughs here in Wuhan Open, and do you think that you have got yourself fully prepared for Wuhan Open?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, I'm coming here and I prepare very good.   I played good tennis last week, and I'm looking forward to be here for my first time.  
Yeah, I will try to play my best tennis and, yeah, and then see what's happen at the end of the year.   I mean, right now I try to stay motivate and stay focus on myself and just try, yeah, try to enjoy the last tournaments of the year.
