THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You must be pleased with how you dealt with a dangerous opponent.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think it was a really tough match.  Especially because I know how she's playing and what to expect.  For me it was important to play my game from the first point, to really be aggressive, have the tension on my side of the court, just trying to enjoying also the match on the Centre Court.   
Yeah, actually I'm happy how I played now the match against her.   
 Q.  The score shows it's quite easy.  Can you explain why you feel it's tough?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I think the score, you cannot see the match from the score.  I mean, I think every single game was really tough.  I mean, I was serving very well today.  I think that was the key at the end, that I really served, yeah, a lot of first serve, then I played my game.   
But, yeah, she was always there.  She was also, like, fighting until the last point.  She was trying to finding the way, as well, especially in the second set.  But, yeah, I'm happy how I served the whole match.   
 Q.  Was it slightly a different experience on Centre Court than you're used to, because a lot of fans were watching the football?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I was still enjoying the match on court.  It's always special to play on the Centre Court.  I knew before that England is playing on the same time.  But, I mean, that was not in my mind.  I was just happy to play there.   
 Q.  Your record against Bencic in official matches isn't the best.  What made it difficult for you in the past to play against her?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: We never played on grass, so it will be the first time as well.  Yeah, she's a tough opponent.  She has nothing to lose.  She is always a dangerous, yeah, player.  She likes to play on grass.   
We played a lot of matches.  Yeah, I think the last one was in Perth, Hopman Cup this year.  Yeah, it's another tough match to play.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the comeback she's made overcoming physical problems?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, she's always a fighter.  I know her since, yeah, years.  She's coming back always.  She had always the problems with her body.  She's always finding the way to coming back and playing good tennis from the first point.  She has nothing to lose.  She's enjoying to playing on grass.   
She played good matches.  She won against tough opponents here.  It will be another really hard match for me, as well.   
 Q.  What about your style of play that makes it particularly hard to play against her?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, I mean, she's playing really flat.  She's serving good.  It is always not easy to play against her.   
But I know what to expect.  Like I said, we played a lot of matches.  Now I will looking forward to playing against her again, first time on grass.   
 Q.  Second-highest seed left in the competition.  What does that mean in terms of your aspirations for the tournament?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: For me, I'm just looking from my rounds, every single day.  You can just see how close it is.  You have to be ready for every single round.  Especially at the Grand Slams, you have to play your best tennis and go through it.   
But for me, I have just my eyes on my way, on my days, my matches.
