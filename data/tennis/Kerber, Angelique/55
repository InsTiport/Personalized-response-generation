THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You're now the top seed in the women's draw.  Do you feel added pressure because of that?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: No.  I mean, to be honest, I am not feeling the pressure because I am not looking on the seeded or who is left or not.  I'm just looking forward for my next match.  For every single day that I'm here trying to do my best.  This is all I'm focusing on.   
 Q.  Talk about today's match against Belinda.  She's been a tough opponent for you in the past.  How difficult was the match?  What are you pleased with?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, it was not so easy, especially because I know she's playing very well on grass.  She beat me always in the top matches.  Today I was just trying to being aggressive.  She played well, especially, yeah, when she was down.  She came back in the second set.  She had set points.  I'm coming back, so it was a little bit of up and downs in the second set.  Actually I'm happy that I'm through in two sets.   
 Q.  Seemed like you maintain your focus very well when there are pauses in the matches.  What is your approach to changeovers?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I mean, in the changeovers I'm just thinking about my plan, about what I want to do in the next points.  This is all I'm thinking on court.  On every single point, trying to do my best, yeah, to take the match in my hand.  Just being aggressive like I was, yeah, playing the matches before, which gives me the confidence why I'm in the quarters right now.   
I'm just trying to doing the same what I did in the last couple of days here.   
 Q.  Do you feel grass brings out your most aggressive game style?  If so, do you do that because you know you have to on this surface or because you actually like playing that way on this surface?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's both.  I mean, first I know that I have to do it.  On the other side, I like to play on grass.  I think that I know how to play on the surface.  I have so many great matches during the years where I have a lot of nice experience.  That gives me the confidence that I know that I have to be, yeah, the aggressive one which has to really try to play point by point and take the point on my hand.   
 Q.  I think you're the only WTA player to reach the second week at all the majors.  Is this something you are aware of?  Does it have to do with planning at peaking at these events?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: For me this year, it was really important for me to really playing again a consistent year.  We are at halftime now.  Actually I'm just trying to focusing on every single match now, not thinking which round it is, if it's the second week or the first round.  I know every match is really tough, especially at the Grand Slams.   
I'm just trying to improving my game, as well.  I mean, I'm practicing really hard.  Now I'm trying to making the transit from the practice, on the match courts, trying to be better and better.   
 Q.  Do you think the players left in really feel it's there for anyone to win this year?  Do you feel it's Serena's to lose?  How do you feel about it?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think everybody who is in the quarters played very good tournament so far.  Everybody has to deserve that, I think.  But it's still a long way until the end.   
For me, really I'm not thinking about others.  I'm just thinking about my next match, which is tomorrow.  This is all I care.   
 Q.  Playing Daria next.  You just played in Eastbourne.  Tight and dramatic match.  What do you take out of that match?  What are the particular problems she provides?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it will be another tricky match.  She played very well in the last months.  We played so many battles also this year against each other.   
Yeah, I know what to expect.  I know, yeah, she know how to play on grass, as well.  She know where the ball has to go.  I think I will just trying to, yeah, playing like I played the last days.  It's a new day, it's a new match, and everything starts from zero tomorrow again.
