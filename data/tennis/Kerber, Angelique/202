A. KERBER/B. Strycova
  6‑1, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   If we set the score as 10, how would you score your performance today?   Is there anything that you can improve?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   Yeah, it was a good match for me today.   It's tough to say a number.   I mean, I played a very good match.   It was tough, because Barbora is a great player and she played very well.
So I'm happy about my performance today, and I will try to play tomorrow the same, to be aggressive and try and improve a little bit maybe my serve, but that's it.   Try to be consistent like that. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   For all the unexpected results the seeds experienced in previous matches, how do you feel about the performance of those seeds?
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   It's tough to say that for me.   I mean, we have the last tournaments of the year, and of course it's always tough to be motivated, but, I mean, all the players are great opponents.   You see it's always tough to play also like maybe new tournament. 
But I just can say for myself, I mean, I'm feeling good and I hope that I can, yeah, play well here. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   First I'd like to extend my congratulations for you to advancing to top 10 of Wuhan Open.   So I wonder if you are still confident and you have the confidence to win the championship of the Wuhan Open. 
ANGELIQUE KERBER:   I think it's still a long way.   I mean, for now I will focus on my match tomorrow.   And, yeah, I think I'm feeling good.   I'm healthy. 
I played also last week a good tournament in Tokyo, so I'm confident.   I just try to be focused on every single match here.
