6-3, 3-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  A tough match, but you were able to force that into a third set.  What do you think was the difference in the third set?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I don't know yet.  I think I was not playing good in the first set.  I start to play my game actually in the second set, and then, yeah, I think at the end she won the deciding points, and I think that was the key for the match.   
 Q.  Were there things that you felt you were doing particularly well tonight?  It looked like especially the third set there was good intensity and movement with some of your shots towards the end there.  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I don't think it's the best year, and also, today I was not able to play from the beginning my match and my game.  I was always having, like, up-and-downs, and that's for sure not the game I can play.  Yeah.   
 Q.  You mentioned being frustrated with the season.  Is it hard to take the court with a positive, you know, attitude, feeling confidence despite everything that's going on on the practice court?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: You know, I'm not thinking right now what's happen or what was in the last few months.  I mean, here I was practicing good, and yeah, I was trying my best.  I was trying to fight until the last point, but yeah, at the end I was not playing my tennis.   
 Q.  How do you feel if you've lost a previous game?  Do you think that affects your next match, or how much does that affect your confidence?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I think now I will just try to, yeah, keep going, actually.  This is what I'm trying, and hopefully I will, yeah, go out there and play my game from the beginning again.  I think this is more the goal I will have, to play a consistent match and playing my game, yeah, from the first point.   
 Q.  It was your second time facing your opponent this year.  What is the most difficult part for you?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Against her?   
Yeah, I think she played very well.  Like, the first two shots after the serve or return, she's aggressive player.  I know already what to expect against her, but, yeah, she's always playing good.   
Also today I think at the end it was just one, two points that decide the match.   
 Q.  When you say you haven't been able to play your game tonight, can I ask more specifically what you mean by your game?  
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think moving good, bringing a lot of balls back, but also playing aggressive.  And I think that I do a lot of mistakes tonight.  But I think also that I, yeah, I had not too much matches in the last few weeks, so maybe this is also a reason.  When you play matches, it's always different.   
But, yeah, it's like the movement, playing aggressive, but also playing good from the defensive, I think I do too many mistakes in the important moments.
