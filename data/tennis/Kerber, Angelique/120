7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What was happening out there with you today?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  I mean, of course the first matches of the year are always tough, and I still not feel my rhythm.  I make too many mistakes.  I was not feeling the ball.
But of course it's tough, but I think it was still good to have a match before, yeah, going to Melbourne.
Q. Are you telling yourself you only had one match here last year and it worked out okay?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Maybe I will tell myself this after the match now, yeah.  (Smiling.)
Q. How bad was the heat today?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Yeah, at the beginning of the match it was really hot.  But it's always here like that.  And in Melbourne, could be the same.
So I think the heat is, of course, still a little bit difficult, because I'm one week here, but I think that I have one week more before the Grand Slam, and this is the, yeah, the important tournament for me.
Q. When you talk about the rhythm and lack of rhythm on the court, what was more frustrating for you?  The errors, not being able to get the proper depth, or placement of the ball?  Where did you think it was kind of going wrong?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it was more that I make too many mistakes and I was not feeling actually, yeah, the ball, because the balls are flying here a little bit different than in Brisbane.
So it was not so easy, but I will try to forget the match as soon as I can.
Q. What will you do the rest of the week in order to make sure you're ready for Melbourne?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know yet.  I mean, it's just a few minutes after the match.  But for sure I will go in the next days to Melbourne, and I will try to get ready there, trying to get the positive energy from last year.
Yeah, trying to start again new tournament, new chances.  I hope I will be there from the first round again.
Q. Is the instinct right now, kind of gut instinct, to try to get to Melbourne, hit as many balls as possible, practice as much as possible, or is it to play practice matches, find other top players to maybe play a few sets with?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I think it's the mix of both, I think.  First of all, of course, I have to go there, play a few balls to feel the ball again, to feel the court.
But I think I will sit down with Torben, with my team, and we will discuss what we have to do now and what's the best for me to being ready and running.
Q. Does it feel different starting the year as No. 1?  Do you feel like there is more focus on you?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: Of course.  I mean, the focus is bigger and it's a little bit different than last year, that's true.
But, I mean, that's big experience for me.  I will try to take the experience.  Of course there are always up and downs in the tennis career and the whole year.
I mean, I'm looking forward, and I will try -- I mean, it's the second tournament of the year.  We have still a lot to go, so I will not do a big drama about that match.
Q. I think it's a bit of tradition of world No. 1s going out at this tournament.  I think Serena has done it, Caroline has done it.  It's not actually that unusual.
ANGELIQUE KERBER: I don't know.  For me, it's the first time, so I don't know.
Q. Did you feel like you had better rhythm in the conditions in Brisbane than you did here the entire week, practicing as well as match play?
ANGELIQUE KERBER: It was completely different, because in Brisbane we played also it was half indoors, so we have a roof, so it was completely different courts, balls.  They are flying a little bit different.
So I cannot compare with both tournaments.
