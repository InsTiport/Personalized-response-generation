N. Li/A. Sevastova
  7-6, 6-3

 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please. 

 Q. I was wondering, if you compare the match you played today to yesterday's match, you seemed to struggle a lot more, especially during the first set, while yesterday you were just, you know, in control. What happened today? What was the difference? 
 NA LI: (Through translation.) I understand that every match is a different match, and the opponent is different; therefore, you have seen different matches today than I did yesterday. 
 Yesterday's opponent is quite familiar. I played against her a couple of times, and today's opponent is unfamiliar to me. Actually, I asked my coach, Thomas, to get some information for me about her style of play, especially her short placement, but unfortunately we did not have that information. 
 You see, I was playing a little bit tight in the game, so that's why you see the different games today. (Laughter.)
