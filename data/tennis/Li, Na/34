 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
 Q.   Did you know much about your opponent?
  NA LI:   No.   Like zero, you know.   I tried to find the game in YouTube, so I was watch a couple of games.   I still a little bit, how do you say, strange in the beginning of the match because I really didn't know the way exactly how she play on the court.
  Yeah, but huge, big serve. 
 Q.   Yeah, she's one of the promising teenagers in the game.   What are your thoughts on her game?
  NA LI:   Yeah, I was feeling she has a huge, big serve and very good, like, baseline.
  I was feeling if she got more experience, I think she be very good player really. 
 Q.   Your next opponent is as well a very young player.   What do you know about Belinda Bencic?
  NA LI:   I think same like today.   I know she was play Kimiko today, but, you know, I have to prepare for my match so I didn't really see like as much.
  So, yeah, seem like I try to find on Internet or coach have to do something, you know. 
 Q.   How did you find the conditions today with the heat?
  NA LI:   I think today was okay, I feel.   Yeah, but I think was very lucky we play today.   Tomorrow is the worst.
  But for every player is the same, so you have to get used to it. 
 Q.   When it's going to be as hot as it's going to be tomorrow, do you still practice like normal or do you stay indoors? 
  NA LI:   I will go earlier.   Yeah, I didn't want killing myself on the court.   I always change a little bit schedule.   Yeah.
