 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You had four matches against your opponent. How did you make it today specifically?   
 NA LI: (Through translation.) Well, I think because this is the first match in the Olympics, and both of us were quite in a tense situation. Because this match is playing at home, I had lots of supporters behind me, particularly my friends who are spending me messages to encourage me.   
 Even though I suffer some injuries, they still encourage me to fight. So it's been very helpful.   
  
  Q. What are some of the turning points in this match? Will your injury have an impact on your upcoming matches?   
 NA LI: (Through translation.) Well, I think as you can tell from this match, I recovered quite well from my injury, and because Olympics is a four-year event, therefore I actually focus on every point and focus on every match.   
  
  Q. How are singles games in your Olympics going to fair in the future?   
 NA LI: (Through translation.) It's not for me to predict for other people. Today for me was a very close match. I only have to focus on every match, every point.
