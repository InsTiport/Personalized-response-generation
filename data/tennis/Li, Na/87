  4‑6, 6‑2, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Chinese, please. 

Q. First, congratulations.   Actually, today it's a really tough match, especially for your service.   You have a lot of double faults.   Also, you also have a large quantity of unforced errors.   My question is:   Can you tell me whether you feel a little bit impatient or rushed during the match?
NA LI:   I'm very much interested why every time when I, no matter I have any difficulties, people always ask me what's going on with my mentality.   You know, actually, for everything happened that might happen on the court, I think I'm very much pleased to win the match today eventually.
Anyway, we have two Chinese players compete with each other.   We get to know each other pretty well, which is very much different from the match with the, you know, players from the other countries.   We get to know each other pretty well, so we know the skills of each other pretty well. 

Q. I think the audiences today are very much excited and happy, because they can feel that for the two highly competent female players in China who are very much, you know, concentrate on the match.   So do you think when will China see the next generation, I mean, the junior generation come up and then to play the match as you are?   For example, Zhang Shuai is yet to decide when to play as an individual player.   Did you take a long time to consider whether you're going to take the professional career as an individual player?
NA LI:   Just now you only mentioned Peng Shuai and Li Na, but actually did not include Zheng Jie, which would be otherwise unfair for her.
At the very beginning, began to play as individual player.   Everybody has different thoughts.   You can't expect that Zhang Shuai shares the same idea as I did.   Everybody has different circumstances or environment.
Actually, I used to ask Zhang Shuai what kind of road Zhang Shuai supposed to take, and Zhang Shuai prefer to take her way, and not everybody will be sufficient enough or strong enough to choose to play as an individual player.
If you're gonna play as an individual player, definitely it's a little bit risky.   It is not suitable for all players. 

Q. It seems like you work out that decision easily and very much fast. 
NA LI: Yes, this is my personality.   I intend to work out the situation very easily and quickly.

Q. I think this is very important tough competition in professional career because you have a competition with another Chinese player.   Some people say that if you can make through this match, you are gonna have next milestone in your professional career.   Actually today we noticed Carlos didn't go to the court to talk to you during the match.   Will you bother to give us explanation why?   Even you have very tough competition, you didn't ask Carlos to go to the court to discuss with you. 
NA LI: I don't think this is the most important match in my professional career.   If the most important one I prefer to regard is French Open as most important one. This is just another win of this tournament at all.
If you believe it is the most important and most tough one, definitely when a newspaper is going to come out, definitely you will write a script like that.
Actually, when I finished the Tokyo tournament, I discuss with Carlos that Carlos will not go to the court to coach me until it is very much necessary. 
I personally believe that I can control the match today.   Otherwise I will definitely ask, you know, Carlos to give me coach there.

Q. If Bartoli fail to be champion in China Open, definitely you will be qualifying to play for WTA final.   So can you share with us your expectation for your preparation for WTA final?
NA LI: Actually, whether Bartoli will win or not has nothing to do with me.   I can't expect to be qualify for WTA because Bartoli failed.   I can't control the WTA final.   What I am going to control is control myself on the match.
Anyway, you know, WTA final is only eligible for the top eight.   This is achievement for all the players who have made a very important achievement in the past season.   I'm going to try to take an important vacation after this one.   

Q. Every time when we talk about the young or junior players you are not very much confidant for them.   Today Ze Zhang is competing with Gasquet.   Will you bother to make comments on the significance of this match?   Because in China it's not easy first to have excellent, you know, Chinese male player as you are in Top 10. 
NA LI: Actually, a lot of people ask me why in China we only have female competent players but not male competent players.   I would say probably the male players in China prefer to choose table tennis, as a joke. Then I would say that they haven t woken up. 
Today I m happy that Ze Zhang beat a Top 20 player in China. I think that's very important, a significant match for him, and he's going to gain more confidence in his professional career.   If he failed to win Gasquet today, probably he's going to be a little bit negative towards the match. It s a big step for him to win this match.

Q.   Before you participate in this match, does your coach give you specific guidance to be prepared for Peng Shuai, or does Peng Shuai give you some unexpected things during the match?
NA LI: How to say it, actually, Carlos didn't have a very good understanding of Peng Shuai.   We will not change our plan simply because of a match.
You know, Carlos only concentrate on myself.   We just do as what we did in past three, you know, matches.

Q. My question is following the previous question.   Zhang Shuai wanted to take the professional player and play as individual player.   I want to ask you that.   You know, everybody knows Zhang Shuai's personality.   For the other players like Zhang Shuai, if they're going to try to play as individual player, do you think how much opportunity will be given, what kind of practice will be given to Zhang Shuai?
NA LI:   I will tell you that I can't answer that question, because I'm not Zhang Shuai. I don t know her personality, neither her experience. It's better for you to ask Zhang Shuai those questions. 

Q.   Today we know that Peng Shuai has a strong will and she is patient.   We noticed from the statistics you have over 20 winners.   Does that mean that you want to be more aggressive and try to finish the match as soon as possible?   For the crown‑level match, we have two Chinese female players.   Does that mean that actually this will help us to improve the brand for Chinese players?
NA LI: Actually, I don t think that much.   This is just a simple match for me.   I don't have so many thoughts. I just want to try my best.

Q.   (Off microphone.)
NA LI: I think no one can make more unforced errors as I did.

Q. Some people say that when you are trying to do some homework prior to the competition it's very much easy for you to lose because you can't get enough information from the opponent.   Is that simply because you don't know the opponent before?   Does your coach Carlos help you to change you in this regard?   You will stick to what you planned in advance even if you are not so familiar with your opponent? 
NA LI: I can tell you the answer in the future.   When I get to know an opponent that I'm not familiar with, I want to repeat again that for female players, actually we are basically equal to each other in terms of competence.   Everybody have the chance to win title. 

Q. Tomorrow you're going to fight against Radwanska.   In North America this year you have already defeated her twice.   So can you talk about it?
NA LI: I'm very much looking forward to this match, but defeating her in North America means nothing to playing in China Open. Actually, today, you know, Radwanska has no match. And I had a really long match with Peng Shuai.
Anyway, I'm happy that I m still continue my match in China Open, so I'm very much looking forward to her match, have a competition with her tomorrow.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English.

Q.   Are you going to make any changes with how you approach service tomorrow?
NA LI:   I wish, but I don't know.   You know, like two days ago I have like unbelievable serve, but today I think I got a lot of double faults.
This right now still change techniques I have to used to.   I always wish I could have good serve in the match today.

Q.   Did you and Peng Shuai exchange any words after the match?
NA LI:   I mean, no.   Until now, I still didn't see her.   Yeah, I will talk to her after press conference if I can see her.
