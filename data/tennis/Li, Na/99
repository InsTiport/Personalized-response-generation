THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk a little bit about the opponent tonight?  
NA LI:   I really have to say she's playing unbelievable today.   I mean, she's young and also she just win the Wimbledon this year, also.   
Today I could win the match because I was stay a long time for the tour, so I got more experience on the court.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How difficult was it with the rain delay and not knowing when you were going to play?  
NA LI:   I mean, it's really tough.   I think I was warming up like hundred times already.   Yeah, because, I mean, you never know when you can come to court, so you always have to like stand up every second.  
So, yeah.   But finally, I mean, the good news is we finish the match today.   Yeah.   (Smiling.)  
   
 Q.   Did you feel any extra pressure especially there at the end when the rain started coming down?   I'm sure you just wanted to finish that match, as well?  
NA LI:   Of course, I didn't want to wait only one point, wait for another five hours.   I was like 40‑Love, I lose one point, I heard like behind me, the guy was like, Rain, stop.   
I was like focus.   It's tough to play home country, home player.   I would like to say today is big challenge for me.   
   
 Q.   Were you impressed by her play?   She was playing on center court, not easy for her playing one of the best players in the world.   
NA LI:   It was tough.   Today I was nervous.   I mean, everyone, you saw the match, everyone can hear after she win the one point.   I would like to say today I was play good as well on the court.   So I think we show the fans we play good match, yeah.
