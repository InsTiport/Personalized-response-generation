 THE INTERPRETER: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What's your plan for the next tournaments? Are you going to play Luxembourg and Kremlin Cup?  
 NA LI: Nothing.  
  
  Q. So you don't have any chance to go to Doha anymore?   
 NA LI: (Through translation.) So far I have no idea. And if it is quite near to the qualification of the Doha year-end final, I shall be playing more tournaments.   
 But so far I have no idea about the exact ranking points.
