   THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 

 Q.  It was a very good first set, but then you seemed to sort of disintegrate a little bit.  What happened in the second two sets? 
 NA LI:  She said I played pretty well in the first set.  In the second set, Martina got the rhythm already. 
 The third set, I just lost -- totally lost my rhythm. 

 Q.  Why did you lose your rhythm in the third set there?  Was it mentally, as well? 
 NA LI:  She said mostly mentally. 

 Q.  Can you go into a bit more detail? 
 NA LI:  She said, I played pretty well in the first set.  I got opportunities in the second set, as well.  After that, Martina is very smart girl.  She got the rhythm of the game after that. 

 Q.  How disappointed are you at how the match went? 
 NA LI:  She's not really disappointed.  Just the score in the third set makes her - how you say - not comfortable with a love game. 

 Q.  Were you happy with the racquets?  You kept having problems with your racquets, string tension. 
 NA LI:  Yeah, feel a little bit weird about the racquet.  She just wanted to find a racquet which she can grip more comfortably. 

 Q.  It was a crucial game in the second set, the fifth game of the second set.  A lot of advantage for Martina.  Was it a turning point of the game? 
 NA LI:  Yeah, she saw the opportunity change suddenly to Martina's side. 

 Q.  Tracy Austin said you're not mentally tough enough yet.  What can you do to become mentally tougher to actually win those sorts of matches? 
 NA LI:  I will do it step by step, slowly. 

 Q.  Despite losing today against Martina, are you still happy with your performance in Melbourne? 
 NA LI:  Very satisfied.  She has time to do shopping then.
