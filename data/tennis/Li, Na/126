   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What's your reaction to not playing today? Is it disappointing not to get your first match under your belt today?
 NA LI: I mean, of course I was feeling so sad for Peng, because, I mean, she's a great player but just injuries so she has to pull out. 
 I mean, yeah, I was ready for play today, but I just in the locker room tape for my toe, and she was coming like, Why you tape? 
 I was like, For the match. What's going on? 
 She was like, I'm not play. 
 I was like, Don't make the joke.
 Yeah, because, she just win a match yesterday, so I never think she can pull out today. So, yes, a little bit, how you say, sad, sad for her. Yeah. 

 Q. Were you expecting this game to play against her, your countryman?
 NA LI: I think always tough you play the same country player, always tough, because like we stay like national team training together, living together, we know much. So always tough, but yeah. I like to say sorry again for her.
