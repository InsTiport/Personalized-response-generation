      6‑3, 6‑0 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   In the last match you got even with Robson for eliminating you.   This time you ended a four‑match losing streak against Jankovic.   Does it feel good to get even?  
    NA LI:   Of course.   I mean, it's very tough to play against Jankovic because she was former No.1 and she has very good defense.   I still remember last time I played her in Rome.   I was feeling I play pretty good, but still lose the match, you know.   So I was so sad after the match.   
    So before this match, Carlos didn't tell me anything.   Just say, Remember how is feeling after match.   I was like, Okay, yeah.   
    I was really, really happy today, I mean, the way I was play on the court.   I was try to serve‑volley, also try to come to the net to win, how you say, the fast.   
   
 Q.   This is your first night session win at the US Open?  
    NA LI:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How does that feel?  
    NA LI:   I mean, I like first match, you know, because after first match, you have whole day.   Not like night session.   For night session you have to wait the whole day and play in the night.   
    But after win the match I was feeling okay, just a little bit late.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on playing Makarova next?  
    NA LI:   Another lefty, more flat.   But for me today I don't have to think what I should do for next round.   Today just have good rest and prepare for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Have you been watching much of the other tennis?  
    NA LI:   I mean, I watch some tennis.   Today or yesterday they didn't show on TV, so I don't know.   They didn't show in channel.   
    I try to turn on the TV, try to see some matches, but they didn't show, yeah.
