  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You're having a good season so far.   What are your feelings about this visit to Madrid?  
LI NA:   You know, I think this first tournament for me in the clay.   So I was playing here for‑‑ I was training yesterday, feeling pretty good.  
So I think I'm ready for the clay court season.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that you are a favorite in Madrid, in the list of favorites in Madrid?   
LI NA:   What do you think?   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   I think that yes, but...  
LI NA:   Okay.   I will take that, yes.   
I think Madrid have the high‑quality tournament, so every tough playing was being here.   I think before tournament start everyone has the chance, because right now I think top 10 was pretty close, everyone.   
So I think everyone has a chance.   Have to see who play best on the court.   
   
 Q.   Explain your expectations for the clay court season.   
LI NA:   I was training two weeks in China.   Of course it was clay court, so I was doing a lot of exercise with my coach, with my team.   
Yeah, we will see.   You know, clay court for me is a little bit‑‑ for me was a little bit strange.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that Madrid is a tournament, a different tournament with other clay tournaments?   It's more different?  
LI NA:   I think every tournament is different, you know.   You can never prepare all of them.   Different country, different people.   
I don't know, maybe because the weather.   I think here is a little bit higher, so for me I was training yesterday and I was feeling a little bit tough for the breathe.   
But I think after two days should be fine.
