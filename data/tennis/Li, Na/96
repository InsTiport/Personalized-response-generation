THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Strange match.   Each set seemed to be a little different.   
NA LI:   It's not strange.   It's tough match.   I mean, this is tennis world.   I mean, yeah, I think both players play good tennis today.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How is it to be playing against Kvitova?   She's really powerful.   How tough is it to be playing against her?  
NA LI:   Yeah, it's very tough against her because she play like the ball so deep, you know.   I was feeling I have all time to defend, not like maybe last two match, I can play more aggressive on the court, so I was feeling I have more chance.  
But today I was feeling maybe like 70% time was like defense to put ball, try to put ball back deep in the court.  
   
 Q.   You had some comebacks against her in the past.   You had a big comeback yesterday.   Were you thinking any point in the third set, Okay, time for the rally now?  
NA LI:   Yeah, I tried to do the same like yesterday, but didn't happen.   So, yeah, I really have to say she's play very good today.   
   
 Q.   We saw the wrap on your knee there, the brace.   Was your knee a factor at all in this match, your leg?  
NA LI:   No, I was healthy, I was running fast on the court.   I mean, I didn't have any injury.  
I mean, the knee, because I do operation before, so just in case.   Nothing happen.  
   
 Q.   Very good start to the hard court season.   How do you see the next tournament in Cincinnati and then the US Open?  
NA LI:   Yeah, I mean, very looking forward, because this is, how you say, after Olympics was like first hard court tournament, and also my coach was coming to Cincy.   
I think we have very good start.   Yeah.
