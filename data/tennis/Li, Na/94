THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Two straight finals for you now in North America.   Has to feel pretty good.   
NA LI:   Yeah, I know, it's amazing this year, because last two years I never got one point in North America.   So, yeah, I was happy I can be the final again.  
   
 Q.   What do you think you're doing well?   
NA LI:   Today or whole tournament?   
   
 Q.   You made two finals, so just lately.   
NA LI:   I don't know, just something is change.   I even didn't know what happened.   Just, Oh, come to the final, okay.   Okay, final again.   
Yeah, because after MontrÃ©al, I mean, I was feeling very tired.   So I got here and my coach send me text message like, Okay, more important is first match.   But he didn't say after, he just say first match more important.  
Yeah, I don't know what happened.   The ball just come to the court all the time.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling tired?   Do you feel it in your body now?  
NA LI:   A little bit.   Yeah, I was talking to my team, I say, Okay, I need to take two days off after here.   So they ask me where are you going, I say, 5th Avenue.  
   
 Q.   She was serving very slow in the match.   Did that surprise you?   Seemed like you were having a lot problems adjusting to that speed?  
NA LI:   Yeah, I mean, because today was warmup like my husband was trying to shooting the serve like a little bit copy for her.   But beginning of the match, I mean, I saw her was a little bit in problem for the back.  
Next her serve was like, Oh, what's going on?   Yeah, so beginning I was like, What happened?   After, like I was win the first set, it was like 2‑Love, it 2‑1 and she called the physio.   
I was like, Oh, okay, maybe she be finishing the match, you know.   But after, I mean, she fight a lot on the court, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Was it difficult, because the serve was coming in slow, but off the ground she was hitting as hard as she normally does?  
NA LI:   Today I was feeling more like mentally match not like on the court.   More like I think both was fighting a lot on the court, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What happened in the second set?   
NA LI:   I don't know.   After she call the physio come to the court, I was like, I think lose the mind a little bit because I thought match should be finish.  
After she stand up and she is still fighting a lot on the court.   So, yeah.   But I was happy I can finally win the match.   
   
 Q.   You called Carlos after the first set that you won.   
NA LI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Then you let him sit down.   
NA LI:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   When you lost the second set you didn't call him.   Why?   
NA LI:   No, because, I mean, I didn't call doesn't mean he's doing bad job.   He's doing good job.   But sometimes I have to think by myself.   I play myself on the court.   I mean, I couldn't always ask coach come all the time, you know.  
So sometimes I really want to thinking for myself.   
   
 Q.   You can play either Kvitova or Kerber in the final.   Talk about each of them.   I know you played Petra in MontrÃ©al.   
NA LI:   Yeah, both lefty.   This is another challenge, because this tournament I only play right hand.   Both was defense unbelievable, like cover.   
So, yeah, I was playing Kvitova last week.   It was very good experience.   Yeah, looking forward for the final.  
   
 Q.   Before you played, what was your plan for the match?   
NA LI:   I mean, before come to the court I know she was serve a lot like heavy.   So I say, Okay, stand back a little bit for return.   And suddenly, I mean, maybe I thinking too much.   
And also Carlos tell me, Okay, don't think about you have to win the match.   You're just doing your job.   Because tennis is not only if you do the good job you can win the match.   It's not, because you have to see what happened for opponent, for what happened for, how do you say, both way.   
So, yeah.  
   
 Q.   How is you're husband dealing with now he's husband and no longer coach?   How is he dealing with the change?   
NA LI:   I think this is best way for us.   (Smiling.)   No, it is really.   It's really tough to find a balance between husband and coaching, so right now Carlos have the coach and husband just like change the grip, fix the drink, and send the racquet.   That's all.   (Laughter.)   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You're used to playing Serena.   Is it weird to have Serena watching you play?   
NA LI:   I was a little bit worried about, because I still remember I have experience like two years ago.   I play Venus before, and after I beat Venus.   I was against Serena but Venus was sitting in player box.   I was feeling, Uh‑oh.   
Yeah, but both was very good player, tough player as well.   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   What do you look forward to doing in New York away from the tennis?   
NA LI:   5th Avenue.   You know what that mean?   (Laughter.)   For the girls.  
   
 Q.   If you could change one thing about the US Open, what would that be?   
NA LI:   Maybe take of the french fries.   No, I mean, every time I was being the US Open I always can smell the french fries everywhere, you know.   Sometimes good, but sometimes if you are hungry, it's very tough to hold there.   Yeah.
