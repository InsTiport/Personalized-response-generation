S. WILLIAMS/N. Li
  7-5, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Li Na. 

 Q. Seemed to be a strong first set you had, but seemed to fade away a bit in the second. Couldn't keep up the intensity? 
 NA LI: I tried to do, but didn't work. 

 Q. You always have very good games against her, although it's 5-1 her favor. You don't seem to be intimidated by her on the court; is that right?
 NA LI: What? 

 Q. A lot of players are intimidated by Serena Williams. You don't seem to be. You go out and seem to like to play her aggressive game against her. 
 NA LI: You come to the court. You not need be afraid about opponent. You have to think about yourself, yeah. 

 Q. How do you assess your overall Wimbledon this time around? 
 NA LI: Not bad (smiling.) Still in quarterfinal, and come to the second week of the Wimbledon. Yeah, little bit sad I lose today. Still okay. 
 I was happy I can come to the quarterfinal again.
