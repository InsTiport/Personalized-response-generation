 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Could you take us through the match today. You seemed fairly comfortable out there. Fairly impressive win. 
 NA LI: Actually, I just walk out on the court, I saw all the fans was from her. So I was a little bit nervous. 
 Yeah, the match beginning, I just tell myself, Don't play three set. If play three set, maybe I got nervous. 
 Yeah, you never know who win the match you play three set. So on the match, I just tell myself, Hold on every point; don't give her chance. Yeah. 

 Q. How do you rate your form at the moment? You went out early in Auckland, but you looked pretty good out there today. How are you feeling about yourself.
 NA LI: Yeah, after bungy jump feeling much better, yeah. (Laughter.) Yeah. 

 Q. Your next opponent is Szavay. How do you prepare for that? 
 NA LI: I was play her last year, beginning of last year. So, I mean, still one year. One year can change too much. 
 I want to see her play. But also she play so fast, so, yeah. 

 Q. Confident going into that match?
 NA LI: I think so, yes, yeah. 

 Q. Can you talk about this coming year. What are your goals for this year? What would you like to achieve? 
 NA LI: The goal for me this year, I hope I can come to top 10, yeah. This is a goal, yeah.
