      7‑6, 6‑1 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you take us through the tiebreaker.   You were down.   What was going through your head?  
    NA LI:   I think this is more important.   If I lose in the tiebreak, maybe is another story.   And also I was 5‑3 down.   I mean, I didn't try to think about score.   Really think about, like, point by point.   
    When she has a set point and she missed the ball, I was turn, I was laughing little bit.   I was happy I'm still on the first set, you know.   After the first set, I think she was a breakdown little bit in the mind.   
   
 Q.   So overall you're happy with your performance today?  
    NA LI:   Yeah, really looking forward for quarterfinal.   Is one and a half year.   Always lose in the fourth round.   So for me it's very important for today the match.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about playing Ivanovic or Radwanska?   Who do you prefer to play?  
    NA LI:   I just stay cool to see.   They are still play right now.   I don't know.   I mean, doesn't matter.   
    Always both are tough player, so for sure is a tough match, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about what you've done in your off time.   Yesterday Kei Nishikori went to make some sushi.   Have you done anything interesting in Melbourne?  
    NA LI:   No.   I just do normal.   Just one hour practice and then go back to hotel, enjoy my room.   Not do any special, yeah.
