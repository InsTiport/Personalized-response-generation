THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   So how glad are you that you got this out of the way before the rain came?  
NA LI:   I mean, I really have no idea, you know, because, I mean, I saw the second match it was a little bit dark, but I saw, okay, because I'm not focus on the weather.   I was focused on my game.   
Just finish in the match, I was come in the locker room, and they say, Oh, how you so lucky, just rain.   
I say, Don't make a joke, because I didn't see any rain was coming.   
Finally, yeah, I was happy I can finish it before the rain come.   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   I didn't see the game, but I'm supposing that you played really well because you beat the No. 3 player in the world, which seems quite easily.   Could you talk about your game today?  
NA LI:   Yeah, I think today I play unbelievable match for both matches, because I was first match play against Errani, as well.   Yeah, I don't know what happened, maybe I have day off yesterday, I was ready to play, but finally they cancel.  
So I was a little bit worried, because if I win the first match, I have to play another one.   Of course, I was a little bit tired in the body, you know, not only for the match, because you have to, how you say, waiting for the rain and start warming up.   I think it's very tough for all of the players.  
   
 Q.   You're still looking for your first title this year.   Do you think Montreal could be the one?  
NA LI:   Yeah.   I mean, this year I have two time in the final, but I lost both.   
I would like to say I didn't play bad match in the final.   Yeah, because I only can say opponents was stronger than me.   So, yeah, I mean, Montreal was already semis, so, you know, still have a lot of good players on the draw.   
So, yeah, everyone have the chance, as well.   So I will try my best.
