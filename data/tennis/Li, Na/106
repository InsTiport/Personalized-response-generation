N. LI/A. Medina Garrigues
  3‑0, (ret.)

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How difficult was it to restart the match after you knew that she was quite injured? 
NA LI:   I mean, it was really tough, because after she has the tape and then she tried to continue play.   So I don't know it's like real or fake, you know.   I mean, some player they do that.
After two point I saw she couldn't running and she start to cry.   I have to say so sorry for her, because I know the injury for tennis athlete is bad thing.
So I wish she was soon as possible come back to the court. 

Q.   For you now, momentum, what do you do tomorrow?   Have a hit up?   Try and get a couple of hours out of yourself?   Wasn't really a full match tonight, obviously. 
NA LI:   Yeah, of course now it's late already.   Like before the match start I was make the joke for my team.   I say, Other players start at 11:00 am; I start the match at 11:00 p.m. 
Right now so late, so I didn't want to change the plan for tomorrow.   Just hit and prepare for next round.

Q.   Next round is against Kim in a replay of last year's final.   How does that prospect feel? 
NA LI:   Someone make good draw.   This only I can say.   Also, I think last year in the final I think for me was good remember for the match. 
Yeah, after that match I was feeling I really can win the Grand Slam.   Yeah, of course it was tough match, so just another challenge for myself. 

Q.   You've been training in Munich, I think. 
NA LI:   Yeah.

Q.   Was it with MÃ¼ller‑Wohlfahrt?
NA LI:   No, just with my husband.

Q.   It was not with a doctor?
NA LI:   Yeah, I was with the doctor.   Rembeck (ph.) 

Q.   What do you think you have to do against Clijsters to beat her?
NA LI:   I think we play the same way, like play against a mirror.   What can I do?   Only one day, so I couldn't change anything.   Only thing is I just try my best tennis on the court.

Q.   What did you learn from the last final here? 
NA LI:   What I learn?   I think, yeah, I mean, last year was the first time to be the finals.   I didn't have any experience for the Grand Slam final.
But after Australia I think I doing well in the French Open.   So, I mean, next round is not in the final, so I don't need any experience for the final, final experience. 

Q.   If I remember well, last year you forget about your wedding anniversary. 
NA LI:   Yeah.

Q.   You are going to remember this time?
NA LI:   Yeah, I think I can remember this year.   (Laughter.)   I didn't want to make same mistake for two times, so yeah.
