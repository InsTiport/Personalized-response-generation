 N. LI/A. Cornet
  6‑2, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Difficult finish of the match, wasn't it?   
NA LI:   It is.   I think pretty, how do you say, end of the match was nervous, you know.   Like because before the two serve games was pretty easy.   5‑4, of course, I won the finishing match, but still a little bit got tight, you know, so, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What did you do during the break?   
NA LI:   No, I was sit in office and saw the TV, they show.   I was pretty so sorry for the lady.   I mean, because I didn't see what happened, but they say falling down, I think neck problem, painful for her.   
   
 Q.   But overall for your first match on grass, what are your thoughts?  
NA LI:   Pretty good.   At least I'm still in the tournament.   (Smiling.)  
Yeah.   I mean, first grass court match, pretty good end, so looking forward for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Tough one.   
NA LI:   Yes.   Always tough.  
   
 Q.   Against someone who really knows how to play on grass.   Won here, Wimbledon final, big challenge.   
NA LI:   You are right.   Yeah.   Big challenge.   I know.   She's, I think she ‑‑she was pretty much, much better on grass court, hard court.   
So, yeah.   And also I was play her twice?   Twice?   I don't think I beat her.   I think I lose her in hard court.   Hard court score is another different story, so we'll see.
