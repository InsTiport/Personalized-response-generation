 Q.  I just wanted to ask about the level of Ljubicic's play today.  How do you feel he played? 
 AGUSTIN CALLERI:  (Through translation).  He's been playing well for a while.  He's a top 10 player and I've seen the last few tournaments that he's having very good results. 
 Q.  He's had good tournament results, Acapulco, tournaments on clay.  Was this a confidence-booster, to do well on the hard courts here? 
 AGUSTIN CALLERI:  (Through translation).  Even if I play mostly on clay, which is where I spend most of the season, I feel quite comfortable on surfaces such as this one or the US Open. 
 Q.  Ljubicic won every single point except for one on his first serve.  With him playing that well, how difficult was that for you?  Did you feel you might still have a chance, as well as he was serving? 
 AGUSTIN CALLERI:  (Through translation).  Well, if you serve at 130 miles per hour, it's going to be very difficult. 
 My return could be good, but never as fast or good as his first serve.
