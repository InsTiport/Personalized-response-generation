Q.  You're climbing the rankings.  The leap you've taken this year is still going?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  I started practicing a week before the US Open.  I've been working hard.  It's paying off.  We are working very well.  I'm working hard, sacrificing as well, but it's paying off. 

Q.  What is the difference between your new coach and your coach before?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Well, we work on different aspects of the game, different tactics.  We spend a lot of time working on that.  I think that was quite fundamental for me to get ready for the match. 

Q.  The fact that you beat Safin, was that important for your match today?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Well, I had already played Safin.  I had beaten him.  I was confident that I would beat him again.  In Vienna, when I lost against Moya in the third set, I was playing very well.  I trusted myself.

Q.  Were you upset when they called net?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  In today's match, they said net, but it hadn't sounded.  I didn't care because I made an ace afterwards. 

Q.  It seemed that motivated you more? 

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  No, I just talked to the referee a little. 

Q.  Are you happy with your game?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Yes.  My physical conditioning is good.  I'm moving well.

Q.  You are seeing the ball well. 

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Yes.  The two games I played in the quallies, they were useful for me.

Q.  You've had a great week.  Do you think it can be the best week in your life?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Well, I don't think beyond what I'm doing right now.  I go match by match.  I don't think so far into the future.  In the past, it wasn't useful for me.  I play in the present, I live in the present.  Now I'll talk to Mariano.  I don't know who my next opponent will be yet. 

Q.  How did you feel this week compared to other weeks?  Were you playing with more confidence?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Yeah, I'm playing with a lot of confidence.  I'm feeling pretty confident.  I've been training for two weeks quite hard.  Now my confidence is high. 

Q.  Your match against Massu in the quallies, was it revenge from the finals in Buenos Aires?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  No, I didn't take it as revenge.  Every match is different.  I took advantage of when he beat me in Buenos Aires, because I learned his game.  It was useful to play against him this time.  In tennis sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. At the Nasdaq I was losing 6 -1, 5-3 against Massu and I won.

Q.  Are you aware that in a week you've played two Grand Slam winners?

AGUSTIN CALLERI:  Yes, I'm aware of that.  I'm also aware of the sacrifice that I'm making, of my potential.
