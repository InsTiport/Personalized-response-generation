A. ZVEREV/P. Gojowczyk   
6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tell us about the match.  How do you think you played?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I think I played a pretty good match.  I think the first two sets were very, very good.  I think the third set I played maybe a little bit shorter, maybe a little bit more passive.  I don't think I played a very good set.  I just feel like Peter played an amazing 25 minutes of tennis, then the set was gone.   
I felt like if I continued playing the way I was playing in the fourth set, I had good chances to turn it around again.
