6-3, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You didn't physically look like yourself today.  Is everything okay?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Ah, no.  As I said, I have been sick for a week.  That hasn't changed, unfortunately.
Q. Playing a tight schedule with lots of tournaments, how do you decide to draw the line, you're sick, take some rest and heal?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I didn't play much this year.  This was only my third tournament.
Actually, yeah, I played I think the least amount of tournaments out of all players.  I don't think I overplayed or anything like that.  I think I just got unlucky, I got a virus somewhere, and that's how it is.
You know, now it's about getting healthy and about recovering and preparing myself for Miami, because Miami is the tournament I do well in, history-wise.  Here I have always struggled.
