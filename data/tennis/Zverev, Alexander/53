A. ZVEREV/A. Bedene   
6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  25 aces, long match. What did you think of that?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, good. I think very high-level match. He played very aggressive, very well, very fast as well. Sometimes I didn't really have chances on his serve.   
Playing three tiebreak sets, it could have gone both ways. I'm just happy to be through.   
 Q.  Being through, what do you think about going into next week?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, it's the first time in the second week. Obviously it's a fourth round. I don't really want to stop here. I want to keep going. I want to keep improving my game.   
It doesn't get easier, the opponents don't get easier, the matches don't get easier. We'll see how it goes.   
But I'm happy for now.   
 Q.  What is the biggest thing you need to work on in your game?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Generally, I mean, all the top guys are getting through the matches, but their aim is to play their best tennis in the second week.   
There's still a lot of things to improve. Obviously, I mean, if you go into details, we'll be here for a very long time. In general, the serving, the returning. Everything can still be better.
