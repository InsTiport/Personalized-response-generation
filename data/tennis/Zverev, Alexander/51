 Q.  Congratulations. Winning a point for Team Europe today. I think, Sascha, you saved something like 15 out of 16 breakpoints out there.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, I had two great coaches, one on the court and one on the sideline who were telling me what to do every single point.   
It was perfect. I could shut down my brain a little bit and just do whatever they told me. They are the two greatest of all time, and I'm going to listen to them.   
 Q.  I believe you have been undefeated in doubles all week, haven't you?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yes, I have not lost a doubles match this week. It's been a great doubles week for me (smiling).   
 Q.  Roger, Friday night playing at home and winning, it doesn't get much better than this, does it?  
ROGER FEDERER: It's great. Thank you all for coming out, making it a great, great atmosphere.   
Yeah, I mean, as you can imagine, all of us tennis players, we travel around the world for what, 10, 11 months of the year? Okay, sometimes we are home, but there is no place like playing at home. This is a very special night for me. Thank you for making it so nice.   
Thanks, Sascha, for a great match. You carried me that second set. It was great, great fun.   
 Q.  Everything looked pretty good for you physically, as well. Obviously after New York a few concerns about the back. Everything looked pretty good out there. Hopefully singles, doubles, more this weekend?  
ROGER FEDERER: Yeah, absolutely. I feel really good. I was able to recover. It was really good that I lost early at the US Open. Gave me more time for the Laver Cup. Great for Laver Cup. It's great. I was so happy after I lost (smiling).   
No. That's how it goes. You've got to make the most of it. I had great family time. My back recovered, and I'm fresh and I'm ready to go for more tomorrow.
