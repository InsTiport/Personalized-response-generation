6-3, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Must have been happy with that.  It was very quick with three sets.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, it's always nice to get a quick one in the beginning of the tournament.  I've had two three-set matches now, which is very, very nice.  I felt pretty good out there.  Serving well, playing well from the baseline, all the different kinds of things.
Yeah, I'm very happy to be through.
Q. Being here, seeing some of the older players here, that's very much the narrative of Wimbledon.  It seems like the 30-plus guys are doing well.  You must have been asked this a hundred times, but does that make you feel like you would like to be one from the next generation to be up there and do what they've done?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Sure.  I mean, I'm motivated a lot.  I don't need to see those guys for extra motivation.  I think I have a lot of motivation already.
Of course, what Rafa and Roger are doing right now is unbelievable this year, how they're playing, how they're winning big titles.  It's very impressive.
Hopefully they can play for a very, very long time, you know, stay in tennis.  But, of course, I want to get out there and, you know, be with them in the rankings.
Q. You mentioned Federer.  Your brother is playing him in the next round.  Have you watched Mischa play yet at all?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, I haven't.  We play the same day always.  I've always played after him.  I had to kind of prepare for my matches, warm up, do all different kinds of things.
I watched him on TV today a little bit.  I watched a little bit of the fifth set.  I'm happy for him to be through, that he's through, as well.  Hopefully he can continue playing like this, as well.
Q. Do you hope to get out on Centre and watch him?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: We'll be playing the same day as well, so that will be tough.
Q. To get through to a fourth round for the first time, I'm sure your ambitions are higher than that, but what sort of a step would that be to get to the second week for the first time at a slam?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It's going to be good.  But I don't think this way.
Q. Your next opponents look like they're about to go to five sets.  Do you see that as a big advantage for you?  Do you have a preference on who you'd play?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I have no clue what the score is actually.  He know that Ofner won the first two sets.  After that, I haven't seen much.
Look, I mean, it's always nice to have three-setters in the beginning of the tournament so you kind of save your energy a little bit.  Of course, it's nice for me that I'm through easily.
But, you know, in the other case, they are on court longer, so they got a little bit more match time.  But, yeah, of course for me it's better to be sitting here talking to you guys than still being out there to play.
Q. There's been quite a lot written about you this year, last year.  Do you get the feeling the public know more about you, people know who you are?  Do you like that?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, sure.  I mean, last year I've been barely top 30, now I'm top 10.  I think that helps a little bit.  The title in Rome helps a lot.
Sure, I mean, I've played a lot better this year than last year, so I think that helps.
