A. ZVEREV/M. Berrettini
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Next up you have Daniil Medvedev. You haven't played him this year, but you have a winning head-to-head record over him. What do you make of your next opponent?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He's different this year than he was the previous years.
Yeah, I've got what, 4? 4-0? Whatever. But it was quite a while ago. Last time we played was in Toronto last year. So still a while ago, and he's been playing some unbelievable tennis.
In the last few months, he's probably the best player in the world, you know, making it to six finals in a row, winning a Masters, making it to the US Open final. So he's definitely been playing the best tennis of his life.
Q. What were you pleased with most tonight? It seemed like your serve was really working well and stuff.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, my serve, obviously also the mental factor of coming back after you beat Roger and still being focused and playing still good tennis.
You know, it was a much different match than against Roger. I mean, he's obviously serving 230 sometimes and not a lot of rallies, but when we got into the rallies I felt okay. You know, I take a lot of positives from this into the final tomorrow.
