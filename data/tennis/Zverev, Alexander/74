K. KHACHANOV/A. Zverev
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Everything is okay with your shoulder?  And what did you say with Khachanov between first and second set?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I told him my shoulder is hurting and that his uncle, or something, that he's going a bit crazy.  And I told him to tell him to keep it down a little bit because he was going a little bit too much over the edge.
I mean, I was never going to win the match, so it was just I told him to calm down a little bit.
Q. When did you realize that you were not going to win the match?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: At today's warmup, because, I mean, I had pain the whole week.  And I did hours of treatment.  And after yesterday's match, you know, I had a lot of pain in the evening and during the night as well.  And then today during the warmup, you know, especially on my second serve where I was doing the kick motion, I mean, I had a lot of pain.  And just kind of stretching, and it was tough.
But, I mean, I don't want to take anything away from him.  He's playing great so credit to him as well.
Q. As a young player, do you foresee any major changes happening in the way that the tour is run throughout the year in terms of introducing more clay courts?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I hope the season gets shorter.
Q. Is that it?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah.
Q. What about the type of courts for a longer period of time?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: We have the four Grand Slams so we kind of got to adjust to them as well.  But I do hope at some point the ATP will realize that tennis players can't play for 11 months a year and that we actually need time to take for our bodies and actually rest.  Because, you know, this tournament has a history of having winners that won't usually win Masters here and that's because the top players have played so much that they're tired.  And that shows a little bit as well.
So, you know, I hope the ATP will realize that.  I have talked to a lot of people about it as well and all of the players agree with me.
Q. Being one of the leaders of the generation, do you foresee that the players will be happy with this trade-off of a shorter season, less opportunity to earn money in that way?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I think so.  The players I talked to yes, because, you know, you can have a longer career as well because you can take care of yourself.  You can prepare yourself.  And if you do it in a different way, you can actually make the same amount of money.  The tournaments can be bigger, tournaments can be different as well.  We can have bigger tournaments more often.
But as I said, us top players, if we play longer and play basically the 20th of November, which gives us not a lot of time to prepare.
