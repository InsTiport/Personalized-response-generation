ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It was a good match.  My serve wasn't there today.  That's why I had to play a lot of long rallies.  Yesterday obviously the match was very tough physically.  I was also very tired.  By the end of it I was very tired.
All in all, it was a good first week on clay.  A lot of positives here.  A few things I have to work on, especially my serve.
Just think positively and I think it's going to be a lot of other good weeks.
