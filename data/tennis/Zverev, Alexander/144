4-6, 6-2, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How did you find the turnaround between yesterday's match and this one?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: The difference?
Q. No, I mean the turnaround, the...
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, it was a completely different match, obviously, John being probably the biggest server on tour with not a lot of rallies, a lot of the short points.
And then Stan who really plays well from the baseline and you have to run a lot.  In the first set I felt like I played a little bit still like I should have played against John.  You know, trying to keep the rallies long, the points long.
But, yeah, I mean, I played well in the second and third.  I turned it around a little bit.  I had to be aggressive.  I felt like he was the one controlling all the points all the time, so I had to change that.
It worked out well for me.  Happy to be in the quarterfinals now.  Hopefully I can play as great as I did today after tomorrow as well.
Q. You won twice against Stan.  Do you think there is something special in your game or his game that make it good for you?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, both times I played him I played very high confidence and I played very well.  You know, I played him in St. Petersburg where I didn't drop a set until him in the final.
I played him here where I had a great match yesterday, and also in the first round I had a great match against Lu where I played an almost perfect match.  Both times I played very well against him.  I think we both have one of the best backhands on tour, both of us, so that maybe helps me a little bit.  He likes to use that corner a lot on the opponent, so maybe that's one thing.
As I said, the main thing is that both times I played him I played really well.  That's the only way to beat him.
Q. Yesterday you were really close to being defeated, and what a turnaround to beat Stan and reach quarterfinals here in Miami.  How is it like?  Seems crazy that all that's going on right now and how do you go for the next match?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, I was maybe quarter of an inch away to being out of the tournament, so maybe I was a bit lucky.  I had to use the opportunity.  I knew I got a second chance in this tournament, so I'm really happy that I used it.
Yeah, I mean, the draw, as I said, he was the No. 1 seed, but the matches will not get easier.  Goffin, Kyrgios are both playing very well right now, so next match is going to be tough as well.
Q. It's Stan's birthday today.  Are you okay with spoiling the party for him?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I'm not sure I've actually broke his party or anything like that.  I think he's actually going to party more now.
Yeah, I'm sorry.  I wanted to win as well.  It's my brother's girlfriend's birthday as well, so happy birthday to her.
Q. You are one of the stars, main stars of the young generation.  Some tournaments, like Rio Buenos Aires in South America are trying to change surface to get a stronger entry list.  As a younger guy who has a future on the circuit, how do you see about that, the clay tournaments in South America that has so many tradition changed to hard court?  How do you feel about that?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I've been to South America, Brazil.  I really love it there.  The only reason why maybe not a lot of top guys are going there is because schedule-wise, you know, it maybe doesn't make too much sense playing on clay for a lot of guys between Australian Open and Indian Wells and Miami, because those are the big tournaments.
So maybe some of them prefer to stay in Europe and play hard courts there.  I think that's the main reason why a lot of players decide not to go to South America.  I think the tournaments there, from what I heard, they're very nice, especially Rio is a very nice event.
Yeah, I don't know exactly the details, if they want to change it, keep it clay.  But from my perspective and my view, I think that's the main reason a lot of players don't go there, is because schedule-wise it doesn't really make sense to play on clay.
Doesn't have anything to do with South America.  Just doesn't make sense to play on clay between two very big tournaments.
