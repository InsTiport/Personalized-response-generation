A. ZVEREV/D. King   
7-6, 7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Given that you're the No. 4 seed, he was not seeded, was it a more difficult match than you anticipated going in?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He surprised me a lot with how well he handled my fast balls.  I thought, you know, I obviously didn't play my best, but I thought I was hitting the ball well.  He always had answers to my quick balls, to my pace.  He's a very, very quick player.   
So I'm happy to be through.  Obviously the ranking says he's whatever, 150 in the world.  He definitely didn't play like it today.   
 Q.  Did you know much about him before the match?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, I didn't.  I knew who he was, of course.  But not about his game.  So he surprised me a lot, how well he was defensively and how well he could handle the fast-paced balls.   
 Q.  Anything in particular you think you need to improve upon for round two?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, it comes naturally I think.  You have to improve everything a little bit.  Obviously you can't be satisfied after a first-round win.  I obviously want to go deeper.   
But I'm going to be on the practice courts tomorrow trying to improve.
