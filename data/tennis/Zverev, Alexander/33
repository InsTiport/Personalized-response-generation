THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did it feel out there tonight?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Good. Yeah, I mean, it felt good from start to finish. Obviously nice to get a win like that against a quality player. I mean, his first loss of the season. I think he's been playing unbelievable tennis.   
Yeah, I'm happy with how it went.   
 Q.  How do you go from playing like you did in the ATP Cup to now not dropping a set? Matter of just putting in the hours on the training court, getting that confidence back?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, it's a matter of doing the hours on the court, feeling comfortable on the court, then winning matches. As I said in the beginning of the tournament, it's going to be a process. I hope that every match will be better and better.   
The first match wasn't the best, but I won. The second match wasn't the best either, but I won. Then it went better and better.   
I hope it will continue being like that. The draw isn't getting easier. Stan is a Grand Slam champion, multiple Grand Slam champion. It's going to be very difficult playing against him.   
 Q.  How do you go playing against him?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He showed why he's a Grand Slam champion, beating Medvedev, coming back from two-sets-to-one down, playing great tennis.   
He's still one of the toughest players to play, especially here in Australia.   
 Q.  Getting to the quarters without dropping a set, do you feel physically fresher?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Of course. It's different if you play three sets or you play back-to-back-to-back five-set matches.   
Yeah, I feel fine. I've had great quality matches, but I never really think about the physical too much. Just try to stay healthy, try to stay fresh, just get my game right.   
 Q.  Almost two years ago Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros said if Zverev doesn't win a slam in two years, you can come to me and say I don't understand tennis.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, no, he did not say that. He said do well at a slam, he didn't say win a slam.   
 Q.  Are you ready to do well at the slams and to win a slam?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I hope so. We will see, no? Only a few days left at this Grand Slam. Only eight players left.   
 Q.  Are you confident?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I don't have a reason not to be right now. I've played against very good opponents so far this week. We'll see. But there's only the eight best players in the world left. I think everybody who's still here has a chance.
