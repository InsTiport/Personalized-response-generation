A. ZVEREV/P. Herbert   
5-7, 6-2, 7-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  This is a more specific question.  I would like to know if you remember Christian Garin.  You play against him in 2013.  What do you remember about his play?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Of course I remember.  I mean, he's coming up now as well.  Ranked about 200-something I think, 220 or something like that.  I think he'll get up there.   
Of course he was a very good clay court player back then.  He was the best by far in juniors on clay.   
Yeah, I lost to him here in the final, so that's what I remember.   
 Q.  (Question off microphone.)  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah.  I mean, three years is a long time, but for some it may take longer for others to come up there.   
Being much better or not is all relative.
