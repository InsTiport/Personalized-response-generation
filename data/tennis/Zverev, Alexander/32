THE MODERATOR: First question, please.
Q. Sascha, tough day, tough night. What are your thoughts overall on the match?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, my serving isn't back yet. Simple as that. I mean, I'm doing double faults. I'm serving 120 kilometers an hour, that's not really going to cut it.
Q. How do you get your serving back? Like, what, is it just more practice time, or what is it when you've gone through this before?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, look, I just, yeah, I just need to get it back somehow. It's just practicing and maybe going on the court and doing a little bit more of that. I have two weeks until the Australian Open and I hope I can get it back until then, but right now it's at a level where it's not going to do it for me. My first serve as well, to be honest.
Q. So to you is it just like a lack of reps then, or is it, I mean, it's still very early, obviously.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I don't know. It's just, sometimes it's lack of reps, sometimes it's just you go out and then something clicks and you have it.
Q. What did you think of Jan's performance to start off?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It was good. Very happy that he could have, that he could give us the first win and I hope that the boys in the doubles can get it through for us.
