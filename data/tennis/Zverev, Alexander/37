THE MODERATOR: First question.   
 Q.  Another mixed day with the serve. How do you feel your service game is going at the moment heading into the Australian Open?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, as I said, generally I'm not playing good, so there's a lot of things that I still need to improve, but it's the start of the season. Usually at the Hopman Cup when I play I always played bad as well. But this is unfortunate, this is a more competitive event, I think. So, yeah, I mean, I played, the first match I actually thought I played okay -- the serving was horrible -- but then I played two very bad matches, but what can I do. I hope our team can still win the doubles and then we still have a chance to go to Sydney.   
 Q.  Where is your confidence, just general confidence out there when you're playing?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, it's not really that high.   
 Q.  You had a busy off-season, obviously. What, how did that limit your training window that you normally would have compared to a regular year?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I had like five days less than I normally have. But, yeah, as I said, I didn't practice a lot of tennis. I think you can see that on the tennis court.   
 Q.  Is it tough at all -- obviously, you don't play a lot of round robin throughout the year -- having to come back from a loss pretty quickly a couple times this week and play again, or is that something --  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, but I mean, yeah, I played at ATP World Finals, I'm used to that, where I actually do well. So it's not about that. It doesn't really matter who I play right now, I need to find my rhythm myself, I think.   
 Q.  Where do you think that's, where are you going to go looking to find that?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: On the practice court.   
 Q.  If the team isn't able to get through to Sydney do you have any plans for any tournaments before the Australian Open?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, I hope we can get through.   
 Q.  You said you've been a Hopman Cup player for a few years now, how do you compare the experience with starting your year at this ATP Cup?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: ATP Cup is good. Obviously it hasn't been the best for me, but it's fun, it's a new event. I like team competitions, but, yeah, I think it's the first year I think it's still going to improve every year that we will have it.
