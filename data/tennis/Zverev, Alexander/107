A. ZVEREV/M. Berrettini   
7-5, 6-2   
 Q.  About your match and about Berrettini.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He's playing great.  I think, if he continues playing like this -- I hope his ankle's okay -- he'll get further in the rankings.  I think he'll be top 100 next week.   
So, you know, he has a great future.   
Me, it's not easy to come from Madrid, where there's a lot of altitude, it's very fast, to here.  So, I only had basically one day.  And for that, I thought I played well.   
Still, I had some adjustments to do in the first set.  But then, once I got going in the second set, I thought I played great.
