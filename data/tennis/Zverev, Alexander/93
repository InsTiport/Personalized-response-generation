S. TSITSIPAS/A. Zverev   
3-6, 7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  It was 6-2, 5-2.  What changed?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He started putting some balls into the court.  I think before he was playing really bad.  And I actually thought I was playing bad the whole match.   
So I lost a little bit of concentration.  I lost a little bit of rhythm, but it wasn't -- I mean, even if I would have won, it wasn't a good match.   
 Q.  Last year when you won the title it was in a totally different city.  Was it strange coming back trying to defend a title in a different city?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I've answered this question two times already during the last three days.  I'm sure the ATP can give you a copy of that.   
 Q.  How big of an advantage was it for him having played you last week and being able to see your game a little bit?  I know you said you played poorly but what advantage was that for him compared to if he hadn't maybe seen you?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I don't think it was that much of an advantage to be honest.   
I mean, I was up 6-3, 5-3, serving for the match.  So it should have been a three and three match, and then I would have been here about one-and-half hours ago.   
But now I'm going to go to Cincinnati.  I'll do everything I can to prepare myself there and play well there.   
 Q.  Was there any other point in the match when you felt you could have turned it back around?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: To be honest, we played three sets, and all three sets should have been three, three, and three.  If we would have played best of five, that's what the score should have been.   
But as I said, I didn't feel the ball at all.  I didn't play well.  So, you know, a lot of it didn't depend on me.   
 Q.  You said you felt like you lost your concentration.  When did you feel like that happened, and then when you're in a situation like that, you're not playing well or saying you don't feel like you're playing well and lose your concentration, what are you trying to do to get yourself back to a level you're happy with?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I should have broken him again at 4-2 in the second to be honest.  I had Love-30.  I had an easy shot on my backhand.  I missed it.  There it kind of a little bit flipped.   
But, you know, things happen during the match.  There's always opportunity like this.  There's always, you know, sometimes you make them and sometimes you don't.   
But, you know, it was -- look, at the end of the day, I played a lot of matches and physically I'm quite tired.  So I'm actually quite happy to have few days off before another Masters and then a Grand Slam.   
 Q.  He has been on quite a hot streak.  What do you think he does so well?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: As I said, I don't think today he played that well.  I think the match was absolutely pathetic on all levels.   
You know, returning, he started to return.  I mean, he was serving 125's to my backhand, and I was missing them.  That does not happen.   
I mean, I'm very honest with you guys.  I always say when the opponent play better.  I'm probably one of the most honest guys on tour.  Today was a pathetic match from -- I don't even think he played well.   
 Q.  You talked about not feeling the ball that well throughout the match.  Do you have an issue with the ball at this tournament?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It's the same ball.   
 Q.  Not issue, but I've heard Nadal talk about how he doesn't like the balls as much at this tournament as at the US Open and stuff.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, ball is the same as Washington and Montreal last year.  I mean, it doesn't change.   
But here definitely the conditions are different.  I feel like the ball flies more through the air and is tougher to control.  So I had to string my rackets way tighter, which gives you a different feel on the racket.   
But we're tennis players.  We have to adjust every single week.   
 Q.  What was the effect of the crowd support for your opponent?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It was great.  I was very happy for him.  Thanks.
