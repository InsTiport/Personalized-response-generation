R. NADAL/A. Zverev
6-7, 6-0, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Obviously a tough way to finish.  How happy were you with how you were able to regroup in the thirds after the quick second?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I had match point, so I think I did well there.  On match point I sucked, so that was it.
Q. What do you think happened on match point?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I missed probably the easiest shot I had the whole match.  That's what happened.
Q. Is that learning the hard way?  Does it feel like that's the usual painful process at some point with a top player you want to beat?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I don't know.  I don't understand the question, to be honest.  What is the question?
Q. Players coming to the top also have these tough losses.  Does it feel like maybe it's painful now but if you have the choice to go through this kind of process or...
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Look, in the last three weeks I lost 7-5 in the third to Berdych; 6-4 in the fifth to Berdych; and 7-5 in the third with match point to Nadal.  So I know how tough losses feel right now.
Q. What was the whole experience like playing Rafa on the big court?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Look, I mean, I think it was a great match.  I mean, Rafa did what he does best; he was fighting.  I mean, he's known for that.  So, you know, I still had chances to win.  I had an easy shot at match point and I missed it.
I'm out and he's in the quarterfinals.
Q. Did you think that time violation warning was fair?  The crowds were cheering.  I think you were just waiting for them to settle down.  Do you think you deserved that?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, and I said that to the umpire.  I was ready to serve.  I was standing at the line.  I was just waiting for the crowd to, you know, calm down a bit.
I don't know what I got the warning for because I was standing there ready to serve.
Q. Rafa has now twice said that you will probably become No. 1 in the world.  What do you feel?  What do you think you will accomplish in this game?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: You know, it's a big honor for me to hear something like that from Rafa, because he's been there.  He knows what it feels like.  He knows what it takes.
You know, we'll see.  We'll see what I can accomplish.  But obviously I'll continue working hard.
This is painful right now, but, you know, it doesn't change anything about the process.
Q. How hard was it to regroup after that match point for the rest of the match?  You were still at 5-3 in the third at that point.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I think he played a pretty decent point on deuce, and then I missed an easy forehand; break point.  I mean, it was tough, but I still had my chances.
You know, obviously Rafa played unbelievable after that.  He didn't really give me chances anymore.
Q. In that moment when you have a volley like that on match point, are you just thinking, I have done it and you take your eye off the ball?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No.  I mean, I mistimed it completely.  I mean, I was wrong-footed there.  I played it kind of too early.
Then the ball was too far in front of me.
You know, no, at that point you don't think anything, really.  You just try to make that shot and win the match.
But, you know, afterwards it kind of hit me.  I probably missed my biggest chance of the match.
Q. Do you take some gratification in that it didn't seem like he really figured you out?  You know, your unforced errors were your downfall.  But he didn't really take the match from you.  Do you feel some sort of gratification for that?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, look, I mean, I think he played not bad today.  I think we both played pretty well.
I don't think we made a lot of unforced errors, any of us.  Played pretty aggressive, both of us.  Obviously his forehand was really good today, especially his forehand down the line.
You know, I had to figure things out:  when do I have to play to his forehand?  When do I have to just kind of take the pace off and play to his backhand?  I think I did it quite well.
I think, you know, it's tough to -- I don't know.  He has to tell you guys that.  I think it's tough to figure each other out in that kind of match when both players are playing well and everything is kind of working.
Q. What happened with the second set?  Did you have a little bit of a letdown after that very tight first set?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, a little bit.  But obviously Rafa played the first game very well.  I think he didn't give me many chances.  I did a lot of unforced errors, I think.  I think I was kind of too happy that I won the first set that I just let the second set kind of slip away.
But then I had my chances in the third, and unfortunately I didn't take them.
