A. ZVEREV/M. Cilic
7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Just wanted to double check - lots of errors from both sides out there.  Is that because you are getting used to the conditions on the court?  And the second question is:  How big a deal would it be if you had a good run here in terms of taking it forward to the Grand Slams next year?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, the court is difficult.  The court is very fast.  And it's very high bouncing as well.  So, it's more difficult than in other tournaments, so everybody has to kind of find their rhythm in the first match.  But at the end of the day, it was a pretty good match in the end.
I'm happy to get the win.  That's the most important thing.  It's important - this tournament is big.  It is very important to all of us players.  Everybody wants to do well.  It has nothing to do with the Grand Slams here.
Q. When it wasn't going so well at the start, you seemed pretty irritated by the way you were playing and you were speaking a fair bit, I think in the direction of your coaching team.  What were you saying?  What were you frustrated with?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I don't remember to be honest.  I was just trying to get myself going, trying to get the energy up.  It worked out.  So, that's what I care about.  I don't remember what I was saying.
Q. You said the court's fast and high bouncing.  A lot of players are giving quite different accounts.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: What did they say?
Q. Federer felt it was slower.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: (Smiling).
Q. Can you explain the discrepancies between why people are saying different things?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: The court is very weird.  When you hit it flat and hard like Cilic does, the court is very fast.  When you hit it with more topspin, the court takes it away and it bounces up.  It's more different than other tournaments.  For me, it is pretty quick.  Also Roger wants to play on the fastest court possible, I guess (smiling).
Q. Your fascination with gold chains.  Is there anything behind it?  Secondly, would you like to come to the City of Gold, Dubai?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I'm going there after here.  I'm going to Dubai for five days and then the Maldives for vacation.
I mean, I've had those chains since I was a little kid and I'm never taking them off.  They have meaning for me.  That's why I wear them.
Yeah, I'm going to Dubai, I'm going to visit it, I'm going to see all the different places.  Hopefully, I will enjoy it.
Q. What do you expect between the Davis Cup, the ATP World Cup, what is your idea?  It is not very clear what will happen exactly, who is going there, who is going somewhere else.  Where is the money?  Where are the players?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Next year is no ATP World Cup yet, so it's the year after.  I've said it before, I'm not going to play Davis Cup in November.  I am going to play in February in Germany, in Frankfurt, I'm going to do that.
But the Davis Cup has some serious issues to think about, I think.  One of them is the dates.  I think the dates is very important and I think none of the top players will play, except Rafa because it's in Spain.  I'm very, very sure that a lot of top players will not play.  We'll see how it goes.
The World Cup, I don't know much about it yet.  It's still a long time to go for the event.  Hopefully, it's going to be a good event.  Obviously, it's in the first week of the year, so it makes sense to play, and it's in Australia as well.  So it's not bad schedule-wise.
