6-3, 6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You must be very happy with the way things are going so far.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I'm in the second week, so...  Why wouldn't I be happy?   
 Q.  Is your form exactly where you'd like it to be or are there still things to improve?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: There's always things to improve.  But I think I played a good match today.  I mean, obviously the match with Jeremy was very tough.  Generally speaking, heading into the second week, I feel pretty good.   
 Q.  You talked about Alex's potential.  Do you see him being a top 50 or 20 player in the future?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, top 50.  I think he has a good chance.  Obviously he has a lot of power.  That helps.  You got to build around that.  You got to build your game around power.  He has a decent serve, very good forehand I thought.  If he continues playing this way, he's hopefully going to be a very good player.   
 Q.  Milos, doesn't get any easier.  Do you think you match up well with him?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, we played twice, once on clay, once or grass, which were two very different matches obviously.  He's playing very well.  Only lost a set to Stan in the tournament so far.   
It's going to be a fun match.  Obviously not a lot of rallies, not a lot of long points.  We'll see how it goes.
