A. ZVEREV/D. Shapovalov
6-4, 6-1
(Mixed Zone.)
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It was pretty even until 4-All the first set.  What made the difference after that?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I played much more aggressive.  Started maybe reading his serve a little bit better.  Played a very good match.  If you let him play aggressive, he's going to punish you a lot.
That's what I did until 4-All.  After that, I stepped up.  I'm happy the way I played.
Q. You are close in age, but have much more experience on this stage.  Do you think it played a part?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: You have to ask him how he felt on court.  I think tennis played a part in it.  Sometimes one player plays better, the other one doesn't.  I think that was more of a role today.
Q. Dominic Thiem in the final.  How do you feel about that matchup?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, it's obviously a great final for kind of the future ahead.  We played five times against each other when he was already top 10 and I was more in the developing stage still.  Obviously he's leading the head-to-head.  But I'm playing quite well.  So is he.  Hopefully it will be another entertaining one.
