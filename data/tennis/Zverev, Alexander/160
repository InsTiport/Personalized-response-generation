A. ZVEREV/S. Robert   
6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  How do you feel?  It was a long day.  Double duty.  How do you feel about your matches today?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, doubles is always tired.  Me and Nick, we didn't play well.  Not much we could do.   
But singles, I mean, it was a difficult match.  I mean, he plays very flat, hits the ball quite hard, so he's a difficult player to play against, that was my first time against him.   
You know, I'm just happy to get the win.   
 Q.  You're playing Dominic next, like third time this spring.  What can you take from the previous matches that perhaps you can do differently in the next one?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, the match in Munich was very good between us.  The match in Nice not so much.  Match in Nice I was very, very tired.   
I mean, the first two sets were actually pretty good in Nice, but the third set I could not do anything anymore.  I was just completely done from the matches before.  So, you know, I mean, it's going to be a totally different match now.   
 Q.  Did you feel like an experienced player already in this tournament?  Playing Robert was a different game.  You showed a lot of maturity.  Do you feel even if you're that young, already mature enough and experience on the tour to go far here?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I mean, I don't think it has much to do with mature enough or something like that.  It has to do something with how good you are.   
I won my first rounds, which I'm happy about.  Next round is going to be difficult.  Dominic has been playing well on clay for a long time now, so we'll see.  It's a totally different matchup.   
 Q.  So many players deal differently with the pressure.  You seem to deal with it naturally.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I mean, I think all of us young players, we actually deal with it quite well, to be honest.  Nick deals with it quite well.  I can't really say he has problems dealing with it.  He's been to two quarterfinals in Grand Slams.  He's quite all right.  All the other ones, Borna is third round here for the second year in a row.  Obviously Thanasi is a bit injured now but he'll be back.   
I don't think we have problems dealing with pressure, to be honest, at the big tournaments right at the moment.   
 Q.  How comfortable you are generally on clay being a tall guy and spending lots of time on hard courts, as I understood?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I was born and raised in Germany, so that's the surface I grew up on, so I'm comfortable on it.   
 Q.  How much of a chance do you give yourself in this tournament, then?  You played on all four Grand Slams now in the main draw.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Of winning this year?   
 Q.  Do you have plans like that?  Share them.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: This year?  No.  I'll be honest.  No.   
 Q.  But, I mean, how far and how comfortable you are at this tournament?  Can you compare it with the other three Grand Slams?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, in Australia I feel quite well.  I mean, I won the juniors there.  I had a really rough draw this year.  I played Andy first round.  That was difficult, but to be honest.   
I feel well in all the Grand Slams.  I feel like I can play on all surfaces, to be honest.  So, you know, it's not about how well you feel in a Grand Slam.  It's also about how well you play at the moment.  I think I'm playing quite well right now.  We'll see how it goes after tomorrow.   
 Q.  Maybe not a tennis question, but ATP's new campaign.  You and Kyrgios and one more --  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: George.   
 Q.  Yes.  Is it something -- what is required of you?  Can you just share?  Is it some fun thing that you have to do?  What is required?  What do you do for ATP as new balls?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: We do a few activities here and there, but, I mean, the campaign is a really nice thing.  Obviously we have a very young group of guys coming up who are playing quite well.  So, you know, I think the new campaign is maybe to just show already what the young guys can bring and what the future might hold.
