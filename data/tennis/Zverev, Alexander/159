D. THIEM/A. Zverev   
6-7, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.   
 Q.  Can you just give us your thoughts on the match?  What do you think made the difference between you two in the end?  Because it was quite tight in the beginning.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I thought it was quite tight actually the whole match, to be honest.  He used his chances much better than me.   
I had a lot of break points, which I only used one of them, I think, one or two.  I can't remember.   
So, yeah, I mean, the match was quite tight, I think.  The score at the end was not as tight as I think the match was.   
But, you know, he just played better in the important moments.  That's what I think.   
 Q.  How far do you think Dominic can go in this tournament?  Do you think he has a chance to win it, even?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Who is he playing next round?   
 Q.  Granollers instead of Rafa.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Oh.  Granollers.  I think he will most likely beat Granollers, to be honest.  We'll see.  The top guys are still playing pretty good.  I mean, Novak is playing really well.   
We'll see how far he can go.   
 Q.  You just asked who he's playing.  Did you not know who your next opponent would be?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: To be honest, I didn't really look that far.  I only go match by match, to be honest, when I look at the draw.  Especially Grand Slam where I know every match is going to be tough.   
Yeah, I didn't really look far ahead.   
 Q.  It's tough to talk about this after a loss, but what kind of positives do you think you can take from this tournament?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Well, I think my first time at French Open, getting to the third round was not bad.  Even today against a top player like Dominic, who has been playing really well, really, really well on clay this year, I had my chances, as I said.  I just didn't use them well enough.  I think that's why I lost.   
 Q.  Where do you see most room for improvement in your game?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I get that question a lot.  I think physically, and then obviously, you know, playing more consistent, playing closer to the baseline I think a little bit, trying to be as aggressive as I am throughout the whole match, which sometimes I don't do.  But, you know, there's room for improvement in everything, I think.   
 Q.  Obviously you're used to playing Dominic, because you have played him twice already.  Was it even harder playing such a good friend in such an important match at a Grand Slam?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: There was not -- yeah, obviously it's a Grand Slam, it's best of five, but mentally there was no difference to the other matches.
