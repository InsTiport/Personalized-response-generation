7-5, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You had some chances but Dominic played great. What is your short analysis of what happened in the court?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, the match was, I thought, pretty even. Dominic obviously played very good from the baseline.
But today I was playing with no returns, actually. I was returning really bad and didn't put a lot of pressure on his serve. And when I did, he was coming out with good serves, good points.
Yeah, credits to him. I played a bad game in the second set, and, yeah, that match was over a few games later.
Q. The one player plays in a very tough way the breakpoint to save. He has good mental strength. But why did you play in so bad way that point after? Also most of all in the second set. I don't think you have low mental strength.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: You don't think what?
Q. I think you have a good mental strength. You played well at the breakpoint. But why...
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I didn't play the next point bad, either. I missed easy shots and easy overhead two times. Doesn't mean you played a bad point. Just didn't use my chances.
As I said, in the second set, the game that I -- I broke myself. I missed two overheads one meter away from the net. This was, I mean, I think -- honestly, I don't know how much you play tennis, but I think you would have made those shots (smiling).
It was just a bad game. Yeah, the match was over a few games later, so what can I do?
Q. You finished the year at No. 7, which is not so bad after what happened during the year, no? I think you're probably happy enough? I'd like to know, since we cannot afford to come to China or to South America, how do you rate this year? And what are your expectations for next, to end on a happy note, if possible?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, talking about happy, I wasn't happy at all the whole year. Outside the court, on the court. So to finish the year No. 7 in the world, for me, with all the things that happened to me and with all the things that were happening is actually quite incredible. I didn't think I would. In that point, you can see it in a very positive way.
And the other point, of course, I was very disappointing, because I wanted to win more tournaments. I wanted to play better at the big tournaments.
Actually, after the US Open I started playing much, much better. I hope I can take that into next season, and we will see.
I think next year will bring a new Grand Slam champion. We'll see who that will be, because I think the young guys are playing incredible tennis.
You know, it can be Daniil, it can be Stefanos, it can be Dominic. I'm in the mix, as well, I hope. We'll see what next year brings. But I think for the young guys, it's going to be an exciting year.
Q. At least you have one month to recover and some holidays. That can be with your family and so on? That's important, also.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I will actually have six days of holidays this year. This is all I'm getting, because I'm still going to South America, still playing with Roger for five matches.
Of course we will not practice every day for four hours, but this is still difficult. We will have to fly to a different country every day. So this will still be tough kind of few days but very exciting, very happy about that.
And then I'll only have a few days' holidays, and then I'm actually going to go to New York to maybe do a small procedure that I have to do on my eyes. Then I'll start training.
