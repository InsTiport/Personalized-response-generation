6-7, 6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. If you had to pinpoint anything regarding the result, would it be your forehand or what would you say?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, my baseline in general.  I think I missed more shots today than I did the whole tournament.
Yeah, I played bad from the baseline.  But, you know, it's not easy against John, because you always feel the pressure that if you get broken you're not going to win the set.
That's maybe a factor, but, yeah, I had a lot of mistakes today that I didn't do the whole week.
Q. Given your history with John, was it any more difficult playing him today, knowing what was on the line for him emotionally?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, no and yes.  I mean, it's obviously the final.  It's never easy to play in the final.
But he played great.  He played very well from the baseline and he returned very well.  Obviously his serve, but we don't need to talk about the serve.
But, yeah, as I said, I did too many unforced errors and I kind of lost the match myself.
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about what it was like at 14, what you remember when you were 14 of playing with him and hanging out with him?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, we were practicing a lot.  Actually, the first practice that we ever played I think I was 15, and it was the last day of the offseason and he went to Australia, and he lost to me.
He was quite disappointed, I remember.  But he's a great guy.  He was always kind of pushing the younger guys.  I'm happy that, you know -- I'm never happy to lose, but if I lose, I'm happy that he won the first Masters.
Q. I would like to ask you about the Davis Cup, how this defeat will affect your game?  You're going to be very tired, a very tough game?  You have to travel to Valencia now.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I have one day of practice.  I'm getting there Tuesday.  I'm going to practice Wednesday, and then Thursday I'm not going to practice a lot.  That gives me one-and-a-half days on clay to play a top-20 player.  I don't think I'll be favorite there.
Q. What would you have done differently today, do you think, to change the result of the match?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I had a pretty good tactic and a game plan, which, you know, if you just miss, it doesn't matter.  I mean, it was not about that.  It was more about me not finding a rhythm.  That was about it.
Yeah, I just missed too many balls.  That's it.
Q. Given your style of play and the fact that you have had so much luck on clay, as well, what are your feelings about the upcoming clay court season?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, hopefully it will be another fun season.  We don't play on the clay courts that much anymore, so I'm going to use that time, you know, to enjoy it, as well.
Obviously Valencia is going to be tough for me, Davis Cup there.  I know that I'm mentally ready for that, but, you know, just hopefully get ready for Monte-Carlo and play well and start off the season well.
Q. Do you have a preference surface-wise?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No.  Don't care.
Q. During your on-court talk you said that you were going to miss Key Biscayne.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  What's it mean to a young player like you leaving this park?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I'll never win here (smiling).  That's one.
But, no, I mean, it's a great site, it's a historic site.  It's one of the oldest ones that we still have.  But I think changing next year to the new one is going to be amazing.  I think the stadium will be amazing.  For the crowd it's going to be amazing.  For us players it's going to be much, much better.  It's a good move, but still we'll miss this site.
