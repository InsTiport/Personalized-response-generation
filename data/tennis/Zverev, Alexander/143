THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Seemed like a very interesting match to be a part of.  Just wanted to know your thoughts after such an entertaining game for everybody else.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, it was good.  It was entertaining.  I mean, what do you want me to tell you?
Yeah, he did some great shots again, but he's known for that.
Q. The second set you were fighting there, and in the third seemed like Nick had a best beginning of the set.  What can you say about the end of the match?  Did you feel that he sort of came out in the end on the edge?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I didn't understand a word you said, bro.  Sorry.
Q. Did you think Nick started better the third set?  What do you think that was the difference in the third set?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: He broke me once, and I didn't -- I had more chances than him, but he broke me, so that's it.
Q. You guys are very good friends.  Nick said at the end of the match that you two hang out in the locker room.  How do you divide the friendship and being on court and leaving everything out there?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I'm a competitor.  That's my job.  I mean, I will always leave everything out there, like I did today.
Sometimes you come up short.  I mean, it's not difficult.  I think any competitor in this world will find a way to separate friendship from competitive nature I think.
Q. Regarding that point when you got broken in the third set, the first point of the game, why do you think the challenge should have not been allowed?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Because he waited about ten seconds to play the ball, looked at it, saw it going into the net, and then challenged.  By the rules, you're not allowed to look at the result of your shot.  You have to challenge right away.  The chair umpire did a horrific job there.
