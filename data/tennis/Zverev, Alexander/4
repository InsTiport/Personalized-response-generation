A. ZVEREV/D. Shapovalov
6-7, 6-3, 7-6
Q. What did you make of the game?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV:   It was kind of a typical first match of the season where I had a lot of chances but let them go a little bit.  In the end I did a good job I think winning the tiebreak, played some good points and getting the win for Germany is the most important thing right now.
Q. How is it feeling to be out on Rod Laver Arena playing for your country?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV:   It's very special.  I think it's very special to be out on Rod Laver every single time you play because every time you play there you feel like you're playing a big match.  It definitely was one today and I'm looking forward to the Australian summer and we'll see what that brings to me.
Q. What would it mean to you if Germany won the ATP Cup?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV:   Everything.  Winning a team event, winning something for your country it's one of the biggest things in our sport.  I think the ATP Cup is just as big as the Davis Cup right now, with the new format that the Davis Cup is having, so it's -- we want to go match by match.  Tomorrow we got the defending champions, that's not going to be easy for us.
