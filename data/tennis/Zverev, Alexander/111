A. ZVEREV/R. Gasquet   
4-6, 6-2, 7-5   
(Transcribed from ATP recording.)   
 Q.  Can you talk about the match this evening.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I started off not too well.  Still a little bit of thought that my birthday, back of my mind, but still a different day.   
I'm just happy that I could turn around the second set.  I thought I played probably the best set of this tournament so far on all levels, from the baseline, returning-wise.  Obviously the third set was very intense, a lot of tight moments.  I feel like in the tightest moments we both played the best tennis.   
I'm just happy with my performance tennis-wise, also mentally-wise.  On all sorts of levels, it was a different match.   
 Q.  Did you enjoy the atmosphere out there?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, it was great.  I think always in south of France, or in France, when a French player is playing, it's always going to be a great atmosphere.   
Obviously a lot of spectators were for him, how they should be.  Yeah, I enjoyed it out there.   
 Q.  Tomorrow against Nishikori, another semifinal in a Masters 1000.  You have a pretty good record.  How much do you look forward to that match?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, he's playing great tennis this week so far.  Had a great match today against Cilic.  Obviously a very long one, as well.  It was similar days for both of us together.   
I played him one time in Washington on a hard court, which is a completely different surface, which is one of the faster courts on tour.  It's going to be a different match.  Hopefully I can be ready for it, and it will be another good one.
