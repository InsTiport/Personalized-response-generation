T. BERDYCH/A. Zverev
  6‑3, 6‑4, 4‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. It's not easy to come after a defeat, but what was your reaction? Did you expect to do much better or you thought he was today unstoppable?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I played a lot in the last two days. I was definitely a little bit tired. 
But, yeah, I mean, he played very well. I missed a lot, a lot, a lot. That's difficult if you miss that much. 
Yeah, he played a very good match. 

Q. Do you have a lot of pressure on your shoulders because of all these German journalists being here, everyone talking about your possible future as a future No.1 or not? Is it something heavy?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: For me, no. I mean, of course, it's nice to have attention and stuff like that. I'm far away from that. Second, there's been a million future No.1's that never got to No.1. There's other guys right now who want to become No.1 after Novak. 
I mean, there's always going to be a lot of talk. Yeah, there's not really pressure.
