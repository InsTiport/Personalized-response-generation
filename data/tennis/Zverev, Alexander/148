6-1, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Just wondering, in the hierarchy of surfaces that you play on, where would clay rank in terms of preference for you?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I get this question a lot because, you know, as a tall guy with a lot of power, you're not supposed to have clay be your best surface or play well on it.   
Actually, I don't mind it at all.  I like playing on it.  It's the surface I grew up on.  You know, in Europe, you play most of the season on clay.   
I actually don't know what my favorite surface is, and I don't actually have a least favorite surface.  It more depends on how I play during the certain time.  It more depends on which form I'm in more than the surface actually.   
 Q.  Does your game change a lot, according to the way you play on clay?  Seems to me most players nowadays don't necessarily change their game that much.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, not a lot of things change.  I think maybe your return position changes a little bit.  Your serve variation maybe changes a little bit.  But I think from the back, a lot of players play similar style, you know, play the same way.   
 Q.  Not regarding this tournament, but regarding Roland Garros.  I would like to know, before playing in Roland Garros, is there any match you watched on the TV, maybe in the stadium, that you keep in mind for one reason?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, the match that I probably will remember is Gaudio against Coria, that final.  I watched it inside of a Greek restaurant in Hamburg, which everybody was for Coria.  I'm guessing he's from Greece, or used to be from Greece or something, his parents.   
I have that in mind since I'm a little kid.
