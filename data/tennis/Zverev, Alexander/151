6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your performance today and the overall flavor of that match?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It was the worst match I played all year.  It's quite simple.   
My serving was absolute horrible, my returning was absolutely horrible.  From the baseline was horrible.  There is not one thing I did well.   
 Q.  Any reason why you think that was?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No.  Just -- it was just that kind of day.   
 Q.  Some people find the conditions difficult, even the World No. 1 finds the conditions difficult.  Do you here?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Today was maybe more difficult than the other day, because it was more windy, but last year I played well here.  You know, this year I didn't.   
But, you know, it's all right.  Gotta move on.   
 Q.  How did you feel in the first set, you had that point and he had an easy pass lined up and he hits one between his legs.  Does that...  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: It's great.  What do you want me to tell you about it?   
I mean, he does it every single time, so I don't know.  It's normal for him.
