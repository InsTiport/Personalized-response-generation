A. ZVEREV/F. Tiafoe
6-2, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you assess your performance today.  How do you think you played?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, it was difficult in beginning for me.  You know, it was different conditions than the first round.  First round on Hisense is kind of an indoor court, you know.  Court 2 is much faster.
But still, you know, I actually played well in the beginning.  But still I felt like from the baseline I was struggling a little bit.  But then it got better.  You know, I'm happy to get a straight-sets win, be better prepared for the next match.
Q. How difficult is it to play against someone that you know so well?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I've done it a few times now.  I mean, we played juniors together.  Actually, we didn't play that much juniors together because I only played juniors when I was 16, and he was still a little bit behind.
But, yeah, I mean, I know him from a very young age.  It's probably not the last time we'll play, as well.
Q. At the beginning of the tournament, Nadal said of the next generation, you are probably, from his point of view, the most complete and fast-developing player.  How does it feel to have this kind of comment from Nadal knowing you're going to face him in the next round?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I have that question been asked about 20 times already, so...
It's obviously great to hear from a legend like him that he thinks I can be very good and he thinks I can be good in the future.  As well, I know that I still have to work very hard.  I still have to, you know, improve a lot to be up there with them.
But yeah, I mean, I'll go match by match.  If Rafa wins today, it's going to be a spectacular night, I think, after tomorrow, or day.  We don't know yet.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that match.
Q. What do you think of Frances' level of game?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: First of all, he's very good.  There's no question about that.  But his game at the moment is a little bit young still, if you understand what I mean.
Sometimes he's very, very good.  Sometimes the level drops a little bit.  Not as consistent as he might be in a few years' time.
I think for the young age he has, he's playing very, very good.  I think he'll be a great player in the future.
Q. Will you watch the match tonight?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: On TV I will, yeah.
