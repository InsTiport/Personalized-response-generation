F. VERDASCO/A. Zverev
6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. Do you think that the interruption yesterday you should have pushed the play on, if possible, rather than stop, seeing that the momentum went the other way this morning?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I think we should have stopped earlier than we actually did because they kept telling us that we can play until 9:30, and we can play until 9:30 when it was a sunny day and yesterday was raining and cloudy and it was very, very dark.
So I mean, it was unfortunate that the matches before took so long and that we couldn't finish yesterday, but it was the right decision to stop.
Q. What do you think made the difference today?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I played absolute shit made the difference.  It's quite simple.
Q. Did he do anything to bother you as well as your playing like shit?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No, he played very well.  He played very smart as well.  Tried to push me back a lot, which he did.  And I didn't feel the ball on my racquet very well, so I played very short and very defensive all the time, which with my game and with my body, it's not easy to do.
Q. Do you think these are situations you still are having to get used to, obviously, a big win in Rome and then coming here and dealing with that at all?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I think it has nothing to do with that, to be honest.  It has more so to do with, you know, maybe first time on Chatrier, maybe those kind of things.  It's a very windy court as well, so the conditions maybe.  But no, it has nothing to do with Rome.
Q. Which is today your major regrets, sort of regret?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Regrets?
Q. Yeah.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: You sometimes play bad.  It's just this is our sport.  There is no regrets.  I mean, what can you do?  In Rome I played fantastic, I won the tournament.  Here I played bad, I lost first round.  That's the way it goes.
I'll prepare the best I can for grass.  We'll see what tournaments I play there.  I'm playing Halle for sure.  We'll see if I play something else maybe.
But the world doesn't stop now.  I mean, I'm still No. 4 in the race to London and I'm still doing okay this year.  I won three tournaments so far.  It's not the end of the world, okay?  I lost a match, but, I mean, pretty much everybody loses a match every single week they play.
So it's nothing, nothing that I should be -- of course I should be concerned the way I played and the way I performed, but it's nothing to be tragic about.
Q. You said you didn't play well.  It was depending a little bit on his way of playing and he's left-hander maybe or I don't know.  I'm just trying to find some reason that you give to yourself and to us.
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: No.  It was myself.  I mean, I have my brother, who is left-handed, who I practice most of my life with, so the left-hander shouldn't be the problem.  No.  It was all more me than anything and anyone.
Q. What will you do the next few days?  How much will it take for you to recover and go back to the court?
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I don't know.  I went straight to the locker room and put my bags down and came here.  I have to discuss that with my team and everyone that's involved.
I will definitely take a few days off.  It's been a rough few weeks for me, in a good way obviously, but physically very, very tiring.
But yeah, and then I'll prepare myself the best I can for grass.
