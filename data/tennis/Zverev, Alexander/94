THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Last week and this week have seen an unusual amount of rain and you went through a lot of delays last week.  And I was curious to know what the last two weeks have been like for you with the delays, whether it's an emotional challenge, a physical challenge, or how do you view what's happened to you the last two weeks with all the rain?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, for me it doesn't change.  I mean, I take a few more naps maybe during the day and that's it.  But, you know, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter when you play.  You still go out there and try to win.   
You know, I've been doing it pretty successfully the last few weeks, so hopefully it will continue.   
 Q.  You're on quite a streak now.  Do you feel at this point when you've had a lot of matches in a row that things start coming more easily?  Does it change as you build up victories?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I feel good.  I feel physically pretty well.  I feel like I'm playing well.   
So, you know, I get into a rhythm.  I get into a rhythm of playing matches one after another, and right now I'm in that rhythm.  So it helps.   
 Q.  I was wondering, the Next Generation, the younger ones that you mentioned, the 19-year-olds, now that you said that you're 21 and you've been on the tour for four years, you don't feel like you're one of those because you're experienced.  Do you recall at what point that changed?  That you came out and you were playing freely and didn't feel any pressure to now do you feel pressure to win?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, yes and no.  But, I mean, it's normal.  I think all the top guys feel more pressure because everybody is looking for them.  Everybody is more excited to play them.   
You saw the reaction that Stefanos had after he beat Novak.  He's not going to have that reaction beating any other player.   
So it's normal.  That comes with it.  And I think it's important to learn how to deal with it.  I think I'm doing quite okay with it.   
After I got to the top 5, I stayed there, and hopefully I will stay there for many more years to come.   
But, yeah, of course there's a period where you go through where it changes.  That will change for Denis who is playing right now.  It will change for Stefanos.  I think everybody will have to go through that.  Right now they're still playing freely.  Right now they're still the youngest guys on tour.  Right now they don't have any pressure.   
And, you know, it's going to be interesting to see when they start feeling that they're the hunted and they're the ones that everybody is looking out for, how it will affect them.   
 Q.  Just a follow-up on the rain question from last week.  So did you say that you find it easy, if a match is interrupted, you have to ability to just go into a sort of an hour nap?  So your nerves must be very settled to have that kind of composure.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah.  I literally want to fall asleep right now.  That's how it is.   
 Q.  You had mentioned sort of coming into these two weeks the 1,500 points to defend.  I was wondering if that's something that you think about quite a bit during the tournaments?  Is it something that maybe makes you more focused?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I had this question two days ago, and I've answered it.  I mean, we look at the rankings obviously, but we look at the race rankings just as much.  And there I have over 4,000 points and I'm No. 2 in the race.  So that I look more than the actual ranking right now.   
And I know I've been playing well throughout the year so, yeah, of course I got a few points to defend.  But at the end of the day, if you're playing well you're going to get them somewhere else even if you lose here or there.   
So it's not something that's on my mind anymore.
