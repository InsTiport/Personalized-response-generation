THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  This tournament has been hard to break through.  There has only been three winners in the last eight years.  Can you talk about some of the challenges unique to this tournament?  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: I mean, I don't know.  I have only made it to the third round a few times.   
It's obviously different.  I mean, Asia is always a little bit different for us.  We don't really play here that much, so we only come here for two, three weeks a year.  So it's always, you know, a little bit different with the time change and kind of going to this part of the world after a very long season already.   
So you've still got to be fresh.  You've got to be fresh mentally, got to be fresh physically, which a lot of players aren't.  And then also the conditions.  I mean, I think this is probably "the" fastest court that we have on tour.  It only suits a few type of players.   
I think that's why the ones that were winning really like this kind of court and these kind of balls and the conditions in general.   
 Q.  Obviously there is a few more weeks left to the year, but if you could just look at up to this point and what you're pleased with in particular, your progress this year.  Obviously a young career still.  
ALEXANDER ZVEREV: Yeah, I mean, obviously having a top 5 year last year was obviously unbelievable and was great, but to back it up is always tougher than doing it the first time.  And I think I did really well.   
I mean, I won another Masters, made two other finals, played well in a Grand Slam for the first time in my career in Paris.  All in all it was obviously a good season.  Then I got injured a little bit.  That took me out of basically the whole grass court season.  I didn't play well.  I didn't feel well.   
You know, and then after that, I won a tournament in Washington, played pretty well in the hard courts.  I mean, I lost to obviously my countryman, Kohlschreiber, in US Open, which I didn't play my best, but he played a really good match.   
So, you know, there is always obviously ups and downs.  I think how I played on the clay courts, as well, was the best tennis I've ever played in my life, especially in Madrid.   
So all in all I think my game has improved.  I have improved physically and have improved mentally.  It was another step forward this year.
