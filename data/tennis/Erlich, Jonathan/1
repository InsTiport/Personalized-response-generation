  BRYAN-BRYAN/Erlich-Ram
4-6, 7-6, 10-7

 Q. What are your feelings about the match? 
 JONATHAN ERLICH: Well, overall I think regardless of the disappointing of today, I think we had a great week. We didn't have I think for like two, three months a good week where we feel that we really play good. 
 I think we're back on track and we're back in business, and we're very happy about -- I'm very happy about it. We gain a lot confidence, especially here for the Olympics and then for the US Open, one thing that was very important for us. 
 Unfortunately today in the clutch time I think the Bryans were a little bit better than us and we couldn't close the deal in the second set. 
 But overall I'm very happy the way that we performed and get into good shape, and that's what matters.

 Q. I think going into the Olympics you're one of the favorites there. Do you have a specific goal there? A medal, or gold or... 
 JONATHAN ERLICH: Yeah, I mean, definitely we feel one of the favorite. Obviously it will be different teams that we play right now in the Olympics. Most of the teams will be singles guys, so it'll be a totally different story. 
 In one way tough and in one way might be maybe easier obviously. At the same time, I think we need to go out and perform good and be in good shape. 
 Obviously our goal is to be in the gold medal. I think we're good enough. Hopefully we can perform.
