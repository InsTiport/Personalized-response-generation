THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on that?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I'm happy, no?  I'm in the first final in a 500 event.  I think I did a great match.   
He had a very good support from the crowd.  It was a nice feeling on the court.  Well, I tried to play very aggressive.  I think I did it.   
 Q.  It was important to come back from 4-1 down in the second, wasn't it?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes.  He was playing unbelievable at the beginning of the second set.  He was playing very fast.  He was playing some good volleys.  Well, I knew that I would have a chance if I was still in the second set.  I did it.   
He had two easy mistakes, and I played very solid that game.  I came back in the second set.   
 Q.  Talk about the crowd.  What was the atmosphere like for you?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I played Davis Cup three weeks ago, so I was feeling almost the same, no?   
But, well, I was very focus.  I really enjoyed the win today because it was a very important match for me.   
 Q.  Coming here you had lost three matches in a row.  How did you change things around?  What does this week mean to end that streak?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I was struggling a little bit before coming here.  I had fever one week.  I couldn't come to Montpellier.  I had a wild card in Marseille.  I was starting to play better.  I lost in the first round.   
Well, was a tough moment for me because I was feeling good on the court.  I was working well.  I was doing everything right, and sometimes the results doesn't come.  You just have to stay there.   
Well, we see that.   
 Q.  Talk about Lucas Pouille.  How do you look ahead to that match?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: He's a good performance.  He's having a very good results this last month.  He had passed a very tough moment today in the semifinal.  I think he will be a tough opponent tomorrow.
