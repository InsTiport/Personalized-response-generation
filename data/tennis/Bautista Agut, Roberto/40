6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How would you assess your performance today?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I felt great on the court, no?  He was mixing up all his game, and he was playing very aggressive on the return.  We made a lot of good returns, both of us.  We did a lot of breaks on the match.   
Well, I think I did a great job.   
 Q.  In terms of not serving badly, but returning well, that's the kind of way the game went today?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yeah, we both returned very well.  We were making a lot of returns, very aggressive.  Here the ball flies after a deep return.  Wasn't easy to keep the serve.  Then I tried to play more aggressive in my second serve, tried to start the game with my serve a bit faster.   
I think I did well.   
 Q.  From playing indoors to outdoors?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: It's very tough, no?  That's why it's never good to lose in the first round.  But to play better here, it was better for me to have three days of practice before this match.   
 Q.  Were you happy to play in the afternoon or would you have preferred to play in the evening?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I don't mind.  I don't mind.  I just try to play whenever I play.  I don't care.
