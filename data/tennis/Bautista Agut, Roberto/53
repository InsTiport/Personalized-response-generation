R. BAUTISTA AGUT/L. Kubot
  6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please. 

Q.   First of all, congrats for your victory.   I wanted to ask you about your next opponent, Giraldo.   He just beat Murray, and he made it to the semifinal in Barcelona.   How do you see your opponent's weak and strong points?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   I think both of us are in a really good place and have a lot of confidence.   It's going to be a tough match for both of us.
Well, more or less I know how he plays.   The first day we trained together here, and it's going to be a tough match.   He strikes the ball very hard from behind the baseline.
I just tried to do my game. 

Q.   This year you're having great victories.   You've beaten players in the top 10.   This year you made the quarterfinals here in Madrid.   What do you think is different this season compared to others?   What have you changed?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   I think I played last year with a really good level during the whole year.   I didn't have the opportunity I had this year because of an injury in the abdominals that I had from Chennai to Roland Garros. 
I think the rest of the year I had a pretty good year last year.   I was very competitive.   We can see that.   Maybe all the confidence that I gained a the beginning of the year when I was winning good matches, well, we're seeing it right now.

Q.   You're not the typical Spanish player.   Does the altitude in Madrid help you in any way to make the ball fly a little bit better?   Do you like it?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Yeah, you know, I like to play on clay, but I like fast clay, the same like we have in Madrid.   I feel really comfortable here.   I think that tomorrow Giraldo is also used to playing in altitude.   It's going to be a tough match.
Hopefully I can play well.   For sure I have options to make it to the semifinals.
