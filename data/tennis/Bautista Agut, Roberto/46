N. DJOKOVIC/R. Bautista-Agut
3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Can you give us your thoughts on the match?  How difficult has it been with the rain and going on and off the court?  How did you stay focused?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA-AGUT: It was tough, no?  But I was feeling great because I was feeling great on court.  I was feeling great on the match.
These conditions were better to play against Novak today, and I just can say I played a great match.  I played great tennis.  In some moments I was close to him.  I was break up in the fourth.
I just played a great match.
Q. Some of the women's players yesterday were not happy to be on court when it was raining a little bit and the conditions of the court.  Since you played yesterday, just wondering what your thoughts were?  Was there a point you thought you shouldn't be on the court?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA-AGUT: The conditions were not good to play tennis, of course.  Today was much better than yesterday.  I can understand the view of the tournament, his position.  They push us to play two hours yesterday.
Of course the court at the end was not in the good shape to play.  Also was a bit difficult to play with these heavy balls.  Today I had a bit pain on the elbow because of the balls.
But you have to play everywhere, and today was better than yesterday.
