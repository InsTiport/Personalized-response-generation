5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What did you think about today's weather?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I didn't remember playing a match with this bad conditions. It was really, really windy. I don't remember the last match I played with that wind.
Obviously it was great to come back to play back on Melbourne Arena. It was actually different match. I finished the match playing really good tennis.
