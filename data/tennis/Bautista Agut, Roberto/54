R. BAUTISTA AGUT/F. Verdasco
  2‑6, 7‑6, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in Spanish, please. 

Q.   You're tired.   I think that emotionally it's been a very tough match because you came from playing Robredo, Verdasco in his house.   It's a great victory for you, right? 
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Yeah, I think it has a lot of merit, the match I won today.   Verdasco was playing superior to be for a great part of it, especially in the first set and part of the second set.
After trying and putting all of it into the game, I managed to win the second set.   The third set I think I played really good tennis. 

Q.   Normally between Spanish people when you play it's more complicated because you know each other better.   In your case, you have defeated two.   It's been easy for you or most difficult? 
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, I don't think it's easier or not more difficult.   I just went into the court to play my tennis as normal.   I just was focused.   I tried not to think a lot about my opponent.   Just focus to do my game.
It's just a coincidence that I played against two Spanish players.   In the match yesterday was a little bit more emotional than today.   I think today was just an ordinary game.   Nothing to do with yesterday's. 

Q.   After Roger Federer leaving the tournament, with him on the same side of the draw, do you think that opens up the draw?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, you know that over here we have some very tough and good players.   No matter the round you're playing, you know you're playing against a really good player.
I think that Simon and Paire, I'm going to play either of them, and it's going to be a tough match.   I will have to play as good as I can if I want to make it to the next round. 

Q.   This year you beat Berdych, Del Potro, Robredo here.   What has been the change to your game in your head?   Mentally talking you changed?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   I think I'm a different player to two years ago.   I have been doing things properly for three years and I'm better in many aspects.   Tennistically, mentally, and emotionally I'm a complete different player.
I managed to have good victories with the work I have done in these years. 

Q.   Do you play in yellow because you're superstitious or the brand gives you?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   No, the brand gives you two clothes, and, well, it's been good for me with the yellow and I'm not going to change it.   I'm going to play in yellow.
