Q. (Question in Spanish.)
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, it was a good match. I think it's never easy to play against a player you never saw him play. And, well, it was a good win again and it's good to start the season playing some matches. And, well, just get in rhythm and happy because I won the first point.
Q. (Question in Spanish.)
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, it's going to be much tougher. They are very good players, they have shown some good tennis on the court in the first two ties, and it's going to be a tough tie because we need to win if we want to be the first in the group.
