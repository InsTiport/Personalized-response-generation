THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Well done on the win. How pleased have you been with the three matches that you've played, particularly today?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, today was I think more difficult, the match. I think it was also the first match with the sun, with the heat. The ball feels much different. The ball is flying more. The court is faster.   
Well, I had more difficulties today, and I think I handle it well.   
 Q.  Have you enjoyed the ATP Cup experience, the fact of being together with teammates, visiting attractions in Perth?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: We spend good days here practicing and also the competition. We had also some time off to go to visit Rottnest Island.   
And, well, it was a good ten days with the team on the court and off the court.   
 Q.  Do you feel as if you're going to now take your game to the next level when you enter the Final 8 stage in Sydney?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I think we're going to play in the afternoon. I'm not sure. And we now expect Rafa wins his match now against Yoshihito.   
Yoshihito is in great form, but Rafa is Rafa. Well, hopefully we win the tie today and we can go as early as possible to Sydney to get used to the conditions tomorrow for practice and also the time difference.
