A. MURRAY/R. Bautista Agut
7-6, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It was a close first set.  How do you think you played?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I think it was a close first set.  Was not easy for me to handle all the emotions I had this week.  For me was not easy to feel perfect on the court and in the first final appearance on Masters 1000.
But I think I gave everything on the court today, as every week, another week, but I think I could play better tennis today.
Q. You have played the world No. 1 and the world No. 2 in successive days.  What are your impressions of their form and their style?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Both are great players.  They are both one of the best players in the history.  It was great for me to learn a lot about them, to experience to play good level match yesterday, yesterday and today.
I'm going to learn from all the success I had this week and everything.  It's going well.
Q. Andy is now closing in on Novak in the race for the year-end No. 1.  You have played them both.  Do you think he could become the year-end No. 1?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I think Andy's in a great performance.  Andy is doing everything to get Novak.  If he continues playing like this and working like that, I think I can see it in his eyes, no?  He's really focused on getting No. 1.
