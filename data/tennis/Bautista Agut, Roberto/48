R. BAUTISTA AGUT/H. Chung
6-0, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That must have felt good?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes.
Q. And quick?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: It's good to win like this, playing well and doing everything you practice for and you get the result.  It's nice, no?
But I have to be humble and know that to win like this, it's impossible, no?  Every win you have to work a lot.  Every win you have to play two hours, and for sure, I'm happy because I won fast today but I know it's gonna be tougher and tougher.
Q. You're playing Marcos Baghdatis or Vasek Pospisil.  Thoughts on your opponent, either one?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: No.  They both play good on this surface.  Both have a great serve.
I will have to play good tennis and return well to beat any of them.
Q. How often do you get to play the same player twice in the same day in singles and doubles?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Not often because I never play doubles (smiling).  Normally I stay focused on singles.  I'm not used to the playing singles and doubles.  I decided to play this week both things, and I will see Chung again now.
Q. Why did you decide to play doubles?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Because last week I didn't play nothing.  Next week I'm not gonna play nothing.  So it's gonna be a busy week.
