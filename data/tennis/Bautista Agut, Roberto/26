S. TSITSIPAS/R. Bautista Agut
7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Technically, statistically you were very close with Tsitsipas in this match.  In your opinion, what elements leads to the result of the game?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I think it was a close match.  Tsitsipas was playing very good.  I had my chances in the first set and in the third set.  I lost both sets.  Maybe was the key or the moment of the match to turn it around.  After the break back, he got confidence, he played really good end on the both sets.
I'm a little bit disappointed because I couldn't confirm both sets, first and third.
Q. Is there any special moment you remember in your mind during the match that you feel was the moment you lost the match?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, at the third set, no?  When I lost the third set, I knew I had to do really good effort to try to win the match, when I lost the third set, two sets to one down.
Well, I continue fighting till the end, but it was not enough.
Q. Now that you've seen Stefanos up close, seen that he's beaten Roger, do you think he has the game now to win a tournament like this?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, he's playing very good tennis.  Of course, he has a lot of time to improve, a lot of time to get enough experience to be in the finals of these tournaments.
But here I think Rafa and Novak are my favorites.
Q. What do you think it is about his game that's made him do so well at this tournament?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, he's a good player, no?  He's very complete.  He has a good forehand and backhand.  He's serving well.  I think he knows the game.  He knows how to play.
Q. You played a lot of five-set matches here.  Did it take a toll?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I played a lot of five sets, yes.  Today I was a little bit tired or feeling the last matches I played here.
But, well, I think it's my best result in a slam.  I have to be happy about how I played during all the tournament.
Q. There was a lot of emotion surrounding the matches, like when you played Andy Murray, an Australian.  Now you're playing a Greek guy in Melbourne, which has the biggest concentration of Greeks outside of Greece.  Did that give you a good vibe or did you feel like you were battling the crowd?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I passed through a lot of difficult moments in the first two matches.  Today I didn't feel the crowd was the same, no?  I had to be very concentrate.  At the beginning of the tournament I had two really tough matches with really good opponents with the crowd against.
Well, it was not easy to beat them.
