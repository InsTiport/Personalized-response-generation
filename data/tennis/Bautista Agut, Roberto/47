R. BAUTISTA AGUT/F. Lopez
6-3, 5-7, 7-5
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Tough match.  Very tight.  Always very tight with Feliciano.  Where do you think the match fell to your side?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: The match was very tough, as you said.  I think the third set was very even.  He had his opportunities.  I don't know if he had one or two break points when we were 4-2; then I had two break points when we were 4-All.
He played really well and then we went to 5-All; in the first break point I tried to go for it.  I was lucky.  I just put it on the line.  I'm happy about that.
I think that beating Feliciano in those conditions is a good victory.  Very happy to make it to the third round another year.
Q. Probably you will be facing Djokovic.  I want to know if you think in this kind of tournament it's possible to beat the top players, Djokovic, Nadal, Ferrer, Murray, whatever?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I think they're top players; they play very well.  They have very few bad days, and that's why they normally make it to the final rounds every week.
Tomorrow it's going to be a difficult match.  Well, Djokovic still has to play his first match and he has to win it.  We'll see how the match goes, but the normal thing is I will play Djokovic.
The circumstances suit me, so I feel comfortable.  Let's see if I can face him and play a good match, and if it's possible, to make it hard for him.
Q. Last match against in Djokovic in the US Open it was quite tough for him.  What do you remember about that match?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I have some pretty good feelings.  I had some good feelings on the court.  I felt very comfortable.  I think I played a good level of tennis.  I had fun playing in the fourth round in a Grand Slam on the center court with Djokovic.
Well, if tomorrow I have the opportunity, I would like to feel those sensations once again.  I want to feel free and try to play my tennis and enjoy the next round.  That's all.
Q. Rafa said yesterday that if he could avoid Djokovic on the way, that would be better?  Do you think people fear Djokovic, or does it motivate you?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: If you face someone else, that's better.  That's clear.  That's the way it is.  In the third round I have to play Djokovic or Coric, whoever wins.
They still have to play.  I don't want to go further because you know that here every match is difficult.  They are very tough.  Djokovic, today he has to beat Coric.
If I face Djokovic it's going to be a tough match.  I'll try to control the game, play freely.  You know, I'm going to play Djokovic in the third round.  I have to face that.  It's better than if you have to play against the first seeded player, but that's the way it is.
Q. I wanted to ask you about Spanish tennis.  Do you think that there is a difference between the older generations and the new generations?  Do you think they're playing hard?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I'm quite tired of this question.  I think we have to live in the present and we have to enjoy it.  Spain has 14 players I believe in the top 100.  I think that's the country that has the most players up there in the top 100.  They're doing things well; one of the biggest nations in the world.
It means that in perhaps five or six years we will see what happens.  I'm sure there are people coming that are doing very well.  We've always had good players here in Spain.
