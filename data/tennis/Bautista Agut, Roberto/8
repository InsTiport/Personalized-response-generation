  R. BAUTISTA AGUT/R. Gasquet
 7-6, 6-2, 6-1
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Well done.  Is never easy to beat a French guy at Roland Garros.  I want to know what do you think about your draw?  I have seen that is not too bad.  What do you think?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   I didn't see the draw (smiling).
 Q. Do you know who you are playing next or not?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   I know I play Balazs because I just ask to my coach.  And I have all my respect for Attila Balazs.  I know he's going to be a tough match.
 With the conditions and everything here it's closer, it's tougher.  I will have to be very concentrated and very focused on the next round.
 Q. So you never look at the draw?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Sometimes I look; sometimes I don't.  This time I had a very difficult first round, and I didn't want to see the next rounds.
