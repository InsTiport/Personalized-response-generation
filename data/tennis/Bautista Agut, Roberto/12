6-7, 6-4, 6-0, 5-7, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough match, obviously. What are your thoughts on his level today?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I think he played really good. He was a tough opponent today.   
I think when the sun came down, the court became a little bit slower and the ball was a little bit heavier. He really felt the ball really good.   
He was playing very fast, very aggressive without mistakes.   
Well, I have to congratulate him, because he did a great job.   
 Q.  You played him a number of times. Is that some of the best tennis you have seen from him?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I think so, no? I think it's maybe the best match he played against me. I'm gonna say that.   
I fought really hard, and I brought him to the fifth set. Today was not enough. His level was really good today.   
 Q.  When you did have success, what do you think was really working for you? When you had success against him, what do you think...  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, the match was really tight. I had two times 15-40, with 3-All in the second set, and I had 4-All, 15-40 again in the second set. I think that was my time to break him and to win the second set, no?   
After, he increased the level and he played really good from at the end of the second set until the third set. He was great at the end of the match, also.   
 Q.  This is your first loss obviously of the year, so you must be pleased obviously about the start of your season.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, it was a great start of the season. I never like to lose, no? But when you give everything on the court and when you try your best, you have to go home, stay calm, and keep working. There is much more tournaments coming.
