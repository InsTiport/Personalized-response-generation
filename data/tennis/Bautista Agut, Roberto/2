 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. What do you feel like you did well tonight?  What were you able to capitalize on to get the win versus Daniil?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, I think I did a lot of things well, no?  To beat Daniil in two sets it's because I played great tennis.  I was very solid and I could play with a lot of rhythm, make him work a lot.
 Well, physically I felt well on the court.  It was a very tight first set.  Well, it was a great match from my side.
 Q. You have great records versus Djokovic and now Medvedev on hard courts.  They are typically players who like to stay in the rallies long and make the other players miss.  How do you find weaknesses in those guys' game and are able to beat them at the baseline game kind of?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, my game is like this, no?  That's how I like to play, no?   I like and I enjoy a lot these matches.
 Well, it's never easy to beat these guys.  Today especially it was a very tough first set, very good rallies, very good points.
 Well, I felt, as I said, physically well.  I could start the second set very focused and it was good for me to make a break and be up on the score on the second set from the beginning.
 Q. He loses his temper there after losing serve toward the end of the first set.  What is your reaction at that point?  You must feel good about the way things are going for you at that point.
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, on that moment I was very focused on me, on the things I had to do on the next game.  Of course if he broke the racquet, it's because he lost his patience.  I think I did some great things to put him under pressure and to feel like this.
