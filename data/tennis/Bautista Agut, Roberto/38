THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on that match?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I am happy, no?  I think I played a very good tennis.  Was not easy to beat Borna.  He's very solid.  He was playing very good serves.  He was playing very aggressive.   
Well, I'm happy because it's my best match on the tournament.   
 Q.  You said what he did well.  What was the best part of your game today?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: I was very solid, no?  I think I didn't rest in all the match.  I played all the points, every point.  I was very focused during all the match, trying to hit, to manage the match a little bit more than him, to make him pressure, to make him feel a little bit exhausted, trying to playing with a lot of rhythm.   
 Q.  You don't know who you're playing tomorrow, but can you talk about each potential opponent.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, both are playing very well, no, if they are in quarterfinal.  Of course, they had a really good wins before playing this match.  Well, now I have time to watch the match, to rest, to enjoy the win.  I will have time to prepare the next match.
