 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Close match today.  Can you take us through the match and how you think you played?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, it was a very tough match.  I never beat Alex before today, and I knew it was going to be a difficult match.  He's a great player.  He's very solid.  He runs well.  He's a great competitor, and well, it took me a while to get the rhythm of the match at the beginning of the first set, but I was turning around the rhythm, playing more aggressive, playing harder, and well, I think the match changed, and finally I could close the match playing very good tennis.
