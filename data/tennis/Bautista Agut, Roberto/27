THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. In terms of the wins you've had since the start of the year, is it the best season of your career?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes, it was a great tournament, no?  I've been playing very good tennis.  I won a really good matches.  I had to fight so hard to stay very focus.  It's been a great month for me and for my tennis.
Q. How do you see a quarterfinal with Federer?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, first he has to beat a great opponent.  Tsitsipas is a great player.  He's playing a top level.  We will see who is going to win, no?
In case I plays Federer, it's going to be a nice match.  I played a great match against him in Shanghai last year.  Now I want to recover well, to enjoy the win I had today.  We will see on Tuesday.
Q. How much do you know of Tsitsipas?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Tsitsipas is doing very well.  As I said, he's one of the top players in the world.  He will be one of the best, for sure.  He's playing at a very high level.
