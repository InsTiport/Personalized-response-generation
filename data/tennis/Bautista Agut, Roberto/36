R. BAUTISTA AGUT/P. Herbert
6-4, 6-7, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Really had fight for that, didn't you?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes, I had to fight so hard.  Was tough to feel good on the court today.  We had a lot of wind.  Was not easy to play, no?
I try to play every point, but the feelings were tough.
Q. It was a question of breaking and grinding the match out, wasn't it?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes, had a lot of chances to break him in the second set.  But he started to play very aggressive with the second serve.  He was playing serve and volley with the second.  I was very close to break him in the second, but finally I had to play a third set.
Q. In conditions like this, it seemed a little cooler today, also there seemed to be some moisture in the air, do the conditions become slower or just the same?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yeah, I think at 2:00 the conditions are very fast, no?  With the wind today, it make it tougher, make it more difficult.
Today was not easy to play brilliant, but I tried to play solid, tried to play long points against him.  Well, I try my best.
Q. You must be relieved the third set didn't go as long as the first two.
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Of course.  I knew beginning of the first set was very important.  I tried to stay there, to play very focused, to play all the points, to make him work on the beginning of the third set.  I could break him very soon.
Q. You must have read about the Davis Cup proposal for changes.  Have you had a look at it?  Do you like for it to change or...
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I think every new invest in tennis is welcome for us, no?  Every improve in the circuit or during the year is going to be better for the players.  We will see how it is at the end.
Q. Your next round, the quarterfinal against Coric.  Your thoughts?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: He's playing well.  He's a very good player.  I will have to play my best tennis to beat him.  I know we played many times, I think three or four times against each other.
Well, it's going to be the first one this year.
