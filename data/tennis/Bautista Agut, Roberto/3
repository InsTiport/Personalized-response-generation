 6-3, 4-6, 7-6
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. A tough three-set win.  Do you want to give your thoughts on the match, on the win, playing your good friend John Isner?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Well, John is a good friend in the tour, no?  He makes always difficult matches playing against him.  He has a very big serve and a lot of power from baseline with the forehand.  It makes it always difficult, no?
 I think I played a brilliant set the first set, and then with John you feel always under pressure.  With two good shots he make me the break with backhand down the line, I remember.  Well, and then the match changed, no?  It was a really tough fight until the last point.
 Q. Your thoughts on you get another chance to play against either Daniil Medvedev or Frances Tiafoe in the next round?
 ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT:   Both players, everyone is good here, no?  The level in the circuit is very high.  Everyone is playing good.
 Well, both players are doing well.  They are playing very good this year.  Well, now I'm very happy.  I want to recover well and get ready for tomorrow.
