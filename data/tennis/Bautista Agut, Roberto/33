R. BAUTISTA AGUT/L. Pouille
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What are your thoughts on winning tonight?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I played very good, very aggressive.  I didn't give him all the court, all the control of the game.  I played very good tennis tonight.
Q. He tried to come back at you in the second set, but you held him off pretty well.
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yeah, I think was tough to get the break in the second because I had breakpoints in the first game, breakpoints in the second game on his serve.  I couldn't make them.  Then he took the break, no?
But I was mentally strong.  I could come back playing very good tennis.
Q. Do you think that was almost the key, that you could break him back immediately?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes, was the key.  When he has advantage, he plays more relaxed, he goes more for the shots.  I tried to make the score closer during all the match.  That was better for me.
Q. What does it mean to you to win the trophy?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, it's very special, no?  I was following a 500 event during all my career.  Well, of course is my best win.
Q. What is next?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: We will see, no (smiling)?  I'm working a lot.  I'm doing the right things, trying to be better player every day.
Well, I hope something better is coming up.
Q. You struggled since Auckland, so this must be a big confidence booster for you.
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yes, there is no better way to get a good preparation for Indian Wells and Miami than playing matches, playing tough matches with a lot of difficulties, like here in Dubai.
Well, I have time to get fit to play a good tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami.
Q. You're the first Spaniard to win since Rafa.  How does that make you feel?  Does that add anything?
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, that means a lot, to win this trophy, no?  I think the last winners are the best tennis players in the era.  That makes me so happy.
