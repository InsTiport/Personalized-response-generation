ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Commiserations on your defeat.  Can you just explain your emotions after a match and a difficult time for you recently.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I was very focused on the match, and I think I played great and I was at the same level as Novak.   
And I had my chance in the third set, and, well, I couldn't make it.  And when you play against a great champion, you don't have many opportunities.   
 Q.  Our condolences.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Thank you.   
 Q.  How did you really summon the strength to be that mentally focused?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, I'm used to do it every day, no?  My life is tennis, no?  I'm used to going inside the court and forget about my real life and try to do my work, no?  That's the thing I've been doing since a lot of years.   
And, well, I have to tell you that was not easy to go on court these days, but I don't know why I could manage it.   
 Q.  Very sorry to hear.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Thank you.   
 Q.  And I'm was going to ask you something completely different if that's okay.  Just if you could tell me how Novak looked to you.  He's been having a lot of trouble, but he seems to be coming back to himself.  What are your thoughts on him?  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Well, he is a great champion.  He is one of the best tennis players in the history.  And, of course, if he keeps pushing like this and fighting, as always he did, he will be on the top again.   
 Q.  What did Novak say to you when you embraced at the net at end of the match?  It looked like he said something.  
ROBERTO BAUTISTA AGUT: Yeah, kind words we have at the end of the match.   
It's a pleasure for me to play against Novak always.  And we played some really nice matches and, unlucky for me, I lost more than I won.  But it's nice to play against him.
