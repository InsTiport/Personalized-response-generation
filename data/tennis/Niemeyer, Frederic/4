   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Your thoughts on the match? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Well, the execution wasn't there, but I thought I had good intention.  You know, he played a very solid match, but I didn't think I executed my shots and didn't serve well.  I think my game was off today. 

 Q.  You mentioned you had problem with vision, the lights. 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Yeah, I did have some problems seeing the ball.  That's why I think I framed a lot of balls.  I don't usually frame that many balls.  I usually hit more the strings. 

 Q.  Did that affect depth?  What was the main issue? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Well, the main issue was like sometimes I had an intention to attack and then the ball like didn't come to the strike zone I expected, so I had to kind of pull off, sometimes just put the ball in instead of being aggressive. 
 When you're not feeling it on the strike zone, it's hard.  You kind of are hesitant a little bit. 

 Q.  You feel that took away from being aggressive? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Yeah.  I still tried but there were a lot of points where I kind of backed off because of it. 

 Q.  There were a couple points where you came in instead of hitting a ball and pretty well gave him sitters. 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Exactly. 

 Q.  Was fatigue a factor? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  No, I actually felt good.  I had good trainers to help me out.  Physically it wasn't a factor.  I felt good out there. 

 Q.  At time your serves looked really good, and other times...  Was it vision as well? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  I struggled with my rhythm on the serve the whole match.  That's why I was trying to get in.  Like the second set, I tried to serve and volley a little bit more.  I tried different things to hopefully get into a rhythm. 
 You know, when I get into a rhythm...  You'll know when I get into the rhythm next time (smiling). 

 Q.  Will we see you next time in Montr√©al? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  It's two years.  It's a long way.  I'm 31.  Right now in my career I'm just going year by year.  I evaluate at the end of the year and see if I have the heart to continue and also the health. 

 Q.  Where do you go from here? 
 FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  My next big tournament is US Open quallies.  It's in two weeks.
