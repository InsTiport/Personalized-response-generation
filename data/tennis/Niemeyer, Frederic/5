THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  In your preparation you had practiced against players who you said were similar types of players that would be in the essence of Davydenko style of play.  Did that help you in your preparation?  Is it something you would continue to do in the future in preparation for a match?

FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  Yeah, I think I do that every week whether it's Montreal or Birmingham or whatever, Zimbabwe.  I think a lot of players do that.  But in practice, I was maybe a little more looser where I was serving, where my fast ball was working a little bit better.  I was able to get a couple free points than tonight.  I felt like even when I was serving pretty good, he was coming back with decent, good defensive return.  That was maybe the difference between tonight and this week when I was practicing. 

Q.  You're 29 now.  You said you worked hard to get this far.  How difficult is it for you now to continue on?

FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  I feel like I've improved a lot.  I'm 29, but I feel like I'm still improving.  It's a bit weird to say, but it's true.  It's extremely hard.  I mean, this year I had a great year.  I had success, but it's been also a lot of hard work physically, mentally, on the road a lot.  I don't have the chance to have an entourage like some other players, which is fine, I'm used to that by now.  You know, this match, I don't think -- 2-1, yeah, he killed me, but tomorrow is another day.  I have doubles.  I'm going to sit down and see what I can do to improve if I play him next. 

Q.  How much longer do you think you'll play for?

FREDERIC NIEMEYER:  We'll see.  At the end of the year, we'll see.  I take it one year at a time.  I take it a few months at a time.  I give myself till the end of the year, and we'll see if I keep going at the end of the year.  It depends on a lot of few things.
