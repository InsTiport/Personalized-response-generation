Q.  Who saw first the damaged hand of Venus? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Actually, Venus came to me first because I'm the primary health care provider.  So I'm the first person, the first contact person. 

Q.  What time did it happen, because I know that Venus went back at 6:30, about? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Actually, the problem had been  -- I think Venus already told you , she's been having problems throughout the day.

Q.  During the day? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  During the day.  The problem was getting worse, is I think what she told you.  So she first came to me around 7 o'clock. 

Q.  This was her right hand?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Yes, it is the right wrist. 

Q.  Is this from when she was injured previously, or this is totally new? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  No, totally new problem. 

Q.  Did she feel it during the game?  They had a game today, she had a rally with her sister.  They were training during the day.  This happened into the game or later? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Today.  During the practice today. 

Q.  During the practice?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Practice today.  Practice today, yes. 

Q.  Did she injure it during the practice? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  No.  I think she already informed you that she had hurt it two days ago, but she had had no problems for two days. 

Q.  Is there any indication of what the problem is? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Actually, we're not quite sure at the moment.  After I saw her, we referred her to the tournament doctor, who is here (Enrica Pastore), to evaluate her.  What she has done  - what we are going to do  - as in the media release, we are actually going to wait another day.  We're going to reevaluate her tomorrow and we're going to see if we can get a more definitive diagnosis on the situation.   (Interview continued in Italian.)

BEATRICE MANZARI:  They don't know exactly what happened to the wrist.  Tomorrow there will be an evaluation.  So they just evaluated that she suffered at the right wrist, nothing more. 

Q.  Could you please tell us, you found this out at 7 o'clock, you said? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  We did, yes. 

Q.  And why, for what reason was it announced at only 8:10?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Okay.  I'm sorry.  We were first aware that there was a problem at 7 o'clock.  But there was still a possibility -- she wasn't sure whether she was able to play or not.  So she was  -- had a practice session at that time to see whether she was able to play or not. 

Q.  She practiced again at 7:30 or something? 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Well, she practiced until 7:30 or after  - later than that, yeah.  Because she wanted to be sure.  I mean, she was... wanted to play, yeah. 

Q.  Did she tell you how she hurt herself?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  How did she hurt herself?  I think she told you she was lifting some luggage.

Q.  What did she say to you?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  That she was lifting some luggage, yes.  Yeah. 

Q.  I just wanted to clarify, because it was a bit varied.  She came in very quickly. 

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Yes, obviously.  Yes. 

Q.  What was the kind of schedule of events ?  So two days ago she picks up her luggage?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Some luggage, it was luggage.

Q.  It hurts a bit.  So she leaves it through a couple of days?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Yeah, she had no problem. 

Q.  She had no pain?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Yeah. 

Q.  Then at 7 o'clock  --?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  No, no, no.  During the day she practiced.  She had two earlier sessions during the day.  And after that, it was gradually getting worse. 

Q.  What is the schedule of events now?  Do we know how long this is likely to take to treat?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  No.  And that's why we're going to reevaluate the situation again tomorrow.  She's going to have continued treatment with her therapist, and we're going to have her in tomorrow and we'll have a reevaluation tomorrow.

Q.  No scans or anything?

PHILIPPA STEWART:  Not at this stage.  Not at this stage.  That's what the reevaluation is always about, to just see whether it's indicated or not. 

Q.  WTA, can I ask you, Osterloh is the first lucky loser.  She was supposed to play doubles.  It was just a coincidence that she was there?  If not, what would have happened? 

RAQUEL MARTIN:  We have to ask the player.  We have to ask Lilia.  But what I'm aware  of - I'm not a spokesperson  - but I do know that she was warming up for her doubles because she was scheduled to play after the Venus-Kournikova match.  So she was on site because she had to play her doubles.
