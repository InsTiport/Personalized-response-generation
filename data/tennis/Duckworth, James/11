 R. FEDERER/J. Duckworth
  6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Obviously not the result you wanted, but are you happy with your effort and the experience of playing Roger?  
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Yeah, I mean, it's good experience to be able to play, you know, probably the best player of all time on Rod Laver Arena.   
Yeah, I would have liked to have played a little bit better, to have executed a little bit better, but it wasn't to be.   You know, I'll continue to work hard to get better.   
   
 Q.   The scoreline, you pushed one of the best players in the world to 6‑4, 6‑4.   Are you happy with your game?  
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Yeah, I feel like with my serve I can be pushing most guys to tiebreakers at least.   A little disappointed I couldn't at least push him to that.   I played a few loose points in the first two sets on my serve to get broken.   
That was a little bit disappointing.   
   
 Q.   What have you got coming up next?  
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   There's two more challengers here in Australia.   Hopefully I can pick up some points and get a direct entry into the French Open.
