  6‑0, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You should probably tell us.   It wasn't obviously the match you in any way, shape, or form wanted.   Thoughts on it?   What was it like trying to compete in that match?
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Yeah, rough night.   You know, we all have days that aren't as good as others. 
A bit of a combination of things:   me not playing great; didn't probably hit the ball as well as I had the last two matches; and Roger was, yeah, seeing the ball pretty big.
Yeah, conditions out there probably didn't help me too much.   It was pretty dead and I wasn't getting much jump off the court, especially off my serve.   Yeah, he was able to dictate and I got chopped.

Q.   Was it him?   The atmosphere?   Packed house?   Center court?   Him being a 17‑time Grand Slam champion and it's a packed center court, did the occasion overwhelm you a little?
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   I don't think so.   I played him before on Rod Laver.   It was a packed house.   I just think he played great and I didn't play so great.   The conditions were really good for him.

Q.   John gave him a pretty good workout last night.   Maybe that played against you.   He got enough court time to get nicely wound up for tonight. 
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Yeah, he didn't do too much wrong tonight, I don't think. 
Yeah, it was tough, like I said.

Q.   Did you have a chat with John about what he got out of last night's match? 
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Just briefly.   He was leaving.   Just, you know, spoke about what he thought.   You know, he played a good match and Roger probably didn't play as well as he did tonight.
Yeah. 

Q.   What do you do to get over something like that?   Do you do your normal thing?   Go out your dinner?   Try to talk about it?   Shut it out of your mind?
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Just spoke to my coach a bit about it.   It was a tough.   Just try and move on.   I think there are a lot of positives for me this week.   I played two great matches at a really high level.
Tonight just wasn't my night. 

Q.   How important is it to not let tonight's result overshadow this week? 
JAMES DUCKWORTH:   Yeah, it's important to keep building towards my goal of cracking that top 100.   I think it's important to just move on and get ready four the next one.
