3-6, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk us through that.  Disappointing after the first set.
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, it was a tough loss.  I was right there with him.  Couple of points here and there.  Got a bit unlucky not convert a couple of break points, and then in the third set to break a string at 30-All, which haven't broken a string in a match in five years.
Yeah, that was very unlucky.  Yeah.
Q. Which game was the 30-All point?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: 3-2.  Yeah.
Q. His serve was spot on today.  Was it as good as it looked like?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: His?
Q. Yeah.
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, I mean, he served well.  He's a good player.  He hits the ball big off both sides.  He was 20 in the world for a reason.
Saying that, still had chances.  Unfortunately couldn't convert them.
Q. How does this sort of change your plans going into the Australian Open?  Carry on with doubles here as well?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, doesn't change much.  Yeah, I'll play doubles here with Gucc, see how it goes.  Sydney next week, quallies there.  Hopefully get a few matches there.
Then, yeah, get ready for Aussie.
Q. Did you and your opponent get a chance to warm up on Rafter Arena?  Obviously weather has been an issue for a lot of players today.
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, we both got on.  Probably, yeah, because of the rain it was quite a bit heavier than how it normally plays, which I found it tough to get many free points on serve because of that.  Balls were fluffing up a lot more.
Q. With the amount of work that you've done, James, is that the disappointing part?  You did all work in the pre-season, worked hard?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, I mean, I worked hard.  I've been working hard for a number of years.  Yeah, I mean, wasn't a bad match, I don't think.  It was just a few points here and there.
Bit disappointed with the way I served.  First serve percentage wasn't high enough.  But, yeah, no, there is still few tournaments for the summer, and Aussie Open is the one I'm going to be really trying to peak for.
You know, hopefully can have a good year.
Q. Any chance to debrief with Marc?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Haven't seen Sharky yet.
Q. Does it make a difference, I mean, Wally Masur and a couple other guys were up in the stands.  Do you notice those guys?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Had no idea there were there, so no.
Q. Have you hit with Oliver Anderson much?
JAMES DUCKWORTH: Yeah, we practiced a lot.  Yeah, he's a good young player.  He's done well to qualify this week.  Should be a -- I think he's just starting now, so if he can play well, he has a chance.
