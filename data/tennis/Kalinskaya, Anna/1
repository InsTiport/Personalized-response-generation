A. KALINSKAYA/K. Mladenovic
6-4, 4-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Looks like your first win over Mladenovic, third try.  Why today and not before?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Well, I played twice against her, and I didn't play my best.  So today I really wanted just to play good and enjoy the moment, play point by point.  I'm happy that I won.  It's a nice feeling.
Q. You're having a great week here, qualifying singles and doubles.  Semifinals now.  What has been working for you well this week?  What has been going right in your game?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: I think I improved my game, like I tried to play more consistent, just tried to be less in a rush, play more rallies.  I think that's why I improve.
Q. A lot of close games in the opening of the third set.  You saved five of six breakpoints.  How did you get through that final set?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: On the breakpoints, I was just trying to let her play, don't miss too much, do less mistakes.  It worked.
Q. Someone told me that you hit and underhand serve.
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Oh, yeah, I did.
Q. We see more of those in tennis this year.  Where did you get the idea to do that?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: I think you knew why I did it.  Because I was watching Nick Kyrgios.  I do the same.  It was funny because I won the point.
Q. First time you ever hit one in a real match?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: First time during a match, it was funny.
Q. Did Mladenovic look surprised?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: I guess I surprised her because she hit it to the net.
Q. Do you plan on trying that tactic again?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Well, maybe.  I need to practice my underarm serve.
Q. Have you ever practiced it before?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: No, just a couple during the warmup for fun.
Q. First semifinal now.  Jessie Pegula.
ANNA KALINSKAYA: I had no idea.  Thanks for telling me.
Q. What do you think about that?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Well, I didn't see her playing much.  I just watched a couple of points before my match today.
I don't know.  Maybe my coach knows.  I didn't see her match, to be honest.
Q. The number four seed is the highest seed left, Hsieh Su-Wei.  You have a chance to win the title here.  Do you stop yourself there thinking about that, just play point by point, match by match, or have you let your imagination wander in that direction?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: No, I don't think about the title.  I just want to play point by point and see how it goes.
Q. What kind of goals have you set for yourself for the rest of the year?  You're getting closer and closer to hitting the top 100.
ANNA KALINSKAYA: So before I was thinking like it's important to get to top 100.  I think I put a lot of pressure on myself.  Now I have a new coach.  She tells me like, Anna, try to improve your game and the result will come.
So now I think less about my ranking.  I just want to improve.
Q. Who is your coach now?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Patricia Tarabini.
Q. There's not many female coaches in the WTA even.  What made you make that choice?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: Well, we start to work, like, three weeks ago.  It's kind of new.  But I like it a lot.
Q. You're so young, but there's been this onslaught of even younger players recently.  Do you pay attention to that?  Does that make you feel more pressure to have success?
ANNA KALINSKAYA: No, I don't really pay attention.
