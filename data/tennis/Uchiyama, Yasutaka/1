 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. Bad luck today, tough match.  What were your thoughts on the match?
 YASUTAKA UCHIYAMA:   Of course disappointed to lose the match.  I know that he's a great player.  He's improving a lot, especially in the last year.  He won two titles, so he's one of the upcoming players.
 I think I couldn't do anything in the first two sets, but I start getting some rhythm from the third set.  Maybe I had some chances in the fourth set.  It was a close match at the end, but I was disappointed to lose, yeah.
