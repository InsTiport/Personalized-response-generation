THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please.  
 
 
Q.  Could you just talk about the match and the flow of things.  It seemed like it was tough to get into things for a while. 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, of course, I was like a little bit disappointed, thinking I don't have any chance to get into the semis. So I couldn't give my best, and I really leave this tournament a little bit disappointed, yeah.  
 
Q.  Physically, how are you, and kind of what do you do from now in preparation for the start of next season?
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, it was okay.  It's good maybe to play against these great players.  And maybe for the next year, it's going to give me a little bit of more confidence so when I play against them, I know that I can. So hope to play a little bit better in the future.  
 
Q.  Could you look back at this Masters Cup.  Is it big experience for you? 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, of course it was.  It was a great experience.  The first time that I'm here in a tournament like this, sure, it's like -- it was great.  It was pretty good.
