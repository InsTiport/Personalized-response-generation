THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  How do you feel?

GASTON GAUDIO:  Well, I'm happy to be here.  I'm going to try to enjoy all the whole week.  I hope to win a match and get into the second round.  But I'm happy to be here, yeah. 

Q.  What do you think about the Red Group? 

GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, the group is tough, but I think that we are playing the best players in the circuit, in the tour.  For sure we are going to find a tough group anywhere, doesn't matter if you're playing in the Blue one, the Red one.  It's all the same; they're all great players. 

Q.  Is the court slow?

GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, was okay.  For me, it's better.  But for me, it was okay, yeah.  It's all right.
