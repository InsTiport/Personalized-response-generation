MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 
 
Q.  I know this is a tough loss, but Argentina is obviously playing tremendous tennis right now.  I'm wondering from your side, why is that? 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Actually, I really don't know.  They are playing good.  I don't know why.  Maybe because one is playing so good, you know, that makes that the other ones trust in that they can do it themselves. 
 
Q.  You were one of the first to really, in this new wave, to start playing.
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  I was behind Squillari first.  So I'm making like a roll the dice, you know?  The dice is rolling. 
 
Q.  But it's not just on clay courts; it's hard courts as well, the Masters Series?
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Not for me, huh?  
 
Q.  Not for you here.  What is the answer?  Is it the camaraderie?  Everybody's friends, like the Spaniards were, and they started playing so well.
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Maybe, I don't know.  Maybe that.  Yeah, we are pretty good friends, you know.  We used to go out every day, having dinner together.  That's make it easy to travel around, to be with your friends.
