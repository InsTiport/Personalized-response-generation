  Q.  You must be pretty pleased with that sort of performance in the first set?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  (Through translation.)  Yes, it was a very good match.  I played very well during the first set.  I believe he was tired or asleep or something, but I took advantage of it.   
  Q.  Nobody talks about you in this tournament.  Now you are in the semifinal.  What do you think about that?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Well, they didn't talk about me in the French Open either when I won it, so I hope to continue like this.  And maybe is a good opportunity to win this tournament, too.   
  Q.  How do you explain your results from this year?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Well, I am starting to play better day by day.  At the beginning of the year I was a little bit tired, you know.  I was coming two years in a row, I was fed up, you know (smiling).   
 And, finally, I think that I am coming back and I really love to play again, you know, my best tennis again.   
  Q.  Do you think you're playing well enough to win the French?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Actually, you never know.  When I came in 2004 to the French Open, I was like playing good tennis, but I didn't expect that I was win the tournament.   
 So this year we'll see.  Of course we have Nadal and Federer and both of them, maybe Coria, a lot of guys, who wants to win it.  It's gonna be tough for sure.   
 But, anyway, I have to go there, play my best tennis, and maybe it happens again.   
  Q.  Do you think you've improved since 2004 some part of your game?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  No, I think that I was playing better in 2004 than now.  But, like I told you before, you never know.  You have to go over there and try to give your best and then maybe it happens.   
  Q.  I saw you yesterday.  You were quite nervous when you were playing against Di Mauro.  Is yourself the worst opponent sometimes?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Myself?   
  Q.  Yes, because you have a negative attitude sometimes.   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  I think that always myself is my worst opponent.  I always playing against myself first and then to the other one.  So I'm playing against two guys during the match (smiling).   
  Q.  You cannot do anything about it?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Imagine how good I am, that I play against two (laughing).   
  Q.  About your mental, do you think that you are ready to fight three sets or four sets, five sets if you have to play five sets?  Not physically, but mentally.   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Mentally, I don't know what is gonna happen tomorrow, you know.  It's like mentally I don't know what is gonna happen in the next ten minutes.  Maybe I get depressed in ten minutes.  I don't know myself too much.   
 But I know that I was prepared, you know, because I did it in the French Open.  But I would love to feel that feeling again.   
  Q.  Do you work to know yourself better?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, I was working with a psychology, and I still.   
  Q.  You still do it?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Yep.   
  Q.  Is he around here?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  It seems like it's not too good or what (laughing)?   
  Q.  I'm just asking.   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, I'm still working.  No, he's not here.  When I arrive there in Argentina, I used to work every day.   
  Q.  He is in Argentina.  Every day?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Almost.   
  Q.  What is his name?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Pablo.   
  Q.  Pablo?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Yep.   
  Q.  Last name?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  Pecola (phonetic spelling).   
  Q.  Half Italian?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  I don't know.   
  Q.  You come from where?  Gaudio, the last game, I mean, where is your family background?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  French.   
  Q.  French, Gaudio?  Come on.   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  I don't know (laughing).  I don't even know.   
  Q.  You never ask?   
 GASTON GAUDIO:  What?  No, I didn't ask.
