THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Can you tell us about your match today. 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  It was pretty tough, the match.  I was playing really good.  It was a very close match.  I was lucky in the third set.  That's why I finish the third set pretty easy.  
 
Q.  But the first two sets were a little tighter.  He could have even beaten you in two sets. 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, I was lucky in the first two sets because I was 6-3 down in the tiebreak.  And, I don't know, he made a few mistakes and that's why I could finish the first set pretty tough.  And then in the third, I start 3-love and that was the difference.  
 
Q.  And your next match against a friend and a fellow countryman (Chela), how do you feel about that? 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Well, playing against a friend, so it's pretty difficult.  But we are professionals and we have to play as best as we can.  And, well, gonna be better for Argentina because they're going to have someone in the quarterfinals.  
 
Q.  And maybe you can talk to us about the beginning of the season.  You started pretty strong on hardcourts in Davis Cup. 
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah.  I was playing pretty good, but I was injured.  After Davis Cup I got injured and I couldn't play after Davis Cup.   Well, I'm back and I start to play again in Indian Wells.  And, well, I started playing good again.
