THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English, please. 


Q.  You seemed to be struggling a little bit with a groin strain.  Do you have a problem there?

GASTON GAUDIO:  No, in my leg. 

Q.  Oh, in your leg?

GASTON GAUDIO:  Yeah, my leg, yes.

Q.  It was hurting at the beginning of the match?

GASTON GAUDIO:  At the beginning of the match, yep.

Q.  So that affected your play today?

GASTON GAUDIO:  No, no. 

Q.  How disappointed are you that you lost the match today? 

GASTON GAUDIO:  How much I am? 

Q.  Yes. 

GASTON GAUDIO:  As much as I can, I guess. 

Q.  One time I heard that you asked God for help.  You said something in Spanish, and you asked for rain to stop the match.  What happened? 

GASTON GAUDIO:  No, I mean, we used to say that in Spanish, but it doesn't mean anything. 

Q.  How frustrating was the delay, and what did you do during the day to kill the time? 

GASTON GAUDIO:  No, we get used to it, you know.  Is not the only city that it happened, this, you know.  So we get used to the rain.  We didn't do so much.  We just having fun with my friends - as always.
