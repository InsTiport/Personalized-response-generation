THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 
 

Q.  It was your first match in Monte-Carlo.  How do you feel looking to the French Open?
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  It's always good to win.  The first match is always a difficult one.  Today it became a bit complicated for me. The important thing was to win and to keep going. 
 

Q.  Coria said you and Nadal were the favorites for the French Open this year.  Do you feel fit for that?
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Yes, if I feel good.  But it's going to be very, very difficult.  There are 110 other players wanting to win also.  Last year to win it was terrible. But if I play a good tournament, if I can win a couple of rounds, it will already be incredible.  Everybody knows that winning the French Open is extremely difficult. 
 

Q.  For this tournament, do you take it match after match?
 
GASTON GAUDIO:  Match after match, as usual.
