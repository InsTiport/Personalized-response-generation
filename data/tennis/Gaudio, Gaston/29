Q. What is your reaction to that match? You started off very well and then it went
worse starting from the second set?

GASTON GAUDIO: Well, it is true I started very well. But in the second set I started
feeling tired and I started having problems with my leg. So I couldn't play well and he
was playing as well as before. The problem of the leg was the adductors.
