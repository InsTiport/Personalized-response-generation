  Q.  Just talk about the injury and the disappointment.   
 LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, obviously disappointed, but my back hasn't come up as well as I would have liked from last week, which is frustrating for me.   
 Not a whole heap I can do about it at the moment, but I don't want to go out there and play in pain, and obviously not being able to compete 100 percent like I'd like to every time I go on the court.   
  
  Q.  Is there a history with this?   
 LLEYTON HEWITT:  No, it just happened first time last week in the first game of my match in Indian Wells, and I just haven't been able to shake it.   
 And I'm not going to go out and risk further injury.  It's the last thing I need at the moment.   
  
  Q.  What are your plans from here?   
 LLEYTON HEWITT:  Not sure at this stage.  Just try and get some treatment, and hopefully it responds better in the next couple of weeks.   
  
  Q.  You're known for being such a fighter.  This has just got to be gut wrenching for you to do this?   
 LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, it's just frustrating, but I don't want to go on the court knowing that I can't compete at my best, either.  That's the most frustrating thing, and that's the thing I struggled with last week in Indian Wells.   
 I couldn't compete the way I wanted to, and that's why you end up losing some of those matches.  That's the most disappointing thing.   
  
  Q.  Coming off Las Vegas you were feeling good?   
 LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, yeah, so that's been the biggest disappointment, because I enjoy these two tournaments.  They're both on surfaces that I play well on, and obviously coming off Las Vegas and playing on American hard court, so it's disappointing.
