Q.  In your words, Lleyton, what were you feeling out there today? 

LLEYTON HEWITT:  No, I've just been -- had some kind of virus, stomach virus, last three or four days or so.  Just got worse and worse.  Yeah, obviously out in the heat today, you know, just felt like I had nothing out there. 

Q.  This morning when you did come in, I know there was talk you were thinking of not playing.  You decided to give it a go.  I'm sure the fans here in Montreal really appreciated your effort.  Was that ever a thought for you not to actually go out? 

LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, it was, up till about 15, 20 minutes before.  11:00 this morning, I was still 50/50.  I was talking it over with the doctors, whatever.  Yeah, it's just seeing what the case was.  Obviously, I haven't been able to eat anything the last three or four days, as well, which, yeah, just really hit me up because I've got no energy whatsoever right at the moment. 

Q.  Looking forward, what does the next two or three days look like for you? 

LLEYTON HEWITT:  Doing nothing.  You know, just trying to find out why I'm feeling so average the last few days.  You know, obviously a long flight, as well, coming over from Australia didn't help.  That's just made things a lot tougher.
