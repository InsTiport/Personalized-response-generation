L. HEWITT/F. Gil
  3-6, 6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Did he just sort of take you unawares at the beginning? 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, I never actually seen him play before. I didn't know what to expect. 
 I didn't play my best set of tennis at the start. You know, I just didn't serve well and didn't execute what I needed to do. 
 Yeah, it took me the first set to really understand how he goes about it, as well. After that, the first set -- the end of the first set I started feeling more and more comfortable, you know, what to do and what his strengths and weaknesses were. 

 Q. Next up is Andy Roddick. How do you see your chances?
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Well, it's a good test a week or so before a big major like Wimbledon. Roddick is -- yeah, he's always going to be one of the favorites under Nadal and Federer on grass at Wimbledon.
 He's made a couple of finals there in the past and lost to Roger, so -- yeah, we both got good records here at Queen's. Hopefully it's a good match tomorrow.

 Q. When you say it's a good test, what are you actually meaning?
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Just a good challenge against one of the best grass court players in the world. He's obviously got, you know, a big weapon with his serve. He's got a big forehand. He moves well for his size.
 Yeah, just playing grass court tennis, to come up against a guy like that is going to be a big step up from my first two matches here.
