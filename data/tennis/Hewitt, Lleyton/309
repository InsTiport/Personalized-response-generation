THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Lleyton, please.  
 
 
Q.  Damn good tennis out there. 
 
LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, it was good.  Jan-Michael always starts well, I found, in the past.  I felt like I haven't had too many chances to break him real early in matches in the past.  I tried to get off to a good start.  I was able to break first up.  He just played incredible tennis the whole first set.  5-1, he was just slapping balls around left, right, and center.  Everything was going two inches inside every line.  I just told myself, you know, "You're No. 1 in the world.  If you can do this..."  Obviously, you don't want to (inaudible) yourself the whole match.  I actually thought I wasn't playing too bad.  I just hung in there like I always did.  In the end it paid off.  
 
Q.  Had he shown you that one -handed forehand?
 
LLEYTON HEWITT:  He's getting better and better every time I see him with it.  Tonight was obviously the best I've seen him hit it.  He hit it well return-wise.  When he was stretched out trying to make a pass, he hit it well.  You know, it's probably been a little bit of a weakness in the past, I think, playing some guys when they've got him out wide.  Now on, I don't think so much.   
 
Q.  You get another American in the next round now. 
 
LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah.  
 
Q.  You haven't played him? 
 
LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, twice.  
 
Q.  Okay. 
 
LLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, I haven't even thought about it yet though.  But, you know, he's playing great.  You know, he's getting better and better every time I see him.  So, you know, I'm going to have to play just as well as I did tonight if I'm going to get through.
