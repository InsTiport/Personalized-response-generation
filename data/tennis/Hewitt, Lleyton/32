L. HEWITT/D. Gimeno‑Traver
      6‑3, 6‑3

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Pretty straightforward, wasn't it?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Yeah, nothing is real straightforward.   It got off to a good start, and then he saved those three break points at Love‑40 in that third game to consolidate the break, which was important.
    I wasn't 100% sure how he'd play on grass.   Obviously I have seen him play a little bit on hard court and clay, but, yeah, he's dangerous.   He served better than I thought he would, hit his spots well and a high percentage of first serves.   He's got a really nice forehand. 
    Happy to get the win in straight sets.

Q.   What pleased you the most about the way you played?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   I just felt pretty sharp out there.   I have been hitting the ball really well in practice.   Didn't take me long at all to get straight on the grass and felt comfortable, which is good.
    Yeah, everything's been going well in practice leading in.   So, yeah, had a good week hitting.   Was able to get enough time on the grass. 
    You know, I felt pretty confident.   Yeah, even my footing‑‑ a lot of guys were slipping over there today.   I didn't really slip at all out there, and I felt like I wasn't sliding like everyone else on the grass courts.   I was pretty happy with that.

Q.   How long does it normally take you to get your footwork at a high end on the grass when you're coming off the clay?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   The last few years it hasn't taken me long at all.   You know, even my first hit I felt pretty comfortable on it. 
    I'm fortunate in that way.   I come on with a pretty positive mindset, as well.   I find the first match though on grass, you know, just getting back into that routine of‑‑ you know, obviously the serve and return is so important. 
    They are, you know, the two big keys on grass; whereas on a clay court the serve and return is pretty much, you know, thrown out the window a lot of the time.

Q.   Bernie was saying in Paris that the French Open is a tournament that he does not like at all. 
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Who was saying that? 

Q.   Bernie Tomic.   And that he's thrilled, thrilled that he was all over and done with it over there, that he could get on to the grass over here.   Has your mindset changed at all about that sort of attitude?   I'm talking about yourself and going away from the clay and coming on to grass. 
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Well, you know, for me obviously I have just ‑‑ you know, I'm sure Bernie means it like, you know, clay's obviously his worst surface, so for him, coming on to the grass ‑‑ he's had his most success obviously at Wimbledon for a Grand Slam. 
    Yeah, for me, me and him have a lot more positive outlook when we get on the grass and start hitting, because purely the surface suits our game.   There's probably only 10 to 15 guys that probably feel that way when they get on a grass court.   Most of the guys look forward to the clay court season.
    He's obviously just come back from surgery and frustrated.   It's pretty tough obviously moving on clay straight after surgery.

Q.   Do you always like the French?   Because what he actually said was, I really like Paris.   I like Paris and the city.   But I hate the French Open. 
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Yeah, I don't know what he means.

Q.   But what about yourself? 
    LLEYTON HEWITT:     I play for all the majors, obviously.   Yeah, for me, obviously Wimbledon and the Australian Open are pretty important, the Australian Open for obvious reasons and Wimbledon because, you know, I sat up for so many late nights as a kid and idolized Pat Cash and those guys climbing into the stands and winning the tournament. 
    Yeah, there is a buzz, and, you know, when you've been able to win there it's even bigger.

Q.   Is this place closer to you in terms of enjoyment?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Oh, yeah, absolutely.   I love coming back here.   Yeah, I just love the surroundings.   The setting today was a fantastic crowd for a first day at Queen's where, you know, a lot of the top seeds have byes, as well.   It was a really good atmosphere out there.

Q.   You won your first title in four years at the start of the year.   You're close to your highest ranking in about three years.   Do you set yourself these landmarks, targets during the year to keep the motivation going?   What are your targets for the rest of this season?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Yeah, I don't set anything over that.   Couldn't care less about my ranking, and, you know, obviously every tournament I go in I want to win.   Every match I play I want to win.
    But the majors are still what I play for.   In a couple weeks' time, one of the big ones for me.   Yeah, that's still the motivation.   Nothing has really changed.
    Obviously Davis Cup in September, as well, and then the Australian summer will come around.   In terms of ranking, there are no big goals.

Q.   What about your history here?   Obviously you have got a great record here.   Does that sort of color how you approach it?   Does it add to it?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Not really.   I think I have won the most matches here already of anyone.   I'd love to win a fifth title here. 
    The run that I had last year was great, you know.   I felt like I got a lot of confidence out of that.   That set me up I think for a good U.S. summer and good US Open beating Del Potro there as well. 
    I really love coming back to this tournament and playing well.

Q.   With Andy announcing AmÃ©lie as his coach through this grass court season, what are your thoughts on that?
    LLEYTON HEWITT:   Everyone to their own.   He obviously thinks she can make a small difference.   And when you're as good a player as Andy and those top guys, it's only half a percent sometimes that can turn something.   He's obviously spoken to her and feels that she may have a couple of different ideas.
    But, yeah, coach and player, the biggest things are mutual respect.
