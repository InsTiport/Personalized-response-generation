D. NALBANDIAN/L. Hewitt
  3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 9-7

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Talk us through your feelings after that. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: There's not a lot to talk about at the moment. A bit frustrating, so... Yeah, a bit disappointed at the moment. 

 Q. How do you rate it as a result here? Obviously very frustrating. You were in the match right through it. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, it's frustrating. I'll sit back and go through it. But right at the moment, yeah, as I said it's disappointing to come so close and fight for so long and not able to quite get the win tonight.

 Q. Especially when you're probably playing better than you have in a while, too. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball all right. There's not a lot I can do about it. 

 Q. How have you gone about bridging the gap to some of the better players and what are your plans in that regard?
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Don't know right at the moment. 

 Q. Even in the off-season. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: I was just working on my game, trying to -- yeah, there's small areas of my game that Rochey and I wanted to work on and we just tried to strengthen those up. Some of those I feel I've been doing well the last few weeks. It's not always to take them from the practice court and put them in the match court either. 
 There's still a few things there to work on, as well.

 Q. Still a bit of room for the rest of the year. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, you can always improve. The bar's always getting raised by the top guys. If I can stay fit and healthy and play a full calendar, then hopefully I can get better as the year goes on. 

 Q. People seem to be asking if you'll be back. 
 LLEYTON HEWITT: What have I said coming in? I think that answers it.

 Q. You had so many close games against David. Is there a particular reason that happens between the two of you?
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Wimbledon final wasn't too close, so... 

 Q. Are you feeling okay after the match?
 LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
