6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You leave Brisbane with a four-win, one-loss -- I suppose it's disappointing today?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Ah, yeah.   
 Q.  What didn't happen for you?  What went wrong?  Frustration?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: I think my serve wasn't on today.  I think I was rushing a lot.   
Yeah, just those little things that I did wrong.   
 Q.  How daunting is it to come up against a two-time Grand Slam winner?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: It's pretty scary.  I think I learned a lot out of that match.  Yeah.   
 Q.  What do you take out of it?  What are some of the things you do take out of this whole experience?  A week long, you had your qually matches, first and second round.  What do you take out of it?  Lots of things?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Some confidence, maybe, in my game and myself, knowing that I do belong here.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Is it just the confidence boost you need before going to the Australian Open?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.  I feel like I'm ready for that challenge now after playing these five matches.  I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  You took that service game off her in the second set.  The crowd were erupting.  And then you seemed to run out of puff.  Did fatigue get you?  Was that one final effort to break back?  What happened?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah, I guess so.  Fatigue came in a bit.  Then I was kind of like, Oh, you can't drop your service game, and stuff like that.  That didn't really help me.   
 Q.  Did Svetlana say anything to you in the match?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.  I think I remember her saying I had a great tournament.  Good luck for the next couple of tournaments I'm playing.   
 Q.  What happens now?  What do you have planned between now and the Australian Open?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: I'm playing the AAMI Classic soon.  So I just go home and have a training block before that starts on the 10th, I think.   
 Q.  What about the support?  You probably designed that there were some witty songs.  I know it's unusual for someone, you know, in her first tournament to have a whole crowd behind her like that.  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah, it's pretty cool to have the crowd behind me.  Yeah, I really appreciate that.  It was kind of funny, their songs.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  The one about the Russians?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: That was a bit rude.  (Laughter.)  It's like, What?   
 Q.  Is it hard not to sort of get ahead of yourself?  With guys like Tomic and Kyrgios, those guys -- I mean, is it hard not to get ahead of yourself when you have had a bit of success like this?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.  I have my mom to keep me grounded.  She's always telling me off if I'm getting a big head and stuff.  (Smiling.)   
 Q.  What did mum say today?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: She said, Get back out on the practice court.  We've got a lot to work on.   
 Q.  So there's no patting yourself on the back for coming this far?  You thought you had enough opportunities today?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: I think she will do that when we get home.  She doesn't like to blow me up, you know, not say, Oh, you did really well, and, like, make me complacent, you know.   
 Q.  How do you think your game did match up?  Where did you maybe surprise yourself that you weren't as far off as maybe before?  Where did you feel like the biggest gap was on court between you and Sveta?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: I think the big difference was her mentality compared to mine.  She was a lot more focused throughout the whole match; whereas mine was kind of on/off.   
 Q.  What's your favorite shot?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Forehand.   
 Q.  That inside-out forehand is really a nice shot of yours.  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is that one that just comes naturally to you?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is your mum sort of more of a tough-love school?  How would you describe your mum as a coach?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tough but fair?  
DESTANEE AIAVA: Just tough (smiling).  Not fair.  Yeah.  Tough, tough, tough.  (Smiling.)
