6-1, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Well, I guess maybe not the set that you wanted but talk me through the match and how it felt out there.
DESTANEE AIAVA: I guess it was just a bad day.  And she was playing pretty well, so all credit to her.  She played pretty good.
Yeah, and I was -- yeah, just wasn't my day today.  I was pretty much hitting the ball to other countries.  It was that bad.
But, yeah, I'll move on.  Yeah.
Q. Do you feel like it's sort of -- it's been a long summer for you already because, obviously, you had the wildcard playoff and success there and I imagine that was quite a high.  So do you feel like you're in the swing of it already?
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah, I had a full on two weeks, and then had a bit of a break Christmas and then got into this tournament.
So, yeah, I've been pretty full on with my tournaments and match play as well, so I've had a lot.
But, yeah, just focusing on Kooyong and Oz Open I guess.
Q. So that's the plan?  Kooyong and Oz Open?
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah.
Q. So how do you feel going into the Oz Open as the wildcard?
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah, I'm pretty happy to have won the wildcard.  I've earned it.  And I feel like I'm not so much ready but, yeah, a bit more confident than I was last year.  So I'm looking forward to that and I'll be happy to play at home as well.
Q. That's going to be such a big stage.  Are you the kind of player that really enjoys that or do you still find that quite a big deal?
DESTANEE AIAVA: Yeah, I enjoy playing at home.  It's only, like, a half an hour drive from my house.  So it's really easy and I don't get that homesick feeling.
But, yeah, having the Ozzie crowd behind me will be pretty good.  So I'm looking forward to that as well.
