WTA: Questions for Jennifer. 

Q. Ice?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: A little precaution.

Q. Heel?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Achilles.

Q. It's definitely okay?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah.

Q. How did you play tonight?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I think I played really good. I was happy with the way I played.
From the beginning, I came out strong. I've played her many times already. She always
plays well. I knew I had to just be really ready for her. I was pleased with all the parts
of my game really.

Q. Do you like a player who gives you a lot of pace, with flat shots?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. I mean, it doesn't really matter. I think, you know, I can
adjust to anybody. You know, she hits the ball hard, really hard, so sometimes it's
difficult, you know, to play a player like her. Really, I can just adjust to everybody, I
think. 

Q. Talk about your next opponent. 

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: It's Serena. Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing her. I haven't
seen her play in a while, so I don't really know how she's playing. I've just got to go
out there and play my game and feel good, you know, see what happens. 

Q. Going to be a power-on-power match?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Well, that's my game and that's her game, so I guess so. Hopefully I
just play my game, I'm on, and feeling good physically. 

Q. Her serve can be huge. Go back to matches where you have players like Lindsay with
big serves. How do you usually deal with a big serve?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I do okay. I mean, I think I return well enough. I mean, it's not
like, you know, they're hitting bombs all the time, certainly not like men's tennis. It's
not like they're unreturnable. If I play well in all parts of my game, if I can hold my
own serve, I should be okay and not feel so much pressure in returning. 

Q. To a lot of people, this is a huge match. A win here is a symbol that you're not
just Top 20, you're Top 5. How are you going to resist having that additional pressure?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I'm just not going to think about it at all. I'm just going to go
out there like it's just a match, that's it, play my game and not think of all the hype,
not really think about the question you just asked (laughter).
