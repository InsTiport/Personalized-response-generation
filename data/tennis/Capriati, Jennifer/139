Q.  Bring us up to date, will you?   You played in Philadelphia, what has been going on? 
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Well, I played in Philly.  I really hurt my arm badly. 
 

Q.  Serving or --
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: It has just been from everything.   I mean, it was a problem that I even had before.  It just -- it really flared up.  I guess I started to play more and started to hit it a little more, so it flared up on me. So I just decided to take that time to rest that and then use that to try to get more in shape, physical shape, conditioning.  And just Australia was too soon, and I just -- I wanted to start here. 
 

Q.  For what reason?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Just, I mean, because I like this place.  Feels like home.  Feels comfortable here.  And I know it well, so... 
 

Q.  Where are you living? 
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Well, Florida, but all over Florida.  Still in Tampa. 
 

Q.  How did you feel out there tonight?   Obviously the strokes were a little erratic.
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I felt great out there.  I felt I started to truly get into it and I had all kinds of energy going on before I went out, you know. I was, like, nervous and anxious going out there.  I mean, it has been a while since I have played a match.  So I think before, you know, I really started to settle down.  It was too late by then. 
 

Q.  Is this what you want to do?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah.  What do you mean? 
 

Q.  You want to be a professional tennis player?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. 
 

Q.  So many people ask me, does she want to do this?  I said I don't know, I will ask her.
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I do want to do this.  I mean, it is up to me to decide, you know, and I am not going to rush things.  I am not going to do everything else that everybody wants.  I want to do what I want. 
 

Q.  What is the attraction for you?  Why do you want to do this at this point?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Just the basic love of the game, you know, just tennis, just the adrenaline rush, really, playing well.  And it is just -- it is a goal for me, you  know, to see if I can do it, come back to the level. 
 

Q.  Has it even crossed your mind at all just the struggles that you have had?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: What? 
 

Q.  Just hanging it up, not playing anymore?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. But I think this is the test of oneself.  And, I mean, there is just -- I feel like I have just been in sort of constant fight, you know, but it is just -- it is getting easier.  So, it is something that I want to continue. 
 

Q.  What level are you hoping to attain, Top-10?  And how quick do you think --
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: That would be great.  And I don't know how quick.  Maybe next week, I don't know. 
 

Q.  What is next for you?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I think Hilton Head.  Hilton Head, the clay court season starting.  It is already next week. 
 

Q.  How much was tonight, particularly the start, the fact that you hadn't played a match for four months?   Was it a question of getting yourself back into the swing of things and finding the range and timing and everything else?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah, I think all that.  And just, I mean, the confidence -- not really sure where I should hit this shot or that shot.  Obviously, I mean, I  doublefaulted a lot, and that is just confidence for me.  It has been hard, because I keep -- seems like I am just always trying to come back.  But now I really think, you know, that I am going to continue playing.  I have had, like, a lot of injuries.  But now I feel pretty good. 
 

Q.  How many tournaments do you think you will play this year?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I don't know, the minimum, maybe more.  As much as I can. 
 

Q.  Do you think if you got that second set you would have been very confident in the third?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah, I think so.  Just -- is it raining out there now? 
 

Q.  Yes.
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah, I mean, I think I was starting to really play well and just find -- finding my rhythm.  But, I mean, she is a tough player to play.  She played well.  She likes the hard ball and she hits it well, so it was tough. 
 

Q.  What do you miss the most about your game right now?   What do you miss?   What do you wish you had back right now?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Confidence and just, you know, with that, I mean, I am more aggressive and I think I am still not aggressive.  
 

Q.  You have been hitting with your brother some?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. 
 

Q.  Can he take a set from you now and then?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Now and then.  No, he is pretty good, so; lucky to have him. 
 

Q.  Is there a coaching situation?  And what is it, if so?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: No, I still don't have, like, a full-time coach.  I am trying people, you know, so different tournaments it has been different people. 
 

Q.  Do you work with your father, your brother?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah, my father -- I mean, when I am home in Saddle Brook I train there.  And my dad, he will always be my coach. 
 

Q.  Who is your favorite all-time player and why?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I would say I like the way Pete plays, Pete Sampras. 
 

Q.  For obvious reasons, because he is so great?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah.  And, I think Borg, too. Bjorn Borg. 
 

Q.  Again, why?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Just because he was just, I mean, so fluid and just, you know, amazing.  And he didn't even play for that long. 
 

Q.  Did you see him play in real life? 
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Only on TV, performing time. 
 

Q.  Is your family here tonight?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. 
 

Q.  Mom, dad, brother?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. 
 

Q.  You were talking about that you hit with Steven.  He is trying to play the Tour?   Is he looking to go to college?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Right now he hasn't made a decision about college yet.  So, I mean, he can't play juniors anymore, so... 
 

Q.  How old is he?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: 18.  I guess, you know, he will -- he really hasn't decided.  He would love to play the Tour, but, I mean, you know -- 
 

Q.  Is he still in high school?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah.  It is his last year. 
 

Q.  Have you given him any advice about whether he should join the Tour or go to college?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: No.  I mean, I think -- I just tell him do what he feels, do what is in his heart, what he really wants and, you know, really think about it and don't do anything that he might regret later. 
 

Q.  What do you think he will regret?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Maybe, you know, going to college.  Maybe he should take that opportunity now, take  advantage. 
 

Q.  Is it difficult coming in and answering these questions on a night that you didn't play so well?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Well, of course, it is always difficult, but got to do it. 
 

Q.  How long have you been a red head?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Just tonight. 
 

Q.  Can you take some comfort away from the -- why did you do it?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I don't know.  I have this thing with red lately.  I like red. 
 

Q.  Can you take a little comfort away from the fact that you did have a terrible start but that you played so well tonight?
 
JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah, I mean, at least I didn't get blown off the court.  And it was so quick and felt like -- that I had like a small chance out there.  So, it was a start for me, actually.
