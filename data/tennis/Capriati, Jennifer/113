Q.  An easy match for you?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI:  No, I mean I went in there thinking it was going to be a tough match.  I mean the scores might have looked, you know, easy, but still it was a difficult match to play just with the conditions and everything. And towards the end there, I had to make sure I kept concentrating.  So, I mean I was just thinking about my game.  I just thought if I could play well, I'd be okay.

Q.  Did the ankle bother you?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Actually, no.  It felt good.  As you probably saw, I had a heavy tape job there.  I've just been getting a lot of treatment ever since my last match.  So it felt good. 

Q.  The last time you met Oremans you lost.  Were you extra motivated to win today?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Oh, yeah.  I mean, I'm just here playing in a Grand Slam and of course, you know, I just want to do the best that I can do and that's enough motivation for me.  It's just, you know, I just try and win every match.  It doesn't matter who I'm playing. 

Q.  She made a lot of mistakes.  Do you feel you won the game or she lost the match?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Well, I think, you know, if I was making mistakes also it would have been easy for her.  So I mean I think I just played my game and played well and, you know, didn't give her any opportunity at all, any openings. 

Q.  Did you see Venus' outfit yesterday, what she played in?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: Yeah. 

Q.  What was your opinion?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I don't have any opinion about it. 

Q.  Caused some stir, didn't it?

JENNIFER CAPRIATI: I guess so.  I don't know right now.  I'm just concentrating on my game and myself and that's it.
