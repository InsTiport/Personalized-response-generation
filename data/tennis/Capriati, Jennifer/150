 Q.   Jennifer, how did this compare with your first round
match?  Especially, the first set?

 JENNIFER CAPRIATI:  Well, I didn't dig myself in a hole today.
And I thought it went all right.  I played well sometimes and
then -- the whole match I kind of felt a little unfocused; not
really playing with a rhythm.  So I thought it was an all-right
match, I mean, the way I played.

 Q.   The way the crowd came in late because of the lateness
of the Lendl match, did that bother you?  The crowd was coming
in so late.

 JENNIFER CAPRIATI:  No.  I mean, it is -- no.

 Q.   You lost a service break at the end, I think, or near
the end.  Were you getting tired, or was she just getting stronger?

 JENNIFER CAPRIATI:  No, I wasn't getting tired.  It just was
just hard for me to close that match out.  I think I just lost
concentration there, and kind of played a little -- a couple of
easy shots.  It wasn't because I was tired, it was because I wasn't
really that focused.

 Q.   Are you going to stick around to watch J. C.?

 JENNIFER CAPRIATI:  I don't know.  Probably.  I will probably
watch him in the lounge.  I wouldn't come out.

 Q.   Thank you.
