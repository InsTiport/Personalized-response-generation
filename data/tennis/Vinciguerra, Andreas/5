 ATP: Questions for Andreas.  
 
Q. You came pretty close there. Did you think you were going to have a big victory?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yeah, it was not that close. I had a few chances in the second
set, but Pete was too good.  
 
Q. Did you think he was ill? He looked a little sluggish. Did you notice if he was ill
or something?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I don't know. I don't really know. I didn't see it. I don't think
so. I don't know.  
 
Q. What makes him so tough?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: He has a very good volley. Of course his serve. His serve is
unbelievable. His second serve is very hard and first serve is harder. I mean, he's a
great player.  
 
Q. Are you well-known in Sweden yet? You're rising quickly in the rankings. 
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Maybe, I don't know. I don't think so, not yet. Maybe in the
future.  
 
Q. Who are your idols from the days of Swedish tennis?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Before it was Edberg and Larsson. They were my favorite Swedish
players before.  
 
Q. Did you find Pete trying to make a bigger effort in the third set to get on your
backhand side?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yeah, I think maybe a little bit. Pete played unbelievable in the
third set. 
 
Q. The backhand cross-court at breakpoint, were you perhaps leaning toward the backhand
side not expecting that shot?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yeah. I thought he's just going to put the ball in the court. Then
he made a good winner. Shit happens (laughter).  
 
Q. Is that a Swedish phrase? How do you say that in Swedish? 
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: (In Swedish.)  
 
Q. When you play Davis Cup, will you be tempted to play for Italy because of your
father or Swedish Davis Cup?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: No, I'm going to play for Sweden. I'm born in Sweden. I live in
Sweden. I'm going to play for Sweden. Maybe Italy (laughter).  
 
Q. Do you speak any Italian?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: A little bit, poco.  
 
Q. What would it have meant to you today if you could have pulled the match out and
beat the best player of our era?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I mean, I don't know. I don't really know. If I had won the match,
it's going to be the victory unbelievable if I can beat a player like Sampras. 
 
Q. Against Pete, is there any way to prevent shit from happening?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I don't know. I don't really know.  
 
Q. Have you actually practiced with Edberg, met with him or talked to him?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I talked with Edberg, but I've never practiced with him.  
 
Q. Who do you practice with mostly?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Mostly I practice with the guys in my club. 
 
Q. Which is where?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: In Malmo.  
 
Q. Do you remember anything that Stefan said to you?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Just he told me to keep on working.  
 
Q. A couple of times you slammed the ball away. Did you have a temper as a junior
player? The crowd whistled when you slammed the ball away. 
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Sometimes I'm angry. When I was younger, I was more crazy than
now. 
 
Q. Does that anger come from your Swedish side or your Italian side?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I think Italian side. 
 
Q. Can you tell us what your father does? It says that he makes pizzas, one says he's a
pizza chef. 
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: He has his own restaurant in Sweden. 
 
Q. In Malmo?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yes. 
 
Q. What's it's called?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Strand Golan. 
 
Q. Is it popular?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: The restaurant is not open in winter, just summertime.  
 
Q. You work there?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: No. 
 
Q. Does he make good pizzas?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yeah, the best.  
 
Q. If you keep on losing to Sampras, do you think you'll have to go back and work in
your father's restaurant?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: I don't hope so.  
 
Q. What's his name?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Giuseppe.  
 
Q. Are you a hockey player?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: Yeah, I like hockey, but I'm not a hockey player. 
 
Q. Bandy?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: You mean?  
 
Q. Do you play that?
 
 ANDREAS VINCIGUERRA: A little bit in Sweden. I like hockey more than bandy.
