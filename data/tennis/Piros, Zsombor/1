Z. PIROS/Y. Oliel
4-6, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That's quite the magic trick?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Maybe, yes.
Q. Come back from one set down.  Talk a little bit about that.
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Yes, I was down one set to love.  He was leading in the whole set.  It was, yeah, 6-4.
I was in trouble, I know that.  I just thinking about how I get back.  My serve is not working, like, during the week.  It doesn't come during the match.  It was simply bad.
I think it was my best match mentally.  I was focused all the match.  That's why I won, I think.
Q. What does it feel like to be a Grand Slam champion?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: I don't know yet because I'm not realized.  Maybe it need time.  I need time to realize that.
I was be honest.  After the first set, I lost my believe a little bit.  So, yeah.  It was my first one, first main draw won in the Grand Slam.  I still surprise myself with this win.
Q. The decisive break was in the third set, at 3-2.
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Yeah, 3-2 I break him.
Q. What happened in that game?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Whew, I don't know.  I don't play good shots.  I think today he was better.  I will be honest.  He was the attacker like most the time.  I was the defender a few times.
He missed that, I think.  I tried to do pressure on him and make good returns.  I think that was my best return game, yeah.  I think he just realized that I'm closer to the win, and that's why he just thinking about that.  I think he was nervous.
Q. He had a lot of fans out there.  Did that make you nervous?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Some people said it's, like, not good for him because he can't concentrate during the match.  But I felt really excited.  It helped me a lot, so very, very lot.
Q. How will you celebrate?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: I don't know because I will go to the Davis Cup like a junior player.  I don't play, but I will celebrate on the Davis Cup.
Q. Where is that?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: Czech Republic [sic].  Bratislava.
Q. Have you checked your phone to see who has sent messages to you?
ZSOMBOR PIROS: No.  I will switch, like, in half hour, yeah.
