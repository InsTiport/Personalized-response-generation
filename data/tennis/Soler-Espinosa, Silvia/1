THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how exciting that was for you this week.   And then also at the end of the match, that tiebreak was very back and forth, too.   
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   I'm very happy the way we played through all the week, from every match to different match we improved day‑to‑day.   
We matched very good.   It's only our second time playing together.   I played two finals this year, so I had a feeling what's going to go on in my mind, so I was just preparing to be calm and play the best as I can.   I think it work out really good today.   
Yeah, these matches, you never know.   In tiebreak you can play two, three balls good, then the other players play five balls good.   But you still need to be all the time focused and fight for every ball.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about winning your first event.   
SILVIA SOLER‑ESPINOSA:   Yeah, for me was so exciting to win the first title.   It was the third final for me this year:   one in singles, one doubles.   To win this tournament, you know, this is amazing tournament.   With her, we had such a good week, very good week together.   So I'm so happy.   
This is very good for me for the rest of the season.   
   
 Q.   Did you find that you were able to get in sync quickly when you started playing together this week or was it hard to adjust?  
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   No, I think we didn't have problems.   
SILVIA SOLER‑ESPINOSA:   No.   
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   Even last week we had a tough draw in Cincinnati, but we played good.   We were happy with our game.   As I said before, in this tournament every match we improve some things.   We play good.   
   
 Q.   How did the two of you come together?   This is your second event.   
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   I think it was in Bastad when I won the tournament in singles, I was looking for somebody.   We talked and agreed to play here.   So that's it.   
   
 Q.   US Open, too?  
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   No.   I play with different partner, the one I played in Bastad, with another Spanish girl, Torro.   
SILVIA SOLER‑ESPINOSA:   I'm playing with Watson there.   
ANDREJA KLEPAC:   For me main draw US Open, the signing was two weeks ago, something like this, one week.   But good.   We are looking forward for the next tournaments, to play some tournaments more together, of course.   
   
 Q.   When you went down 7‑5, you hit the ball, were frustrated.   Were you worried at that point?  
SILVIA SOLER‑ESPINOSA:   Yeah, is like what she said.   Sometimes you play good, sometimes you lose.   Yeah, I was little bit not feeling so good, feeling little bit the pressure.   
We spoke and we said, Okay, we are here because we enjoy all the week.   We are trying to be aggressive.   Let's continue playing the same.   Let's enjoy the final.   That's the most important.   
Then everything comes.
