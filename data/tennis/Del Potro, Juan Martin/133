J. DEL POTRO/A. Clement
  6-3, 6-1, 6-2

 Q. That's your first time on grass since Wimbledon last year. It looked pretty impressive to me. Were you pleased? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I had a good start in this Wimbledon. Clement is a good player. He knows how can you play in this surface. He did quarterfinals last year and was very tough for first time against him. I didn't read much, I did everything, serves, volleys, returns, and it was more easy than I was thinking before the match.

 Q. How was your preparation for Wimbledon? How long have you been practicing on grass? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: For a week. I was sick five days at home, and then I started to prepare this tournament in Argentina. But I practiced for a week, like eight days or nine days.

 Q. In Argentina on grass?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes.

 Q. You don't have any grass courts, do you? Is it more like on a cricket ground? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: It's very new thing in Argentina, playing in grass court. We have just two or three grass courts there, but they are good courts where we can practice for sure. 

 Q. How do you like grass to play on? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I prefer hard court for sure, but sometimes it's fine, you play here, and I want to learn play this surface. I don't know if I can win this tournament someday, but I'm trying. I want to improve my game in this kind of surface. 

 Q. What advantage is being so tall to you on grass with the serving? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: With the serve, my movements, my volleys, I think I have an advantage over small players. But sometimes could be difficult to move or to play slow balls. But now I'm doing good, so I have to win the same way. 

 Q. You're playing Lleyton Hewitt next? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes.

 Q. Have you played him before?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I never played him. Will be very tough.

 Q. Is it an exaggeration to say you might be starting to fall in love with Wimbledon or get more interested in it? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, of course. If I be here, it's because I have a chance to do a good tournament. When I go into the court I will always think in the victory and do my things. Now I have a very good player in front of me, but I have my weapons, I have my games, and I am confident with that and try to beat him.
