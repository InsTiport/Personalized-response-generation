THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel?   I mean, you won in Basel, in Switzerland.   Not too tired?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, I feel tired, but this tournament is so good.   It's a big tournament, and I'm ready to do my best like in Basel and Vienna.   
I play really well today.   Tomorrow I have a difficult match against a French guy, but also I'm glad with my success that I'm looking forward with this tournament, too.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the surface?   Some say it's slower than it used to be.   
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, but it's similar than Basel.   I like the court.   I don't have any problem.
