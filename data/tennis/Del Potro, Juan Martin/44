THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How is your wrist feeling right now?   Are you dealing with everything?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I hope I will be better these days without competitions.   I will have a big rest for my wrist, and that's important to be ready and be 100% in my next tournament.  
   
 Q.   Has that been bothering you throughout the course of the year since or since the US Open?   
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, sometimes is bothering me, but sometimes I can manage it, my pains, but wasn't today.   
I think he deserved to win, and it's okay.  
   
 Q.   How much did the rain delay affect your game?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, we have a big delay, big stop, but doesn't affect my game.   I think I come to the court again try to be aggressive, but I made a lot of mistakes, too many [] efforts with my forehand.   And I start like the second match one set down, so was really close for me, but I need to work hard.  
   
 Q.   Do you think there was any sort of, you know, letdown or fatigue from such a big week?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Sorry?   
   
 Q.   Do you think there was any mental letdown or physical fatigue from having such a big week in Indian Wells?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, I like this tournament.   I was excited to play here, but, you know, just a bad day and he play really well.   He took the chance to beat me tonight, and I think that's it.  
   
 Q.   How familiar are you with Tobias?   Have you played him much or are you familiar with his game?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, no, I never played against him until today.   But he's a good player, of course.
