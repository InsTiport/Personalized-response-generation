  6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. The way that guy was on the court, was that distracting at all?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, of course. Is too difficult play against Koellerer, because you never know what he gonna do after the point.   
 But I was so focus with my game, I always try to do my play. Sometimes I was nervous and I feel the pression, but after I did a good job.   
  
  Q. Djokovic said a few weeks ago that with all these great players coming around maybe he came around at the wrong era. Do you feel that way?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, my feeling is I have very good players from me to the No. 1. For sure, Roger, Rafa, Murray, they are two or three step more than me. I working hard every day hard to be like them.   
 But if I play for many years in this level, then they gonna retire and I gonna be much better, so...
