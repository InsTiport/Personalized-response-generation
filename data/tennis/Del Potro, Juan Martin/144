  J. DEL POTRO/K. Nishikori  
6-3, 6-4, 6-3  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. I'm not going to ask you how you feel this time, but did you worry at any time in the beginning when you were down Love-3 and then in the second set when he broke to you get to 5-4, were you cornered at all about the possibility of the match getting away from you?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Whew, no.   
  
  Q. Big question.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I was thinking about my physic. He was tired, too. So he start better than me. But after I broke, very soon, his serve and then I start to play my game and it was a little easier.   
 But I did my shot, my game, and finally I won the match in three sets.  
  
  Q. So now are you not as tired? You said you couldn't move anymore the other night, do you feel more refreshed, like you're ready to go on?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, I feel better. I played in two hours I think. I don't know. But tomorrow I have my day off to recovery for Wednesday, so I hope -- it will be good for the next match.  
  
  Q. Any preference? Right now I think Murray is ahead.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I lost against both.   
  
  Q. When you think of having won 22 straight matches, what goes through your mind?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Nothing. I just thinking in that match I concentrate to win Nishikori and that's it. I don't think in the other tournaments or the other matches. I just thinking in the moment what I'm doing and that's it.   
  
  Q. How much did you know about Nishikori before this tournament or before the match?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, he's a very good player. He has a good future. But today he doesn't play too good, but he did a very good tournament.   
 I'm happy to be in the quarterfinals, but it's good tournament for him, also.   
  
  Q. Nishikori told us that you guys played when you guys are 13 or 14. Do you remember that?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. He was very small.   
  
  Q. So how tall were you back in...  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. I don't remember too much.   
  
  Q. So you won match?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, of course.
