 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Last match you beat Nikolay. What do you think was the reason for your loss tonight?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, he play very good tennis. I never see the match. I was confused with my hit. I was move slowly with my movements. That's it. I play against the No. 5 in the world, so the match is always tough.   
 But I'm happy because I go to Argentina and I have another good things to play the next week.   
  
  Q. There's one victory between you and the semifinal of your first Masters Cup. How would you describe your first experience here in Shanghai?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: It was fantastic. I'm very happy to play my first Masters Cup. I know these tournaments are very complicated for every player. That's a good experience for me, for my career.   
 I just need experience to play better the next Masters Cup. I need time to get it. I'm happy anyway.   
  
  Q. I saw you a couple years ago in Chile playing futures. I saw you have the chance to be a top player like you are right now. What do you think this year made the change in your career?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I'm living a dream. When I was young I think about this moment, I be top 10, I play my first Masters Cup. It's like a dream, you know.   
 But I want more. I want to be better in a few years. This is the moment where I'm living now. I need to work hard to be better because they are stronger than me. That's it.   
  
  Q. People will say you need to face more challenges on the big stages like this to prove you're a top player. How do you take this kind of comment?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, the people are talking too much sometimes. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. But I'm happy with my season. I beat many players, like Ferrer, Gasquet, Roddick, Tommy Haas, many good players.   
 Now some people start talking bad about me. But that's the tennis life. We live with that comment, so I don't care about that.   
  
  Q. I know this match is just over, but have you thought at all about how you're going to now get back to Argentina and what your preparations might be for Davis Cup?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, we leave tomorrow. I'm arriving Saturday night in Argentina, and I have four days to recovery and to prepare the Davis Cup. Will be the last two matches in my year - maybe the best important matches. So I want to be in good shape to beat Spain.   
  
  Q. How do you comment about the captain already announce the Argentinian team.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I come to holidays here.   
  
  Q. How do you comment your opponent Spain without Nadal in the final?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, Feliciano, Verdasco, Ferrer are very good players. I don't know, what can I say? I just want to beat Spain. Is always better play against No. 5 or top 10 and not No. 1 in the world.   
 But we will see what could happen next week.   
  
  Q. Could you predict the champion in this Masters Cup?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Murray (smiling).   
  
  Q. Why?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: 'Cause my friend (laughter).
