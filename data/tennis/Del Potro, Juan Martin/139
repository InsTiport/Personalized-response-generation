  6-3, 6-4, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. People talk approximate the big four players at the moment. You're behind them. Do you feel you can get into that group, that you're good enough yet?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I cannot be there yet. I need improve a lot my serve, my volley. But I need time also. Maybe some time, a few months I can be there. 

 Q. So you think you're headed in that direction?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, of course. I'm in a good way. I beat good players last year. I won Auckland last week. 
 I'm in a good way.
