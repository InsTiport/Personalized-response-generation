  6‑3, 7‑5, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you talk about your match today.   Can you talk about the way you're playing in the tournament?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yes, I play good match.   Is not easy when you play with friends or players from Argentina, but the match was okay. 
I have many match points, but he made big serves and he play really, really well until the last point. 

Q.   Your next match is against Andy Roddick.   This is his last tournament as he's announced.   Do you prepare any differently for that mentally going into that match?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No.   I will prepare like always. 
I know this is special, this day, for him, but I'm doing my job.   I will trying to be focused on my match and doing my things, my shots. 
The match is going to be very tough.   But, anyway, if I play in high level, will be tough for both players. 

Q.   What do you expect the atmosphere to be like on Tuesday? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Big atmosphere.   The crowd loves Andy here and they have respect to me, so will be a fantastic show to the players and to the fans also. 

Q.   Is it a factor in the match when Andy has the whole crowd on his side or do you tune it out?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, no, because they have respect to me, and also Argentinian fans come to watch me.   I don't know if all crowd will be with him. 
But, anyway, I like to play in these kind of matches.   Is nice for me.   But I will like to win and I will try to do my best tennis. 

Q.   I believe you were having trouble with your wrist in Cincinnati.   Is everything okay?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, perfect.

Q.   How about the knee today? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, I did a bad movement, but nothing dangerous. 

Q.   The shot that he hit that bounced off the net post, have you ever had that happen to you before?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, never.   Was unbelievable point, really important point. 
But you can see if the ball doesn't hit the post maybe he get the winner, so I got lucky to play my forehand and then to win the point.
