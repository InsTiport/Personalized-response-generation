THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell me if your height is an advantage for playing tennis or a disadvantage?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, I think is an advantage.   I'm very confidence with my serve, with my size, with my movements, and my size help me to serve or to find different ways of my serves.   
And I think all the tallest players are very dangerous in this kind of surface.   
   
 Q.   Why don't you play more serve‑volley or go more often to the net?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   To the net?   I like to make winners on the baseline.   
   
 Q.   Is your volley not so good?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I'm working on my volley, but I'm confidence playing on the baseline with forehands and backhands.   But I know the way to beat the top guys is going to the net all the time, but I'm not playing against them yet.   
   
 Q.   But your plan for the future is to go more to the net?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, could be.   Yeah.
