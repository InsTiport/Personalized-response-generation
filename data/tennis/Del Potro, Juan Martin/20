R. BAUTISTA AGUT/J. Del Potro
  4‑6, 6‑3, 5‑7, 6‑4, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How much did you know about him coming into this match?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I know him very well.   I think he play a great match during the four hours.   It's tough when you play very high level during four hours.   Tough to beat the opponent.   I was close. 
But in every moment what I have, he play unbelievable shot.   In breakpoint down, he serves well.   He made winners with forehands, backhands, and he play always to the line very often during the match. 
When you don't have that little lucky on your side, it's another thing negative to play.   And I think he did really well. 

Q.   You came here as one of the top favorites in a tough section of the draw.   Is this tournament unlucky for you?   You haven't produced your best tennis here before. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I like the tournament.   I think this year the courts are faster than years ago.   For Bautista's game is much better. 
But I'm still confidence playing this tournament.   I think sometimes the favorites lose very early in a Grand Slam, like Federer in Wimbledon or Rafa, and then other ones in the US Open.   Here is my chance to get out very early in the tournament. 
But the season just started.   I will try to be positive for the rest of the year. 

Q.   Did the delay because of the heat today distract you?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, no.   I think for all the players is tough to play with this weather.   We have lucky to play a night session.   It was really hot anyway, but doesn't affect to play. 

Q.   What did you do during the delay? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I just waiting for my match.   They move some matches before our match in our court.   But we were waiting the match at the locker rooms.   It was fair for both player. 

Q.   With the Australian Open coming so early in the season, do you think maybe you need more time to get prepared, more tournaments to get your confidence going?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, no.   I think is not nothing dangerous.   I mean, just lost match.   He play really well.   That's it. 
I need to keep working.   I already won the tournament last week, and that give me confidence to improve my game. 
But this kind of match also help me to learn something, and I will try to take my positive things about this match and change the negative to improve my game. 

Q.   Is it at all tough playing a tournament, making it all the way to the final a week before a slam?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, but I like to play in Sydney.   When I reach semifinals at the Roland Garros, I play Dusseldorf, and I got very early to my first round in French Open.   Before the US Open 2009 I play Washington, then I play MontrÃ©al. 
But is normally my schedule.   I like to play before a big tournament.   But it's just a tennis match and that's it.
