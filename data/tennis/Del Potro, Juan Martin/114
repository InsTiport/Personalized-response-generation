 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Apart from the win, what did you like most about your game tonight?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I really showed the crowd, the people was so exciting all the time. We played very good match.   
 I think I have many good things right for the next match.   
  
  Q. With the exception of the US Open which you won in five sets, how does this compare with the other five-setters you played?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. The time was similar, I think. I play different player. Blake is too fast. He play very strong with his forehand. He never miss easy points, easy forehand.   
 It's very difficult to keep trying, keep going. You have to be focused every point, every time, and try to take your chance. I had my chance in the last set.   
  
  Q. How were you feeling at the end of the third set? What were you thinking?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, just keep trying, you know. It's a long match. Here playing five sets, you can lose last two sets and you still have with chance. That's what happen tonight. I was trying every game with my serve. Then when I had the opportunity to broke his serve, sometimes I did, sometimes not.   
 But I think I have very good things to keep with me for the next match.   
  
  Q. You had the trainer out in the fifth set. Are you okay?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. Well, we play a very hard match. Obviously we both needed the trainer many times. But I'm okay.   
  
  Q. James did say that he wasn't really happy playing two matches in two days. He would have preferred to play Monday night late. What were your thoughts?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, was tough for him play two days in a row, five-set matches. Of course, is difficult. Maybe I had a little lucky because I play on Monday not too long the match.   
 But he did a very good job today. I don't know. The match goes with me. But he play very good tennis.   
  
  Q. James said the second-serve ace you had at 2-1 was possibly the turning point. Did you feel that as well?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, I was thinking to do my best serve, and I did. I had a chance to close the match in 6-5 serving. He play a great game. I miss all my first serves, so I was a little nervous.   
 But in the end I was so focused trying to break his serve, and I did in the last game, so...   
  
  Q. What do you think about your next opponent, Florian Mayer?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I play with him last year. He's a good player, of course. He beat Troicki. Maybe he's playing very good tennis. I hopefully be ready for next fight. I don't know, maybe I can play three hours better for my physical.   
  
  Q. How is your wrist?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I'm okay. Thank you.   
  
  Q. No pain?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: A little bit. But I can play.
