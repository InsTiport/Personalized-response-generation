 F. MAYER/J. Del Potro
  6-2, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Was there any residue effects from the long match, your first-round match, today?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't think so. Mayer plays better than me. He has more confidence. But it's normal. I am very far to my good game again, but I did my best. It was shorter, but I tried.   
  
  Q. What's the most frustrating thing? Is it timing? Getting your eye again? Fitness? After a long break, what's the hardest thing?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, everything is tough after long, long time. But if I'm here it's because I want to play. I want to try again. That's what I'm thinking every day. I don't want to feel bad, you know.   
 Last year was very bad year for me, and now I'm okay. I am in good shape. I don't have any problems with my physics. I'm still trying.  
  
  Q. Did you struggle with the heat a bit today?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no, no. This kind of match maybe you don't have many things to take because he plays better than me. He has a very strange game. He has a good slice, very good dropshots. I can never feel good in the game. But that's for him.   
 He played better, and that's it. Now I have three days to be in good shape for Melbourne. That's what I want. I'm very happy to be here in Sydney since one year. I really want to say thank you to the tournament to trust in my game and to give me a wildcard.  
 Of course I want to be here next year, but in better shape.  
  
  Q. What are the positives you take out of your first tournament back?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I have many things. I beat Lopez in my first match, and today I play against one very good player. I lose, but I'm in the competition again. That's important for my future.   
  
  Q. Your projected ranking, will you use that in Melbourne?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes.  
  
  Q. You will?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. If I don't use, I cannot play. (Smiling.)  
  
  Q. You didn't think of asking for a wildcard?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, because my protection finishing soon, so I need to use.   
  
  Q. If you do get a win at Melbourne Park, would you feel comfortable stepping up again from your game previously? Is it something you feel confident being able to back up and play two games in two or three days?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I think so. I need hours and hours into the court. I hope play a good tennis in Melbourne. Maybe couple of match will be better for my next tournaments. I will try. I can play good tennis one day, but the next day play bad.   
 But it's normal. If I don't have a lot of the matches in my body, could happen.   
  
  Q. Did you get more than you expected out of this week in Sydney?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Of course I want to play and win a tournament. When you lost, it's hard, you know.  
 But now it's different. I have different sensations. I lost, but I have another tournament in three days. I'm in good shape. I have my wrist in good shape. That's good.
