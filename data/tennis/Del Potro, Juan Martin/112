  5-7, 6-4, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You've had some very tough matches leading up to today's game. Did that affect you at all? You looked a little tired. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, but this is normal. We play hard match, five sets again. Marin is playing a great tennis. 
 I think he did better than me and he won. 

 Q. What do you think the difference was? Where did he get you? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, just the serve in the end. You know, after four hours, you have to focus. And he broke me very soon in the fifth. Then I had my chance in last game. I miss a forehand. 
 But he play very good. 

 Q. Did you run into one of the courtside cameras at one stage?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No.

 Q. What about your wrist and foot, those factors today?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: My whole body. 
 Well, I will go home and I will see the doctors there. I need little rest to recovery and be in good shape for next tournaments. 

 Q. He's in his second major quarterfinal in a row. Do you think he's lifting parts of his game in certain moments? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He's playing very well. He won last week. He's beating everyone. 
 I think he has the opportunity to keep going. He will play a quarters here against GonzÃ¡lez or Roddick. He can beat both of them. So I wish good luck. 

 Q. There would have been a lot of extra pressure on you, being a reigning Grand Slam champion. Do you think that weight will be lifted before your next major?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I really enjoyed that pression. The crowd is unbelievable with me. They support me every match, every point. I was down in every match, and they help me to keep fighting, like today. I really like it, that pression.
