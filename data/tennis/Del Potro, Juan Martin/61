M. LLODRA/J. Del Potro
  6‑4, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please the title in Vienna, the title in Basel, was this week too much for your body? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I think he play really well today.   He deserve to win the match.   He was really confident with his serves and volleys and I couldn't play my game.
He was aggressive than me and he tooks all the opportunities to break my serve, and that's it. 

Q.   And no physical issue at all all the week?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, I'm a little tired, but it's normal.   I was playing few matches, but he deserve for today.
I'm not going to take away nothing from his victory, you know. 

Q.   Now Djokovic is out; Federer didn't come here; you're out.   What do you think that means for the tournament, a Master 1000, at the end when all the big names are out?   Do you think they need to change the date of the tournament? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Well, they are normal players.   They can win and they can lose every time, so maybe other players are playing much better than him and than me also.
But they are the favorites.   I just be part of the rest of the players, and I think they deserve to beat all of us.   Llodra made an unbelievable match today and he can win the tournament also.

Q.   London coming on Monday is not playing a part at all?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I can tell you that my sensation is it's a big tournament.   I was try, but I felt ready to play this tournament because it's so good, and if you do well here, you can start the season more, you know, young.
