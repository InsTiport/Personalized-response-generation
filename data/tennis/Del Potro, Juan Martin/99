 Q. Are you satisfied with your game today, and is there more to come?

 But for start, is a nice match. 

 Q. Was it tough or... 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. He's very fast. He made many slices, dropshots. I'm not top player, so sometimes is going to be difficult. But I served really well today, and I feel confidence with my game. 

 Q. How does it feel being back at Wimbledon after the two-year gap?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Really nice. I miss all the tournaments. This one is one of the best of the world. And I came here many days before for be ready for this tournament, trying to learn on grass. Need to improve my volley, my serve, everything. 
 If not this year, maybe the next one. But I'm trying.

 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no, no. We are professional. Here in London, everything with the weather can happen. But we want to play in every way in every surface, and we are here for that. 

 Q. Is it fair to say that you looked a bit nervous today?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Today? You think so? 

 Q. Yes, I think so. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Maybe. Maybe, because he's very dangerous. But I was focused with my serve. Here on grass, if you have a good serve, take your chance, you have many opportunities to win.
