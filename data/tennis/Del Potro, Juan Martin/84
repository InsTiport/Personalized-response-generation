THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You had a very strong match today.   Talk about how good you're feeling in this round compared to the previous two rounds. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I'm feeling really well today.   I played I think the best match of the year.   Only four matches in this year, but I was really confidence with my forehand every part of the match.
I served much better than the last two matches, and my game is still improving.   So it's a good signal for the next round. 

Q.   I wanted to ask about an incident in the first set with the bugs on the court.   Were you trying to help clean them up with the towel? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah. 

Q.   What happened? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   The court just close to the line was so wet and I need the help.   The ball boy come with the towel and I made a little job with him.   It was fine.

Q.   What was the joke?   We couldn't understand on the television. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, I did with the towel his face.   What, you was watching the Tomic match?
