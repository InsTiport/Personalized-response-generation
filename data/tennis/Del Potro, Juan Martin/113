 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Did you expect such a tough match?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, of course. He beat Troicki in the second round. For sure he did to play good tennis.   
 Today, especially in the second set, I felt very confused with my game. But after improve a little bit. And then in the end I finish the match playing a very good points.   
  
  Q. Pat Rafter said you could be the next man to dominate men's tennis in the world. What do you think of that?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. He knows about this sport. But I don't want extra pression. I have too much pression with me. So thank you to Patrick, but I have a long way to be the next No. 1 or to be better.   
  
  Q. You played Florian Mayer last year as well. How was it different from last year?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I think he's playing better this year. His forehand improve a lot. His serve also. Well, he was focus until the last point. Maybe the last match when he felt maybe confused with the game, he goes south for two or three games. And today doesn't happen.   
 I think he could have a very good season.   
  
  Q. When you come back to your hometown, how do people treat you?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Normal. I feel very comfortable in my city. I can do whatever I like. I know it is a small town and we know every person. So I walking around, I say hi to everyone.
