J. DEL POTRO/F. Verdasco
  6-4, 3-6, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Your next match is against Roger. The last meeting you had with him was the US Open finals. If you compare your form there to today, what's the difference or are you on the same level? How would you say that? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, we're playing different surface, different moment. We are fighting for last two semis. I have to play better than US Open if I want to win. 
 But is good chance to advance to semis. 

 Q. What especially pleased you about your game today? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I served much better than the other match. I was very focused in the important moments, especially in the tiebreak. And I take my opportunities. That's what I have to do against Roger. 

 Q. Clearly it's a big win for you. You want to progress. A little bit of nerves near the end when you were leading 4-2 in the third and he came back? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Of course, I feel nervous because if I lose, I go home. 
 But it's important, the victory of today, to get confidence. I hope my best tennis against Roger. 

 Q. What did you keep from the final of the US Open? What did you learn that day about yourself? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, many things. But I don't know when it happen. Thursday against Roger, the match will be completely different. He's playing like the US Open, maybe I play -- I do many, many heroes [sic]. But I will try to beat anyway. 

 Q. Apart from winning today, what have you enjoyed most about your time in London so far? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I'm happy to be here. I have friends. I spoke with Tevez last night. Maybe he come tonight to watch Roger. Is more interesting than my match (laughter). 
 But I'm happy to be here. 

 Q. What did Tevez say to you? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Try to win. 
 No, we are friends. Maybe he's coming to next match.

 Q. How long have you been friends?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Many years ago. 

 Q. How did you feel coming back two days after the Andy Murray match? Were you tired at all?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I play three sets again, but I feel a little tired, but I can play more matches. Especially against Roger. I need the victory if I want to be in semis, so I will fight like today.

 Q. You feel you'll be a hundred percent for playing Roger?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know what I will feel on Thursday. But I hope my best. 

 Q. Do you get the sense that a lot of people in this country, of course they appreciate what you did against Federer, but the recognition level of you as a player has gone up? In Britain, they appreciate you, they want to speak to you in the street; is there a sense of that? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, yeah, that's change in my life. But is beautiful. I have to learn about these things. For the future is good at this moment.
