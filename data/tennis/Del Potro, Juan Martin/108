M. BAGHDATIS/J. Del Potro
  6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How is your wrist? Anything to worry about there?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No. Just for safety because I did a bad movement on the serve, and that's just be safer for the rest of the match. 

 Q. What are your thoughts about the match, how you're progressing with your game?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, is difficult to say now how I'm feeling. Marcos playing very well since a couple years ago. 
 Every player for me at this moment, it's very tough. But I'm still improving. I'm playing better than Sydney. I think that's positive for the next tournaments.
