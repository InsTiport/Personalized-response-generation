J. DEL POTRO/F. Serra
  6‑4, 7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How was it for you to kind of shift your preparation from Nalbandian to this player that you probably hadn't seen much of?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   It's not easy because I was thinking about six days playing against one player and then last night they changed.   It's not easy, but anyway, anything can happen. 
And this morning I wake up thinking about Serra, trying to do my game like always, and the other thing was completely the past.

Q.   How long did it take you to figure him out?   How many games?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Oh, well, he play really well.   He serve well in important moments, but I think I play much better in important moments than him.   Basically in the tiebreak, in the second set, and in the end of the match. 
Was a really close match, but I feel good.

Q.   He said there was a challenge in the third set that turned it around for him. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I was serving Love‑15 and he made a good return.   I saw the ball really close to the line and I called the challenge and I have lucky.   I have lucky to won that point. 
But anyways, the match, I was confidence to win this match.
