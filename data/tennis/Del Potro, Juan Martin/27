N. DJOKOVIC/J. del Potro
  6‑3, 3‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Do you think back on that forehand that you missed wide?   Where did the match turn for you?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Could be that moment and also when I missed three forehands in a row in 3‑2 of the third set.   I made an easy mistake with my forehand.   I never expect that on my game. 
But I think we play a good match.   Some mistakes was the difference today.   When I got my chance to break his serve, I miss a passing shot really close, then he took the opportunity in the 3‑2 of the third set. 
He's a really good player to try to come back in the third one.   But I'm still alive.   Now I will have to play better against Roger. 

Q.   Your thoughts for the Federer match on Saturday then? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   It's going to be a decision match for both.   We play in every Masters, the last match of the group, and we always play for something, which is good for be focus and with the high expectations. 
I will try to do my best.   I know for me has been a long season, a lot of matches in the end of the year.   I'm getting tired.   But is the last effort.   Could be the last effort of the year, so I will try to enjoy and do the best I can. 

Q.   Have you recovered your things?   Was it only a rumor you recovered the items stolen in Paris or is it true?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, I don't get anything yet. 

Q.   Federer said the court is slow.   Djokovic said it's fast.   What are your thoughts on the speed?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I would say medium (smiling). 
I like to play indoors court.   I think could be slower than Shanghai.   But in Paris was faster. 
But I think is tough to play long rallies.   As you see, we play three sets today and was less than two hours match.   That's mean the courts are fast. 

Q.   Do you have to adjust when you're playing on a slower surface or do you play the same as Shanghai?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I play the same in every surface:   try to hit good forehands and make winners.
