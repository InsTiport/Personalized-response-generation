J. DEL POTRO/R. Nadal
  7-6, 6-1

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. How does it feel to beat Nadal for the second straight time?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Good. I have a good sensation. I know since many years, Rafa. I'm happy to beat one more time, but I'm happy to see him in the court fighting until the final. You know, is very good for me and for everyone to see his comeback.

 Q. Can you give us your thoughts about Roddick tomorrow?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: A little bit tough. We play couple days ago and was so close, the match. But tomorrow I think could be the same. 
 He has a very good serve and in this surface is very complete. But I will try to do my best, and I will try to be focusing important moments, and that's it.

 Q. Did you get a sense of how Rafa was moving tonight compared to the last time that you played him? Better, worse, about the same? Can you tell?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Same. 

 Q. Same? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Maybe he needs a few matches to feel better, but it's normal with the competition. But I saw his movement was good. 

 Q. It's hard to tell sometimes because you've seen him on clay courts for two months where he moves so differently. It's been a long time since you've seen him on the hardcourts. You might have been one of the last people to see him. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. Of course he can play better in clay court, and he's a specialist of that surface. But in this surface he won in every one and everywhere, so he's a very dangerous player, too. 
 But I think he play more matches, could be tough for me and for everyone.

 Q. What happened in the tiebreaker, do you think, when you were down? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I have a little luck, you know, in the fight to win my lob, backhand lob.
 After that point, I come back to the tiebreaker and I was so focused with my serving at 6-5 and I did an ace. After that I start to play better and more confidence. I take the directions of the point and every time I feel better.

 Q. Do you have a cold?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No. A little bit.

 Q. Can I get your thoughts in Spanish, like on the game, if you don't mind? Is it okay to ask in Spanish? Can you answer in Spanish about your game and your thoughts about the next opponent, please? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: (In Spanish.)
