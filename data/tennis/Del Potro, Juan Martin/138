J. DEL POTRO/G. Muller
  6-7, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Happy with the way you served today? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, of course. Always is good to win the match. I'm happy to be in the 16. So I was try to keep alive in the tournament.

 Q. I think you only had four breakpoints throughout the four sets. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, well, he served very good. In important points he made good service volleys. 
 I never can do nothing with his serve. Finally I broke his serve in 5-All, and then I close the match with my serve. 

 Q. Are you excited about the prospect of playing Cilic in the next round? 
  JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He's a very good player. He won last week in Chennai, and his game improve a lot. 
 But I have to do my game and just think in my mind and my things and try to do my best. 

 Q. The two of you, many people believe you're the two rising stars in men's tennis. Do you think this will be the first of many meetings against each other?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: We don't know. I don't think about that. If I can't be better, if I lose, I will be happy with my tournament.

 Q. He said that he had played you in the juniors twice and you had beaten him twice. Do you remember those matches?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I remember. But we were younger. Now we have twenty years and the life change too much. So we don't know what can happen on Sunday. 

 Q. You had an excellent 2008. The youngest player to get in the top 10. Is that form carrying on now? Are you playing as well as you were last year?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I'm playing good since last year. But I need to play better if I want to beat Nadal, Federer, Murray, or Djokovic. I'm not going to beat them if I'm still missing breakpoints or missing volleys or whatever. 

 Q. Do tennis writers make too much of rivalries between young people? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I don't like to play against Argentinians. Djokovic, Nadal played many, many times, and hopefully I will play with Cilic many times also. So we start a new promise, and we will see what can I do on Sunday. 

 Q. How good can he be, do you think? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Me or him? 

 Q. Cilic, yeah. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, very good. He has everything to be a good player. His service, his movement, his forehand. He will be top 10, very close.

 Q. How good do you think you could be? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, don't know what can I do. I'm top 10 right now, but I want to be many years in the top.

 Q. Do you think you two are the most capable of breaking in and challenging the top four?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I don't think so. He's playing very good. I'm playing good too, but we never know where could I be in three months, or him. We just have to work and keep improving. 

 Q. Can you talk a little bit your new Davis Cup captain and what you think he brings to the table?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: He's a good person. He has a lot of experience in Davis Cup. We are happy with the captain.

 Q. What do you think he brings to the table? How can he help the team?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't speak too much with him because I don't have time. He's very good. He has good players in his team, so I have to try to win Davis Cup for the first time.
