 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How did you feel in the third set?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: So tired. Well, I felt my chance in the second set, tiebreak second set, and I didn't take them. I was trying until the final, you know, but it was so complicated for me.   
 Andy is a good player. I think he's a very good winner of this tournament.  
  
  Q. Was it just a question of accumulation of a lot of tennis from Washington to here and so many matches, or was it just the sun of today?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, yes. It was very tough for me. I was playing against Andy, I was thinking about my physic, and it was very tough, this match.   
 Otherwise the weather was very hot for me, and I feel -- I feel that, but when I have my chance in the second, I played bad in the important moments, and Andy has very good experience. He's a good winner.   
  
  Q. Physically did you have a shoulder issue?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. Just tired, you know. I not have any problems, but I feel it the matches since Washington. It's normal.  
  
  Q. How close to the top three or four players do you think you are? Do you think you're on the same level with them right now or not?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I don't think so. I need to work hard to be like them. I can play against them, but I need to improve my game a lot if I want to be top four or top two or top one for many years.  
  
  Q. What did you learn from this experience?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: A lot. I never -- I never play a final in Masters, and the crowd and this tournament and everything, it's so good for me and for my future.   
 I'm very happy to be in the final. I lost, but I'm happy. I don't have to think in the past and now see the future.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised that the crowd seemed to be on your side today?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, it was 50 and 50. But when the crowd saw me very tired, it was good.   
 I did my best. I never tire for respect for the crowd and Andy also. I fight until the final, and sometimes you cannot do nothing, and that's what happen in the third set.  
  
  Q. Do you regret at all calling for the trainer in that second set? It seemed to cut the momentum a little bit for you.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I call the trainer because I feel bad, you know. That's was the reason.  
  
  Q. You felt like dizzy or was it your shoulder?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no, my body. I feel a little headache, but it was normal. I was hot, but I don't feel too good with my body. I feel tired.  
  
  Q. Are you sure you will play Cincinnati?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. I fly tomorrow to Cincy, and maybe I will see there what can I do.   
 But I have two days to recover. We play Wednesday. So if I feel good, I will play.  
  
  Q. Did you hear anything the last week or so from Nalbandian or any of the other Argentine players?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no.   
  
  Q. Do you think you could win the US Open? I mean, you played some very high-level tennis. You beat some very good players.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I don't know. I have many players thinking like me, you know. Murray is a great favorite; Roger, Rafa.   
 It's my dream. I want to win that tournament. It's my favorite Grand Slam, and I have chance, but they are very strong, too. So it will be very tough.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your match in Spanish, please.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: (In Spanish.)
