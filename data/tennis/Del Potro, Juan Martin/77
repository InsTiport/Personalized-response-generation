D. FERRER/J. Del Potro
  6‑3, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Was it frustrating in that 1‑All in the second set?   Was that a turning point when you lost your serve and then had a good opportunity to break him back?   Was that where the match turned?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I think.   I'm not glad because I lost, but he made a better match than me tonight.   I think he broke me twice.   That's it.   Then he was really solid in the baseline playing long rallies. 
But I need to work hard if I want to beat him.

Q.   Did it feel a little bit like Davis Cup with the crowd being very excited for both of you guys?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No. 

Q.   Not crazy enough?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   (Shakes head.)
