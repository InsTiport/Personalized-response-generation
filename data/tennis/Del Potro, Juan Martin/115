J. DEL POTRO/M. Russell
  6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You had a few heated exchanges with the umpire. What set it off?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: About the challenge. She say I take too many time to call the challenge, and I try to explain to her I just hit the ball and then see the mark and call the challenge. 
 But she say, You can't do that. That's it. After that, I was disappoint, but is the rules. 

 Q. Seemed like after that your serves got even faster. When you get angry about something, are you able to channel it into that?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, but I can't do that. I had to play same every time. I have to be focused every time. Depends the referee says, the umpire, and the crowd maybe. But I have to be focused every time. 

 Q. How do you feel physically? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, of course, I don't feel hundred percent, but I am feel better than yesterday, and I hope be better for tomorrow, for Wednesday, in my next match. 

 Q. Does it hurt when you play? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: A little bit. After two hours match the pain came and I feel a little bit, but I can play. Of course, if I be here, I want to win matches.
