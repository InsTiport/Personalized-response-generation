    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   It was a very long day and a pretty tough battle.   How did you feel out there?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I felt good because I won the big battle for the first round.   Of course, he's a very tough opponent.   He play so solid on the baseline.   He made a good forehands, backhands.   We play like every time long rallies.   I got to make three or four winners in the same point to win the point.   
    But was really close for me.   I think I was lucky maybe in the fourth set when I come back after being break down.   But I'm okay.   I feel good with my level.   My forehand was good.   My serve improved since the last tournament.   That's important.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the argument you had with him at the changeover, not happy with the medical timeout?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I just asked about the medical timeout because I didn't know how many, how long.   He explained to me then the chair umpire also, and that's it.   
   
 Q.   I was confused about what happened on the call reversal in the tiebreaker.   I didn't understand the ruling on that.   
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't remember.   The linesman, he called it out, and that's with Garcia‑LÃ³pez asked for the challenge.   The balls was in.   The lineman called it out, and he asked for the challenge.   The ball was in, so we replay the point.  
   
 Q.   He was mad because if it was called in originally he would have won the point because your put‑away went wide?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, he called it out.   The same as the last point was similar.   I hit my backhand after he called it out.   
    But in that moment, the ball was in.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you won here four years ago.   You've been through a lot since.   Coming off the semifinal at Wimbledon, is now a better time than ever to get back to the Grand Slam final again?   Do you feel you can do it?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I was close to do it in Wimbledon, but you have really good guys playing much better than me at the moment.   They are so good.   That's the true, you know.   
    I'm trying to getting closer to them in these kind of tournaments, but it's not easy.   It's a long tournament.   I just finish after four hours and a half.   Then I will have Lleyton Hewitt.   It's maybe the tougher opponent without seeding.   
    Is going to be really difficult for me.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're back up to the level you were at in 2009?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't know.   I'm glad with my level at this moment.   I'm 6 in the world.   I think I'm getting closer to the top guys, reaching semifinals in Grand Slams, playing semifinals in the 1000 Masters.   
    That's what I want, just go the far as I can in these kind of tournaments and play the last day against the top guys.   
   
 Q.   When did you find out when you were playing today?   Did they explain to you why you, from Argentina, was playing in the day and Andy Murray who is from Europe was playing at night?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't know.   I think they put the good matches at night (smiling).   
    But, yeah, was a long day for me and for the rest of the players.   We've been at the locker room preparing the match like three, four times a day, then the rains coming again.   
    Sometimes is frustrating, but we are professionals.   Sometimes these things can happen.   In the end, if you win, everything is okay.   
   
 Q.   When yesterday did you learn you were going to play during the day today?  
    JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't remember.   Around 3:00, 4:00 p.m. they told me you going to be the second match after 1:00.   I say it's okay.   Maybe it's strange putting Murray very late on Wednesday.   Sometimes they put second matches on Wednesday, too, second round.   But not this year.   
    Anyway, he will have a day off also and it's okay.
