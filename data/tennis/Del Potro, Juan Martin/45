R. NADAL/J. Del Potro
  4‑6, 6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You were up a set and a break and at the end it's a loss.   Is it very frustrating?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, but I think Rafa deserves to win.   He plays unbelievable for like an hour there.   The last hour of the match he didn't make effort.   He played so solid and put me so far to the baseline and make winners from there. 
But I think I made a good tournament anyway, and Rafa played really well today the second and third set.   He broke me early in the third.   Play against him when the score is down is tougher, you know.   But I was fighting all the time but he won in the end.

Q.   How difficult was it to come back from yesterday's match physically?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, I played three sets against Murray then three sets Djokovic.   But the finals are finals.   You know, they are special, and you get the energy from everywhere to play the finals.   I think of course if he had a day off between matches would be fantastic, but Rafa plays yesterday, also.   The conditions are the same for both players.
I think my body was okay.   Just he played better in the end and he deserved to win.

Q.   What did you say to Rafa in Spanish after the match?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   That he deserved to win today.   I'm so happy for him.   Watching him in this level, he's playing really well.   He already won three tournaments.   He's winning more than everyone after six, seven months.   It's amazing share with him again everything and his team, as well.   I'm very happy for them.

Q.   There were a lot of momentum changes in this match.   He won the first three games and then you won nine of the next eleven and then he won five in a row.   What do you think caused that match to swing so much both directions?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't know.   I think all games are tough because he ‑‑I don't serve really well and every game he has chances to break me.   And also when he was serving I was close to break all the time, and all games was really close and can go for one or for the other.   I think that was the reason of that. 
But I think in the end when I should play my best tennis he was better than me, and that was the key of the match.

Q.   Did he remind you of when he was No. 1, you know, when he was winning all the time?   Was it a very similar feeling?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, yeah.   I think I felt like a very big opening for me.   Like always, like in the past, he's playing so solid, so strong.   He's fast, you know, for play on this surface.
I think he deserve to win the tournament.   He beat very good players here and Indian Wells.   What I say the days before, he's gonna be fighting for the first position very soon.

Q.   You have been away from the circuit for a long time because you were injured.   Tell us how difficult it is to come back. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Very difficult, yeah.   First you have to lose the scare about your problem, and then take matches to feel good.   You can see the matches in ViÃ±a from Rafa and see the difference between them and now is like another player. 
That's takes time to change or to improve.   But he made so quick, so fast. 

Q.   Are you surprised?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, of course.   But I don't know how surprised I am because Rafa can do everything.   Not many players can do that.

Q.   Why do you think Rafa has been able to come back so quickly to his level?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Well, he's very strong mentally.   His game is very good, very strong, very solid.   He has big talent, as well.   His team was working with him every day to be in shape for this tournament after seven months.
What I said, not many players can do that.   Just him or maybe one or two more in the world.   But it's amazing how fast he's recovered the level.

Q.   You beat Djokovic and you beat Murray.   What is the next step for you?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Beat Nadal, beat Federer.   (Laughter.)   Try to beat all of them. 
But I think I made a good tournament, anyway.   Of course I am a little sad for my match of today, but after maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow I will be happy for this tournament and get motivation for the future, for the next one, and be ready, waiting for another chance like I made in this tournament.

Q.   If Nicola in fact gets you in to see the Holy Father, would you be willing to take Rafa with you? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   No, just me.   (Laughter.)   I need it. 

Q.   You're playing Miami? 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, yeah.

Q.   That's always been a good tournament for you.   What are your thoughts on it?   It's a fast turnaround. 
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I'm excited to play Miami.   You know, many Argentinian fans, friends, family, come to watch me there.   It's a very good tournament, as well.   I'm so exciting to be playing there.
But first I need couple of days for recovery, for rest, and I wish to do a similar tournament there like I did here.

Q.   With all the Argentinian and South American fans in Miami, many people call it the Grand Slam of Latin America.   Would you agree with that?
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, yeah.   I think many fans come to watch us around the world.   But basically Miami, Argentinian fans, the facilities to come there are easier, and that's the reason of that. 
But the fans here also make a special tournament, but the Latino‑Americans are more caliente.   (Laughter.)
