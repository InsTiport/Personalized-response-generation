J. DEL POTRO/R. Federer
  6-2, 6-7, 6-3

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. When exactly did you know you had qualified? At what exact moment did you know? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Franco told me I qualified after like 25 minutes after the match, because nobody knows what happen. 
 But, well, I qualified (smiling). 

 Q. Can you sum up your performance against Roger Federer tonight. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I play good tennis today, similar than New York, a little better in some moments of the match. I serve good in important moments. I take my opportunities. That's what I have to do against the best player of the world: take the opportunities and try to play the best tennis. 

 Q. Can you describe your emotions at the end of the match? Must have been a strange sensation to beat Roger Federer but don't know if you qualified. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, it was very strange. But I don't want to talk about that because the people who has to made the numbers to see who qualify, they knows what they did. Now is the past. I'm in the semifinals. I happy for that. But was strange. 

 Q. We saw Carlos Tevez?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, we talk last night. We talk this morning. I know he's gonna come to watch the match. Maybe if I play Saturday night, he will be here. 

 Q. Federer said he didn't feel sorry about all the people that were supportive of Murray. What about you? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I'm sorry? 

 Q. Federer told us he don't feel sorry about all the people supporting Murray. How about you? Do you feel sorry he's not in the game now?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I didn't understand what you say. 

 Q. Do you feel sorry for Murray's supporters?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, this is the sport. Just two players has to qualify. Maybe for the local public is bad to not have the opportunity to see Murray in the semis, but they will see Federer, for sure, and another good players. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on the other group matches tomorrow, possible semifinal opponents?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, all players are playing very good this season. They are very strong. Djokovic for me could be the most dangerous. But Robin has a good serve. Davydenko is so fast. Everyone has good things to play against me. 
 But I will try to play like today. 

 Q. You said you play as well, maybe even better than the US Open. Do you feel it's one of your best matches in your life?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I don't think so. Well, my best match was the final of the US Open. But I feel better again since the US Open, and that's important for the next matches. 

 Q. Do you like the round robin format or is it too confusing for players and spectators?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, it's okay. Is difficult to do these number because Roger, me and Murray won two matches, and unfortunately Murray has to -- he's out. Maybe in the other group, Djokovic win two matches and maybe happen the same. So it's strange for us, but we like it.
