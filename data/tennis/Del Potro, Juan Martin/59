THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did it feel being back on court tonight?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Was really nice for me to come to this court again.   After three years, the crowd was amazing for both players.   They really enjoy the match.   Even if I lose, I can enjoy this week a lot.   
So I'm glad to play in this tournament.   I will try to improve a little bit for my next match.   
   
 Q.   Last time here you lost your first match and qualified for the final.   In this round robin, there's a lot of opportunities still for you.   
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, well, all matches are really tough.   David is playing so well.   He won two tournaments in a row and he's playing with a lot of confidence.   The rest of the players are on a very high level.   
So it's going to be interesting for me.   But anyways, everything can happen.   I am still alive so I will still try to qualify.   
   
 Q.   Were you pleased with the way you fought back in the match?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, I never give it up.   In all the matches, I'm trying to improve all the time.   But David was better in the important moments, like in the end of the match.   He broke me, my serve, playing really well.   He never miss a returns in the last game.   So he takes the chance of the match.   I think that was the key.   
   
 Q.   Your next match is against Janko Tipsarevic.   What are your thoughts on this?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Try to play better than today.   It is going to be difficult match because Janko is a dangerous player.   He moves so fast and he play very, very solid on the baseline.   So it's going to be difficult for me.   
But hopefully I can play better.
