L. HEWITT/J. Del Potro
  6-3, 7-5, 7-5

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What was the problem with your knee, and did it bother you today? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Nothing special. After the return, I slide down, but nothing dangerous. But that was for precaution. 

 Q. Did Lleyton surprise you with the level of his play?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, he play very good. We play a high-level match. I play good, too, but was not enough to beat him. 

 Q. What gave you a problem about his game? What were the problems he caused you?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, is difficult for me playing this kind of surface. And Lleyton has much experience than me. 
 He has many matches here in grass court. He was a champion here. So I need time to learn how can I play on this surface, and that's it. 

 Q. What do you think you need particularly to do better on grass, to succeed on grass?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Everything. I never pass the second round, so I need to improve everything. 

 Q. You were very warm in your congratulations to him at the net. Can I ask what you said?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I say, Congrats. He did a very good match. You know, he's one of my idols. And I say, You are in very good shape again, so I'm happy for you and good luck. 

 Q. Did you think before this match that you had an opportunity against a player who is finding his form again? This was an opportunity for you, wasn't it?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I think so. I have good things to get about this match. I learned little bit playing with him. 
 You know, he never miss a returns when he has a break, and I did many times. So I think that was the difference between me and him. 

 Q. When you say Hewitt is one of your idols, how long have you been aware of him or followed his career?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I start to follow him was when I was young, like 11 years, 12 years. 

 Q. Do you think next year you'll probably play on grass before Wimbledon, lead-up tournaments?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. Depends French Open maybe, if I have time or not. I was sick before this tournament at home. Was a little difficult for me to come early to do a good preparation. 

 Q. Instead of looking for grass courts in Argentina, you know, perhaps you should... 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, we have a good courts.

 Q. Perhaps you should be playing the grass at Queen's or something. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. After French Open, I went home, and I need that time to relaxing, you know, and to be in good shape for this tournament. 
 But no was enough the time.

 Q. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your play today?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know, maybe 8. 

 Q. 8?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, I play good in the baseline, but I did misses with my serve, especially in the breakpoints. Two breaks, three breaks, and that's it, the match, it's over.

 Q. So you are sad?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, a little. 

 Q. At the end of the third set, did you feel, If I can just get this set, I can win this match; it will change?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Maybe. Until the last point, I was thinking that. I broke his serve 5-4 in the third. I was two set down. So everybody was thinking about the match it's over, but I was there until the last point. I don't have the lucky what I have to have to beat him. 

 Q. A bit of the problem with the net at one point?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Exactly (smiling). 

 Q. Having done so well at the French Open, how disappointing is it to go out early here?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: The French and this tournament now is the past. I have many tournaments in the future. Now I need time to recovery, to practice in hard court, and try to finish a good season this year. 

 Q. Do you enjoy London, or are you getting a little bit fed up with going out the second round in Wimbledon?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I like it. I like London. This year we have a very good weather, so the conditions are very nice to play. And I play in Centre Court, Court No. 1, so was very, very good for me. 

 Q. What have you been doing when you haven't been practicing or playing this week?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, has been many things with my coaches, my friends. We cook every day. It's fine for me. 

 Q. When you're not playing tennis, how do you relax?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Sleeping (smiling). 

 Q. How long do you sleep? How many hours do you need to sleep?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Depends. If I go out, maybe 13 hours.

 Q. Does it get easier, this game, this tennis? Does it get easier or more difficult?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: The tennis is difficult for everyone. We have to travel a lot and we have to practice every day. 
 Is very tough, but otherwise is so lovely to be here in this kind of tournament. 

 Q. Is it something you want to carry on for a long time?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes. When I start to play this sport, my goals are be professional, be top 10, be top one. I don't know. Many goals. 
 But now I'm living this kind of life, and it's a little unnormal.
