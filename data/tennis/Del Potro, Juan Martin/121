  7-5, 2-1 Ret.

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. What kind of injury forced you out?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: What? 

 Q. What kind of injury forced you out?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I had this injury in Miami this year, and I don't want to risk for the end of the season. I'm a little sorry, you know. It's a big tournament here in Shanghai, very important for me, but if I want to have a good finish this season, I had to recovery, go home to be in good shape for the last tournaments.

 Q. Some players complain about the schedule too tight for the players, for the professional players. Do you agree with them? And do you think it's a consequence of this schedule?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I don't like to talk here about this. Of course, we have a hard calendar. We play -- it's difficult to play 11 months, high level, you know, but we know they are working in that, so we hope that a good change for the future. But we know it's difficult to change soon, so... 

 Q. What exactly is the injury?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Where? 

 Q. What exactly is it, yeah. 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I spoke with the doctor right now. He say -- well, I had this injury before, so I know what I have. When I feel pain, I need to stop, because maybe it could be dangerous, but... 

 Q. Is it tendinitis? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, the tendon.

 Q. What will you do from here? Will you play in Paris or will you just play London?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I wish play in Paris and Basel, too, but first I go home. I will see the doctors there, and I will try to recovery.

 Q. Is it kind of frustrating that you can't build momentum after the US Open because of something like this?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, no, I feel -- well, I feel tired, of course, but if I came here, it's because I want to play here, you know, especially in Shanghai. They made a good work to change the event, and they are amazing tournament this year. 
 So I would love to win this tournament maybe in the future, but now I have two more tournaments, three more tournaments important in this season. I hope that -- I hope the best for my wrist. Then we will see what happen.

 Q. You said the injury was first a problem in Miami. Has it been a problem during the year?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, yeah. Well, after Miami I need a while to recovery, and maybe I need a while to after here, so -- but I don't think it's something dangerous.

 Q. You said after Miami you needed a while to recover. How long did it take to recover after Miami?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, like a week, at least. Then time to practice again, time to feel strong again, maybe a couple of weeks, but I don't know at this moment.

 Q. Did you have treatment, or did you just rest it and do nothing?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, treatment, rest, and everything. But the doctor knows. I don't know what I have to do with this pain. 

 Q. Back to your injuries, it's muscle or ligament, your wrist? It's muscle or ligament injury? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I really don't know.

 Q. You don't know?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No.

 Q. You have been with the injury for so long time? You don't know what kind it is? You don't know even it's ligament or muscle?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, I don't know. 
 THE MODERATOR: He just said it's tendinitis if you didn't listen to the question before.
