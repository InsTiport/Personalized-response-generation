 J. DEL POTRO/B. Kavcic
  6‑4, 7‑5, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You feel like you're back to some of your best form after the horrible injury?  
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Yeah, almost in my best form.   I think I play much better than my first match, and Kavcic is very dangerous and very faster.  
So I know I should play 100% like today.   I feel confidence with my forehand basically.   So it's important to play safely all the game and play in confidence every time.  
   
 Q.   You won the US Open.   How did you find conditions here in Australia?   You feel they suit your game?   
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   Every Grand Slam are different.   I had good memories here in Melbourne.   I don't know if I closer or far to my best level on 2009, but I'm doing my job, trying to improve my serve, forehand, volleys, everything.  
Then we will see if I can play better or not in the future.   
   
 Q.   How are your confidence levels in general?   Feeling like you're very close to returning to your best?   
JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:   I don't know.   I already won a very tough match.   I want to think in my next round.   Will be against Lu.   He's dangerous also.  
So if I play like today, maybe I have little chance to win.   Even if I lose and play in the same way, I will be happy, too.
