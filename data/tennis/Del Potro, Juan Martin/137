 J. DEL POTRO/M. Cilic
  5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. A tough three sets, and then in the fourth you broke him open. What did you do in that fourth set that was different from the first three?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, the three sets was very tough for both. And in the fourth I broke his serve early, and then I won my serve easier. I think he was tired, or I don't know what happened with him in the fourth set. But the breaks was the key of that set.   
  
  Q. Are you happy with your form? How does it compare with the US Open quarterfinal of last year? Are you playing as well now as you were then?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, of course I'm happy. It's my first time in quarterfinals here in Australia, and I want to be in the semifinals. I know I will play against Berdych or Federer. It will be tough for me, but I can try to beat them.   
  
  Q. You went into today's match the favorite. Do you like being in that position going into a match?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't care. Doesn't matter for me. I just play the game. Against Roger or Berdych, they will be the favorite. Nothing change for the game.   
 But always is good be in good shape or play against some players behind you.
