J. DEL POTRO/R. Soderling
  6-7, 6-3, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Can you give us your thoughts on tonight's match?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: It was a very, very tough match. It was so close. We play unbelievable points. We serve well. The difference was just a couple of points in the tiebreak on the second set. 
 But, anyway, he has a great season. I wish the best for the next one. 

 Q. How do you feel physically after another match in three sets?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, I always play matches three sets. But tomorrow will be maybe the last one of the year. I will want to close a good year. I will play against Nikolay. It will be tough. 
 But if I play like today, maybe I will have chance to win. 

 Q. How does it compare, reaching the final here, to reaching the final at Flushing Meadows?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know, I never played the final in the Masters Cup. But I can tell you tomorrow. 

 Q. You were 4-2 down in the third set. What did you say to yourself to make the next move?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, the crowd tell me to fight. The crowd was so exciting, cheering for both players. That's help me to try to fight. Finally I broke his serve after the 4-2. I start to play a little better, more confidence. I think that was the key. 

 Q. Even after winning the US Open you publicly admitted you didn't feel you belonged amongst the guys at the top of the game. Now getting to the Masters final, do you feel you belong there now?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. They are great, great players. I just want to be like them, you know. I need time to improve my game, my physic, my body, everything. 
 But I think I'm in a good way. I hope similar season for the future. 

 Q. What do you think of Davydenko as an opponent?
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, he's very fast and he play well in this kind of surface. But if I play good, I think I will have chance to win. 
 I don't know, he's playing a good tennis. He has confidence to play the finals. But I think will be a good final to watch. 

 Q. You lost your first five games in the tournament. That seems like a long time ago now. What is the difference between you now as a player than a week ago when you lost those five games? 
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, but is tough play against Murray first match in the Masters Cup here in London. But in the beginning of the week, I play little bad. But now I feel better, am playing better. I have confidence similar than New York. 
 I don't know. I don't have nothing to lose for tomorrow. So we want to enjoy the finals and then a good vacations.
