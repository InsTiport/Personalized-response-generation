 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What is your feeling today after this match?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I'm feeling better than yesterday. I think today was better match for me. I play really aggressive during all the match and I take all my opportunities to be a quick match.   
 So that's important for my next round because I don't have a day off this week. I playing since Monday to tomorrow. So will be difficult.   
 But I hope be ready for fight.   
  
  Q. How do you explain the difference between yesterday and today?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. Just I had a little bad luck. I have set points, and he play really well. And today I'm still trying, serving well. I was more aggressive with my returns. All my breakpoints I played more aggressive than yesterday and I closed the match easy, no?   
  
  Q. In which shape are you? No problem physically?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yes, I'm getting better. Slowly, but I'm getting better.   
  
  Q. Slowly, what?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: It's not easy play a Grand Slam, play this Grand Slam since 2009. I will play tomorrow again. Hopefully be in good shape for play Simon, he's really nice player. He has a lot of talent, so will be difficult.   
  
  Q. You met twice.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah.   
  
  Q. A very long match at the US Open.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: At the US Open. He play really, really good. We just play on exhibition last week. But, you know, tomorrow will be a good match for both. So I want to be focused, to be ready for play good tennis.   
  
  Q. You hit 75 winners today and yesterday.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: How many?   
  
  Q. 75. You must be pleased with that statistic.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah. Looking here I played 30 aces, too. It's a nice number. But hopefully be the same tomorrow. I will need all my weapons: my serve, my volleys, my forehand, if I want to stay alive in the tournament.  
  
  Q. Do you think that's the key for you on grass?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah, I think so. If you have nice serve and you play focus all the points, you have chance to play a good game. I don't know if you gonna win or lose, but you will have any chance for sure.  
  
  Q. How many double-faults did you have?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Three.   
  
  Q. It seems players are double-faulting less than before. Why do you think that is?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I'm thinking I made my first double-fault in the tiebreak, so it's a bad moment for make a double-fault. So I will change that for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. But in general, people are hitting fewer double-faults. Why do you think that is?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I don't know. Well, you have to give your serve whatever you can. If you play against good return players, is better if you be more aggressive with your first and second serve. I think that's the reason.   
  
  Q. But that would mean you might make more double-faults.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Yeah. Hopefully not. But I will think about you if I make a double-fault.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us a bit about the shoes.   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: The shoes? I don't know. Was to the crowd.  
  
  Q. Was it losing the set or was it stopping the match?   
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: I lost the set. Once again I stop a match for another day. I think the crowd was, until the last point with cold, windy, rain, so was a good idea for them.   
  
  Q. Did the crowd ask for your shoes? Have you ever given your shoes before?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, the first time. After the match, I saw the kid with my shoes and I sign for him.  
  
  Q. Did you walk back to the locker room in your bare feet?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: My socks.  
  
  Q. Is playing on grass easier for your body than hard courts, maybe even than clay?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: No, it's really difficult for my physically and for my game playing here on grass. But this year I'm here for learn, for improve my serve and volleys.   
 And after French, I came here for practice a lot, every day. If I have a good result, it's better. But if I not, it's a good moment for improve my game here and for be ready for the next years.   
  
  Q. What parts of your body does it hurt?  
 JUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO: Well, after a match, every part hurts. But we have a good physios, good massages, and I will try to be in good shape for tomorrow.
