S. WAWRINKA/D. Koepfer
6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. There was a loud explosion while you were preparing to serve, and you obviously stopped serving and just looked up in the air, thinking, what on earth was that?  Can you tell me what it was like when you were serving and you heard that huge bang, not knowing what it was?  You looked at Stan and he didn't seem to know either.  Can you just talk about that.
DOMINIK KOEPFER:   Yeah, it was kind of weird.  I mean, we both stopped.  I think it was before my first serve.  We looked at each other and didn't know really what it was.  I think it turned out it was like some microphone that someone dropped.
Q. It was a fighter plane breaking the speed of sound.
DOMINIK KOEPFER:   Yeah, it was a weird feeling.  But, I mean, for one or two points I thought about it.  I didn't really think much about it.  Nobody freaked out, so I wasn't too worried, to be honest.
