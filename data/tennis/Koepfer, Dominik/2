  D. KOEPFER/H. Dellien
 7-5, 6-2, 6-4
 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It was a relatively convincing match.  What were your thoughts?
 DOMINIK KOEPFER:   Thanks.  Yeah, I thought I played a pretty good match.  From the start I got into the match pretty well, pretty solid, I thought, and was a little nervous in the beginning.  Haven't really played well here in Australia.
 Then just played solid the entire way through, returned pretty well today, and yeah, happy I got it done.
 Q. You have Thiem the next match.  What will you be looking to do that match?
 DOMINIK KOEPFER:   It's obviously a tough task to play a Grand Slam champion.  He won the US Open last year.  It's not easy to play one of the top guys, but I'm excited to play him and it's another challenge ahead of me.  And yeah, I'm looking forward to trying to make his life hard.
