MODERATOR:  Questions for Monica.  
 
 
Q.  There have been a lot of upsets on the other half of the draw.  What do you know about the girls left over?
 
MONICA SELES:  I know Lisa Raymond, she's a good friend on the tour.  She's playing Hantuchova, a good young up-and-coming player.  I've practiced with her a couple times.  She's playing some great tennis for this past year.  The other two, definitely big surprises, Smashnova, Gagliardi. 
 
Q.  Are you surprised the way that bracket fell?
 
MONICA SELES:  Oh, yeah.  I think everybody's really surprised how it's turned out.  I think Kim came in, you know, not a hundred percent, so we all kind of knew that it would be very difficult for her to be in that same form she was last year.  But certainly the other seeds up there, the draw always looked easier up there, but once a few of the seeds lost, gosh, it just opened up totally.  But you have to give credit to the other players. 
 
Q.  Your side is becoming the veteran's side, you, Martina. 
 
MONICA SELES:  That's scary when you're calling Martina a veteran, but okay (laughter).  Yeah, definitely, it's great to see that.  Someone like Arantxa is playing some great tennis.  Same for Amanda.  It's nice to see a mixture on the tour.  It's great to have that at this tournament.
