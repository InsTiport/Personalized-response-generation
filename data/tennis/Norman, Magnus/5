THE MODERATOR:  First question, please. 


Q.  Magnus, was that perhaps a tougher match than you expected?

MAGNUS NORMAN: Well, you never know what to expect when you walk on the court.  I was expecting to win, and, you know, he gave me a tough job.  And, you know, I was little bit worried in the third set because he was playing very, very good.  I didn't really find my rhythm.  He was especially serving really good.   He gave me some troubles but I'm very, very happy with the way I played the last one and a half set. 

Q.  How much was the heat a factor?

MAGNUS NORMAN: In the beginning it was a big factor.  I mean it's obviously very, very hot out there, but I think after perhaps one, one and a half, two sets, it got a lot cooler and actually we had to turn on the lights, you know, because it got dark.  So just in the beginning. 

Q.  If you have to pick up one turning point in that match, which one would it be?

MAGNUS NORMAN: Oh, it's obviously when I held the serve to  -- in the third set.  He was up 3-love, and had two or three I think break points to 4-love.  That was a very important game to hold serve.  Then I broke him after that.  So I think it was that game. 

Q.  Most media obviously focusing on other players.  Is that an advantage for you?

MAGNUS NORMAN: Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.
