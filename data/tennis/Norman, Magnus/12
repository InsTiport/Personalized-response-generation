 MODERATOR: Questions for Magnus.  
 
Q. His serve today steamed outrageous, right?
 
 MAGNUS NORMAN: He was serving unbelievable, the best I've ever seen him. I heard before
the match, and yesterday, that he had some problems with his back, so I was expecting him
maybe to start the match a little bit slow, maybe not serve a hundred percent. You know,
if he's got problems with his back, I would like to have a problem with my back, as well,
if he serves like that.  
 
Q. You had a difficult match with Kuerten. It's the second time recently that you lost
to him. Were you expecting this?
 
 MAGNUS NORMAN: Today?  
 
Q. Yes. 
 
 MAGNUS NORMAN: No. I mean, Gustavo is a very good player. You know, he's one of the
best players in the world. I didn't think I made a bad match today either. I think I've
been playing two very good matches here. It's just a couple of points here and there. But,
you know, I'm going to try to win at least one match tomorrow.
