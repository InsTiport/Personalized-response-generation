M. PUIG/B. Bencic
6-0, 0-0 (ret.)
Q. (Regarding yesterday's match going into today. )
MONICA PUIG: Yesterday I got off to a really good start.  Coming up 4-0 is really big advantage, especially after a rain delay.
Then she wasn't feeling that great today, which is a shame.  This matchup was a really strong one, and I had to be really careful.
I just wish her all the best in recovery for Melbourne.
Q. Looking ahead to the final.
MONICA PUIG: I'll just have fun.  It's my first final in two years, so I'm really excited to be back in a final and really excited to just get out there and compete.  I'll fight my hardest for the win.
