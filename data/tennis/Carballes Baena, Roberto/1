6-1, 6-3 [Ret.]
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Could you tell us what was wrong with you today and why you had to retire?
ROBERTO CARBALLES BAENA:   Well, I have been throwing up all the day.  I started yesterday night at 3 a.m.  I tried to warm up and tried to play, but I couldn't.  It was impossible.
Q. Do you know what's wrong?  Are you sick?  Food poisoning?
ROBERTO CARBALLES BAENA:   I don't know.  The doctors say that it's stomach virus, but I don't know.  I am trying to understand why this is happening, but I don't know.
Q. During your previous match were you feeling okay and it started yesterday?
ROBERTO CARBALLES BAENA:   Yeah, yeah, yesterday I was good.  I practiced a little bit, 45 minutes.  Then I did the recovery.  I went to lunch, to dinner, everything was okay.
At 3 a.m. I woke up with a pain in my stomach and feeling so bad.  Then I warm up this morning.  I was feeling better.  But after the warmup, I started to throw up again two times.  It was tough, yeah.
