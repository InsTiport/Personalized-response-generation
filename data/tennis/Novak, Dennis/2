D. NOVAK/F. Fognini
6-3, 6-2
Q. Talk about the win, how important it was to get your country off to a good start.
DENNIS NOVAK:   The win was very good, very important for me.  I was waiting for this day so long to start finally the season.  Of course, that's tough opponent against Fabio.  Of course I expected to win, but you never know what's coming from Fabio.
Yeah, it was a solid match.  Very important to be one up.  Once you're up, take a little bit of pressure from Dominic.
Q. What was the key to the match?
DENNIS NOVAK:   I think it was just being solid, making him play a lot of balls, try to get him angry maybe that he loses his path.  So, yeah, it was definitely a plan of me.
But I was trying to serve well, good percentage.  Just tried to focus on every point.
