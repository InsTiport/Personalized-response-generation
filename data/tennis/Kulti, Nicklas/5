Q.  How well did John play today? 

NICKLAS KULTI:  Well, I think he played really good.  I think this surface is good for him because it doesn't bounce high and it is pretty fast. 


Q.  He has talked about not playing anymore or not playing a lot after this year.  Considering how well maybe he has played or how well he played today, can you understand maybe him not wanting to play anymore, or do you think he could keep on place at a very high level? 

NICKLAS KULTI:  Well, if he plays like he did today, I mean, today, I think he played on a high level, and I don't know whether he is -- how do you say -- if he really wants to be Number 1 or whatever, play really good.  I mean, it is up to him.  It is hard for me to say.  You better ask him. 


Q.  Thank you.
