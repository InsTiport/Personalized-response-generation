 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. It was really a tough battle between you and Fiona.  What do you think made the difference in the end?
 PATRICIA MARIA TIG:   Well, I think she's a really great player, and she really played an amazing match.  We both there for the first two sets.
 I think I was consuming myself a lot during the first set, which in the end it was very hard for me to keep the same level of the game.
 But overall, I'm really happy about the match.  I think we fought for every point really good.  I will definitely enjoy playing her again.
 Q. How were the conditions?  Because it was like quite cold and it was really physically tough with a long first set.
 PATRICIA MARIA TIG:   Yes.  Well, I love the conditions here.  Like I said, it's a really special place for me.
 Unfortunately I didn't manage to keep myself calm during the first set.  You know, it's very difficult to play against a player who is from the country where the tournament is held.
 I wish, if I could, I would change my whole attitude about what I was doing on the court.  That's why I wish I can have another chance to play on bigger stages of world and hopefully I can, you know, do better regarding my attitude and also regarding my game.
