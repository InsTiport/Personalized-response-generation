  3/6, 6/3, 4/6, 7/6, 6/4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How do you feel now? 
SIMONE BOLELLI:   I'm little disappoint because I had a chance to win the match in fourth set, and also today some chance, I had some chance, but I didn't take it.
But anyway, I'm good for the tournament.   Actually, I lost in qualify and I had the chance to play once again in the main draw.   I lost today against Kei, great player.
I think I'm in good shape.   I am in good moment.   Just keep going like this, and okay. 

Q.   Did you prefer to keep playing on Saturday? 
SIMONE BOLELLI:   Maybe was better, but ‑‑ I can say it now because I just finish the match and I lost‑‑ maybe for me was better to finish the match in fourth set.   I mean, I had the chance to do it. 
Two days off I just start thinking this, and maybe today I didn't was very, I don't know, concentrate like Saturday. 

Q.   How difficult it was to keep concentrated on Sunday?   You have to wait 24 hours, so...
SIMONE BOLELLI:   Yeah, it's not easy.   I just play a little bit yesterday, one hour, about one hour, and then massage, everything.   A lot of rest.
Today just practicing close to the match.   But it's not easy.   I mean, with the day in the middle, it's not easy to keep the energy. 

Q.   Who do you think felt more pressure going to the court today:   you or Kei? 
SIMONE BOLELLI:   Pressure, I don't know.   Maybe Kei.   He's No. 20 in the world, so maybe he has to win this match.
But for the other side, I knew that I could win because I had already chances Saturday.   So, I mean, was even.
