NICOLAS LAPENTTI: It was a bit strange. I didn't learn about it until 20 minutes before the match. I really wanted to play with Costa. He had beaten me twice in a Masters, and I wanted revenge. Well, Costa was definitely going to do a better game than Acasuso. After being on the center court, having to play on Court 1 was a little bit of a strange sensation. I played comfortably, without nerves. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: Roger is always very dangerous. We've only played once this year in Hamburg. He beat me. It's another opportunity for revenge. I feel I'm playing well. I'm finding my game. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: My physical condition is good. This match only lasted one hour and a quarter, so I didn't get that tired. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: At the end of November, I will start the pre-season in Ecuador. First week of December will be Nogales in a rural house. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: My options are to play clay in Guayaquil, cement in Salinas, or Quito. I had a phone call the day after the draw. He wanted to know my views. They said they wanted to take a decision, but those were the three options. I don't know what is the term for the decision to be taken, but I'm sure the chairman of the Federation will let you know. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: There are several players who specialize in different things. Some play on clay, some on hard court. You have to analyze well. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: It's not what I would like, but what would be more convenient for me, the most important. I really don't know. If I knew, I wouldn't tell you maybe. 

NICOLAS LAPENTTI: Very well. The Davis Cup is very special for me. I see that my other team members, one in particular, has recovered and playing well. We can play a good draw.
