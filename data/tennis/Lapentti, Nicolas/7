Q. Nicolas, it was a tough match against a very difficult opponent. Can you talk to us about the match. 
 
 NICOLAS LAPENTTI: Yeah, well, Jiri had a great start of the year. He's the kind of player that does everything quite well. He plays well from the baseline. He goes to the net, has good volleys. And I think it was very important to be patient and to serve well today. I am happy with the way things went on the court, and I'm definitely playing better than my first match. So that gives me a lot of confidence for my next round match.  
 
Q. Can you talk to us about that next round that you're going to be playing, Ferrero or Voinea? 
 
 NICOLAS LAPENTTI: Well, they're both very tough players. Ferrero is definitely the favorite to win the match. We always have very tough matches with Juan Carlos. Hopefully, I can keep improving my game and take it to a next level if I have to.  
 
Q. You had a very good start of the year. Do you think this is going to be your year, like in '99? 
 
 NICOLAS LAPENTTI: I think I'm in a good position to get there. I feel confident, I feel like my game is coming back together. Mentally, I'm hungry to get back into the Top 10. I think that's the most important - to want to get there, to be eager to achieve what I want. And I think I'll make it.  
 
Q. You are a resident of Miami. You live here in Miami. There are no big tournaments in Ecuador. This is your local tournament? 
 
 NICOLAS LAPENTTI: It is kind of my local tournament. Leaving aside Davis Cup, it is the only tournament where I can play with friends and family watching. It makes me feel at home. I am always looking forward to this tournament in Miami.
