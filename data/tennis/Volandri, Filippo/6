THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  I'd like to know a little bit about what you've been doing tennis-wise in the last two years and why it's suddenly coming now, please. 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  I mean, I have no problems, but a period when I didn't win so much but I work a lot.  And then I'm good now because I work and I working again, and I have a big period in this winter when I practice hard.  I am happy because finally I see the results.  
 
Q.  Was that work you were doing over here?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, yeah, seven weeks. 
 
Q.  How did that come about? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  I mean,  that's the result of the work.  Only because I was practicing in Florence before, but I didn't have so much players who practice well.  I came here, and I found guys like Gaudenzi, Sanguinetti, Ljubicic, Furlan.  That's why, players that I can learn a lot.  
 
Q.  What kind of training did you make, weight-lifting, something like that? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Everything.  Endurance, a lot of endurance.  Everything.  I came in the morning at 8 o'clock and I went at 8 o'clock in the evening.  
 
Q.  Did you have any time for lunch?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah (laughing).  Lunch, little relax after lunch, and then 3 o'clock again on court.  
 
Q.  In that time did you put weight on or take it off? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  No, I didn't lose weight.  
 
Q.  You put muscle on?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, yeah.  
 
Q.  Did you think when Norman won those games, several games in a row, were you worried that he was going to do the same as he had done yesterday?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Maybe had too much feeling with the balls.  I felt maybe, yes, too much feeling, too much sure about me.  Then he came back.  I relaxed and he came back. 
 
Q.  You were too comfortable?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, when you give a chance to a player like him... 
 
Q.  Which part of your game would you like to improve? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, maybe when you are 5-1 up and then you are 5-all, that's maybe the part of the game that I want improve.  
 
NICOLA ARZANI:  The mental part?  
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yes, the mental part.  When you are 5-1 up, you have to close the match. 
 
Q.  Why did you start to work so hard, to train so hard?  You were fed up with not having results?  You decided it was time you had results? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Maybe I understood that when I am good physically, I can play good.  That is other thing you have to make to be a real player.  But I understood that when I feel good, I can play better.  
 
Q.  How conscious are you of the fact that Italy, like where I come from, is very short of top-class players? 
 
NICOLA ARZANI:  Do you want to ask, does that put pressure on him? 
 
Q.  Yes, and is it an inspiration, as well, to fill that gap? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  No, I mean, I'm just working.  I don't think about what's happened around me.  Now I'm focus.  
 
Q.  You seemed to have a lot of support from Italy today. 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, yeah.  We are close to Italy, so that's why.  
 
Q.  Which town are you from? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  I was born Livorno.  I practice few years in Florence.  Yeah, my residence is Livorno. 
 
Q.  How far is that from here?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Is 350 kilometers, no more. 
 
Q.  I was told when you were young you would have preferred to play basketball.  Is that correct? 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, I start to play basketball before tennis.  My sister was playing  - she is older than me  - was playing before me tennis.  That's why, my mother can take us only one sport.  I mean, was tough for her divide in two and take us somewhere.  
 
Q.  Now you have no regrets?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  No, no (smiling). 
 
Q.  But you follow basketball as a supporter?
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  No.  
 
Q.  Can you tell us a few words about Nadal.  He seems to be surprising everyone here.  You beat him recently.
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Yeah, he surprised everyone, but not me.  I play against him in the final in a challenger a few weeks ago.  I won 6-1 in the third, but I felt he can be a real good player.  He's so young and his power is unbelievable.  For a guy 17 years old... 
 
Q.  Not yet. 
 
FILIPPO VOLANDRI:  Not yet... is big power.
