 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Peng Sun. 

 Q. Would you please give us a brief comment on your performance today. 
 PENG SUN: (Through interpretation.) Actually, before I came here, I know that my opponents are the top 10 players in the world, so I have a brief understanding of their strategies and techniques in playing the tennis. 
 So at the beginning, I feel really a little bit nervous. But after two games, I came to be adjusted to that. I think that my performance is quite good. But I think that the opponent has imposed quite a lot of pressure on me. 
 As far as the strategy and also the techniques are concerned, I think that it's fine. But as to the pressure, I think I did not pose much pressure on them. So there is a lot of things for me to learn from it. 

 Q. We know it is the first time for the Chinese male players to play in the Olympic Games. Also you have the chance to meet high level players. What do you think is the effective matters to improve your performance? 
 PENG SUN: (Through interpretation.) I think we need to popularize the tennis, just like in Europe. We should have the tennis competitions each week or we should encourage more people, more boys, to play the tennis. Also we should hold the more intense competitions in tennis. That means that we need to create a kind of environment for us to popularize the tennis. That is my idea.
