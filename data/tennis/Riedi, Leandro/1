THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Great day for Swiss tennis, the first all-Swiss junior Grand Slam final.  What can you say about this?  How proud are you to have been part of this?
LEANDRO RIEDI:   It's an unbelievable feeling.  I think the whole Swiss tennis fans are so excited for today.  Also I'm able to be a part of it.  Such a cool moment.
No, yeah, it was a tough match in the end.  I'm still really happy that I'm a part of a history that was made now in Swiss, yeah.
Q. What makes Dominic so tough to play?
LEANDRO RIEDI:   Today he was just so aggressive and he played really good tennis today.  It was really hard for me to get the rhythm.  I was playing okay, not my best, but also not my worst.  Was really okay.
He was just too good for me today.  I tried my best, but today he was just better.
