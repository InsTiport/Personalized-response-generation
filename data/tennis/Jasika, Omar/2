THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Must be really thrilled with that performance.

 Q.  How did you feel going in?  Obviously a big moment.  How were the nerves before the match?  
OMAR JASIKA: Well, yeah, a few weeks before I started thinking about it, you know, struggling to sleep a little bit, you know.  Normal.  As it was getting closer and closer, it was starting to get even more.   
But I was okay.  It was good.   
 Q.  You got incredible support out there.  How did you deal with that?  Did you enjoy it?

 Q.  What went right in the third set for you to get 6-Love?  
OMAR JASIKA: I just got momentum at the start, the first few games.  The crowd picked me up a bit.  He started getting I think a little bit nervous as well.  Yeah, it was good to get that set.   
 Q.  You'll get to move off one of the backcourts next time around and move up to one of the show courts?
