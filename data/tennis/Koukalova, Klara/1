THE MODERATOR:  We'll get started.  We have Klara Koukalova.  The floor's open for questions.


Q.  When did you find out you would play, and why did your coach tell you she was substituting you for Daja? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, they let me know yesterday and they told me that it's gonna be surprise for Serena because she was counting to play with Daja.  Serena knows Daja very well, so they change it for surprise. 

Q.  The surprise didn't work so well, though.  Was she just too good, or did you not play as well as you wanted to? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, she has the strongest serve I ever played, so is the first reason.  Well, she's No. 1 so... you know. 

Q.  How did you feel you played overall? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I feel sad, but I was not playing so good. 

Q.  You don't think you played that well?

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  No. 

Q.  It seemed like when you got into the rallies you were okay, but you had a hard time getting into the rallies?

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Especially my serve was not working.  Her return's so well, so it's tough to get into rally with her. 

Q.  What kind of chance did you give yourself before you got on the court? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, that I have to serve well is the first thing, then good return.  But it depends how Serena serve.  And then stay in the ball and play the rally as much as possible. 

Q.  When she serves, is it because she serves so hard that makes it difficult, or is it because it's hard to know where she's going to serve? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I think both, because she serves so hard and you never know where it's going, the serve. 

Q.  Can you talk about the challenge of hitting winners against her?  You tried to work the sides, but she just got to everything.  How frustrating is that when you can't get it past her? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I don't know.  She's first in the world, so it's hard to play with her.  I don't know. 

Q.  How did the team react when they found out you were going to substitute for Daja? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I think everything was fine.  We have a great team.  I think everything was all right. 

Q.  How did you react?  Were you happy with the opportunity? 

KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Oh, sure.  I was very happy to play against her, and I was looking forward to play against Serena.
