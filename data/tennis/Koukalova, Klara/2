THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Can you talk about what went through your mind when you won the match and how happy you were?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I'm very happy.  I couldn't believe actually that I won.  But Monica is a Top 10 player, so it's unbelievable.  
 
Q.  What do you think a victory like this will mean to your career down the line?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I think I get into Top 100 for the first time in my life, so that's the most important now.  And, well, I beat Top 10 player, so that's always good.  
 
Q.  Is that your best win? 
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Yeah, for sure.  
 
Q.  Were you conscious that she was injured and had her foot strapped?  Did that affect her movement, do you think? 
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I don't know, because it was third game in first set, so I know how she's moving normally.  But I don't know.  
 
Q.  Did you make an effort to try and sort of force her to run around the court more following her injury?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I think she was running normally.  I don't know.  
 
Q.  For those of us who don't know a lot about you, can you give us a short version of how you got involved in tennis and your background a little bit?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I started at seven coming from Prague, and I don't know what to say.  
 
Q.  Parents? 
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Parents, they both  -- they are not playing tennis.  
 
Q.  What do they do?  Where did you start to play?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  In Prague.  
 
Q.  At a club?
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, there is a club near our house, so I started there.  
 
My parents, my mother is a barman and my father is taxi driver.  
 
Q.  Was there any particular Czech woman that you admired? 
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I like Denisa Chladkova, so she won also.  So it's good.  Martina Navratilova, yeah.  
 
Q.  When you first started to play, at what stage, I guess, did you start to think that you would like to be on the tour?  Did you just start playing as a kid for fun? 
 
KLARA KOUKALOVA:  Well, I started as just a kid for fun, and then I get into national Czech team under-12 or something, and take it serious after.
