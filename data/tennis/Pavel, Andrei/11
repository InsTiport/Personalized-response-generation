 MODERATOR: Questions for Andrei, please.  
 
Q. You had a slow start today. Were you caught a little off guard?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: Yeah. Actually, yes, I had a really slow start, and he had a very good
start. Kind of he put me straightaway from the first points under pressure. I had my
expectations so high. I put myself in a place where the expectations, they were so high.
Actually, I was trying to serve the same as I served last night. Somehow, you know, when
you want something so much, it turns around on you. That what happened. He played really
well. He didn't give me any chance. I mean, he didn't -- I had to win the points every
time. I didn't get any free points, to put it this way. First set, it went by so fast. The
second, I knew that I can come back. Well, I didn't. So he's in the semis, and I'm not. 
 
Q. You're having your best ever season this year. How do you explain it, and what do
you think you're making different?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: Well, the difference, I've been working much harder these few years. All
my life seemed so much more quieter. I'm just getting more mature in the head, more
professional in a lot of ways, believing in me much more than I was doing the last few
years. The injuries - now I recover after a few very difficult injuries. Basically, this
is all about what I can think right now of. Confidence, yeah.
