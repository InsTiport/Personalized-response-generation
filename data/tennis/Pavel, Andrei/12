 MODERATOR: Questions.  
 
Q. Are you satisfied?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: Are you kidding me? Sure, I'm very satisfied. It's been the best. I mean,
I played another very, very good match, similar with this, in Davis Cup against Zimbabwe,
in Zimbabwe. I served so big, I was so confident on my serve, afterwards on the return, I
just go for it. I was so relaxed. That's why everything went so smoothly for me.  
 
Q. Were you surprised how easy it was?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: No. I mean, I lost against him a few times, so I kind of knew that I have
to attack him. I knew he didn't play much in the last few months. I had to go for my
shots. I mean, if you let Andre Agassi to decide what he's doing with the ball, I guess
you have no chance. I mean, he was for sure not in his best shape, in his best tennis.
But, you know, when you are in the -- when you're playing your best, I say I surely want
it, so I win it. 
 
Q. Is there a secret behind this big serve?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: Well, my serve has been improving in the last two years very good because
about five years ago I had a difficult operation on my elbow, and now I've been working
out in the last year and a half for my arm really, really good. I had a conditional
trainer. With my coach, we kind of changed just a bit the movement on the serve. It works
really good. 
 
Q. Were you surprised when he tried to change tactics in the second set, played these
high balls?
 
 ANDREI PAVEL: Well, sure. He had to change something. Basically I was hitting the ball
so well. He thought like he has to change something. I was pretty cool on the court, so I
went for the shots and everything went right. That's why I win in two sets
"easy".
