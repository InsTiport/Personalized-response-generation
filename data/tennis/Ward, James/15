J. WARD/B. Rola
      7‑5, 6‑4

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Good to get back on the record grass?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, it's always nice.   I play well on it.   It's a surface I like. 
    Yeah, sure, today I love it.

Q.   Dimitrov the next round.   Is this the bit of surface in which you fancy yourself to beat a player like him?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, probably.   It would be obviously an upset if you look at the rankings.   We practiced last week.   We know each other pretty well, anyway.   I think it will be a good match.

Q.   You reached the semis here a couple of years ago. 
    JAMES WARD:   That was obviously like a one‑off result.   I played unbelievable the whole week.   You can't do that every week. 
    Yeah, but I think I'm playing a lot better, a lot more consistent.   And, you know, I've got a new coach.   New things are working out, as you saw at the French.   With the opportunities the next few weeks, hopefully I'll keep moving forward.

Q.   What was your reaction when you heard about Andy hiring AmÃ©lie to be a coach?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, it's not for me to comment, is it really? 
    I mean, he believes in the decision.   I'm sure it will work out for him.

Q.   Shouldn't make much difference if it's male or female, should it?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah.   Look, it's obviously different.   That's why everyone is talking about it.
    I'm sure after a week or so it will die down and everyone will just get on with it.

Q.   Would you do it yourself?
    JAMES WARD:   I'm trying to avoid the question.   (Laughter.)   You're forcing an answer.
    I don't know.   Honestly, I don't know.   I wouldn't say no because, you know, I'm not in a position like he is at the moment.   It's a bit different.

Q.   Good answer. 
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah.

Q.   Someone mentioned earlier about women allowed ‑‑
    JAMES WARD:   Should we talk about my match or just talk about Mauresmo?   I mean... 

Q.   How much confidence did you gain?   How much confidence did you get out of the French Open?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, obviously it was great.   Everyone has been taking a little bit more interest since then.   You know, it's a lot of confidence. 
    I beat two good players in the quallies there and took four sets with Robredo.   It was a tough match.   He had to play well, which he did.   I also played a good level.   He's a guy who has played really well, especially at the French. 
    It was a tough draw, but it was also a good experience and one that will help me in the next few weeks, I'm sure.

Q.   How tough was the heat out there today?
    JAMES WARD:   No, I mean, it's fine.   Yeah, the heat in England is not exactly like heat in other countries you play in most weeks.   Yeah, it's fine.

Q.   Are you noticing the benefits of working with Darren Tandy now?
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, definitely.   Having somebody around every day, you stick to good habits.   Hearing someone's voice and picking you up on what you need to be doing, it's definitely a big help.

Q.   Is your family here? 
    JAMES WARD:   Yeah, my dad is here and my uncle is around and there is always a few family and   friends about.   It's a nice touch, especially when it's so close.   You have to make the most of it.   They don't get to watch me much during the year.
    So, yeah, it was good.
