6-3, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you feel after your first win on grass?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Great.  It's nice.  Nice to win.  Coming out on the grass courts always have high expectations from myself.  Yeah, but this match just proved that I have practiced, I have done a lot of work on the court, felt confident, which is very good.   
And, yeah, I was just happy to close the match in two sets and didn't have to waste any more energy or anything like that.  Yeah, I'd like to build up from this match and go on with whatever is in front of me now.   
 Q.  What was the difference between here and Stuttgart?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Just match is a match.  You have days that things are not going your way and some days things are just clicking.  I mean, I think I have put a lot of work in the past two weeks, you know, on and off the court.  So for sure I expect something to come around.   
Yeah, today was just, you know, a solid match.  It's never easy to come out on that centre court or Monday.  The grass is still a little bit slippery.  You need to be careful a little bit.  I found my way around the court pretty well, and I think I'm most pleased with that today.   
 Q.  Were you actively trying to keep the points short?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, absolutely.  I was pushing myself to just stay in the moment, stay in the present, return every ball that I can, make sure that I take the right decision, yeah, trying to serve as best I can and making sure that I keep that focus throughout the whole time.   
Now we are playing best of three, but in two weeks' time we are going to be playing best of five.  So you need to push yourself to get over that extra hurdle.  Even if it's in straight sets, you still need to kind of push yourself to have that mentality that you have done the work, you push yourself for two, three sets.  Yeah, today was, as I said, overall it's just a good performance for me today.   
 Q.  Bulgarian groups here.  Do you feel the support?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Always, always, always  when I see the flags around.  Yeah, this year the surroundings look so much bigger.  As I said, I see so many familiar faces, but it's great to see actually on a Monday with such great weather, people are coming to watch and enjoying the tennis.  That's just beautiful to see.  It's great for the sport, and especially when it's on grass, it's even more special, see the Bulgarian flags.  It's always a good sign for me.   
 Q.  You won the tournament in 2014.  Does that give you more motivation every time you come here?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Absolutely.  Yeah, I mean, I would love to repeat that.  As I said, every tournament you play on grass, I just want to win it.  The grass court season is pretty short, so you just need to make sure that you get the most out of it.   
In my case right now, I mean, I didn't have such a good match in Stuttgart for which I was obviously quite disappointed because I kind of felt like a wasted tournament.   
But I didn't get discouraged.  I kept on playing, kept on practicing, arrived here and just pushed through the days of work in practice.  And today I was just very happy and positive to come out to compete.
