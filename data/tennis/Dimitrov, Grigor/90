A. MURRAY/G. Dimitrov
  4‑6, 7‑6, 7‑5

Q. You played a great match today. How did you see the match out there?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Many chances. Obviously too many chances. Up a set, 4‑1, serving for the match. Just too many opportunities, you know. When you miss on them playing against a top player‑‑ Andy has been playing really good so far, that's about it. Nothing else.
I mean, I'm positive. A lot of good things that I thought I did good. You know, off to the Open now.

Q. Anything specific you can take away? You hung through all the way back and forth. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, overall my game was good. I was happy with the way I played at least, but that's about it.
I had too many opportunities. That's the only thing. If that you have many and you don't take them, that's how it is. 
I want to say that's about it. Everything else felt pretty good. The body held pretty good for three hours, so good things ahead.

Q. And you played a player with amazing fighting abilities as well obviously. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, absolutely. He's definitely one of the greatest returners out there and he returns so many balls in in important moments. Yeah.
