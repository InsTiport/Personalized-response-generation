G. DIMITROV/A. Dolgopolov   
4-6, 6-3, 6-4   
 Q.  Congratulations on today.  You came back for just a couple games and seemed to be on a bit of an express train and served it out very well.  Were you pleased with how quickly...  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I was actually rushing a lot this morning.  I didn't expect the match before to finish that way, so I jumped straight to the court from the practice court.   
I served well, so I think that was good enough.  I knew Alex was sort of come and start shooting every ball, so I had to be ready.   
I had a good night's sleep and I'm kind of good.   
 Q.  Semis continuing like a bit of a return to form for you?  Must be pleased about your form going forward.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, as I said, right now I'm just focused to get as many matches as possible and get ready for Melbourne.   
That's my main goal.  My job here is still in progress.  I'm excited to get on the court again, semifinal.   
 Q.  Muller next.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah.  So Muller next.  Yeah, it's going to be a big match.  Big server.  Experienced guy.  Tough conditions today, but going to be the same for both of us.  Yeah, that's how it's going to go.
