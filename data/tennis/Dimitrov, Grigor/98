  6‑4, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How would you assess your game on grass today?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, yeah, I mean, I don't think I'm playing bad tennis at the moment.   I just am doing a lot of good things on the court which really don't discourage me to play.   
Tough match today, of course.   I'm just going to stay positive.   Wimbledon is coming up.   I'm going to have good time to get ready.  
Yeah, everything is going to be ‑‑I think everything is going to be fine for me.   
   
 Q.   Does it hurt more losing as a defending champion?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It always does.   It always does.   It's just a tough ‑‑of course, it's a tough loss for me, but I give credit to Gilles.   He played a good match.   Very solid serving.   
You know, it was just very close.   I mean, I think I was striking the ball pretty good.   I got quite a few break points that I didn't convert.   
I think that's about it.   It's just about that small shift that I'm going to need.   
Yeah, it's of course never easy when you lose your title, but that's part of the game.   I'm going to have quite a few days to get ready for Wimby, and, yeah, I'm sure I'm going to turn things around.  
   
 Q.   What will you be doing between now and Wimbledon?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think I'm just going to probably rest a little bit.   I think it's good to let the body recover.   First week on grass it's always a bit intense on the body.   You're a little stiff every day.   
I'm just going to get a little bit of a rest and just get out on the practice court and just keep working.  
I mean, this is pretty much the best thing I can do right now.   There's not much else to think about.   I've just gotta go out there and perform.   I felt I have been quite unlucky in the past weeks with a lot that has been going on, and it's something that actually, you know, I accept and I need to fight through.   
   
 Q.   A lot of the big guys struggled here.   How do you explain that?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   As I said, it's never easy.   It's first week on grass, and it's just you have dangerous players.  
As I said, I mean, look at the draw.   It's just full of players that can actually play good on grass.   Good servers, good serve and volleyers.   If you're not in a good rhythm, it takes one or two points to turn everything around.  
Same thing happened with me today.   I felt I had quite a few break points in the first set, I felt I was striking the ball well.   I felt everything was going according to my plan.   But just one or two points turned everything away from me, and that made a difference.   
   
 Q.   How would you compare your loss today with the French Open first‑round loss?   Would you say you're more disappointed?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I don't want to say more disappointed.   It's just not easy losing, especially on a tournament that you know you're going to play good and you have good success out here and you're feeling good.  
It's just a shame that I had to go down that way again, but as I said, I'm very positive.   I'm happy what I'm doing on the practice court and I'm staying healthy.   
I mean, this is just a good, solid base for me.   You know, one of the biggest tournaments is around the corner.
