A. MURRAY/G. Dimitrov
6-1, 6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Describe what you were feeling out on court tonight.
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, first, obviously it's a great experience for me to get out there and play a night match on Ashe.  Obviously I'm very disappointed from the result.  I feel I've been doing really well the past five, six weeks, practicing-wise, winning a few good and close matches when I had to.
Obviously today I ran out of fuel I think physically and mentally.  For sure I was a little bit overwhelmed to get out there, you know, playing that prime time match.  Of course, it's a great experience for me.  Andy right now is the best player out there.  Of course, he deserves all the credit today.
Q. How difficult was it to play against Andy tonight?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I knew what I had to do.  I didn't execute things the right way.  I did a lot of unforced errors.  First serve was gone.  Andy was just putting everything back in the court.
I didn't feel he played unbelievable tennis, but I felt I just did a lot of mistakes.  For sure he has a lot of confidence right now, a lot of matches behind his back.  For sure he knows how to play in moments like that.  Pretty experienced player.
So, yeah, it's all my fault what happened on the court out there.
Q. Did you feel early on that it wasn't going to be your night tonight?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: The thing is I tried.  It's not that I didn't try.  This is what I just said to my coach right now in the locker room.  I mean, I knew Andy is going to play good tennis.
Even the first game I had breakpoints.  Pretty unlucky I think the first game, especially with the two serves on the line.
What else?  I mean, how would you know?  I mean, anything can happen at any moment during a match.  Obviously the first set, I felt, I mean, okay, it's just the first set.  Slowly I think he was just getting his way into the court.  He was moving me well, playing the right shots, just executing a lot of balls the right way.
Even if I just kept trying, I kept missing or I was going for a little bit too much on the shots.  As I said, Andy is the best player right now out there for me, so he deserved the win today, for sure.
Q. How do you look at your US Open overall?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, as I said, I think it's been a great almost 10 weeks of traveling for me, starting in Washington.  A few stumbles here and there, obviously a lot of traveling, a lot of practice and everything.
I'm kind of looking forward to just step back for maybe a week, just rest a little bit, just analyze what has been happening.  But, as I said, especially the past five, six weeks I feel I've been doing the right things, been really good with my professionalism on and off the court.  Discipline has been better I think overall.  My game plan is a little bit better.
So I think things are moving a little bit forward.  Again, I'm pretty disappointed right now.  It's very hard for me to hide it.  I expected definitely better from myself.  But I just ran out of gas.  I think not so much physically, but I think it was just more emotionally, mentally.  I knew that I was just getting a little bit tired.
