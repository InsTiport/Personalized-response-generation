THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Rogers Cup.   What's your perspective on this tournament?   What do you think about the tournament so far?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It's my second time here.     Obviously it's lovely conditions.   You have a great stadium.   I think all the players are feeling really comfortable out here.   
I was feeling not so good the previous week, so, you know, I tried to lower my expectations a little bit, especially coming into that week, but in the same time I just wanted to come out here and compete.   You know, that's the most important thing for me.  
Every time I enter is to win, so, you know, I'm feeling I'm giving it my 100%.   I'm very excited for my match tomorrow.   I've only seen good so far from here.   It's a great place.  
   
 Q.   What was the problem leading up to this tournament for you?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It was just I got a little sick.   So it happens.  
   
 Q.   Can you assess today's match against Donald Young?   How did you feel it went?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Definitely not an easy match to start with.   Donald has been playing well the past two weeks.   I had my first match on hard court.   So the only thing I could do is come on the court and basically try to play my game.  
Unfortunately I was 4‑1 up in the first set when I just disengaged a little bit and just changed my momentum which caused me the set obviously.  
A dip like that shouldn't be allowed, especially at the level that I want to be in, the level I want to compete.   But after that, I felt like second and third set I really took command on the court, played a few good games and just grabbed it.   There was not much else I could do.  
   
 Q.   How concerned are you about those little dips in concentration when you're not in the match?   Is that the difference between you being at the level you're at and then being No. 1?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   As I said, it's just my first match on hard court for that summer, so I'll just give myself a little bit of credit today for that.   But again, I shouldn't be allowed to have dips like that, especially after having momentum on my side, and I feel I have been playing good tennis throughout the year so far.   
Again, you know, I need to attack that top in a very different way.   As you mentioned, it's probably not the best scenario to think that way if you want to get up to the top.  
   
 Q.   Tommy Robredo next.   Can you talk about a matchup against him?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Definitely one of the toughest opponents.   You know, he's a great competitor.   He's been playing for numerous years so far.   He's very experienced.   He knows his way around the court pretty good.  
What can I say?   It's a great matchup for me.   I'm looking forward to that match, because I just expect for myself to raise my level even a little bit more from today and play better tennis.  
I come out to compete and kind of focus on what I need to be doing right now.  
   
 Q.   A lot of the top players take a break after Wimbledon, as you have, as well.   Do you think that helped you, having the break, or in hindsight maybe you were just better to go with the momentum you had at Wimbledon?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, first of all, there were no tournaments right after Wimbledon.   Of course there were a few, but different surfaces, and I think I have played enough matches to that point of the year.  
So in a way I think it's just good to disengage a little bit and kind of start fresh.   I think it works different for everyone.   I think it's one of the first times that actually I have done that, so we will see how the result will be.  
Actually, I'm not worried at all.   I had a great time.   I don't regret any single day of it.  
   
 Q.   Can you share please how are you going to prepare mentally for the next match?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I mean, I think it's like 7:00 right now.   Definitely try to get back, maybe room service.   Just, you know, get the body going a little bit.   
Here with my physio, so I'm just going to see how the body feels and, you know, get a good night's sleep.   There's not much else we can do about that.   Good thing is now you're playing every day, so you don't have actually time to think or to know what it is.  
It's another match for you.   Just going to get out there and play.  
   
 Q.   When you get out there during the match, do you find yourself that you can focus point by point, or does sometimes your mind wanders, thinks of other things, yet you're still in control?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think your mind wanders, anyway.   That's why it's so tough, especially when you compete at a high level.   Means you have to have that switch and basically switch on and off every time you want to stay focused.  
So that's I think one of the arts I think in any sport is to have that switch, to be in control of that.   I think it's an amazing tool.   And I think today was one of those days that I needed to prove that to me, not only to me but also the opponent on the other side, that I was down the first set, even though I was 4‑1 up, but again I switched it and it was a completely different outcome towards the end of the match.
