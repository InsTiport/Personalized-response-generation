G. DIMITROV/R. Haase
  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Good to be back in Brisbane?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, very nice.   Very nice first match, so to speak, for the new year.   It's a great feeling definitely coming back here.   It's always a nice event to start the year with.
I'm feeling quite comfortable on the court.   Yeah, looking forward to the next round, and hopefully I do good.

Q.   Your form tonight, pretty solid in all areas.   What are you happy with mostly?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think I'm happy definitely with all‑court game.   I mean, I was just really trying to focus on a few things on the game tonight.   Obviously first match in a long time, and it's never easy to get on the court and start competing from where you left off. 
I was happy the way I was serving on the important occasions in every game.   I thought I moved quite well on the court, so a that helped ease up on some points and eventually bring me to good opportunities.
You know, just enjoyed the match actually.

Q.   Tell us a little bit about what you did in the off‑season.   How did you prepare for this year.   Did you change anything in your game from previous years?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Obviously my last match I believe was in Paris, and I mean, obviously I didn't have that much of a rest after that.
But I really tried to focus on just getting back into the gym and then trying to grind out a few sessions early in the off‑season.   Of course, in the last place, I was working with Roger Rasheed.   Definitely the past five, six weeks in the off‑season has been quite a tough, you know, game days and practice days and all that.
But I'm happy that everything turned out to be very positive and actually very great experience as well.   We've worked I think overall in every area.   We never focus on one thing in particular.   We have a higher goals for what we want to do and where we're heading.

Q.   Cilic next.   That's going to be a tough one.   He's unseeded, so to get him this early in the draw is pretty tough. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Obviously if you look at the draw, there is not an easy‑‑ I mean, not an easy first or second round or whatever.   Everyone is pretty happy to come out and play matches, especially after the off‑season.
Everyone wants to come out and compete and see where they're at.   Marin is a very dangerous player, and he's definitely capable of doing a lot of damage.
So I just got to be ready and got to make sure that I'm going to have a good service game, and obviously try to, you know, cover a lot of court.   He has a decent serve as well. 
It's going to be an interesting match.   Of course I'm looking forward to it.   It's a great preparation again for the Aussie Open.

Q.   How did it feel stepping out on court this year after missing out on the final last year?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Obviously didn't expect to come back on the center court that early, but it was great.   I think it's one of those days you really got to embrace it and make the most out of it. 
I felt pretty good coming out on the court today.   First match it's never easy.   You feel like, Oh, man, coming back on the center court, I mean, good and bad memories in the same time. 
Once you're out there and the spotlight hits you, you're changing your thinking, your mind, and all that, so it becomes automatic.   You go into a zone.   You feel you belong there.

Q.   Other players comment about being surprised about how fast the surface is playing. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It is fast.   Well, faster than last year, I believe.   And also from what I'm hearing it's the fastest courts in over 15 years.   I have no idea.   I can only judge for the past four, five years.   It's definitely a little bit faster. 
But, I mean, it's the same for everyone.   In the end of the day, you got to adjust to the conditions. 
Yeah.
