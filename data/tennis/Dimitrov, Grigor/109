 G. DIMITROV/P. Andujar
      6‑4, 6‑4 
   
 Q.   Straight-sets win over Pablo Andujar.   Tell us a little bit about the match today.   
    GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It was tough conditions, a little windy.   Weather wasn't the best.   Of course, everything was different.   
    I didn't play my best, but happy with the win.   Really looking forward to the match tomorrow.   So I just have to get myself together next couple of hours and bounce back for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Playing Novak, always something special.   He is unbeaten here in Beijing.   Something you look forward to extra?  
    GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, he's always been playing good out here, which is pretty good.   
    At the same time I like my chances.   I've been practicing well.   I had a good block before the last bit of the season.   In a way I'm excited to just come out there and play that match.   
    Of course, I don't put myself a lot of expectations.   Everything is just to win.   I'm going to give my all.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel in general?   A couple weeks left in the season, a lot at stake at the end of the year.   
    GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Tough to say 'a couple weeks' when you have to play four or five more tournaments till the end of the year.   
    Yeah, got to stay positive knowing you had a good block before that, had a bit of a rest.   That should inspire you to play better and be excited.   
    I don't feel the season is over.   I don't think it's even over, especially when you're preparing in the off‑season.   Everything is around the corner.   That makes it special.
