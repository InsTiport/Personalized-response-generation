G. DIMITROV/F. Delbonis
  6‑3, 6‑0, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   I want to know if you are going to play in the tie against Luxembourg. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I still don't know.   Still don't know about that.   Hopefully if everything goes well, and according to my schedule, I think I will decide pretty much last minute.   Nothing is sure till the end.
If it fits with my schedule, I will definitely have that and come over.

Q.   So you still have to play one tie for the Olympics.
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   We'll see.   As I say, it's always tricky with Davis Cup.   If it interferes with your schedule and what you've got to do, it's always tricky, but, I mean, I can play next year, as well. 
So if you think about it ‑‑or later in the year.   So it's just a tough decision to make right now.
