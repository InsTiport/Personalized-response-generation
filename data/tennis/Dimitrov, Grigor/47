G. DIMITROV/P. Carreno Busta
6-1, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your last two matches were very impressive.  Before this semifinal, would you not prefer to play more tennis matches with more crucial points to enforce you mentally?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, I don't look at it that way.  Every match is for me to come out there and play my game.  If my game is working well, we saw the results.  That's just simple as that.  If I'm playing well, this is a great outcome.
But, yeah, I wish I could time that feeling to be tight at certain moments, to have that tough games.  But this is what it is right now.  I accept it.  I embrace it.  Yeah, whatever next comes at me, I just have to be ready.
Q. What is it about Jack's game that you found difficult recently?  What do you think being on an indoor hard court is going to bring you?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: He is not an ordinary player.  He really uses his strengths very good.  I think he obviously has improved a lot on his game, played pretty much throughout the whole year, very strong finish of the year, yeah, won a Masters.  Obviously he's riding on confidence right now.
But, yeah, I mean, it's a game I think obviously a lot of players are pretty dangerous, but again, I think he just uses his strengths better than some other players.
Q. Where do you find motivation in a situation where you're in and he's already out?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: It's not easy to think knowing that you have to play anyway tomorrow.  I mean, winning, losing, you still have to go and play again.  I just didn't want to think anything else.  You know what, I'm going to take it as just another match.  Also I wanted to play good.  I wanted to keep on going with the style that I've been doing so far.
Again, I don't think I did anything outrageous or crazy.  I followed my game well and didn't make mistakes.  I think the simplicity helped me to play such a good game, to go through those matches in such a manner.
Q. Jack is a different player to David and Pablo.  How are you going to approach this match differently?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I don't think I'm going to be trying anything different, to be honest.  I'm just going to focus on my side of the net, my game.  Again, he has his game, I have my game.  Simple as that.  I don't think either one of us is going to try to do anything different in order to win.
Obviously, the fight is going to be out there.  But, yeah, I don't feel like I want to change anything in my game or try something new or different from what's working.  Why change if things are going well for you?
Q. Andy Murray just announced that he's split with Ivan Lendl.  As someone who has one of his old coaches in your ranks, are you worried he might come after Dani?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: If I'm worried?  No.
Q. And your reaction to the news?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, this is a choice.  It's not their first time splitting up anyways.  Maybe it's just a temporary thing.  I don't know what's going on in his team.
Yeah, I mean, I'm not worried.  If you ask me if he's going to take Dani, no.  Obviously I can wish him only the best.  I hope he has a speedy recovery.  I miss playing against him.  I miss practicing against him.
Yeah, hopefully has a speedy recovery, probably see him next year at some point.
Q. You said after the Goffin match it was important not to overthink.  How have you been able to arrive at the place where you can play instinctually and let it flow?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: That was the goal today, obviously not to overthink, not to think that I'm already playing on Saturday.  It's just match by match.
Yeah, for me it's just important to focus on these things right now.  The simplicity really helps me right now.  I'm not overthinking.  Even when I play my game, I miss a ball, is miss a ball, on to the next one.  I want to do keep that momentum going.  Yeah, ultimately it turned out to be another great day in the office.
