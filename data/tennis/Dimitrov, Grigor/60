6-4, 6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Did you feel that was about Roger being in peak form, or did you feel you could have given it more?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, I'm for sure disappointed with the outcome.  I didn't play my best tennis.  Of course, if you don't play good against Roger, especially here on grass, it's very difficult.   
Yeah, but overall I'm disappointed in myself, that I couldn't play better.  I did a lot of unforced errors, and my first serve was not on point.  Without those weapons, it's never easy to play against him.   
 Q.  Were those factors there because it was him?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No.  You know, I think that factor with the pressure and all that, it's way past.  If I'm out there on the court, it's to win, of course.  It doesn't matter who is in front of me.  I need to be able to play my game and make sure that if I win, I win on my terms, and if I lose, I lose on my terms.   
But, yeah, today nothing was going my way, absolutely nothing.  I mean, shame.  I really felt I was on a good path.  I felt I think physically very strong.  Didn't waste that much energy the previous matches.   
But yeah, I guess I need to accept this like this.  I need to move on now, yeah, just start preparing for whatever's ahead of me.   
 Q.  How did you rate Roger today?  Based on what you've seen, how do you think he could go on?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Honestly, I don't want to judge from one match especially.  I don't want to say that.  It's early in the second week.  For sure, with each match you get confidence.  I think he played good, especially set two and three.  I think first, we were both a little tight, trying to find the way to play the game.   
Yeah, he found it faster.  Yeah, I think his serve today was really the key against me.   
 Q.  In a match like this, how much are you keying on the first set?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I think I played a poor game at 4-All.  Actually, I missed a few balls by an inch.  Could have easily gone either way.   
Yeah, I mean, again, honestly, there's not much else I can say about the match, especially that I haven't even taken a set.  I wasn't able to, as I said, play my game.   
I felt towards the end of the match a little bit better, I was tracking the ball a little bit better, but still that didn't really help.
