(INTERVIEW OF GRIGOR DIMITROV)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  First question just about, how do you feel?  Did you practice already? How did you feel on court? How did you feel the court here in Rome?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Oh, it's good.  I mean, today and yesterday I was out on the court and just trying to find fine-tunings for the last days now.   
I think I've been  hitting the ball well, but still I feel I haven't found my game right now.  So, for sure, I'm not at my best right now.   
But that's - - I guess that's okay.  I still have couple of days to get ready, to get used to the conditions and everything.  So, hopefully, in the next couple of days I can really step out there and raise my game a little bit more.   
 Q.  Did you set any goal for yourself for the clay season?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Not right now.  As I said, I'm still not there.  I feel like the game is not as consistent as I would like it to be and still missing some of the shots that I feel that I should not miss.   
So, yeah, I'm just -- I think I'm a little off balance for the moment.  But, that's okay.  You know, it's good to go through moments like that and kind of look into me and see what I can do in the next couple of days to get better.  Simple as that.   
But again, I'm positive.  I think my mental state is pretty good, so I'm just gonna try to get better on that note.   
 Q.  Do you think this lack of consistency is the only thing you are missing to get back to the level you showed up in London, maybe?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, I don't know.  I wish I could say.   
Like there were, I think, a few things.  But right now, it's just not - -  for me, it's just to focus on the game a little bit more, that's all.  Just to make sure that I do a lot of repetitions and just don't miss the shots that I should miss.   
You know, it's clay, so you get your opportunities, you get your chances.  And you just need to be there.
