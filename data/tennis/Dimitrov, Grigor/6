D. MEDVEDEV/G. Dimitrov
7-6, 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What are your thoughts on the match overall?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, good match overall. I think it was just a few points here and there. Yeah, three sets to love, but, I mean, the score for me doesn't justify the match itself.
I think it was a good level. Overall he played really well, fought hard, a lot of the key points he played well. So, yeah, I mean, I don't want to be too down on myself. Great weeks. First time in semifinal out here.
Just going to take a lot of the positives, for sure.
Q. How did Medvedev look to you? Do you think he can carry this into another match?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, anything's possible. You get the chance to be in the final, so you got to leave everything out there. I mean, of course, if he keeps going the same way, plays the same, I think absolutely he's got a major shot.
Yeah, I think the two days definitely helped him, but it helped me in the same time. Yeah, I mean, I think overall it was a great match on both ends.
Q. Do you feel you did leave everything out there?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I think so. As I said, I just didn't play good enough on those key points, especially I think the set point in the first set, I knew what he's going to do. He came up with the goods.
Second set, again, I was not able to get free points on my serve, or on his for that matter. He used the court pretty well.
Yeah, but, I mean, for sure I'm critical of myself. I think absolutely I could have done better on certain occasions. Again, I don't want to go too deep right now on myself.
Q. How differently do you think the match goes if some of those points go differently in your direction?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, I would have been one set to love up. Second set would have been I think very different. I might have been able to go for different shots.
I don't know. I might have tried to change up a little bit or reassess what I've done well in the first set, kind of start doing it again in the second.
First set was in the past, so I only could look what's happening after.
Q. What are the strengths of Medvedev's game?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I've played couple of times against him. I think one of the strengths is sometimes you don't know where he serves, first or second serve. That sometimes can be misleading at times like big points.
I think he just fights right. That's it. He puts every ball in the court. Somehow he gets to the balls. Doesn't give you enough free points. I think that's the major thing that I see right now. In a way, I feel like everything else is pretty predictable. I can see that early on.
Yeah, I mean, I think he's also riding a good wave of playing great tennis, a lot of confidence. That helps a lot, for sure.
Q. When you fall behind two sets to love, a difficult spot, do past experiences creep into your head?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Actually I was very positive in the third set really. I mean, I still had chances, again. Honestly, there's not much to say. Just because I was there, it's best-of-five, anything can happen. You never know. You got to go till the end.
I mean, I will definitely watch the match and see if I could have done any different in any type of situations. But I think, again, a few times it was 30-All, 30-15, just came up with the goods. I came up to the net, it was either a pass or a really good ball, bottom line.
So I had to go for something very difficult. In a sense, he was provoking me to miss certain shots that I usually wouldn't miss or I would have enough time to hit a volley. Just the small details.
I do believe I've given everything of myself out there in the match today. I still felt that I could have done something else, I just don't know what it is right now.
