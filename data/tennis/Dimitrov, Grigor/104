  3‑6, 6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How would you rate your first match of the season? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Tough to rate it with one word, I would say.   First of all, I'm really happy that I won the match, because it's just never easy coming out and playing such a match.   Mean, I felt that I fought really hard, but still I think a little bit far from the game, a little bit rusty. 
But I was happy I was on top of the match, and I knew that I had to play a little bit better to win.   Think this is the only thing I could do today.

Q.   What did you do during off‑season?   Did you go to Australia? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   No, no.   I spent a bit of time in L.A., so I think this is where I ‑‑ we had the whole season with Roger Rasheed and my physio staff, so it was a great off‑season.
We really good a lot of work.   I think physically I've improved, raised my level a little bit, and I think also it showed today.   I think after playing two and a half hours I felt really fresh and that I could have gone another two and a half hours, which is good sign. 
I got to take that match as positive.   In a way, I'm also excited to get on the court again and try to improve my game.

Q.   When you prepare yourself in the off‑season and you talk with Roger, do you set goals for the next season?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Of course we have goals.   But I think the one thing I like to say is that every week you have a goal, and that is to win the tournament.   That's the most important thing.   It's the most important thing for me.   One week can change the whole goals and schedule and all that. 
So overall, you know, we are really particular for certain things, and I think we'll keep that for ourselves now.

Q.   Last year you think that the year was a good season for you?   Reaching the top 10 I guess meant a lot for you. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, I think it was my best year, that's for sure.   Still, there are a lot more things that I want to achieve.
In a way, I don't want to be greedy now for that, but I'm really happy that I was injury‑free and I could complete a really good season with a lot of good wins.
There is just a lot of tournaments to be played, so let's see how the year will be.

Q.   Did you hear that many people said that it could be your year and you could win your first Grand Slam this year.   What do you think of that?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, that sounds very nice, so hopefully.   Now that you put it that way, happy for that, of course. 
But, you know, tennis is action.   With the talk you're never going to go any further than what it is.
I need to prove that, and I think the most important thing is I need to prove to myself.   Only then I can say, Yeah, I won a Grand Slam.   Until then, we can just have our presumptions.

Q.   Is there one thing you need to improve to reach top 5 or reach Grand Slam?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think I've been pretty close both ways.   I think I just need to be consistent, play well, win big tournaments.
After that, the points are starting to roll, we have easier tournaments, and then when you get to certain opponents, need to be able to pass.   You know, next thing you know, you might hold a trophy.   I think that's the biggest reward.

Q.   Off‑season, major changes?   Little things? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think I've reached a level that it's not about the major changes.   It's more of the details on what we need to focus on and work on. 
So there have been a lot of I would say details that we really focused on, especially off the court and how we prepare to get on the court.
So I think those things are going to play a bigger role in my year. 

Q.   Do you feel like you have to be more aggressive consistently? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I always consider myself an aggressive player, so I'm going to stick to what I believe and the way I want to present myself, especially when I come on court or against the players I'm playing.
Sometimes your game is not there, so you need to sort of count on something else.   As I said, you cannot focus on one thing in particular.   You got to be ready for whatever is on the other side.
I think today was a great example.   Even though I wanted to play my game and my rhythm, against players like that it's never easy.   You have to pull something else out of the bag.

Q.   So top 10, everyone knows you're there.   Do you see top 5 this year?   Could you get to No. 1?   You're playing all the big guys very close now. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   There is always possibility for everything, I would say.   I think the first step is definitely top 5.   From there you can sort of see the end, and that's the top.
In order to do that, you need to win slams and big tournaments.   That's just proven.   There is no other way.   There is no shortcuts.   Play your best tennis, give your heart out, and anything can happen.
