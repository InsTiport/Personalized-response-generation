  4‑6, 6‑4, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you just sort out how difficult it was to win a match against Anderson who has such a big serve and he's so powerful?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, I mean, I think you need a dozen of everything.   I think it was a very tough match, first of all.   I mean, I didn't expect it to go like this.   
Going into the third set was one of these things that you just want to ‑‑you want to see what's gonna happen and kind of hope for some serves and something to ‑‑I mean, in order for you to get back the serve.   He was serving‑‑ he's one of the biggest servers I've ever played.   
Today, I mean, he served ‑‑I was basically kind of stuck after the first set, but thank God it rained so I had time to go back in the locker and had time to review the first set and see what I did good and see what I did bad.  
I mean, in the end I had to just kind of find a way to put the ball in the court somehow here and there.   I think that's what happened in the second and third set.   After I think I was just ‑‑I was just more, how do you say, more focused and more steady than him.  
I saw he started missing a few first serves, so I put the ball in, I put his second serve back, and, I mean, also it was kind of windy so that didn't help much.  
So, I mean, the whole match was a bit weird in general.   I mean, it was ups and downs, but, I mean, it's important end result.  
   
 Q.   You seemed to get quite emotional at the end, as well.   Did you have a little cry?   Why was that?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   No, I got couple of tears.   No, it was a good moment.   I always wanted to share this with, you know, with the people that I love.   I mean, unfortunately not everyone could have been here, but who knows that I'm going to be in the semis.   
So I was glad because my father was there, and I think it was a big moment for him mainly.   I mean, for me, too, but I think it was more and more on his side, because I know how we have been together and all that.   We had our thing.   I think that was great.   You know, I thank him basically.   That's what I told him after the match.   I think it was an awesome experience for us.  
   
 Q.   The draw seems to have opened up quite well for you now.   Do you think you can go on and win it?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, sure.   I mean, everything can happen here in the semis.   I don't know who I'm playing tomorrow, but you gotta go day by day.   You cannot expect coming on court tomorrow or play against a guy that is not seeded or something and be like, Okay, I think that's going to be an easy one for me.   I think those guys are actually the most dangerous ones.  
I mean, other thing is grass.   You can expect anything any time, and you just gotta stay in the game and do the best you can.   Well, I mean, also the weather and all this, the conditions are important, obviously.   
So, you know, keep, you know, put the feet on the ground and just go another day.  
   
 Q.   Anderson threatened to come back and take your break away in the third.   What was your mindset then?   You handled the situation pretty well, it seemed.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, I mean, it was tough to serve against the wind, obviously.   And I think he played one of his best matches against me, I have to say.   
I mean, he was hitting the ball also very good from the baseline, which I didn't expect so much.   But in general he was very solid, so I was always kind of I wanted to be careful for his shots or how he's gonna develop his game.   Well, I had to just count on my first serve and good placement and all these things.  
I just wanted to kind of just stick into the point, and, well, if he would have broke me back, well, probably would have played still, so, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Were you nervous then?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, a little.   Yeah, but not that nervous to shag the ball or something, so thank God.  
   
 Q.   When you had a little break, it looked like you had a chat with one of the ball girls.   Can you give us an idea what you were talking about?   
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   (Smiling.)   I think I just said, How are you doing?   I said, Do you think we gonna finish the match?   
I don't know.   I was chewing gum.   I don't remember.   Yeah, actually, I was chewing the gum, and these changeovers, yeah, I just asked how old is she and stuff.   She seems to smile all the time, so she couldn't talk much.   So I don't know.   She was nice.
