G. DIMITROV/D. Goffin   
6-0, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You don't have the experience of other players in this tournament, but today it was amazing, or was Goffin very tired?  What happened out there?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I can only speak for myself.  I mean, obviously I played well.  It's something I cannot hide.   
I was just following my game.  Just simple as that.  I mean, I didn't think I did who knows what.  But I think my focus was very good.  I started the match well.  I was using every opportunity.  I took care of all of the balls that I had to.  I won the most important points, especially in the first set.   
So, yeah, this really helps I think.  Especially in this tournament, I mean, each set, each game, each point matters and counts.   
Yeah, once you're into the game, once you're into the match, you don't think about anything but how you can play better.  I don't know, maybe also David had some health problems or something.   
Yeah, on my side, it was definitely a good day in the office.   
 Q.  In the second set, I think the fifth game, Goffin took you to three deuces.  Did you start to get a bit rattled at that point, get a bit nervous he might make a bit of a comeback?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, against David, you always got to be ready.  That's why I knew even after that first set, I was like, Wow, I know this is the score, but he's not just going to give up.  I had to stay focused.   
He made I think a few pretty good returns.  I think actually I let him play pretty good on a few points.  He got into the court I felt a little bit.  Then I let him play his game.   
But, yeah, I saw that right away.  I think I just put the brakes on it pretty fast.  I think after that game, I actually remember that game very clearly, I was a little bit also more certain how I wanted to play and how I was performing throughout the whole time.   
Yeah, after that, I don't know if I relaxed a little bit more, but obviously my confidence was growing with each game.   
 Q.  Many people compared you to Federer at the beginning.  Now this is your best season so far.  Do you think more people are starting to appreciate you for your individual achievements as opposed to comparing you to other players?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, I think the comparisons and all this, they don't really matter any more.  As I said before, I'm saying it now, I'm really looking after my game and what I'm doing right.   
Yeah, I think one of the wrong things you can do is to try to follow somebody else or try to, as I said, follow in the footsteps, the things that they have done.   
But, yeah, I think clearly I played a great match today.  I'm happy with it.  I mean, now you're into the tournament, two matches under your belt.  You slowly start to get out there.  I'm looking forward.   
 Q.  I think you got a coaching violation in the second set.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, that was very weird, to be honest.  I have no idea why.  But it's fine.  It's okay, yeah.  I accepted it.   
I mean, when you're so zoomed into the match, I don't even pay attention to all that.  I think the side umpire went to say that.  Okay, I get it.   
But, yeah, I had a warning from the umpire before that anyway because he says, Next time you get a time violation.  Especially when I was on the other side, I guess that rattled him, too.   
All came together.  I accept it (smiling).   
 Q.  You spoke on court about the first set, how you played so well.  I think you said something about everything you touched turned to gold.  Talk a bit about that, and how often you feel you get in the zone like that during the season.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I think you get in the zone pretty often.  I mean, in order to win, you need to get to that point.  I think the beginning of the match really set up the tone for the whole, yeah, match.  I think early on I just really went for my shots.  I created opportunities.  I used those opportunities.  Just everything, whatever, I felt I was trying to do really paid off.   
Yeah, to be able to be consistent against one of the top guys for that amount of period was great for me.  I think it helps me.  It helps me also to realize what I've done good and what's working and what's not.  Yeah, especially after that first set, I think I kept on playing the same game, trying to create even more opportunities.   
I didn't feel I did something, I mean, outrageous or anything.  I just felt that I was right there when I had to be.   
 Q.  Considering the whole season you had, do you think this match was maybe the best since Australia?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: It could be.  I've played I think a little bit over 50 matches right now, 40 something.  I think I need to sit down and think about it, but right now, from the top of my head, this is definitely the one that sticks out in terms of consistency, focus, striking the ball, movement, agility, everything that I can possibly think.   
Yes, it happens.  Again, I work for those moments, too.  They don't just come.  They don't just come to you.  Again, when you recognize that, you might as well make the most out of it.   
 Q.  Something away from the match.  Next week is the Davis Cup Final with France hosting Belgium.  Who do you think will win and what are your thoughts on the final?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Who do I think is going to win?   
 Q.  Yes, and why.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Oh, didn't think about that.  But you're right.   
I mean, obviously I know who is going to play for France and, yeah, who is going to play for Belgium.  I think who is going to win?  I'm sorry, mate, I have no idea who is going to win.   
I think it's just going to be an interesting, interesting final.  I think it's going to mean a lot to either team.   
I mean, I've never been on such a stage of a Davis Cup, but I can only guess how important that is, not only to them, to the country.  Yeah, I think there's going to be some great tennis that's going to be produced out there.   
I think a lot of the players have obviously been playing till the end of the season.  Now David is out here still fighting in London.   
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.  I'm sure, yeah, if I have the time, which I'm not sure I will, going to rest a little from tennis (smiling), but it will be kind of interesting to see a few of the matches.   
 Q.  Nadal said the other day that against you he played one of his two best matches.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, he said that to me, too.   
 Q.  That gives you some sort of satisfaction, I guess.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Really?  I lost four times this year.  C'mon (smiling).   
 Q.  So it doesn't give you satisfaction, okay.  What about the best ranking, if that gives you some more confidence?  Last thing is, you are Bulgarian, you were born in Haskovo.  You lived in Paris, are a resident of Monte-Carlo.  You had a Russian girlfriend in Los Angeles.  I'd like to know if you think about yourself as a citizen of the world?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: You mentioned only one girlfriend in there?  Man, c'mon (laughter).  And you missed two other countries I lived in.  Anyway, fair enough, fair enough.   
Well, obviously ranking, it's something that was definitely a goal of mine by the end of the year.  I just wanted to end up the year top 10 this year and obviously play out here.  Obviously, things have gone better than expected, and I appreciate that.   
Again, right now, I just want to say, I'm still thinking about my match on Friday.  Every match is important to me.  I just want to prepare and give myself the best shot till the end of the season.  That's what's more important to me right now.   
Yeah, the rest, what can you say?  The tennis lifestyle, it can go in so many directions, man.  I mean, one day I would like to talk about it, absolutely.  I think everyone is going to hear.  I think I have a lot to say on that matter.   
Right now, I'm enjoying one of my best seasons.  I'm still here, happy.   
 Q.  (Off microphone.)  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: There's nothing to escape.  Ask me something directly, I'll tell you.  You didn't ask me.  You just stated the facts (laughter).   
 Q.  I want to know the countries where you live better, where you see yourself better in the future.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I wish I knew.  I think it took me quite a few years to settle myself where I'm at right now.  But deep down in my heart, I'm Bulgarian.  I still have a Bulgarian passport.  I compete for Bulgaria.  (Indiscernible) my Bulgarian flag.  I'm proud to be Bulgarian.  Zero shame of anything of that, or anywhere else I lived in the world.   
I think the most important thing for whoever it is, is to find your own balance, find your way to coexist obviously with yourself and follow your dreams, follow your goals.  Once you find that, why change?   
I think right now I feel like I have a solid team, kind of a solid house behind me.  Everything is compact to the point I feel comfortable with.  I don't think I'm sacrificing anything in my life right now.   
 Q.  You mentioned this is one of your most successful years in a while, a bit like 2014 was.  Could you put your finger on what it is you think has changed this year that has brought the success back?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I don't think that many things.  Well, Dani Vallverdu deserves a lot of credit.  He came into the team at a very crucial moment a couple of years ago.  I mean, everybody that has been in my team deserves a lot of credit.  Without that, I wouldn't be the same guy.  Again, it also comes down to the whole team, of course, Dani, my family, closest friends.  This is the base of everything.   
For me, this is such an important part.  If I'm all good with that, in a way nothing else matters.  It doesn't matter if I'm going to play on a center court or on Court 18 if I have all that sorted out.  Like this, you all have the same goal together.  You strive to be better.  I think automatically you build up such a bond that just things starting to come together.   
Yes, of course I've worked a lot on and off the court.  I felt I've been pretty consistent, playing well.  Yeah, I think just a little bit of everything.  I think every small success we're trying to build on and build on.  That's why you're here on that stage right now, because this is what you deserve.  Also you get what you put in.
