G. DIMITROV/S. Wawrinka
  6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Was it a bit weird on the court against Stan, who was missing a lot?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I like to believe I was the cause of him missing that many balls.   I got on top of the match pretty early.   I broke him in the first game of the first set.   I had a good momentum to sort of feed off, then in the same time I was playing a good tennis. 
In a way I just felt that I'm doing a good job.   The only thing I could do is play my game, just having less mistakes.   I think all that in a way paid off in a good way for me.

Q.   Is this week the best tennis you've played since a while?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I would say yes and no.   If you look at it from the tennis point of view, yeah, maybe.   As a performance, even though I haven't played that many matches this year, the beginning of the year I had a good start. 
I don't think of it that way because I'm focused on each tournament and what's my goal.   I think this is pretty much the most important part for me at the moment, to look after my matches. 

Q.   I saw you playing very well yesterday against Fognini and today even better, or is it just two different opponents with different games? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   First, it's two different opponents.   Second is that I think I was just very consistent.   I had a good level yesterday.   I felt that early on today I had a good level, too.   For me, I didn't have to do anything else in a way.   I didn't have to improvise much.   All I had to do is play a solid game. 
I think that was pretty much it for me.   Everything else was just coming and I was playing good, game after game, starting to feel a bit more confident.   Again, I didn't think Stan played his best tennis, that's true.   Everyone saw that.   But winning is winning. 

Q.   It's a long time since you haven't beaten a top 30 player, since Toronto last year.   Is it a new click or new start?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Depends what kind of click you're talking about. 
No, I haven't felt I've been lacking to beat higher‑ranked players in a way.   If you think about it, the competition nowadays is so tough and so big, you can't really think like that. 
I mean, if you see a guy that is, let's say, ranked 40, you can easily lose to him if you're not there, if you're not playing a good tennis. 
There's just so many components that are out in the game, if you allow yourself to think that way, I think you're going to lose every day. 

Q.   Looking at your earlier successes, I would say that your grass court game is your greatest strength, then hard court.   You seem to be improving all the time on the clay.   Would you agree with that?   Which surface do you enjoy playing on mostly?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I always felt I'm playing pretty much good on any surface.   Of course, grass is my preferable.   Of course, I like hard court. 
But I grew up on clay.   My early years, I mean, they were pretty much on clay.   Yeah, so, I mean, I feel quite comfortable.   In the same time I had quite a bit of time after Miami to come back here and start practicing.   I think that was one of my best preparations I had.   I felt that I've done everything in a good and a positive way.   The results are here for now. 

Q.   If you have to choose where to play the match of your life, which surface would you pick?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Match of my life?   I'll go grass, for sure. 

Q.   Because could be the final of Wimbledon?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Could be.   Could be my dream match (smiling). 

Q.   Rafa is playing with a different racquet.   What about your new racquet?   In Rotterdam it looks like you were playing with a different racquet. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   What's happening with Rafa's racquet? 

Q.   He's using a different one with more open strings.   It's not like yours.   You were playing with a different model in Rotterdam. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   When it comes to racquets, I think it's a really personal feeling for each player.   I think to go through that period is I would say one of the most painful periods for a tennis player.   I mean, the game is evolving.   You change as a player.   The game is changing.   Everything is changing in a way.   Part of that is the racquet, as you mention. 
I think it's really whatever suits for everyone.   I've been playing with pretty much the same racquet since quite some time.   But I just had to go through the whole process of finding the final tune‑up for me.   I think now that I'm a little bit older, I know how my game is a little bit more, I know how my body is reacting. 
As I said, it's a very delicate situation.   I think every player goes through that at least once in his tennis career. 

Q.   Is that the final of the season?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It's pretty much the final frame.   But now it's all the rest, you know, that comes with it.

Q.   How do you see the next match against GaÃ«l?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It will be interesting.   Is always interesting match when GaÃ«l is on court.   In the same time I feel, you know, very happy to come out and play. 
I think this is the first big feeling for me I had in a long time.   I'm kind of happy to come out there on the court and just also test myself. 
It's never easy coming to play the first match.   The next day you're a little sore, you feel like your body is not reacting well.   I like these moments, to go through that.   Now I feel I'm in a good balance. 
Playing against GaÃ«l, it's always tricky.   He had a good win today.   Obviously that's going to give him a lot of confidence.   He would like to come out on court and show it tomorrow.   There's no secret in that.   But in the same time, I mean, I'm here to win.   As I said before, whoever I play, I'm there to win. 

Q.   What is the toughest against him?   Is it that you can't really guess what he's going to do?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I mean, he has his game.   You know, he has his game.   I can't tell you one thing in particular because, again, you never know what's going to happen.   It can be unbelievable shots, the next thing it can be something different. 
I think overall you just got to be really ready for whatever is in front of you.   Might have a good day, come out on the court, everything goes like I want to, but there's always a possibility of the other way.   Once you have that opportunity, you grab it. 

Q.   Is it patience that you need the most when you have to play a guy like Monfils?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think patience in any match right now, especially when you play on clay court...   What else can I say?   Of course, patience is one of the things.   Attacking is also going to be a good asset to my game.   I'm an aggressive player and I like to do that. 
I don't think I'm going to go out of my way just because of the other player's game.
