  6‑3, 7‑6, 3‑6, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. How good does it feel to get a tough win in against a tough player on grass?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Excellent, excellent, excellent. I mean, I didn't expect anything less from me today. I came out on the court and I played a very solid, I think, two sets.   
Third one was a little, I think, just I think not doubt, but I was not hitting the ball as well. I did a few unforced errors, but, you know, back at the fourth, I felt very comfortable.   
I had quite a bit of fuel in the tank, which is a good sign. I was going after my shots. I broke him twice to finish the match. So it was a good match overall for me.  
   
 Q. Do you feel that losing the third and struggling and kind of reflecting on some of the hard matches you have had, ones that you have played really well, but not come out on top, and then to be able to get the fourth, coming back from a break down...   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I was just saying, Not again.   
Also, I have been, I think, quite a bit unfortunate with some of my matches the past months, I would say. I just figured, well, it is what it is. I can't do anything about it. But the only thing I can do is give myself the best shot possible.  
When I got to that point, when I got to that feeling, you know, I just kept playing my game. My excitement for the game was there, which always helps. The positivity brings you good shots, good decisions.  
I was like, I'm not losing that match, even if it went into a fifth.   
   
 Q. What went through your mind at the end of that, you won 7‑1, that tiebreak and then it was like all of a sudden, the focus went...   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I was actually up 1‑Love and I had break point, and I think that break point cost me a little bit. I didn't think about it, but I knew he's gonna change his game a little bit, and the problem is I fell into that trap.  
And, yeah, I was just following his game for a set. Set and a little bit. I think that didn't help me at all. You know, I started taking the wrong decisions, and I was not following my game plan. I was not going after my shots enough.  
Then I knew that as soon as the third set was over, it was like, Okay, you can't do that again. Yeah, and I tried to correct myself.   
Even though we had quite a few big rallies I think in the fourth, even though I was up a break, I knew I was returning well, serving well when I had to, and I had the confidence to finish the match.  
   
 Q. What did you make of having to play in the rain? Because Gilles didn't seem to be particularly happy with how the officials dealt with it. He seemed a bit frustrated that you carried on for a bit. Did you notice him being frustrated? Did that help you?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, I mean, everyone has their own way. I understand his frustration. But, you know, it's whatever, it's for him is the same for me.  
I think it's just, you know, we have all the officials out there. We had the umpire coming down, the supervisor, so all these guys are taking unbelievable care of us, you know, to protect us and to take the right decisions and all that.  
I know when there is a little mist in the air, the grass is a little slippery. Yeah, we all know that. That's logistics, yes. And you just try not to push too much, so you don't want to slide. You have to be a bit more cautious.  
But, you know, in the same time, it's whatever is for him, is the same for me. You know, it's like we are both in it together, yeah.   
   
 Q. It doesn't really bother you just to realize that's what it is and you just get on with it?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, you can't fight the weather, you know. It's like things in life you can definitely fight...   
   
 Q. He seems to get frustrated by it, where it doesn't seem to frustrate you.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I don't think he gets frustrated. My personal opinion, I don't think he gets frustrated. That's just, you know, I guess how it is.   
He's a cool guy, though. We have mutual respect and all that, but everyone has their own ways...   
   
 Q. I'm just basing it on what he said after the match.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I don't know what he said.  
   
 Q. He said he was annoyed.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Well, then I guess he was.   
   
 Q. In the past you have had some good moments with Novak on camera. These things kind of go viral, back and forth. Do you guys ever think about doing a TV show or something?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Me and him? (Laughter.)  
 Q. It's pretty entertaining stuff.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV: We never spoke about it. Obviously, I mean, we're neighbors in a way. We live close by in Monaco and our countries are next to each other.  
I don't know. Maybe you should ask him next time. It's kind of cool. I mean, I'm happy to do whatever videos and stuff with him. It's fun.  
   
 Q. Did you ever ask him for advice? I mean, he's obviously in this other planet. Do you ever hit him up and ask him for tips on this consistency, longevity of the way he's playing?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I would say not yet. I would say this is ‑‑I mean, I think we're still competing against each other and believe it or not, we all have egos. You know, it's very hard to take it out and put it in your pocket and ask another player.   
Yeah, we all talk and discuss a lot of things in the locker room, yes, of course. But when it comes to tennis and, you know, professional stuff, I think it's a pretty fine line there that we are, like, I think keep a distance on.  
I think if that happens, there will be just a few players that I'll definitely ask, but it wouldn't be him at that point, I guess.  
   
 Q. You had a good run a couple years ago. You beat Andy Murray. Up until today, it's been a while since you have had back‑to‑back wins. Do you feel like this is the kind of thing that can get your confidence back to where you were a couple years ago?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Absolutely. With each match you get more and more confident. You start to feel the grass more, your movement more, your shots, your routine. Everything becomes very natural. You get in a good rhythm. So that gives you that calmness when you come out on the court.  
But for me, I mean, honestly I'm trying not to think so much about what happened two years ago, because if I just keep playing on that, oh, I had unbelievable Wimbledon two years ago, I will never be able to do better. In a way, I just don't want to live in the past. I take all the good moments and the good experience, yes, indeed I do.  
But if I want to get even further, there is just obviously a long way to go. But in the same time, I just ‑‑I need to focus and follow how I want to be and how I want to structure the whole tournament and any other tournament ahead.
