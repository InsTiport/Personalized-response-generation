THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. I'd like to know what you think of the draw. Was it accessible for you?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Everything has to be accessible.  If you're out here, you're No. 4 seed, and I think everything is, in a way, in your hands.  You know, you need to focus on what you have to do right now, focusing on the matches, and just take it one match at a time.  I think that's the most important.
I think there is a lot of good and quality players, especially early in each round.  So, yeah, in a way you need to be ready for anything that's ahead of me right now.
Also, the past weeks haven't gone the way I wanted it or expected it, and then, yeah, so for me it's just the importance of focusing on each opponent.  My No. 1 priority right now is my first match.  Let's start from there and hope it goes well.
Q. French Open is not a Grand Slam where you succeed a lot.  How can you explain this?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I wish I could tell you more about it.  It's just I never found, I guess, the right way of playing here.  I think quite a few rounds was I struggled with early rounds out here.  I was not -- I mean, not playing as good as I wanted to, but that's the best thing is you can always try, not only next year, but next week.
I think that's one of the best things in tennis.  Yeah, I'm just looking forward to get out there and play again.  I'm always excited when I come out here.  Always pleased, you know, to have a good preparation, so I'm always coming earlier out here.
I'm going to give everything that I have for the last event on clay this year.
