G. DIMITROV/R. Gasquet   
6-3, 6-2, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel about going onto the court so late, two minutes before midnight?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, a lot of thoughts can go through your head around that time.  The past couple of days I've been going to bed pretty late just to get the feel going to bed late.  I don't fall asleep if the match goes on.   
But again tonight, I'm just happy I finished in straight sets and I didn't have to waste more energy or more time on the court.  So I'm just happy with that.   
 Q.  Was there any talk about a curfew, a midnight curfew?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Meaning?   
 Q.  You couldn't go on after a certain hour.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I've never heard of that.  We had matches in the past finishing 4, 5 in the morning.  It's in the game.  Whatever it is, it's in the game.  I just had to deal with whatever was in front of me.  Yeah, I'm just moving along now.   
 Q.  What kind of impact do you think it will have on your tournament moving into the latter rounds?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: For sure a match like that, it helps me.  I helps me to have more confidence, to feel better on the court, more secure in my shots.  Just a lot of positives.  Take a lot of positives out of that match.  The first couple of matches were so-so in my opinion.  To be able to come tonight and step up against a player like Richard, it means a lot to me, gives me good credit.  In the same time I just need to focus now, just need to keep the same line, just control what I can.   
 Q.  In Brisbane you said you changed your routine a little bit, you were going to arcades and playing games.  Been doing anything like that?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Actually I went to the arcades a few nights ago.  I think it's important to kind of disconnect a little bit, just hang out with friends, walk around, do whatever you feel like doing.  I think it's very important for the mind and the body to be synchronized with you.  If you feel that you're in one element, it always feels good to be on the court warming up, you feel loose, happy.  I think this is great.  In the same time, you need to enjoy every match you play.  You just never know what's going to happen, if it's going to be your last match on such a court.  It was my first win on Rod Laver.  I'm going to remember that for sure.  Those moments for me count a lot.   
 Q.  Will you be requesting a later start on Monday?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I'm not one of those guys that go, Can you please play me at 1 a.m. in the morning, whatever.  Whatever time.  I really don't care.  I wouldn't think they're going to put us early to play anyway just because of my match and Denis's match.  Getting ready for that one.   
 Q.  What time do you think you'll be able to get to sleep tonight?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Hopefully by 5 I'm going to be done with everything, all the stretchings, the rehab, just sleep in, come back tomorrow, hit some balls.  Kind of go to bed again.
