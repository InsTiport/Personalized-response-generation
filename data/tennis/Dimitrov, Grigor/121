 G. DIMITROV/R. Harrison
  7‑6, 6‑3, 6‑2 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did that feel today?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   It felt good.   It felt nice to get the tournament going.   Obviously first match is never easy playing on that court.   
Felt pretty good.   Confident at the moment.   Excited for the next match.   
   
 Q.   How are you generally feeling about your form?   Must be pretty confident.   
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, I'm feeling good at the moment.   It's just, you know, early in the tournament, so of course there's a lot of other things to look forward to.   
It's just nice to start that way.   I think it's obviously important to get those first matches in a pretty good form.   I like the way I'm playing right now and feeling comfortable on court.  
   
 Q.   Andy has won.   Novak has won.   When you have guys in the higher seeds doing that, do you think sometimes that can open up the competition for you a bit further down the seedings?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I mean, I like the pressure anyway.   I don't want to put it out because I think you want to have that a little bit.   I think that puts you into a better stage and actually you're playing better.   
But as I said, the first matches, you always want to come on the court and sort of have a solid performance and see where you're at at the moment.   
I think the top guys like Novak, Andy, and Roger and Rafa, that's what they're trying to do anyway the first matches, they're quite good.   If you think about it, it's something you can go through.  
   
 Q.   Did winning Queen's change your preparations or expectations for Wimbledon?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   No.   Of course, it's a good feeling to win that title.   I always wanted to win it.   
Didn't change anything.   Of course, I appreciate that title, the tournament that I played.   But I had a week to get ready for Wimbledon.   Everything was going according to plan.   We didn't do anything else, nothing spectacular.   We just followed our routines, just going through the days.   
   
 Q.   Before October last year you hadn't won a title.   Now you have four on four different surfaces and made quarterfinals in Australia.   What has been the main difference?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, I think getting in that partnership with Roger Rasheed really helped me out through that tough time last year, especially in the end of last year.   Coming through the tournament in Stockholm, obviously that was a good steppingstone for me, my first title.   That created a big window for us where we had a lot to do in the off‑season, put in extra work and see our goals in the future.   
I think in the end, just turned out to be something really good.   
I mean, it's already six months behind us.   You know, we're just going strong.   We're not satisfied with less.   
   
 Q.   What do you think in particular is special about your relationship with Roger?   What is he helping you with now that maybe you didn't get in the past?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think the structure on and off the court is really important.   Brought a lot of discipline, shot selection, all those things.   So for me I think it was just a matter of time to learn something about myself more than anything else.   
It just clicked.   It just happens.   You can't really describe things like that sometimes.   Yeah, we have our goals that are really higher than that.   We're just at the beginning.   
   
 Q.   You said you learned something about yourself.   What have you learned?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I think on the court I'm just playing a better tennis.   I think I have better shot selections.   I'm more consistent throughout all the weeks, winning more matches.   
I think you always got to find a little bit of a good formula for that.   I think once you got it you got to apply it as soon as the tournament starts and find your own path for that.   
   
 Q.   Your backhand, did you always play single handed?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   No, always one‑handed.  
   
 Q.   Did your coach teach you that way?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, my father was my coach.   He was the reason why I'm playing tennis.   He's the one that taught me everything on the court, and of course helping me off the court.   
Yeah, to me two‑hander was never an option for me.  
   
 Q.   You never struggled with power when you were smaller?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   No, no, no.   
   
 Q.   How much do you know about your opponent in the second round?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Honestly, I don't know much about him.   I've seen just briefly a couple of points here and there.   I think that's about it.   Just got to get on the court and do my thing.   
   
 Q.   How do you prepare for a match when you don't know that much about your opponent?   Just focus on yourself?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, the most important thing is my game, how I'm going to play.   I'm always focusing on that, how I'm going to perform on the court, how I'm going to play the whole match.   
To me that's much more valuable than actually thinking how the opposition is at the moment.   I'm just looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   There's quite a few people who think you might be able to go quite a long way into the tournament.   How does that make you feel?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   I just won my first match, so I think we're really early on of talking that way.   
But I think everything's possible.   I always like to just take one match at a time and one opponent at a time.   The rest just, you know, it comes.   I don't need to put the extra pressure on myself.   I just need to focus on how I'm playing and the way I'm on the court.   So there's nothing else that brings me back to that.
