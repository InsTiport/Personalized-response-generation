7-6, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously pleased with the way you played today?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, absolutely.  It's just one of those matches that you just need to be ready.  Milos is one of the biggest servers out there.  I mean, I knew what to expect, so I just had to execute the right way.   
I felt everything went pretty well in the first set for me.  From then on, I had, I think, a different mentality and different approach towards the second set, and I was just focusing on my game.  I think, after that, I think -- that first break, I think, played a big role for me.   
After that, it was just -- you know, I felt mentally I was strong.  I was hitting the ball well enough.  I think this is where I had the match in my hands.   
 Q.  Could you feel the momentum change in that second set when you got on top of him?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, definitely.  It's one of those -- you know, I played quite solid game to break him.  I had quite a few passes, good returns.   
Yeah, that was pretty much it.  I think after that I was just solid overall, moving well, hitting the shots where I had to.  And, yeah, I was reading his serve pretty well after that, too, to do the second break.  From then on, it was a pretty smooth sailing.   
 Q.  What does early success in a season mean for the rest of your year?  Historically these tournaments kick-started a climb up the rankings for the players that have won.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, it's always good to start the year -- you know, coming in the first week and being in the final, of course, that's the best-case scenario.   
But my goals are completely different.  I have a different approach, I think, in a way for the year.  I'm really focused on the first six months of the year and the way that I'm going to sort of perform.  Also, my schedule is pretty much based on that, so I'm just focusing on the matches and what I have to play.  I'm not thinking, okay, if I win this tournament, I'm going to get that amount of points and I'm going to be better in the ranking.  If you keep winning and keep improving, everything comes with it.   
So, for sure, I give myself credit to be in the final for the first week.  As I said, it's never easy, always a bit of nerves, you're a little insecure in yourself, you haven't competed for over a month.   
In the same time, I think that's what we live for is to compete and perform.  When you have a good start like that, you just have to appreciate it and just get on with it.   
 Q.  What about your satisfaction that you're able to continue the momentum that you generated in the back half of last season?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I was working hard offseason.  I felt I was working hard.  I just wanted to keep that fine line, as simple as that, simplifying other things, simplifying, for example, my fitness sessions, the way I was practicing, what I was practicing on.   
So I think that's about it.  I was not trying to think how I'm going to start the year, or let's, you know, keep that momentum.  It kind of just happened to be that way.  I had quite a few tough weeks of work, but then, you know, I had to -- it's not easy to stay as positive as you like, but that's why also you have the right people around you to tell you that you maybe do good work.  Because I'm very hard on myself.  And even in the offseason, after brutal sessions, I was never happy with myself.  There was people that, from my team, that had to set me down, like, Man, relax.  What are you doing?   
Yeah, I understand a little bit better what they mean.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  You have Kei next.  You haven't beaten him.  How do you approach it?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Just like any other match.  I mean, there is guys that I have always played, I mean, differently, I feel.  Kei is one of those guys.   
I think last year we played a pretty close match.  I felt like I had my chance and my momentum.  But it's just another match for me.  As I said, it's the final.  I'm not playing anything next week.  So, for sure, I'm going to get out there and just leave it all.
