G. DIMITROV/D. Novak   
6-3, 6-2, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel, first round?  As well as your form has been the last couple months?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I think it's getting there.  It's still early in the tournament.  Different conditions today.  I just had to come out and just play my game, simple as that.  I didn't know, never played against the opponent.  In a way, I didn't know what to expect.   
I just had to be focused.  He already had three matches under his belt.  I think it's a good start today.   
 Q.  Do you think you'll take that mindset into the rest of the tournament, if you play your best, high chances it will be good enough to win?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I'll definitely like to go after match by match.  As I said, everybody can play well.  I think all the opponents are pretty dangerous.  As I said, people are excited, fresh, just starting the year.   
For me, it's going to be all about my game and how I'm going to deal with it.  That's all I'm really focusing on.  The rest, it's not in my control.  I just really need to stay focused, need to stay composed.  Again, really looking forward after my game.   
 Q.  There's been mixed reports about a players meeting on Friday, Novak taking the stage and speaking about prize money.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: It's just a private meeting between the players.  I'd rather not comment on that.
