G. DIMITROV/N. Mahut
  7‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Where would that rank in your wins on grass?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, yeah, definitely I think it was one of my best wins so far.   I have known Nicolas for quite a long time. 
As I said yesterday, we know our game pretty well.   I know how he's playing on grass, and I also got a chance look what he did yesterday against Murray.
No, just trying to use certain momentums to, you know, to try to bring the match into my court.   So I was very happy that everything turned to be that way.   You know, just in general I'm happy to play out there today.

Q.   This tournament has had a reputation for supporting young players, and I think you've been here how many years now?   When was your first wildcard here?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, yeah, I think two years ago.

Q.   Two years ago.   Do you feel like a special affinity with the tournament?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, I mean, definitely.   I love this tournament.   I played as a junior here, so I feel absolutely great every time I'm here.   The whole atmosphere and the crowd, just the whole club, you can feel like the history and all that itself.
So I think, I mean, many players in the locker room are very pleased also to be here.   I think it's a great preparation for all the upcoming tournaments.
Well, I mean, I'm extremely happy because I know the place now much better, and the people are very nice with me; also because I'm winning, as well.   (Smiling.)

Q.   That helps, doesn't it?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah.

Q.   How about you and grass?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Me and grass? 

Q.   People have been saying for a long, long time that you have the perfect game for it.   Do you like the stuff?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, yeah.   I don't mind the grass.   I enjoy it, and, I mean, you cannot predict what's going to happen here every match, and there's tons of different players that even though they're not supposed to be good on grass they're playing one of their best matches on grass. 
I think you've just got to take the best out of yourself when you go out on the grass and try the things that you really want to try.
You know, everything happens so fast that the situation‑‑ you know, you cannot practice a certain situation there.   I think you have to have also a bit of imagination and just kind of improvise when you go out there.
I mean, yeah, there's just all type of matches that you can do stuff.   Grass is one of the surfaces that you can, I mean, do absolutely different, and, well, I like to say insane things, yeah.   (Smiling.)

Q.   Do you feel like you're sort of on the verge of making that really significant breakthrough?   You have been around there for a long time now. 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, I mean, I am not worrying about this thing.   I'm not thinking of that at all, because that's not my goal at the moment. 
Of course I'm happy to win these matches and to go on and win why not more and why not the tournament, of course.   But this thing, I don't have it as, you know, a short‑time thing.   I just like to see what's going to happen also the week after.   You know, you never know.   I might win the tournament, and next week I go and I lose first round or something like this.
I take it day by day, step by step.   You know, if your game goes well, you take it.

Q.   Years ago people would have maybe thought a promising junior like yourself should be in the top 20 by 21, but do you agree that's different now because a lot of the tournament players are older, and do you think you have to be a lot more patient coming up?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, but you have nowadays a couple of players that are up there already.   But, I mean, if you see the average age of the guys who are top 20, he's 27 years old.   So, I mean, that should tell you something, I mean, a little bit how the situation is on the tour so far.
I mean, there's so many things that you gotta improve also on the tour, because sometimes you see these young guys‑‑ I mean, I've seen how ‑‑I still consider myself as the young guy on the tour, but sometimes you see a couple of juniors coming in the locker room, and, you know, it's like, Wow, was I like this before?   (Smiling.)
I hope I wasn't.   Well, I think I was.   I don't know anymore.   Anyway, so, you know, there's a lot to learn.   I mean, you take every opportunity you can, of course, if you can.   You try to learn from every mistake.

Q.   Do you think you're a senior junior or a junior senior?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   That's a very tough question.   I think I'm still juniors for certain things, but I'm trying to get better, trying to get better. 
Well, I will tell you when I get on the other stage.   I am tell you.   I'm not junior anymore.

Q.   Do you think you're quite close to the Olympics cut?   Are you really hopeful you might get in? 
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, I'm hoping.   I mean, if I play, it would be great.   If not, I'm not playing. 

Q.   Coaching at the moment is Patrick?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah.   He's having a week off.

Q.   So who is with you this week?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   My father and my fitness coach.   Yeah. 

Q.   When you have weeks like that, do you still speak to Patrick?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Every day.   We are on the phone all the time.   Yeah, yeah, it's nothing ‑‑I mean, I think he has to enjoy his time a little bit with his family.   I'm sure he's not very happy to see my face week after week. 

Q.   Is that tough for a young junior senior like you, you know, having a 24/7 coach all the time?   Do you need a bit of space sometimes?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah, of course.   I think everyone does.   But, I mean, in the end it's how you're going to adjust and how you're going to have your routines, of course. 
I mean, most of the people that know me, they know what I like and they know what I don't like.   They know when I get punchy or something and when it's time to take a few days off.   Of course you have to sacrifice a lot from yourself, as well, but it's for a good cause, so I'm happy to do it.   Of course sometimes I'm not at my best, but, well, you cannot wake up every day and be 100%.

Q.   Have you felt pressure over the years as being almost designated as "the" next big one?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Well, pressure, I think pressure is everywhere, I mean, for everyone, so to speak.   I think everyone feels it, but no one actually wants to say, Yeah, you know, I feel pressure.
I think that's a human thing, to feel pressure and all that.   Yeah, I'm saying, yes, I had quite a bit of pressure, but, I mean, I think you've got to go through that.   You want to be better, you want to improve.   Well, of course you're putting certain bars for yourself.   You know, if you can live up to the expectations, well, what's happening after. 

Q.   Where are you playing last week?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Holland.

Q.   's‑Hertogenbosch?
GRIGOR DIMITROV:   Yeah.
