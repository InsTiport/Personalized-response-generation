4-6, 7-5, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough to get in a rhythm tonight, wasn't it?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I mean, it is what it is.  You have days like this that you can't really do much else.  Unfortunately, I couldn't play my game to the extent that I was looking for.  Movement was not good over the court.  I thought I served okay for a little bit, but then I lost my rhythm again.   
Of course, all the credit to Malek.  He played a good game.  He was strong throughout the whole match.  Actually was hitting pretty good shots.  I mean, nothing to lose.  Also pretty much a lot of luck was on his side, let calls.   
You control what you can control.  Tonight, yeah, I couldn't control anything on my side.   
 Q.  You served well for a while, but also there were quiet a few double-faults.  Is your shoulder okay?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: When you put everything together, there's no point to give any excuses right now.  He deserves all the credit.  He's the one that went through the match.   
Honestly, there's not much else for me to say except I need to keep on going with the same attitude.  That's the only thing I feel like I can really work on right now.  I mean, the rest, how the body will feel, all that, again, I can only control what I can control:  the rehab, the right amount of treatment, the fitness side, the preventive side for anything.  Yeah, all those things are going to come into play.   
So yeah, I mean, that's about it right now.  Also I don't feel the need to get too down on myself.  I expected not to do my best in terms of not to play my best game.  I expect to give 100% from myself, and I thought I did.  As we saw, it was just not enough to kind of find my way into the game today.  Therefore, that was the result.   
 Q.  Will you look at taking a little bit of time off?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, I don't think so.  I just had some time off.  I don't think I'm slowing down.  Again, the best thing is you have another match in about a week or two's time.  I guess that's the positive side.   
I'm going to kind of keep going with the same attitude, going to the gym, just preparing.  Of course, it's not easy when you lose.  This is I think my first first-round loss in quite some time now.  In a way, that's the result.  There's no point for me to really get too, too down on myself.  Again, I think I had a good start of the season.  Now is the time to push hard through.   
Yeah, for sure the next events, I mean, I don't shy away.  I feel like I'm going to be ready.  Even now, I thought I could progress with each match.  All those first matches, as I said even before in the press, every match here is tough.  Doesn't matter some of the higher guys or top seeds are not here.  As I said, everyone is going to play well out here.   
That's the situation now, I guess.
