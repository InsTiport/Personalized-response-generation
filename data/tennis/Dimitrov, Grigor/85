V. TROICKI/G. Dimitrov
2-6, 6-1, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Must be a tough one to take, the way it finished.
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, it's never easy losing from a match point.  It's in the game.  Obviously was Viktor's day today.  I think everything was pretty much going on his side.
Especially even after that first set I knew he was going to do something else.  I think early on he got a few good calls, few good shots, so that kind of lift him up.  I'm giving all the credit to him today.
Q. Do you think he learned from your match in Brisbane last week, which was close?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I didn't play quite the same player, to be honest, so of course I take the experience out of it, but it's just not the same -- you're talking the one I played against him or...
Q. Yeah, in Brisbane last week.  Do you sense he kind of had learned from that, changed tactics, adjusted?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, not really.  I thought he played the same game.  I came out the first set I think pretty strong, and, yeah, was just playing my game.  As I said, I was focusing on myself.
Also been a while for me to be on the final.  I think even early on I was nervous, but I still played good tennis.  So, yeah, that's that.
Brisbane was just a past tournament.  None of the matches are similar to the ones you play before obviously.  Every match is different.  Different city, different courts, different surroundings.
Maybe the same player, but in the same time, you know, that's how it is.
Q. What do you think changed for you?  You were in such control the first set, and second set was completely different.
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I think I didn't serve good enough the second set.  I was definitely out of sync and out of balance throughout the whole second set.
I thought I strung my racquets also a little bit too tight because the temperature was a little bit different tonight.  That didn't give me enough bite on some of the shots.
You start thinking about a few things here and there, and next thing you know the set was gone.  I had no doubt that I'm going to play good in the third set.  I had too many opportunities.  I had I believe eight breakpoints in the third set and he put eight first serves.  What can you do on that?
Just too good with the outcome.  Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.  There is nothing else than that.
Q. Is it going to be easy for you to put this result behind you going into Melbourne?  Will it sting a little bit or forget about it right away?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: It has to.  If not, then I have some issue -- it has to.  But in the at the same time, I'm looking forward to Melbourne.  I'm playing Monday, so that's definitely not easy.  Going there tomorrow obviously, first thing in the morning.
Going to get out on the court again I guess.  Not going to have much time to rest.  I don't have much time to think about it.
I think in a way that's going to be good for me.  I have nothing else to think about.  Just need to focus on one thing and one thing only:  My match on Monday and how to acclimatize as quick as possible.
Going to get out on the court and hopefully everything feels well.  I have no doubt that physically I'm going to be good, so, yeah, it's just a little bit also how the body is going to respond.  Not going to get much sleep tonight obviously.
It's part of the game.  As I said, the most important thing for me right now is not to feel sorry for myself or be pissed or anything.  Looking forward it to it.  I want to take it as it is.  I wanted to play a lot of matches, so here we go.  I have a lot of matches.  Nothing to complain about.
Q. Would you say from that perspective - you played the maximum number of matches you could - mission accomplished for you?  You got what you wanted out of the week?
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Also the quarters in Brisbane, so wasn't the maximum amount.
Q. In Sydney.
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I mean, a lot of positive to take out of those weeks.  Yeah, obviously I've played a lot of matches, singles and doubles.  I've played a few doubles matches, which was good for me.  I felt good throughout the whole time, so...
I don't know, to be honest.  I'm taking -- as I said, I'm taking every match as -- I'm embracing it and just trying to play the game and trying to learn, but in the same time apply all the things I've worked on the past weeks.
Today, again, you know, I felt I did good, but in the same time, I think also my -- I got a little bit nervous at some point I think even before the match.  I think even though I came out pretty good.
So that was something that I was happy with, because it's been a while that a match meant a lot to me like in that manner.  You're in the final, so of course it means a little bit more than any other matches.  Over a year since I was in the final.
It was great.  So I'm happy to have that feeling back; happy to feel like those little butterflies again.  That's its most important thing for me right now.
Yeah, I've played a lot of matches.  Hopefully I'll play double the matches in Melbourne.
