THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Did you think that the key of the game was in the end of the first set?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, for sure the first set played a big role.  I think the first game of the match was a very poor game for me, but I managed to win it.  That was important.   
Yeah, had a few games that I had a pretty loose points, about 10 in a row.  That obviously wasn't ideal for me.   
But, yeah, after that first set, I had a bit more confidence.  I played better I think overall.  That was very positive.  I'm just pleased to go through first round in straight sets.   
 Q.  You looked very uncomfortable with your drive, could be?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: When?   
 Q.  In the second set, the start of the second set.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I didn't feel uncomfortable with my game.   
 Q.  With the drive.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: With my forehand?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, I don't think so.  I think I started with the break, I think in the second set.  So, yeah, I missed a few forehands.  Other than that, I don't think that my forehand was not working today.  I think especially, yeah, end of the second set, beginning of the third, I think I was striking the ball pretty well.   
 Q.  You did really well at Queen's.  Have you placed yourself any goals for this tournament?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Yeah, I'm planning myself to win 18 sets (smiling).   
Obviously it's not easy.  First matches are never easy.  But, look, today was a pretty tricky opponent to play in an opening round.  I've known Diego for quite a time.  We had quite a few matches to play against each other.  I knew it was not going to be an easy match, for sure.   
But, hey, this is what it is right now.  Yeah, I'm just looking forward for what's next.   
 Q.  Did the match with him bring back some maybe bad memories from last year?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, no, no, no.  Actually we're pretty friendly to one another in the locker room.  Before the match today we spoke a little bit.  That's all behind, I think.   
 Q.  On Saturday you gave a tennis lesson to Romeo Beckham.  How did this come about?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: Romeo, he's a very talented kid.  I think he hasn't played tennis for that long, but he sure showed I think a lot of potential.  It was very nice to spend some time off the court, especially I don't want to say kids, because I like to give a bit of my time as well when they really appreciate something like this.   
Yeah, I just wanted to do something nice for him.  He came to quite a few of my matches I think on the days.  Yeah, glad to spend also some time with Victoria and get to know the family from close.   
 Q.  Lots of fans were waiting for you outside the court today.  How does that make you feel?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: It's always great.  Always great.  I think obviously there's quite a few countries when I'm playing in, I see the Bulgarian flags.  The supporters are pretty awesome out here.  Yeah, hopefully in the next matches I'll play on even bigger courts and I can see a lot more of those audience around.   
 Q.  You and Roger are in the same end of the draw.  Are you planning any songs for your boy band?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: No, not here.  I think here we all are pretty focused to play the tournament, just like every other one.  But, yeah, we haven't had much time to all three sit down and discuss what might be our potential third song to end up the trilogy on that.   
 Q.  It's better for you to play in the small courts because you feel the feelings of the people?  
GRIGOR DIMITROV: I mean, it doesn't matter.  I don't think Court 12 is also that small court.  I think everybody was pretty happy.  Everybody got what they want.  The crowd was full.  It doesn't matter.   
It's the first round of a major.  Everything counts.  So doesn't matter if you're going to have, you know, 20 people or 100 people, you're there to do your job.
