Q. Marcelo, you were into the Final here last year; again this year.  What has changed in your game? 
 
MARCELO RIOS:  Maybe I play more smart; not trying to go so much for my shot, missing too much.  Having played very good here every time I come here.  I think it's a nice place to play tennis.  Every time I play, I play a great match. 
 

Q. You were in the final in Barcelona last year, and you play here.  You have not played so much.
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I don't understand. 
 

Q. You play very well in Barcelona last year, if I know, Final.  This year you lost first round.  Suddenly it comes?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I think this year I played a guy that went to the Final.  I didn't play that good.  I think everybody's tough.  Now, I have some good matches here; have one week to practice last week.  Every tournament you can do good or  bad. 
 

Q. Magnus Larsson seems to be in good shape as well so far.  You are.  But do you still expect to beat him that easily?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I have played many times with Magnus.  We played long matches, three sets.  This is the first time we played a quick match.  I never expected to win so easy, but I think I played pretty good, low unforced errors; did my game. 
 

Q. After the match, you spoke to the crowd and you said how much you liked to play in Monte-Carlo.  Can you explain, from your point of view, what's so special about this tournament here in Monte-Carlo for you?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I think the tournament is great, playing here.  It's a very nice place.  Also the courts are pretty good.  It's nice to play here. 
 

Q. Can you tell us about your next opponent, Carlos Moya, how you judge his game?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  Never play Moya.  It's going to be the first time.  He's a great claycourt player.  He doesn't miss so much.  I think it's going to be a tough match.  He's a great player.
