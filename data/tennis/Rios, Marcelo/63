Q. Marcelo, are you aware about Ayala was considered the best Chilean player of all time?

MARCELO RIOS:  I have no idea.  Even I don't know him.  I have no idea.


Q. Because now people is asking maybe you're getting the best ever in your country.

MARCELO RIOS:  I don't know.  They say when Ayela played, there was no ranking, but I have no idea about Ayela.


Q. Do you know that Ayela was finalist in Paris in 19 --

MARCELO RIOS:  I have no idea.


Q. Is it important for you to be amongst the best ten tennis players?  It's going to be next week.  Is that very important for you?

MARCELO RIOS:  Being one of the best players?


Q. Amongst the top 10.

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, sure.  Like I said yesterday, being top 10, I think every player wants to be there.  Once you're top 10, you want to be top five, then be No. 1. 


Q. Sounds easy.

MARCELO RIOS:  Huh?


Q. Sounds easy.

MARCELO RIOS:  Sounds easy, but I don't think it's so easy.


Q. Marcelo, you said yesterday about growing up near a country club or in a country club as a youngster.  Could you tell us more about that, why you were there, all about it.

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, when I was little, like I think seven, we changed our country club, house inside country club.  I think that's why I started playing tennis, because before I went to school and didn't play any tennis. After that, I was there playing some sports, some soccer, golf.  I don't know why I started playing tennis.


Q. How is it that you went to the country club?

MARCELO RIOS:  Sorry?


Q. Was your father involved with the country club? How did that happen?

MARCELO RIOS:  Yeah.  He was a member before, before we lived there.  We changed over there.  I think because it was near, but I have no idea.


Q. Do you read some famous poet in Chile?  Do you read Neruda?

MARCELO RIOS:  I read when I was in school, but after that I haven't read anything of Neruda. 


Q. What is your favorite sport apart from tennis?

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, I like to play a lot of soccer, when I have time, but it's not much time I have. Sometimes I play some golf.  That's it.


Q. Do you have a handicap in golf?

MARCELO RIOS:  No.
