Q.  Among the people that were cheering, were those people that you knew or just fans in general? 

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, there were many people, family, coach, people I know. 


Q.  Did that help you at all?  Makes no difference? 

MARCELO RIOS:  Obviously it helps me.  People with me, always that helps me.  That's why I think I was 5-1 down and I still came back.
