Q.  Is it painful, this defeat?

MARCELO RIOS:  Obviously.  Every time you lose, it's painful.  I think I had a chance in the first set, then he raised his level. 

Q.  Were you distracted by the attitude of the referee?

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, this happens all the time.  That's a subject that's very important.  The ATP hasn't really reacted to this problem we always complain about. 

Q.  Were you affected by this?

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, it was an important moment.

Q.  What was key to your defeat?  What do you blame your defeat on?  Was it your unforced errors?  Was he attacking very well? 

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, he served well, and I didn't serve that good.  We didn't play long rallies.  There were quite a lot of errors from both of us. 

Q.  Besides today's matches, how would you assess the end of the season?

MARCELO RIOS:  It wasn't a good season for me.  There are still two tournaments.  I had an injury in my knee that was bad for me.  I haven't had enough confidence to win matches in a row in order to recover my confidence. 

Q.  How do you feel physically, your physical condition?

MARCELO RIOS:  Okay.  Well, the knee hasn't been hurting me that much.  But it's still there, the injury.
