THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.  
 
 
Q.  Can you talk about how you were feeling out there today, particularly what changed after the first set. 
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I think I start little bit slow.  He play good his serve and I make couple of errors in my serve and he broke me.  I was not there in the first set.  Up to that, I have the break and start serving a little bit.  I start feeling much better from baseline. 
 
Q.  So was it the serve that started clicking in? 
 
MARCELO RIOS:  Yeah, I think he start making serve and volley, once I return pretty good.  He start staying back.  When he stay back, I think have no chance.
