THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Marcelo.   
 
 
Q.  Can you talk to us about the match today.  It seemed like a very easy match.  How was it really? 
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I think was  -- maybe the score was easy, but was a tough match.  All the games were pretty tough.  And he got a lot of break points.  He didn't make the break points, and I have a couple and I did.  Even the score will see it was a pretty tough match.  Really hot, and the conditions were tough.  
 
Q.  Also could you say something about your next match, that you're going to be playing tomorrow. 
 
MARCELO RIOS:  Well, I have never played Chela before.  He's a great baseline player.  He play really good, and for beating him I will have to play my best.  I'm looking forward to win.
