MIKI SINGH:  Marcelo is a 6-4, 6-3 winner today. He's advanced to the quarterfinals.  He'll play either Tommy Haas or Petr Korda tomorrow.  Marcelo also reached the semifinals here back in '96.  First question.


Q.  Didn't look like you had any problem today with him.

MARCELO RIOS:  Yeah.  I think I start from the beginning really good, serving really good.  I broke him like early in the match.  I think that helped me a lot.  I think every time I move him around, I have chances.  He was serving big at the beginning.  I think I played a really smart match, didn't make that many errors.


Q.  There were several points in the match when you seemed to be doing some deep knee bends or something.  Were you having any problem physically?

MARCELO RIOS:  I always do.  When I feel like doing it, I do.  I was injured from my knee two weeks ago, and now  I'm feeling much better.


Q.  Are you hoping your next opponent is Korda?

MARCELO RIOS:  I really don't care.  I think the winner is going to be the best.  I like to play Korda.  We playing almost the same surface.  I think I play much better than the Australian Open.  I think I have a lot of chance.


Q.  What's the difference between how you were playing at the Australian Open and how you're playing here?  What's made the difference?

MARCELO RIOS:  Well, I think I'm serving much better.  I'm like playing the game more smart, not rushing too much, trying to play fast points.  Maybe I'm more patient, trying to work more the point than making more mistakes.


Q.  In this match you went to the net seven times and won seven points.  Why don't you go to the net more often?

MARCELO RIOS:  Because I don't feel like it.
