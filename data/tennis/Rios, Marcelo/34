 Q. You were quite in control of the match after you won the third set. What happened? 
 
 MARCELO RIOS: Well, I think he broke me in the fourth set. After he broke me in the
fourth set, I think I went down a little bit. He was serving better. I didn't play very
good since all the tournament. Even if I was two sets to one, I was thinking about I was
to do the things good, hitting the ball pretty good. But I think these couple months been
a good experience. Got to work harder now. 
 
Q. Do you feel you can turn it again over in your favor at some point?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: I think it's not the end of the world, losing this match. I can play much
better than that. I take a little week off and start practicing again. 
 
Q. Did anything in Magnus Larsson's play surprise you today?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: I play him a lot of times. He served good. I think he's serving good,
he's playing good. I think he served pretty good. But like I say, I think he didn't beat
me. I think I made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of errors. 
 
Q. But you aren't disappointed that you lost?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: Well, I think I'm not going to be happy if I didn't win. 
 
Q. The fact that you missed in a Grand Slam, is it more disappointing?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: Than what? 
 
Q. The fact that you didn't win a Grand Slam until now.
 
 MARCELO RIOS: I think I'm having a pretty good year. Haven't had very good the Slams.
