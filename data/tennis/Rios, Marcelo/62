Q. Were you satisfied with your game?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  I think it was a strange match. Didn't start playing very good the first couple of games, then started playing good - there was one point at 2-All, made a dropshot. 
 

Q. You think because of the way you both play you neutralized each other because the match plan is kind of the same?
 
MARCELO RIOS:  We know each other, we have played many times.  I don't know.
