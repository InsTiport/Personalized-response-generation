 Q. How did you feel about today's match? Problems? You dropped a set? 
 
 MARCELO RIOS: I think I was pretty lucky that I won the match. I didn't play that good
and I think he got his chances and maybe in the third set he broke me the first games
maybe would it be different. But I felt at the beginning really good and then I have -- I
broke down a little bit and I missed two returns that I got pissed, and after that I think
I start playing really well. 
 
Q. Winning a match that you say you shouldn't have won, does that boost your
confidence?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: Maybe if I play another guy maybe it would be different. I think he
missed too many balls today and that is why I won. But I don't think I make any -- didn't
hit the ball pretty clean. I made a lot of mistakes with my forehand. But I think he
didn't play that good and that is why I won. 
 
Q. Then you can play better?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: I think I can play better. I think since last week I have been playing
much better, but I think I am not on my level right now. Maybe the first match I played
pretty good, but it's been too up-and-down. I haven't found my rhythm yet. 
 
Q. That comes with more matches?
 
 MARCELO RIOS: Maybe. I think I have been playing and practicing a lot and maybe I need
a little more matches. I thought this match was going to give me a little rhythm and get
used to the court and all that, but like I said I think I missed too much today.
