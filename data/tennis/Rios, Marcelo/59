Q. Did the disputed calls affect the match at all?

MARCELO RIOS: Pardon?

Q. The disputed calls, Tarango's complaints?

MARCELO RIOS: I think he start to play his game, he's always complaining too much. I
think it's not that. I think I play really bad. It was tough to play at night. Balls were
going really fast. I think I gave too many chances, lost too many points that I never
lost. I think I didn't play my tennis.

Q. What is it about playing at night that you don't like? Is it something about the
lights?

MARCELO RIOS: I don't see the ball like I see during the day. I think it's a bit
faster. I play in America, so that's why I play at night. It's not an excuse. I think I
just lost. I didn't feel good on the court. That's it.

Q. Marcelo, for a player who is established like you are, becoming established top ten
in the world, when you sign on with a coach like Nick, I don't imagine -- what's the
relationship like? What kind of stuff does he work on? He can't start over with you like
he can with a 13 year old kid.

MARCELO RIOS: I've just been working with him for two weeks. I think -- maybe I not
concentrate too much on the court, work on that, stay more focused, not try to give too
many points. I think I'm not hitting good the ball. I've been playing not good. Now I'm
going to take a little rest and then get back to the indoors.

Q. Is most of what you and he worked on more mental approach strategy, more than
technical things with your game?

MARCELO RIOS: I have my shots already. I think everyone have his shots already. He not
teach me how to hit my shots. He's going to help me with my game, try to improve, more how
to be on the court.

Q. Did you get upset with Tarango for his complaining?

MARCELO RIOS: Well, I know before I went to the court he was going to be like that. I
was ready. I don't know, that was the match.
