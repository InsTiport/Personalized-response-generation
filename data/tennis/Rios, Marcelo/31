Q. What about your last week's injury?

MARCELO RIOS: I feel much better. Trying to rest a couple of days, two days. I still
feel my back a little bit, but it is much better with the surface. Last week it was bad
for my back.

Q. Do you feel strong enough to play every week from now 'til the end of the season?

MARCELO RIOS: I am going to try to do my best. I am going to see how this week is going
and how my back is responding.

Q. Any problem of playing on clay in Santiago and coming back to Hannover; is it not a
problem?

MARCELO RIOS: I don't think it is a big deal. I am going to play in Santiago; then a
week off. Then I can practice indoors. I think it is not that bad.

Q. How do you feel tennis-wise?

MARCELO RIOS: I have been playing pretty good. Maybe not very consistent in the match.
I play very good a couple of minutes; then I go down a bit. But I have been feeling pretty
good.
