ATP: Questions, please. 

Q. That was a strange match. How did you see it?

MARCELO RIOS: I think I played a really bad first set, and he play a bad second. But I
think it was a good match, just missing too much. Got a lot of chances, but never feel
good on the court. It was windy. The only thing I got to do is return the serve, and that
was it, but I couldn't even hit the return. It's another match.

Q. Is that the longest and most tiring match you've had since you've been back?

MARCELO RIOS: Yeah.

Q. How did you feel your fitness held up?

MARCELO RIOS: Right now I'm feeling good. Last night I was a little bit tired. But I
think that's good to feel a little bit in my legs so it can get used to it. Right now I
have no have pain. Maybe moving a little bit bad; sometimes it's tough to move. But that's
going to come with time. 

Q. Tim plays Agassi next. Do you see him having any chance in that match?

MARCELO RIOS: I don't think so. I think Andre, he's playing pretty good. I think he
like to play guys that serve-and-volley. I think Andre should win pretty easy. 

Q. What should Tim's tactics be to go out and play him?

MARCELO RIOS: I have no idea, man. You've got to ask him Tim, not me.

Q. Where do you think you are at the moment in your comeback?

MARCELO RIOS: I think some days I'm hitting good the ball. All depends how my leg is
feeling. Sometimes I'm a little bit tired, and it's tough to move. But just time, just
time. I try to put a lot of me to try to hit the ball good. I think it's going to come by
itself.

Q. Are you restricted in how much time you can practice?

MARCELO RIOS: I try not to play a lot of tennis. I try more to exercise, to like get
stronger, the leg more than I'm playing tennis.
