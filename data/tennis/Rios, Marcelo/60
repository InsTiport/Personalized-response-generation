not concentrating. I'm not playing good.

Q. One of the things we understood yesterday is when you start out hot, you stay hot,
but when you start out cold, you stay cold. Is that true?

make me go down, not play very consistent. Didn't have a good time. I'm not playing very
good.

Q. You played him at least twice before. Both times you were victorious. Did you go
into the match thinking that you beat him twice before, this could be a little easier?

MARCELO RIOS: I knew it was going to be tough. I knew he serve good. I have a chance to
break first game; I didn't do it. I knew it was going to be tough. He play good. Not
because I beat him two time I knew I was going to win.

Q. What did he do today to make such a difference? 

MARCELO RIOS: Sorry?

Q. What did he do today to make such a difference?

served bad. I think I lost the match.

Q. Marcelo, how much pressure is there on you these days?

MARCELO RIOS: How pressure?

Q. From the media, up and coming star.

Think nothing to do with my game with the pressure. I'm just playing bad and having a bad
time.

MARCELO RIOS: Well, I'm going to Toronto, try to play good.

important, all the same.

too hard on yourself?

Q. Are you a perfectionist?

MARCELO RIOS: Sorry?

Q. Perfectionist?

MARCELO RIOS: Yeah, try to do things good. Sometimes I can't do it, but always I try
like to do my best.

everything is going to be right. Now like this, I have to continue.

Q. Marcelo, do you think (inaudible) six foot and more and serving 110 miles an hour or
more, that being 5'8", it makes you a special player?

MARCELO RIOS: I don't think so.

they do?

MARCELO RIOS: I don't think so.

that?

MARCELO RIOS: Yeah, sure. Never been a Top 10 player. First time in the history of
tennis.

Q. What does that mean to you?

MARCELO RIOS: Well, being like the first one, I feel proud of myself. If I'm happy,
I'll try to prove it again.
