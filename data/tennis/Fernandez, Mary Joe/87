Q. How is your leg and when did you hurt it and what did you do with it?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Well, I actually strained it a little bit yesterday and when I was
playing. I guess I aggravated it more and I guess I just started pulling it more and
started feeling the pain running down my leg, and I actually felt it, I think, the end of
the first set.

Q. At what point did you do it in the match yesterday, do you remember?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: No. I don't remember.

Q. Was it late or early?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: It was middle, I think.

Q. Do you feel it now when you are running?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: I felt it today. You know, I haven't torn -- done anything. It's
just a pull right now and it is real sore and sensitive, so. . .

Q. How did playing the doubles affect that, aggravate it more or --

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Aggravated it more and it would be wiser not to play; rest it up
tomorrow and get treatment on it and hopefully it will be better in 24 hours, 48 hours.

Q. You seemed to be called for several footfaults in the last two matches.

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Did I get called today too.

Q. Yeah, once that I saw.

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Yeah, I don't know why. I never footfault. It is ticking me off. I
must be getting it from my friend Lindsay Davenport. She footfaults all the time. It must
be contagious.

Q. This is a couple of days down the road. How do you feel about playing Arantxa, if it
does come to that?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: I still have a tough match ahead of me. Hopefully if I can get
through that, and Arantxa gets through, you know, it is tough. Arantxa, you know, No. 2 in
the world and quickest player out there and, you know, I will have to play very well. I
will have to play aggressively, but, you know, it is too early to think about that match
yet. 

Q. Mary Joe, what was happening with your stomach?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Got a little nauseous. I took some Tylenol before I went out there.
Hadn't eaten any food; kind of messed my stomach up a little bit.

Q. What about when you left the court?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: I went to change.

Q. Is this left over from the flu or this is because you just didn't eat?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: No. Just because I didn't eat.

Q. Why didn't you eat?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Match was going pretty quick. I didn't know if I had enough time.
Didn't want to be stuffed. Didn't time it correctly.

Q. Besides your leg, you looked a little bit uncomfortable out there in singles when I
was watching, you looked really, really warm. Were you uncomfortable?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ: Well, my leg worried me a little bit and then I got nauseous after
the first, game second set, so combination of both of them, I wasn't feeling too great out
there, and playing another quick player out there who gets a lot of balls back; heavy
topspin, so that was tough. That was stressing me out, and I knew that I had to win that
second set. I knew if it went to three I was going to be in trouble. Fortunately I was
able to pull it out.
