Q.  It was quite windy up in the stands.  Was it a factor on the court at all?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  It was a bit swirly out there.  It's weird for Palm Springs, Indian Wells, whatever.  Usually it's pretty calm here.  It's been windy the last couple days.


Q.  Does it affect your serve or any particular shots?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  No, not really.  It was the same conditions for both of us.  You know, usually I would think that the wind would benefit me instead of her.  She has a high ball toss on her serve.  But, no, I didn't feel it really affected any part of my game.


Q.  The first game lasted four or five deuces. 

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  I think more.


Q.  12 minutes, I think total. 

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah.


Q.  She kind of steam rolled you a little bit?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah.  I mean, the first two games were important games.  I had a few game points to hold my own serve.  I think I was up 15-40 on her serve.  So you lose those two games, you get a little discouraged.  The momentum definitely shifts.  I think she got a little more confident, played a lot better.  A lot of unforced errors, felt a little flat out there.  It's hard.  It's hard when you kind of lose your rhythm and you're playing against such a good player.  You know you have to play aggressively, you have to take it to her.  It's not easy when all of a sudden you lose a little bit of confidence.


Q.  Obviously you guys play doubles together so you know each other's game very well. 

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  Yeah.


Q.  Does that factor in at all?

MARY JOE FERNANDEZ:  No.  We've been playing for a long time.  We've played each other many, many times.  There were no surprises.  I think both of us know how the other one is going to play.
