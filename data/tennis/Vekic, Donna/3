THE MODERATOR: Questions, in English.   
 Q.  Welcome to Zhuhai. How do you feel about the city, the whole environment? What's your impression of this stadium?  
DONNA VEKIC: I really enjoy my time here so far. The hotel's great, the club is really amazing, I really like these conditions with the covered courts. I think it really suits my game, so I'm really excited to start playing some matches.   
 Q.  After you did really good at the U.S. Open, making it to the quarter final. But it looks like after that during the Asian season you have had some problems in your matches. So can you talk about your physical condition and your game right now?  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah, my Asian swing didn't go as good as I planned and wanted, for sure. But I had some tough matches, especially in Beijing, losing to Kiki 7-6 in the third set. So I'm actually really looking forward to playing her tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in Chinese.   
 Q.  We know this is the first time for you in Zhuhai Elite Trophy which has a different format. Starting with the round robin and then semi-final and final. So how do you make of this different format in Zhuhai?  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah, it is my first time playing in a format like this. I think, I guess every game counts, so I think you have to be focused every point, even more than usual. So I don't know, it will be interesting. I'm really excited to be here and to be playing here as well.   
 Q.  Related to your tennis, which opponent do you think would be tougher for you in your group between Bertens and Yastremska?  
DONNA VEKIC: I never played Yastremska, I never even practiced with her. So, to be honest, I don't know. I know she plays big, tries to be aggressive and normally I'm okay with those players.   
But with Kiki I had a lot of tough matches, even three matches this year already and all matches were really close. But I like the matchup she gives me, I have time and I can, I have time to play my game, so, yeah, I think hopefully it will be a good match tomorrow.   
 Q.  Looking back over the whole year, which tournament do you think is your highlight or which match do you think you played the best and can you summarize your season?  
DONNA VEKIC: I think my best tournament has to be U.S. Open, for sure. But my best match? Hmm. Maybe against Sasnovich in Brisbane or I against Hercog in Linz a few weeks ago. That was definitely my fastest match.
