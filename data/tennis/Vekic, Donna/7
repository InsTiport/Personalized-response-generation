D. VEKIC/K. Bertens   
7-6, 1-6, 7-5   
 Q.  Donna, a dramatic one.  What do you think was the key to getting that comeback and the win?  
DONNA VEKIC: I don't even know.  I was just like trying to put the ball in, and tried to be aggressive, tried to go for it because she was also serving for the set in the first set, and I broke her.  So I kind of had that in my mind as well.  But I really didn't expect to win after saving two match points today.   
 Q.  It didn't seem like today's win revolved around power from your game.  It seemed you were playing a smarter match and relying on your fitness a little bit more.  Is that the sense that you felt?  Based on your facial expression, maybe not.  
DONNA VEKIC: I actually had a feeling that I wasn't moving quite as well as I was in the last match.  I don't know.  I felt really clumsy today, like I was going to fall over my feet every second.  But it was definitely physical out there, and I'm really happy to have this kind of match in the first tournament, to see how much I can push myself; and obviously I can play long, play good and win, so I'm really happy about that.   
 Q.  How can you describe the change between the second and the third set?  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah, I think I was like a little bit slow in the second set.  I was late for a lot of balls.  So I just -- already towards the end of the second set I tried to get the intensity back, and for one we had quite a few rallies, and even though I lost the game, it kind of put me back into the match.   
 Q.  You said after your first win that that was the first time you'd ever won the first match of the year.  So now you have two.  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah.  It's crazy.  Quarters in the first week, it's crazy.   
 Q.  What means more to you at this point, making the quarters to start the season or getting a win like that over a Top 10 player?  
DONNA VEKIC: No, definitely a win like that.  If I won a match like this in the first round and then lost, it would still be really good.  She's a really great player.  I thought she played really well today.  So I'm really happy to win.   
 Q.  Do you know when the last time was you won a match saving match point?  
DONNA VEKIC: Yes.  In Washington.  I beat Stoller 15-13 in the third-set tiebreak.  Saved quite a few there.   
 Q.  But how has your week otherwise been in Brisbane?  
DONNA VEKIC: No.  I'm really enjoying it.  I really like the cover on the courts.  I think it helps a lot.  And I had a really good time at the fireworks.  And, yeah, that's it.   
 Q.  How much Torben is trying to help you?  What part of the game is he trying to improve a little bit more?  
DONNA VEKIC: I told her the other day, we were working more on my net game.  And today it just wasn't there.  But that's what we have been working on.  And I guess I still need a little bit more practice.   
 Q.  And then you'll play either Svitolina or Sasnovich in the quarters.  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah.   
 Q.  So another tough one?  
DONNA VEKIC: Yeah.  The thing is I was practicing a lot with Svitolina in Geneva the week before Christmas, so I think I know her game well now.  But whoever wins it's going to be a tough match for sure.
