How happy are you that that went so well today?DONNA VEKIC: I'm really happy.  It was important match for me, for my confidence, for my season, and I hope I can turn things around from now on. I been working hard and practicing well.  It just hasn't been there in the matches.  So I hope this could be a good start of moving forward.Q. Seemed like it was quite a sort of mental battle out there.  Some tennis and also to some extent who was dealing better with the pressure.DONNA VEKIC: Well it was my first time on such a big stadium.  She was French and favorite and the crowd was supporting her.  I warmed up on the court and I was like, Yeah, I'm okay.  This will be okay. Then I went out in the warmup I'm like, Oh, my God.  There were so many people.  I was so nervous in the first set.  I finally loosened up and started playing better.Q. Your ranking has gone the wrong way quite considerably.  Has your self-belief been affected by that at all?DONNA VEKIC: Yeah, it hasn't been easy, but, you know, I knew what I had to do, and I still know what I have to keep doing to improve and to get back to my previous ranking and to improve that as well.  Get back into top 50.Q. Were you able to avoid being distracted by the events around the article in the website last night?DONNA VEKIC: Yeah.
