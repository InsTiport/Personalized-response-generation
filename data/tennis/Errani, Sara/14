  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. What pleased you the most about that performance?  
SARA ERRANI: Well, I never beat her, so I know was a really tough match. Of course, she's a really good player. Really happy to won her in a big tournament like this one.  
   
 Q. What do you think made the difference today?   
SARA ERRANI: Well, just a few points. I mean, I just tried to stay there every point, solid, without too many mistakes. It's my game.   
She hit the ball really strong, so I just tried to make her play one shot more.   
   
 Q. What were your thoughts when you learned you'd be playing Petra in the first round?  
SARA ERRANI: Well, not very happy in the beginning, of course. I was doing the draw. I was the last one coming out. Of course, I wasn't too much happy. But now I'm happy, so it's good.   
   
 Q. You have Caroline Garcia next. What are your thoughts on that match?  
SARA ERRANI: I lost against her last week. She's a really good player. Really tough match again. Just here to try my best.
