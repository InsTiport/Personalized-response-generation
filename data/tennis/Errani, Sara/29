      6‑3, 6‑1

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Obviously disappointing result for you.   Can you just talk about the match, what might have gone wrong for you out there?
    SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, she played really good match.   For me was difficult.   I mean, I think the worst thing was the fight.   Normally is my best thing that I do on the court, and today was not good.

Q.   Why was that missing today?
    SARA ERRANI:   I don't know why.   I mean, I think is the pressure.   Everything is very difficult for me.   That's it.

Q.   You're clearly very upset obviously. 
    SARA ERRANI:   But is not for losing.   I mean, I'm not sad for losing.   She did a great match.
    Is not my problem.   The worst for me is to find the way, because sometimes there are difficult thing because you never ‑‑I have never been here like this.   I have never been in this situation, so it's a new situation for me. 
    And also for my team, not only for me, my coach.   We have to find the solution, because is I think these things happens to everybody when you feel on the top and you are there and the people is playing against you with no pressure and you have a lot of pressure. 
    I'm not that kind of player that can go there and make ace and winner, and if the ball is going in I'm doing good.   For me is to go there and fight.   If I feel that I'm not fighting good for too much pressure, for not feeling good with myself doing that thing.   Because I don't want to go on the court.   I don't want to go to play.   I don't want to play.   I don't want to stay there on the court.   I feel very bad.
    So that is the problem for me.   I have to find the way to find the motivation to go there, because if I go there and I know that if I lose is very bad and if I win is normal is not a good thing.   Is not the way.   You have to find your motivation.   I have to find a way to like to stay there and fight.   That is important.
    I hope to find it.

Q.   You were bumped up into the fourth seed when Maria Sharapova withdrew.   Did that add a little pressure?
    SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, absolutely.   Yeah.

Q.   How did you deal with that?
    SARA ERRANI:   (Smiling).   Very bad.   You see.   You see.   I don't know.   I don't know how to explain, but is very difficult.   I know the situation.   I know all the players expecting from me, and I would like to know how to do.   But you have to pass it on yourself, and it's not never the same that somebody is telling you and not that you are passing on that moment.
    So I hope this can make me stronger, make me (Italian) to improve.   This is moment I think you have to pass from bad moments to improve your serve, and I hope that I will try and I will find the solution and feel better. 
    Is not for winning or losing.   Is not that my problem.   Is to feel good on the court.

Q.   Did you arrive at this tournament feeling good about yourself or were you having some doubts when you got here?
    SARA ERRANI:   No, I think is some weeks that I'm feeling too much pressure.   I don't know why, but I'm not enjoying going on the courts, and that is the worst thing a player can have.   Because if you go there and you fight and you lose, not my problem.   I always try to. 
    But the problem is if you go there and you are not fighting, that is my best thing that I always had as my good thing.   And I have to find a way.   I hope to find it (smiling). 

Q.   You had a lot of time to think, I would think, yesterday with the rain and with the schedule being all messed up.   You weren't scheduled to play yesterday, were you?
    SARA ERRANI:   No, I was scheduled in double.

Q.   Did that have any effect at all, the waiting?
    SARA ERRANI:   No, not for rest.   Is like four days that I'm like shaking, sleeping very bad, feel bad.   Not yesterday.

Q.   Is there someone you can consult about that?   Did you talk to your team about talking to somebody?
    SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, for sure.   We are try to find a good way.
