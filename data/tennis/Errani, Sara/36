S. ERRANI/J. Goerges
  6‑3, 4‑6, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Just your reaction to the win, obviously beating last year's finalist here.   It must be very good for your confidence going forward?
SARA ERRANI:   Yes.   It was very tough match.   She was playing very strong the ball.   She was hitting the ball ‑‑maybe I never see somebody hitting that strong on the forehand.   She was also serving strong, and the court is fast. 
So it was not easy.   Just try to defend, try to play my game, but was not easy.   Just to keep going, keep try to be less unforced errors as possible and try to push the ball when I can.   It was tough, but of course I'm very happy to win.

Q.   Seemed like you won the backhand battle.   It was a lot of backhand rallies during this match.   Was it something you were thinking about before the match?
SARA ERRANI:   Well, I just think to play more on the backhand, for sure.   Also with my forehand try to take my forehand to play on her backhand, because with her forehand it was impossible to play.   She was making winner everywhere. 
It was very tough.   I just try to find her backhand and when I can, try to push her a bit more.   It was very tough.

Q.   It seems like you're becoming a more complete player as the years are going now.   Before you were very good on clay, and now you were finalist in Paris.   Now you can play very good on hard court.   Did you expect that kind of evolution several years ago?
SARA ERRANI:   No, but also the other years I like to play on hard court, more on the outside.   And Paris was different because it was also slow court, was not so fast, so it was better for me.
Yeah, I am happy to try to adapt my game on all the surface, not only on clay, for sure.   This is a good thing for me.

Q.   I don't know if you heard, but Victoria Azarenka has pulled out.   She was in your section.   Do you feel that ‑‑do you think about that, or is it too far ahead?
SARA ERRANI:   No, I just think about next match, and then we will see.   I just think about now Cirstea, andthat's it.   Not more in front.

Q.   Can you talk about the match against Sorana you have next and how you're approaching it and what kind of game she has?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, she has a very strong game also.   She hit the ball so hard to try to close the point fast, so I just try to push her when I can and try to be solid on the baseline, for sure.   And that's it.     But she's a strong player, we know, so it's tough.

Q.   Just going back to Vika, she said that she felt the injury, first of all, Tuesday of last week in Doha.   You obviously played her, if I'm not mistaken.   Did you sense she was injured or had a problem then?
SARA ERRANI:   I think no.   Nobody think about that.   She beat also Serena.   So I don't know.   I don't know what she has.   But sometime happen for sure.
In tennis we play all the week and is very tough.   You have to be very good every time physically and can happen sometimes that you have some injury and you want to rest.   To save also your physical is not easy. 
In football you see they play many, many matches, and they can say, Yeah, I change, and come another one.   But in tennis you're alone, so it's tough.

Q.   Do you think it's difficult, the two weeks of Doha and Dubai, the draws are small and the level is very, very high so you top players every day?   Do you think it's probably the toughest two weeks besides the Grand Slams?
SARA ERRANI:   Well, there are also very tough weeks, but for sure these two tournaments are incredible, no?   I think almost all the players better are here. 
So for sure is very tough, also because you come after Fed Cup, and after Fed Cup is tough to play because you lose many energy for attention and for everything.   So it's more difficult.

Q.   For years now we have had Flavia Pennetta, Francesca Schiavone, Fed Cup teammates of you.   And now obviously you're the highest‑ranked female Italian in the world rankings, and there is Roberta, as well.   How do you feel about that, being the highest?
SARA ERRANI:   I don't think about being the first Italian player.   For sure we have been a very good team always, and now they stop a bit but for sure they will be coming back. 
Of course I'm happy to be top ranking, not to be the first Italian, but for sure if you have top ranking is better.   I feel good about that.   I just want to improve my game every day, try to learn everything from everybody and go working.

Q.   Looking at your schedule, it seems you commit to play every week.   Is that a little bit tough for your body?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, it's tough.   I tell you sometimes is very tough.   You have to decide.   But for my plan we decide like that for the moment I'm good, but I know that I'm playing many weeks and sometimes I will have to rest.
Here I'm resting doubles.   Normally I play every time doubles.   So here we don't play.   But I know that, and we just try with my team to find the better way. 

Q.   Flavia Pennetta is playing Bogota this week, is coming back.   Do you have a word about it?   Do you keep in touch with her this week?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, for sure, we keep in touch always.   She come also in the Fed Cup week.   She didn't play, but she was there. 
For sure I'm happy that she's coming back.   She's a very good person before and very good player.   So Italy needs her, and for sure we know that she will come back very strong.

Q.   She did rehab with Rafa, we saw in some pictures in Barcelona, I think.   Do you think that's a good sign?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, for everybody is good sign to work with Rafa.
