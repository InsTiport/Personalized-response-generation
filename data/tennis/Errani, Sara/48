THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Tough loss in the singles.   How did you manage to pick yourself up for the doubles?  
SARA ERRANI:   Was okay for me.   I was feeling good.   During the double, after first set, I had a bit of down, a bit tired.   But we won a very good match.   We play very good in the third set.   
I'm very happy for that.   
   
 Q.   Did your partner say anything to you to try to lift you?
