 S. ERRANI/J. Jankovic
      7‑6, 6‑2 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please.   
   
 Q.   Could you just talk about the match, especially that first set?   It was very close.   Then you seemed to really just grind her down in the second set.   
    SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, very unbelievable tough match today.   Jelena played very good.   I think she changed the tactic from Rome.   She was a bit more playing with her forehand on my backhand.  
    But of course, all the points was very tough.   I just tried to be focused.   I was 4‑1 up.   She start to play much better.   I was a bit tired.   So it was not easy to stay there.  
    Of course, was very important to win that first set.   Of course, I'm very happy to win this difficult match for me.  
   
 Q.   The fact that Jankovic had a muscle problem and also the fact that she had like a big crowd cheering for her during the match, especially the first tough set, does sometimes make it hard to concentrate?  
    SARA ERRANI:   Well, of course, the crowd was unbelievable loud and was difficult to stay focused, of course, sometimes make you a bit angry.   But I just try to forget about them because of course was their job to stay there and make that problems on me.  
    But I just stay focused.   She called the physio, but on my mind I thought that was nothing really wrong on her and just tried to be focused on me.
