A. PETKOVIC/S. Errani
      6‑2, 6‑2

    THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Obviously a tough match for you out there today.   What was she doing out there differently from Madrid that made it tough for you to get a hold in the match?
    SARA ERRANI:   Well, I think she played a good match.   The problem was not that.   It was me.   No power, no energy.
    Like that, it's tough to play tennis.

Q.   Why do you think you lacked the power and the energy?
    SARA ERRANI:   I don't know.   Very, very tired.   I didn't have mentally energy.   Maybe is the thing that I have better, but today, I don't know. 
    I don't know why I was dead.   I couldn't have power on my legs.   I have ‑‑I don't know.

Q.   You have been playing doubles.   Obviously you play doubles and singles at the Grand Slams.   Does that make it harder to keep up your energy if you go deep in both?
    SARA ERRANI:   Yes, of course.   Of course.   Is not easy, but I always love to play both.
    That's what there is playing both.

Q.   I have heard you have had some problems with the media after doubles and you wrote a letter about it.   Has that contributed to your sort of fatigue or energy on court?
    SARA ERRANI:   Maybe yes; maybe no.   Don't know.
