S.   WILLIAMS/S. Errani
  7‑6, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions in English, please. 

Q.   Could you tell us a little bit about what advice your coach was giving you in the second set near the end of the game?   Looked like he was getting quite excited. 
SARA ERRANI:   Well, he just tried to tell me to serve a bit better, how to make it, and then on the baseline try to went head the ball, try push more maybe going to the net and be more aggressive; and also hit the ball more long, try to play more long, because I was playing a bit short. 
But that's it. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   I wanted to ask you about your serve, because I see a good thing is that you've got a good forehand, backhand.   Perhaps today in the second set we see that your second serve was not so good.   It was a little bit difficult because Serena was returning really well.
SARA ERRANI:   Particularly I haven't served very well today.   Today my first serve percentage is very high.   I don't know what it was at the end of the match, but in the first set I did really well.
My second serves are not that good.   The problem is my first serves, because today I haven't served that well.   I didn't put it where I wanted to because when they put so much pressure on me with the return, it's more difficult for me to serve.
I have to be better in that, but it's not easy.
