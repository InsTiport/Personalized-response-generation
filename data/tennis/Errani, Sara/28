THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You had injury yesterday night.   How this injury influence today's game?   Was there any influence?  
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, it was difficult.   I mean, I was a bit afraid to run in the beginning more.   I was a bit, you know, checking out how was leg.  
But I think was okay today.   I didn't have too much pain.   Of course, very tight, but not really pain.   So that was very good for me.   
   
 Q.   Next year or soon the WTA is expanding the Championships in doubles to eight teams having round robin in doubles, too.   Just wondering, as a player who plays both singles and doubles, whether you like that idea or you like the current format more?  
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, but I think they are going to make it also more days, so it will be better.   I mean, of course it's tough, but it's in every tournament like that.   
Many times it's tough, but for me I think is better to be eight teams and also is better if there are more days than now that we are playing all the days.  
   
 Q.   Today was announced Russian team for Fed Cup final.     It's Kleybanova, Khromacheva, Gasparyan, and Panova.   Do you know someone from the girls except obviously Kleybanova?  
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, Panova.   I know Kleybanova and Panova.   I don't know the other two girls.   
In Fed Cup everything is different, so you have just to go there and fight.   And it's not like a normal tournament.   It's a bit different.   So we will see.
