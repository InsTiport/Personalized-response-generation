S. ERRANI/J. Zheng
  6‑2, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Can you talk about your game plan today.   It worked so well. 
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, I think I have a game that is difficult for her to play with me I think.   If I play like up ball, very high, she's in a big trouble because she go back and maybe there is more difficult.   She has to run more, so...   This is one thing. 
Also today was very hot.   Was difficult for both.   But I play a good match and am happy for that. 

Q.   Did you change anything with your doubles partner before this match?   Did she give you any advice?
SARA ERRANI:   Yes, of course.   We talk about her match.   I saw her match, I think just one set.   But I know Zheng.   I know how she play.   Also she explain me her match, but I already know how she was playing. 

Q.   Can you talk about how does it feel to be into the quarters for the first time in a Grand Slam. 
SARA ERRANI:   Of course it's incredible for me.   It's the first time quarterfinal, so I'm very happy for this. 
I'm playing good.   I'm happy to still alive in the tournament.
