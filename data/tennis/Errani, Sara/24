ERRANI‑VINCI/Makarova‑Vesnina
  6‑4, 3‑6, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How did you turn the match around? 
SARA ERRANI:   I don't know.   Was very strange, very difficult.   We went from 2‑Love up in the third, 5‑2, playing not very good. 
From there we start, I don't know, just keep it going.   We won, I don't know. 

Q.   Valentino Rossi is a huge icon in Italy.   Do you think he'll be back in his prime? 
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, I think Valentino Rossi always have been unbelievable, so I think he can come back.
