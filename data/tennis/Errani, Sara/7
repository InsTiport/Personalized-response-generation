  6‑4, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. I'm just doing a story about Wimbledon fashion, the outfits and dresses and stuff. I know you're a Nike player. I wondered how you decided to pick your outfit and not wear the original dress.   
SARA ERRANI: Yes, I love Nike from when I was a kid. My dream was not to be a good player but to have Nike stuff (smiling).  
No, but I'm really happy to be in the Nike family. I love it really much.  
   
 Q. For this tournament, how did you pick ‑‑because they were going to have everyone wear the same dress. I guess they changed it and you wore a skirt.   
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, they give you the option what you prefer, and I prefer the one that I wear today.  
   
 Q. Were you happy they gave you a choice? I think originally there was going to be no choice.   
SARA ERRANI: Yes, they are flexible. I mean, if you don't feel really comfortable with something you can ask them and it's no problem.  
I mean, the important thing is to be comfortable on the court and feel good to play.
