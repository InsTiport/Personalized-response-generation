S. WILLIAMS/S. Errani
  6‑1, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Did you feel you were out of your league today playing Serena today?   That the gap of talent was just incredible today. 
SARA ERRANI:   I didn't understand nothing.   Sorry.

Q.   We use a term, out of our league, that she was at a different level of talent because of her game today.   Did you feel a little intimidated being on the tennis court the way she was playing?
SARA ERRANI:   Well, of course, I know she's a very strong player.   Big difference, of course; I lost 1 and 2.   She played a good match; she's a great player.

Q.   Was there anything you could do today tactics‑wise to try to get into the match?
SARA ERRANI:   Well, if I know, on the court would be different.   But I just try.   I just believe I can do before the match.   I just try everything I could. 
I just try first set to be a bit more on the defense, to receive a bit more far away, and play her high balls and try to make that game.
Then was not so good, so I changed and try to be a bit more aggressive. 
In any case, it was very difficult.

Q.   When she's at her best, can anybody beat her?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, I think maybe she's the best.   Yeah, for me I think she is incredible.   The way she want to won, when she play like this, I think she's best player in the world.

Q.   What do you think about the final?   Is Serena the clear winner?
SARA ERRANI:   We will see tomorrow, but I think she can win.   I think she will win, but I don't know, of course.   They have to play, and Azarenka is also a strong player.   I think Serena is another level.
