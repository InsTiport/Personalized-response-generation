S. ERRANI/A. Sabalenka
6-2, 1-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. You were 4-1 trailing in the third set.  What kept you going?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, just try to, I don't know, keep going.  Try to make her feel that I was there.  Maybe in the second I was too down, so I just want to try to come up and try to be there.
Q. How important was it for you as a former champion in 2016 here, coming into 2018, qualifying through the rounds, to get into the main draw?
SARA ERRANI: Well, is the only way to play.  I mean, what I can do?  I cannot play main draw, so I have to play qually.  I was lucky to get in, even in the qually.
It's good to won matches.  I need matches to be ready.  Of course, is not easy here.  You have three rounds of qually, tough matches.  I play tomorrow.  Physically is tough, but I'm trying to be ready.
Q. How far are you from your best?
SARA ERRANI: I don't know.  Is tough to say.  I keep going.  I think I'm in the right way.  Of course, I need more matches, more confidence.  But the way to arrive is good.
Of course, I know it is too difficult, maybe impossible, to reach the level that I had in 2012, '13, and last year.  I know top 10 is really difficult.
Is not my goal, to be top 10 again.  Is just to have fun playing, to find myself good, to reach the best that I can.
Q. Do you have any doubts after what happened last year, a rough time, coming in?  Does it affect you?
SARA ERRANI: Well, I'm still waiting to finish that.  Is not finish yet.  Of course, is a thing that is always there.  I hope that is finish soon.
