A. RADWANSKA/S. Errani
  6‑7, 7‑5, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Longest WTA game ever.   How do you feel now?   It took three hours and a half. 
SARA ERRANI:   Very tired, of course. 

Q.   Emotionally?   Physically? 
SARA ERRANI:   It's tough of course.   I try to do everything, but I'm tired physically now of course.
But this is tennis.   You win and you lost, so that's it. 

Q.   Between the second and the third set you lost few games in a row, six or five, I guess, and then you managed to come back to the game.   How did you do it?   It looked like you were out of power totally, completely, and then suddenly turning point and you began to play very, very well in the third set. 
SARA ERRANI:   Yes, I was out of power.   I was dead maybe from the second.   So I just try to fight.   In tennis you have to fight.   I just try to play point by point also if I was tired, and that's it.   I think only about that, not other things.
All the game were very long; also the one that I lost.   So just try to maybe push a bit more to make shorter the point, but was tough. 

Q.   This was a very long match and you proved during this whole match that you deserve for being in this masters.   Did you learn a lot?   What did you learn exactly during these few matches?   Did it show you that you really belong to the top now? 
SARA ERRANI:   I didn't understand too much what did you ask me, but, yes, I'm here playing in the master with the best players of the year.   It's good results for me.   I won one match; this is one was very tough.
I just try everything on the court, try to give my best, give everything, and this is it.   This is what I did.

Q.   What I meant is Angelique Kerber was in her first master and she was a little bit intimidated for a first match, but after she learned a lot.   My question was:   Do you feel the same or not? 
SARA ERRANI:   No, I just also from the first match was feeling good.   I was, how you say, excited to play, to try everything.
That's it. 

Q.   Did you enjoy playing on that surface here in Istanbul? 
SARA ERRANI:   Yes, I think it's a good surface.   With a ball after some game they are like very big and very difficult to move, but it's for me and it's for everybody like that.
So we know how to adapt our game to the conditions, the court, the balls.   So I think we are prepared to do it.
