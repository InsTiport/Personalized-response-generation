ERRANI‑VINCI/Black‑Mirza
  7‑6, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.

Q.   How does it feel? 
ROBERTA VINCI:   Good. 
SARA ERRANI:   Very happy to won the tournament, of course. 

Q.   What about your play today got you the victory? 
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, was a difficult match.   We didn't play unbelievable tennis, but of course they play good, so was not easy. 
Mirza on the baseline was very good, as always.   Cara on the net was, of course, making you a bit stressed on the baseline.   Was not easy. 
We had very close the first set, 5‑4 down, 30‑All.   Can change the match in nothing.   We were also a bit of lucky.   We play good.   We try our best.   I think was a good match. 

Q.   You two have been playing a lot of good tennis recently.   How do you explain that? 
ROBERTA VINCI:   Well, yeah, we play a good tennis.   We won here first time here, so of course we are happy. 
Of course, we try our best in every single matches.   Sometimes we play so and so.   But today we play, yeah, not so good, but we won.   It was the important thing. 

Q.   How much of a difference has completing your career Grand Slam at Wimbledon made for both of you as a team and players?
SARA ERRANI:   Of course, was very big, good satisfaction for us to won Wimbledon.   It was, of course, maybe the difficult one for us.   We never like too much the grass.   So was unbelievable. 
In Italy, it's very nice.   But we like to continue and try to win more tournaments and try to improve all the times.   Here, we never played very good on this season, USA season before the US Open.   We won one time US Open, but before we never did good results.   This time we won. 
ROBERTA VINCI:   First time, so it's good.
