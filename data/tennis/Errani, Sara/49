 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Corrado, you've inspired two teams in the last four years to victory. You don't have a No. 1 player like some other countries. What is the recipe for this?
 CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI: The spirit of the team. This is the secret of the results of this group. And anyway, these or two strong player. We have one, the doubles more stronger in the world. But we have three players that can play very, very good in the doubles. 
 So this is the great team. The spirit is right. They're ready to fight. So I think that is the secret of this results. They like to play this kind of competition. They are always there. 

 Q. Francesca, we obviously didn't see you play today. Just your reaction to winning the Fed Cup this year?
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: You miss me today, huh? You miss my play? (Laughter.) 
 No, it was enough, one point, so Flavia played very concentrate match. The goal was to win 3-0, and we did it. 
 So now it's just to enjoy. I came here today just to enjoy and to be happy and big party. 

 Q. Corrado, as somebody who gets your top players -- and obviously top players, I didn't mean anything by not No. 1 -- but I mean top players in the game. Are you surprised that had odds countries, specifically like the U.S., we can't get our top players to play. 
 CAPTAIN BARAZZUTTI: This is not my problem.
 FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE: You have to ask to Venus or Venus, not to us. 

 Q. In football, there are certain countries where certain players seem to play better for their country than their club. Something about putting on the shirt of the national team that makes them find something extra. Is that the case with the Italian team here?
 SARA ERRANI: Yeah, I think it's like that. I like for my side very much to play with Italian team. I feel very good when I defend my country. 
 I think also them. They are -- they always play very good in Fed Cup, so it means that it's like that.
