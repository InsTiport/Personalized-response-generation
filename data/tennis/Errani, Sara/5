An interview with:   
SARA ERRANI   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Can you explain exactly what happened to your neck.  
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, I woke up tonight at 3:00 totally blocked.  Couldn't stay down, couldn't stay up.  I don't know.  Yesterday night I was okay, so...   
I just went to the physio.  I try taking antiinflammatory, everything, to try to play.  But it's impossible for me.  It's sad for me.  I mean, I even can't put my T-shirt, so it's impossible to try.   
 Q.  Is it a problem you've ever had before?  
SARA ERRANI: No, no, not really.  Is a new.  They told me is nothing dangerous.  I mean, it can happen.   
I hope in three, four days it can go away.  But for the moment, I cannot do something in so short time.   
 Q.  This isn't something that happened yesterday during the match?  
SARA ERRANI: No, no, nothing.  Even in double yesterday was okay.  Yesterday night even.  I just woke up tonight like this.  I don't know why.
