THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about the match.  Are you content with the way you played?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, really tough match for me already this morning I woke up feeling bad so was not easy.  I warm up, was a lot of headache and like fever and this thing.
So just try to stay there.  In the second set she start to make some mistakes the first game, and I just continue and try to stay there.  I mean, feeling bad, but just try to fight.
Q. Is it flu or any kind of diagnosis?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, it's everything.  The air condition here is very dangerous.  So I don't know, cough.  I don't know how you say, headache and this normal thing.  Not too bad, but to play, not too much energy.
Q. Just talk about Sam is playing well.  That will be a tough matchup in the next round.  Talk about that.
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, I hope to recover good.  Yes, of course really tough.  Sam here is always playing very good, so it would be tough, for sure.
