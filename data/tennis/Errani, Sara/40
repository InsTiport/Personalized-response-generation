THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Your first win ever at this tournament, this WTA Championships, and it ended with a bagel.   How does that feel for you?  
SARA ERRANI:   I don't care too much about the bagel.   I just want to win.   I don't care about the results.  
I think we play a good match.   She was playing amazing on the second, and I'm happy that I've been still focus and aggressive on the third.  
   
 Q.   A lot of players talk about how it's a big honor just to make it to this tournament.   Obviously it's a much bigger deal once you win here.   Does it feel different now, more like you belong now that you're winning matches?  
SARA ERRANI:   No, I'm just happy.   I'm happy to be here and I'm happy how I play.   I just want to keep going and happy that I'm still alive.  
Tomorrow I will try.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about playing Radwanska.   Doesn't completely play your style, but you're both fast.   It's a little bit different than just playing on the normal power players, no?   
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, she's a very strong player.   I know her, and we play sometimes.   We will see.   I hope it will be a tough match.   
We will see tomorrow.
