6-4, 7-6
An interview with:
SARA ERRANI
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How difficult was it for you to face in your first match a home crowd favorite?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, the crowd was really noisy a lot.  Of course is normal.  She's from here.
I was a bit nervous in the second because I was also really tired.  Of course, when you're more tired, you're not that calm that you should be.
Nothing.  Was tough.  I mean, coming from Europe, I had just two days to practice on hard court.  Long flight.  Arrive here not in the best condition.
But was a good match.  Of course, I'm really happy to won today.
Q. When did you arrive?
SARA ERRANI: Two days ago.  From Bastad, so clay court matches.  It's not easy when you fly, one day traveling, then you arrive here, practice one day, then yesterday raining, just practice half an hour, then play today.
I was a bit tired also for that, for sure.
Q. She tried to go up in the rankings after her injury.  What do you think of Wozniak's play?
SARA ERRANI: Well, I play against her two times before today and I lost both.
She's a good player.  Maybe she has to have more matches to play better and confidence.  But, of course, she have been many years with good ranking, playing good matches.  So, of course, her tennis is good.
Q. You're playing Karolina Pliskova tomorrow in the second round.  What are your thoughts and how are you going to approach that match?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, really difficult match.  Here the court are really, really fast.  Is not easy for my game.  Last time I play with her in China, she play unbelievable.  She serve really good, hitting really strong.
Will be really tough match but I'm here to try my best.
