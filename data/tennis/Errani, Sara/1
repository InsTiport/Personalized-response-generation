7-6, 3-6, 9-7
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. That was a very dramatic match.  You seemed to be a bit unhappy with Kiki, with how she was showing that maybe she felt she was injured.  What were you feeling then?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, that match, I don't like - I don't know how to say in English - you know, when somebody joking on you.  She can play an amazing match.  She played an amazing match, but I don't like the situation.  One hour she's injury, then she run like never.  I don't like that.
She go out of the court on the chair, and now she's in the locker perfect, in the restaurant.  I don't like these things.  I'm sorry.
Q. You feel she was exaggerating?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah.
Q. Have you spoken to Kiki?  You said you saw her in the restaurant.
SARA ERRANI:   No, no, no.  I didn't talk to her.
I mean, congratulate her for the match.  Then after the people say to me that I'm unfair person.  Is funny for me these things.  I don't think she did a good attitude on court.  I didn't like that.
Q. You don't think she was actually hurt?
SARA ERRANI:   I don't know.  Did you see her running less?  I mean she run like never all the point for one hour, and you are one hour...
You know these things.  Of course, good job for her.  If you want to do like that, is a good job.  I think she can even do the same without doing that.  It was good.
I'm bad because was hurting me and make me angry.  So well done for her.
Q. What do you think the difference was in the match?  It was obviously very close.
SARA ERRANI:   Well, is one point.  I mean, I had match point.  She had three.  Is very near.  I mean, the match like this can be both sides.  Was really near all the match.  I had many opportunities.  I didn't took them up.  Of course, it's my fault.
But in the end, in the total, I think was good match.
Q. What is your thinking on using an underhand serve?
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, is not my first time.  If you follow me last two years, I had many problems.  I'm just trying to be there and try to compete with what I have.  There are days where is really bad, is very tough for me, so I just tried to compete with everything I have.
Q. What is the reason for your toss?  It went wrong about 60 times.  How come?
SARA ERRANI:   My what?
Q. Your toss.
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, I have many problems with that in two years.  Happens to me.
Q. Did you agree with the referee that you were punished now and then?
SARA ERRANI:   What, sorry?
Q. Do you agree with the referee?  He punished you.
SARA ERRANI:   Yeah, yeah, sure, is the rule.  If I'm back in the seconds, he did his job.  Of course is good.  Is my problem.  If I wait too long, is right of the chair umpire to call me time, of course.
Q. Do you fear to have a sanction with the WTA after you insulted Kiki Bertens leaving the court?
SARA ERRANI:   I didn't understand.
Q. Do you fear to have a sanction?
SARA ERRANI:   Do I feel, me?
Q. Do you fear, if you fear.
SARA ERRANI:   What is 'fear'?
Q. Are you scared?
SARA ERRANI:   I'm scared of what?
Q. To have a sanction.
SARA ERRANI:   Me?
Q. After what you said leaving the court.
SARA ERRANI:   What I said leaving the court?
Q. We heard (in Italian).
SARA ERRANI:   I say that many times.  They have to tell me during the match.  I'm not saying to her.  In Italian you say that when you're angry.  Is not to her.  I don't know, if they want to do sanction, I don't think...
When I say that?
Q. We heard that when you left the court at the door.
SARA ERRANI:   Outside?  I am outside the court already, I'm saying what I want or not.  I was already at the door.  I was already outside the court, so I don't know.
Q. Do you think she really needed the wheelchair or do you think the entire wheelchair thing was a fake?
SARA ERRANI:   Ask her.  Ask her.
