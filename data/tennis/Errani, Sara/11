S. ERRANI/M. Brengle   
4-6, 6-1, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  4-1 down.  Comeback.  If you could address, she called her coach at that point.  Your thoughts on why you'd want a coach to come out at that point if it was you?  
SARA ERRANI: He come in at 4-1, in first set?   
 Q.  4-1 in third set.  
SARA ERRANI: I don't remember.  I mean, I was a bit out, so I don't know.  I don't know to answer.  Just was not feeling really good, so I call him.  I don't even remember.   
 Q.  Not your coach; her coach.  She was leading you 4-1 in the third and she called her coach.  
SARA ERRANI: Oh, sorry, sorry.  I thought in the first set me.   
Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know why she called.  I was just try to thinking on me and that's it.  I know it was 2-1, tough two games against the wind, so I know going there was a bit better for me, and then just keep going.   
 Q.  The first set she came back.  Third set you came back.  Strange match.  How do you explain that?  
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, really strange match, yes.  (Smiling.)   
 Q.  How do you explain a match that's going one way and then the other?  
SARA ERRANI: I don't know.  I mean, she had a game that she did not miss a ball sometime.  She's more aggressive.  Sometimes she just wait more.   
So is not easy to play against her.  In the beginning was a lot of wind, so it was difficult to play to find the ball for me.  I don't know for her.  So maybe for that change.   
 Q.  Why do you think you won that match?  
SARA ERRANI: I don't know.  I don't know.  (Smiling.)   
I could have lost easily, so I don't know.  There is no explanation to this.  Just keep fighting.   
 Q.  Can you explain how you turn around matches?  You already showed your turnaround qualities in the match against Zheng Saisai from China.  You almost lost but then you turned the match and you won in two sets.  What's mentally your strength that you can turn around matches?  
SARA ERRANI: Just playing.  I mean, just do not think too much about this court.  Just think that I can play.  Just think more on my game, more on fight and play every point, and then it comes.  It is not thinking too much 4-1 down I will win this set.  No, just try to make this game and then maybe the next one and then maybe the next one.   
 Q.  If you were up 4-1, would you call the coach in that situation?  
SARA ERRANI: If I feel to call him, yes.  Is not a problem.   
 Q.  But did that break help you recollect your thoughts?  
SARA ERRANI: If he has to say something important on your game, yes, I call him.  If I see that I'm 4-1 but sometimes you are 4-1-up and you are not feeling like maybe not doing the right things playing, so you want somebody talk to you to see if you're doing the good things or not.   
 Q.  Runner-up in 2013 to Petra.  Do you see yourself taking the next step this time?  
SARA ERRANI: No, it's really different situation here.  So it's everything is different.  Just to be in semifinal for me is amazing result.  Let's see who will win and try to play another match, doing my best.   
 Q.  You have been top 5 and top 10 for two years.  How do you place your game at this moment?  
SARA ERRANI: How what?   
 Q.  Where do you place your game?  
SARA ERRANI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Where do you feel your game is at?  
SARA ERRANI: Well, not my best, for sure.  But tough year for me.  Just try to improve, to practice good and to improve to go back to maybe that situation.  It's very difficult, but I just play for that.
