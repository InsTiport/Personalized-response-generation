7-6, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Great match today.
SARA ERRANI: Thank you.
Q. Real thriller.  How do you feel you played?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, I think was great match.  Really long, two hour and a half.  Very tough physically.  With her all the match is like this.  We play always long matches, long points.
So I think we play a really good match today.
Q. The second set in particular you went down 5-1 and clawed your way back.  What was going through your mind at 5-1 down?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, was 5-1, but I had many games with 40-Love, 40-15, and advantage, and was 5-1 not really true.  Was not too much true.
Was just thinking that the level, I was near for the level, and just try to keep going, play all the points, and finally was 5-All, and 5-5, 6-All, and really tough the tiebreaker.
Q. You seem to have a growing fan base over the last couple days, more fans in the stadium cheering for you.  Do you find you have a lot of fans coming to watch you in Sydney and Australia?
SARA ERRANI: Well, I hope.  I mean, I don't know.  Today I think there was more for Jelena, but I don't know.  Maybe they would like to have a third set.
Yeah I think I have many fans, so is nice.  I'm happy to be appreciate for what I do.
Q. Do you like it in Sydney?  How are you finding it so far?
SARA ERRANI: Yeah, I love Australia.  All Australia is really nice.  I've been to Bondi Beach also the other day.  So it's amazing.  I feel really good in here and I think the people is really nice.  I'm happy to be here.
Q. Talk about the off-season.  Did you do anything different this time?
SARA ERRANI: No, no, not really.  Last year I couldn't do the off-season for the injury, and this year I made like five weeks.  So try to train hard, but with no change.  The off-season is the same, in place Valencia, with the same coach and same physical trainer.
Q. Can you talk about the injuries?  Are you a 100% and exactly what happened?
SARA ERRANI: No, last year I didn't do the off-season, not this year.
Q. Right.
SARA ERRANI: I had like a ribs injury one year ago.
Q. And physically you feel yourself 100% physical?
SARA ERRANI: Well, depending of the day.  Can change a lot.  You can feel good and then there is like yesterday really hot and you can feel bad.
I just try to be ready all the days.  I mean, all the days can happen.  You can have some pain or not feeling great, but for the moment I'm okay.
Q. Were you happy in 2015?  Were you pleased overall?
SARA ERRANI: Yes.  I made many great weeks.  Finished top 20.  Is a really good result for me.  I'm happy about that.  Was a tough year for me and I did a good result, so I'm happy about that.
Q. But the Grand Slams, they weren't spectacular at that point; you've been higher before.
SARA ERRANI: Well, for me was okay.  I try my best and was good.  Of course I lost with Wickmayer third round really tough match, then I did quarterfinal in Paris.  That is really great.  And second round in Wimbledon.  I don't love grass and was good for me.  And in US Open I was sick with fever and this and I did third round also there.
So was great.
Q. But you will want to be back to top 10 eventually.  The Grand Slams you'll be quarterfinals...
SARA ERRANI: I know it's really difficult to be top 10.  There are only ten person that are top 10 and the level now is really high, so I'm not playing to be top 10.
I'm just playing to try to stay in the tour and try to do my best.  If I do my best and I'm 30, I'm happier than if I don't do my best and I'm top 10.
So for me, just want to play every day, to practice every day, give everything I have inside, and then I'm happy about that.  It's not a problem for me, the ranking.  Of course you want to be the higher ranking you can, but is not my -- I cannot focus about that, because can be other person that doing amazing result and they can pass me.
But if I did my best, that is important for me.
Q. What would make you happy this year?
SARA ERRANI: To be happy.  To try to not have injuries is important for a player.  And as I tell you:  try to give my best, and this make me happy.
