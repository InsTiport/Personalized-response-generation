 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Must be very pleased with that.   
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: Thank you. It's amazing for us. It's the first Masters. I didn't expect this after first match. Even we won second match against Nestor/Zimonjic, I knew it was going to be tough match today.   
 We played unbelievable, so I'm very happy. It's amazing.   
  
  Q. How do you assess your chances going forward into the semifinals?   
 MICHAL MERTINAK: We'll see. It's not going to be easy match there. We have to wait for the opponents, but it's going to be tough, of course. It's always tough in the semis.   
  
  Q. Playing on Saturday, you'd expect to have a capacity crowd for the match.   
 MICHAL MERTINAK: I think it's going to be full, of course.   
 FRANTISEK CERMAK: I hope.
