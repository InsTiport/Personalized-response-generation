 Q.  Nadia, tonight you were a different player at the beginning or it was your opponent? 
 NADIA PETROVA: No, I think I was a bit struggling in the beginning with myself.  Absolutely didn't have an answer to it.  I came out on court and started the match very slow and I just didn't feel like completing.  I didn't feel like fighting.  It was very strange for me to understand why is that happening, because all year we really work hard to be here then suddenly I feel like after beating Amelie I have a good chance against Martina, I come on court and I don't want to play. 
 Maybe because it's really too late.  It's hard for me to understand.  The only time I started playing again it was 3 in the second set.  I really started fighting and you could see some energy coming out of me. 
 But in the third set I feel like I was already empty. 

 Q.  Martina said last night she still remembers a great match against you in Moscow? 
 NADIA PETROVA: Right.  It's been a long time, and I absolutely didn't think about it.  I think my concern today was to play the game I can and to make myself compete and at least enjoy being out there. 

 Q.  Tomorrow you're fighting again Justine.  You still have a chance? 
 NADIA PETROVA: I still have a chance.  I know that and hopefully tomorrow I'm not going to make the same mistake as I've done today, because then I would probably regret it for a long time, because I really felt like I had a good chance this year.  And so far after playing a match like today, it feels like I'm letting it go. 
 I don't want it to happen. 

 Q.  Good luck. 
 NADIA PETROVA: Thank you.
