THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 


Q.  Your game, you play a bit like her, don't you?

NADIA PETROVA: Yeah, I have also a powerful style to play, pretty simple I would say.  But at this time the women tennis is strong and it's aggressive and it gives results. 


Q.  Do you go for winners all the time?  Are you trying to learn to mix your game up a little bit?

NADIA PETROVA: To go to winners straightaway is like a little bit dangerous because you can get straightaway mistakes, so it's easy point for the opponent.  The thing is if it's comfortable and your position is very good, then you can go for it.  But if it's a tough one, you just have to play it back and make your partner  -- opponent play. 


Q.  How do you think she played?  You said maybe she wasn't physically  --?

NADIA PETROVA: Yeah, she didn't play her best because I was just playing a little bit away from her and she even didn't try to move. 


Q.  Do you like to play in the wind?

NADIA PETROVA: (Laughing.) No, this is not my favorite weather condition, but today was very tough and the wind was taking the clay with it and it was very difficult, it was coming into the eyes.  And it was very hard when you make a toss, the ball was just moving around.  But it's for both of us the same conditions. 


Q.  Is your coach here?

NADIA PETROVA: Yeah, my coach is here.  His name is Glenn Schaap.  I used to work with him two years ago.


Q.  You're not working anymore with  --?

NADIA PETROVA: With Tathiana, no, not anymore.  She's not feeling well and she's staying back home. 


Q.  He was in the stand, up in the stand?

NADIA PETROVA: Yeah, yeah.  He was sitting just right behind me.
