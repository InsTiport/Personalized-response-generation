THE MODERATOR:  First question, please.  
 
 
Q.  Before she withdrew, had you noticed that she was having some problems? 
 
NADIA PETROVA:  You know, to me didn't seem that she had any problems because she was still going for every shot.  I just figure out that down-the-line shots were very effective, so I was using them quite a lot.  
 
Q.  Now that you've played Seles, did you think it was different than you had thought it would be?  What is your thought?
 
NADIA PETROVA:  I've seen her playing a lot.  She's a person who takes the balls early and like to play in the open spots, so I knew what I'm gonna be facing.  So I just make my mind ready on fast shots and balls that I really have to be quick with my legs.  Actually, I was very prepared for it.  I got what I was ready for.  
 
Q.  What is your goal in this tournament? 
 
NADIA PETROVA:  I just take every match step by step.
