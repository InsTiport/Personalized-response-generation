THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How do you rate that one?  You looked in fine form tonight.  Looked like you were playing good tennis.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I felt okay.  I wouldn't say it was the best, but it was enough to win and close it today in two sets.  That's why I wanted to close it and not play third set.   
And because it's pretty late and tomorrow I have a next match.  Happy that I closed the second set.  I think my serve was really good today.  I had a few aces and a lot of free points from the serve and a lot of points which I closed on the net.   
A little bit struggling with the return today, but I think she was serving few times okay, as well.  And the game from the baseline I think overall was just solid, and, yeah, enough for today.   
 Q.  When you play a player like that who has had such a good win in the previous match, is it important for you to make sure that you have a good start to sort of set the record straight, I guess, on your end?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I saw the match yesterday.  They were playing really good tennis in the third set, but they are both different players than I am.  So I just knew it was going to be totally different match today.   
I'm just not thinking about what was yesterday.  So I just, you know, tried to be there today and to be the one who is pushing and aggressive, and that's what happened.   
I think she doesn't like this game at all.  And, yeah, we played few times.  I just lost last year in Hopman Cup, which I don't count that much, because it's not a tournament (smiling).   
Yes, so I think she also have this in her head.  I don't know if she was a little bit maybe tired, but everything was going on my side.   
 Q.  Was it a specific tactical decision to come into the net as early as you were in the rallies, to not have to get stuck, just giving her rhythm and rallying from the baseline all day long?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Definitely, because she can, you know, play a lot of shots from the baseline and she can run there half day, so that's what I don't want to do.   
So my plan was just to play aggressive, and when I had the first chance, just to move close to the net and maybe close it on the net or with volleys or something, so just to be pushing not with the shots but with my body, as well.   
So that's what I think was working today.  And same thing for yesterday.  Just have to say Vinci gave me good lessons yesterday (smiling).   
 Q.  So the slice wasn't bothering you today?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, yeah.  It was very ugly slice compared to today.  Was very hard match yesterday for me.   
 Q.  This is your first event with David.  Obviously the result is great, but how are things going with both of you, the coaching side of things?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, definitely it's always better if you are winning, so I cannot say much  there is some things wrong now.  So everything is going well so far.   
I think we just having fun even off the court, even on the court when we are practicing.  I think he's telling me good stuff, so I agree with all the things what he's saying to me.   
I think he can just improve my game and improve my movement.  So we are trying to work on those things.  Yeah, so far good (smiling).   
 Q.  When you play someone like Cornet in the final, do you feel like you have to change what you have been doing, or is the approach going to be what you have done these last few matches?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think it's gonna be more same what I play, because I didn't play any aggressive player here.  Just more of those type of players which are defending, so Vinci, Putintseva, and now Svitolina, and Cornet is going to be the same, which is, I think, better for me that I don't have to change anything and still to have plan about myself and not thinking too much about her.   
But obviously we gonna talk with my coach, and maybe there is going to be little bit different tactics.  I didn't played her since, they told me, 2013.  I don't remember that we played, but, yeah, she won few matches here, so she has to be in a good form, as well.  I have to be ready.   
 Q.  She said she didn't remember that match, either.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Okay.  Where was it?   
 Q.  China.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Okay.  I don't know it.   
 Q.  How are you feeling physically through the week?  Obviously everybody is kind of, the first week, the matches take a lot more out of you guys.  How are you feeling?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't feel tired at all, because my season finished pretty late, so I didn't have that big offseason as some girls.  So I just had few or two weeks off and then three weeks practicing, which is not that long since my last match in Fed Cup.   
So I feel like normally that I would be in the half season, like everything is going well, my body is fine.  Till yesterday, I didn't have any hard match, actually.   
I had few good days before the tournament when I was practicing in the heat, so I feel ready and  excited to continue this journey which started here.   
 Q.  You are normally so calm on court.  Everybody just kind of assumes that you're always calm.  When do you ever get the most either angry or excited or something?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Come on.  You saw me excited.  It's not that I don't have any emotions.  It's not like often, but it's still there.  I think it's improving, because when I'm getting excited I'm playing better tennis.   
Yeah, but I get angry with myself.  I'm trying not to show it that much, because it's obviously not helping to me and it's helping the opponent.  So I'm just trying not to show it.   
I'm getting more angry in the practice, actually, when I miss few times in a row.  I just smash my racquet a few times.  But, yeah.  Everything.   
 Q.  Is that something you want to do, show more emotion on court?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, but the good emotions I want to show.  I think I play better tennis when I'm in it, into the match.  Not like today, was not good atmosphere.  I didn't feel that good today on the court.   
Some matches -- well, you have to have good opponent, and the match has to be really, like, intense and I can get into it, and I'm playing better in these conditions.   
 Q.  The courts here, do you find them quite quick compared to other hard courts that you play on?  What's your thoughts on it?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I would say it's, like, in the middle.  Obviously when you play in the day and when it's 40 degrees, it's much faster than it was today.   
Even yesterday I played pretty late in the afternoon, but still, I think, it's pretty hot out there and humid.  So the balls are flying a lot.  I think it's my advantage for the serve.  It can be really fast.  I can do aces and I can really push, but I think it still can be faster.  I prefer.
