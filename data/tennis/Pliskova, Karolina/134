6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You have had some pretty tough matches with Giorgi, your next opponent.  Your thoughts about that one coming up?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: You mean Giorgi?   
 Q.  Yes.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, definitely.  I think she's playing well here.  Didn't see much of her tournament, of the matches, but I think she beat some good players, definitely.  It's going to be tough.   
Last time we played was in Prague on clay, so I was playing horrible there.  Just want to improve.  It's always tough to play her.  She's playing so fast and you never know what's gonna come.   
So I think it's gonna be similar to my match what it was today.  Not many rallies, some winners, mistakes, and I have to serve well.  That's, I think, the main thing.   
 Q.  How did it feel being out there as defending champion on court?  Did it feel any different to you?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, not really.  I felt okay.  Just obviously I didn't know my opponent.  So I don't think was the best match.  But as always, the first rounds are not the best.  I think she played really strange, some good points and then a lot of mistakes.   
Yeah, a little bit strange, but at least good preparation for tomorrow's match, because I think it's going to be similar.   
Obviously happy to be back and happy to be playing.  So important win for me tonight.   
 Q.  Is there anybody who plays that sort of extreme, aggressive game as Giorgi for tomorrow?  And how do you stay sane during that match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think she's one of the strongest hitters what I have played ever.  I mean, there is few, but I think she's one of the really, like, craziest.  I think she sometimes even doesn't know where she's playing.   
Yeah, she can have good day, bad day, so you have to be, like, really ready for everything.  Try to put as many balls as possible back, because she can also miss a lot of balls.  Just waiting for a chance.  I think against her there is always a chance, and if she's hitting winners, I still have to leave it and be focused on my game and especially on my serve.   
Last time, like I said, I played bad, but we played couple of times already.  Always was strange match.  I think it's like if you go play Karlovic; you don't even know how you play.  You're just, like, walking from side to side.  Definitely I think she's also quite double faulting a lot.  So I have to be, like, really ready and taking my chances if I get some.   
 Q.  Your opponent tonight, not too familiar with them.  When you play someone you don't really know so well, how long does it take you to sort of get a feel for their game in the first set?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: There is always some preparation for the match with my coach.  He went to check a little bit the match what she was playing against Vekic, and then obviously about few games I have the feeling, like, what is she playing good and what is her best shot and if the serve is okay.  So then I know a little bit, let's say, three, four games, and I can get used to it and to see what is she playing and where she's good or not.   
But it's always tough to play somebody who you don't know, especially the young ones.  I think they can play really good if they have nothing to lose, always.  But I don't think she played the best today.   
 Q.  A question about your patches you have on your outfits.  Do you put those on yourself?  Who puts them on?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, there is always somebody who is doing it for me.  But I can do it, as well (smiling).   
 Q.  Have you done it yourself sometimes?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I do.   
 Q.  With a needle?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes.  I can do it.   
 Q.  Who does it for you other times?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Always somebody at home.  Depends when the clothes, when I get it.  If I get it at home or sometimes I get it on the tournament.  There is always somebody in the locker room, so if I don't have  time and I don't have the equipment for it, then I always find somebody.  Or in the city, there is -- in every city there is some stuff which can do it.   
 Q.  There is someone who does it here, too?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Here I took it from home, these clothes.   
 Q.  But is there somebody here?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I don't think so.   
 Q.  At slams, you mean?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, at slams.
