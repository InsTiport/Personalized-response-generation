HSIEH SU-WEI/K. Pliskova   
6-4, 1-6, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Are you going to have nightmares about that?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on that?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I would say I was very close.  Didn't have many match points.  Was not that close actually.  I thought I was playing fine after the first set.   
I was obviously tired today.  My legs were not doing much.  Was tough match.  Especially to play against her, you need to be ready on the legs a lot, which I was not.   
 Q.  Did you just lose focus at the finish?  She's so difficult to play.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think it was a little bit of both.  Maybe I start to be a little bit more passive.  I thought is already done the match because it looked like.  She just started to play well.   
I didn't do anything that wrong in the end.  Of course, I could do better.  I think she just played well in the end, just went for her shots.   
She was playing this way in the first set.  It's tough to play her.  I don't like to play her.  I don't know if there is somebody who likes to play her.  But that's how it is.   
 Q.  You said yesterday you were going to see how your body recovered after how exhausting it was.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It didn't recover.   
 Q.  When you woke up this morning, could you tell?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, it was tough this morning, to warm up for the match.  Even now, so...  I need few days.   
 Q.  Did Rennae say anything to you after the match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, we didn't talk.   
 Q.  Been a good start to the year for you, hasn't it?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, of course.   
 Q.  Do you think she had the same attitude at 1-5 that you had with Serena?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I would not compare these two matches because I think the game was completely different.  I was completely different player against Serena.  I just played so much better there.   
There is nothing to compare.   
 Q.  When you played in Miami, you had to save match points.  Here today, she kind of comes back.  Is it tougher, the mental side, to play against her, or is it the physical tennis side?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I felt really bad physically today.  I think if I feel just a little bit better, I could made it because I was struggling a little bit with my body and with myself more than with her game today.  I think was a little bit different.   
In Miami, I was 100% ready there.  This is the bad part about it.  But overall I don't think I played something that bad.  If my legs and my body is there, I'm able to finish this match.   
Of course, in the end, when it's getting tight, her game is not the best.  You're never going to feel the best against her.  That's how it is.  I was ready for it.  But, yeah, shit happens.   
 Q.  Do you know how you'll spend the next few weeks heading up to Indian Wells?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I have no idea.
