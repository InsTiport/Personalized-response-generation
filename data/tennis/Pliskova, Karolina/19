Ka. PLISKOVA/L. Siegemund
6-3, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It seems that everyone is always talking about all the other top seeds except yourself. Does that bother you, upset you?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I'm not really thinking what's everyone is saying, so no.
Q. Do you actually like it? Kind of no pressure...
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No pressure? I think there is some kind of pressure when you're second seeded, so maybe you see it a little bit different than me (smiling).
Q. You are so far undefeated this year and have yet to drop a set. Can you tell us what's been the factor for your recent good form?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: For sure, the offseason I think was good. I did a lot of work, and I was feeling good in Brisbane. I was there couple days more before the tournament, so I think it was good move just to stay there a little bit longer just to get used to the hot conditions.
Here so far the weather keep changing. But I think I am more used to it. I like Australia. I always play well here. Of course it's only third round now, but I have played a lot of matches already, so I feel confident. I feel good enough to continue.
Q. You were saying earlier that on court that it was kind of an ugly match for you. Can you just expand a little bit on what you meant?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I mean, I was not feeling perfect. I think I did okay, and it was kind of solid match.
But I think against her you never gonna feel amazing because she tries to play a lot of styles, a lot of dropshots, slice. So there is a lot of different shots which she's playing.
I think she just wanted me to feel this way, but I think I was just doing okay and just staying on my side of the court, being positive enough. Serving well today especially, so I think it was just solid match.
