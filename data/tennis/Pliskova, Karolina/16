K. PLISKOVA/K. Mladenovic
6-1, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What are your thoughts on that? Looked fairly comfortable.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I think so. I think the score little bit is easier than it really was. I think we had couple tough games.
But overall I think I had it pretty much all the match under my control. Even though she played some great shots, some good serves, I think I was in charge of most of the games.
Q. What were you most pleased about with your game?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think my attitude today because I think I was not playing amazing but still, even I didn't make any points or I did some couple mistakes, not really good ones, but I was still there. I didn't really give up.
Although the score was easy, I could easily go that I could think it's already done. But she was still fighting in the second set. I think it was positive that I really stayed in because she could make it difficult for me if I don't really stay in the match.
That's what actually happened in Australia. I think she got much better in the second set. It was also getting a little bit here. I think I made it easier for myself that I just stayed there every point.
Q. When a player who has beaten you in a venue like she did here seven years ago, is that ever on your mind?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think with my game, there is not really anybody who I would be super scared of because it's mostly about me. Of course, sometimes it can be even I play good, but I can still lose, especially to the top players, especially to the players which also have a big game.
But I think with her was always more about me, waiting for chances. I know I lost to her here a couple years back. I was playing terrible. It was after winning Doha. It can happen of course. I'm not saying I can't lose. If I'm solid, if I am there just focus every point, I think it should not happen.
Q. A lot of the top seeds got knocked out yesterday. Do you ever allow yourself to look at the draw or just one match at a time?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: On my part of draw?
Q. Yes.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think Sofia was in my part of draw because I was actually doing the draw. This time I really saw pretty much every match.
But doesn't really bother me. It's not that I don't want to know, but I don't actually need to know because anyway it can change. The top players can lose, as you see it's often happening right now.
Whoever's going to be there for me, I have to play well. No matter if she's seeded or Grand Slam champion, I still have to do my job.
