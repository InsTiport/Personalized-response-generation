K. PLISKOVA/K. Mladenovic
  6‑2, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Well done.   Which was harder to beat, the conditions or your opponent? 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I would say conditions, but also like Kristina was playing really well, so the second set really wasn't easy with the conditions. 
I started the match and I was feeling great actually, and with the way how it went I was a little bit like it was getting worse actually. 
So I couldn't be more happy to made it in two sets.

Q.   She was coming on stronger and stronger, wasn't she?   So those last four points were absolutely crucial, weren't they? 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, yes.   She was starting to play better and better with the time, so that's why I said I'm happy to made it in two sets, because the third set would be‑‑ I don't know.
I still have my serve and I was still playing well, but it would be really tough.   You don't want to play a tiebreak in the third set.
Well, with the time really she was improving, and if I compare the first and second set it was a different player. 

Q.   Even though the conditions were unpleasant, you have a very good game for the surface of grass.   Are you excited about the possibility... (PA interruption.) 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I didn't have that many good matches on grass in the past.   Like last year didn't play this good on grass, so for me it's really important, especially in front of the Wimbledon, to play like this and to have some results on grass as well.
I think I my game is good on grass.   I just don't know why I didn't had any good results.   So I'm happy that it's come already. 

Q.   What was it like warming up with Kristina before actually playing?   That's got to be kind of strange. 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, for most of the people probably yes, but not for me.   We just talked, and we are here with families, my mother, she's not playing tennis.   I'm here with mother, she's here with father, and there wasn't any chance to hit with someone else.
There was a chance like to hit or not to warmup at all, so we just talked.   We Were really good friends, and I don't think this can have any influence on the match.   Like I know her for years and I know her game, so not even 30 minutes of warmup I don't think can change something.

Q.   The first interruption, was the umpire trying to tell you to carry on playing?   You both looked like you wanted to come straight off. 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   When? 

Q.   The first rain interruption. 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, it's always ‑‑ like with the rain it's raining just so a little bit here, and the courts are wet immediately.
It's just no one wants to get injured before Wimbledon, so we are just taking care of ourselves.   We just wanted both ‑‑ it's better to stop early than after you fell down or something, because then it's really like slippery, so...

Q.   What will your preparations be for the final now?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I don't really know.   I don't have any preparation.   I just did some stretching.   I don't feel that much tired, so I will maybe watch a little bit of the next semifinal if they are going on the court.   I don't even know now. 
And just wait until the finals tomorrow.

Q.   (No microphone.)
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I don't think here I will not go on the court, but TV somewhere on Internet I will try to watch.   But I know both of the girls, so...
