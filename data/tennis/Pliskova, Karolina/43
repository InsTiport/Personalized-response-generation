4-6, 7-5, 13-11
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk through the match, where you think it kind of -- small margins, but what was the difference?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think I had a lot of chances, for sure.  Also started in the second set, I think I was not playing the best tennis, for sure, not today.  My serve was totally -- not totally, but quite off.
I think she just played good.  She had nothing to lose, so some shots were quite understandable.  She just went for it.  A little bit unlucky, but that's how it is.
Q. In terms of the serve, the execution on the serve, in the two service games you had to serve it out, was that just a failure of execution?  Was there something she did differently in those games?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think it was just too quick.  Both starts of the game I was Love-40 down.  On one I was able to go to deuce.  On the other one, I think she just went for it.  She killed the first return.  She was lucky with the volley which she put on the line.
I think a little bit of everything.  I obviously missed something, too.  There was a mix of she played well and then I missed too much.  I didn't really serve well.  I thought the court was quite slow, too, really.  Be serving that good as I was the matches before...  I could do better.
Q. Obviously an opportunity you had here, but how are you feeling after the match?  To lose on a dead net cord, to have it tight...  I could understand if you're mad, sad?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't know actually.  I think I will find out sooner or later.  Right now it's just shit day.  That's it, I think.
Q. Can you talk about her game a little bit.  Were you surprised by how she played?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not really surprised.  I think, of course, super effective on grass because the shot stays quite low.  We played on hard court, it was different.  Of course, I was returning quite bad today.
I gave her a lot of points without she had to do really something for it.  She played great I think on the net.  She has good hands, good slice.  Here I think it's effective.
I don't know how big chance she has to go more far.  I think today she was playing good against me.
Q. A lot of the top seeds have fallen this tournament.  How much do you feel added pressure in the second week of a slam?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: There is pressure from first day on the Grand Slam, so there is not bigger pressure in the second week.  I think should be little bit less.  Of course, you face players which won some matches, too.  Not like you have the great draw.
You still have to play good tennis, so I don't think this has something to do with pressure.
