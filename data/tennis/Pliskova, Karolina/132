K. PLISKOVA/C. Giorgi   
6-3, 4-6, 6-0   
 Q.  Can you just talk about today's match and how you played today?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Definitely, first of all, tough conditions from yesterday with the rain delay and everything.  So happy that I made it.   
I think I played pretty solid.  It's a tough match always against her.  She's playing quite fast.  But happy that I made it.   
 Q.  Next you'll play someone you have played a lot this year, Wozniacki.  How do you see that match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, we have had a lot of matches this year.  I know how is she playing, so I know what to expect.  I have to be so aggressive enough and make some winners and serve well.
