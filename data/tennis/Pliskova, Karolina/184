V. WILLIAMS/K. Pliskova
  7‑5, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. A well‑played match. Tough way to lose I guess in the second set. Can you talk us through? When did you start to feel like you had a read on her game and started playing better? What was the difference in the end?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think was really high quality match, both sets, and even me and even she played some good tennis.
So I'm not really disappointed with the way how I played, but with the way how it ended. But that's tennis.
You just miss couple of points like this and that is it. I mean, the first set she was definitely better. Although I made it back and was 5‑All and I had some break points.
You know, she just was serving better at that time and she deserved to win the first set. But, I mean, I think I deserved to win the second set but it didn't happen. Was a little bit unlucky, I have to say, in the he said. I missed some close shots. 
But, you know, I don't even know what to say because I'm really happy with the way how I played and happy with the match, but just I wish I could just change the end. (Smiling.)

Q. First time that you played Venus. What was your feeling about how she was playing and what were you particularly surprised by? 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I know she is a great player. I knew it even before the match obviously because I saw her million times in TV.
But I saw few matches here what she played. I think this was the best match what she played. But it's final. Everyone is playing the best in the final. It's different in first round and finals to play those great players. They just play the best in the final. 
So, yeah, she didn't do much mistakes from the baseline. She was serving pretty well, serving a lot to my body, which was tough for me to return because I'm not used to that. Not many girls are serving like this. 
I couldn't really like be aggressive on the return. That was probably the hardest thing for me. From the baseline it was pretty 50/50, I would say. So, yeah, close one.
It could be three sets. It could be 2‑0 for me, anything, but was 0‑2. 

Q. Obviously disappointing in how it ended, but given the way that you were able to play today and the way you played throughout this week, how much did this final week of the season mean for and you? Does to give you extra motivation into the off‑season and 2016?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think, and even my coach think, this was the best week from the whole year like with the way how I played. Pretty happy about this week. Obviously it's going to help me to start the new season next year. 
I still have this week Fed Cup, so it's going to be pretty tough. I'm flying soon. We have to leave soon.
Yeah, but happy about this week because I didn't feel that good the whole year. Especially in the end of the season when I was playing the tournaments before in Asia I felt tired, you know, not really happy about my tennis, but this week definitely made it better.
