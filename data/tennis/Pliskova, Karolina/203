  6-1, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. What does it mean to you to win a junior Grand Slam?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I'm very happy and I think it's very great when I won the championship here. And I can't believe it, then I won it. 
 I think it's great.

 Q. What was it like playing out on Rod Laver Arena?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It was great. I was practicing in the morning. I don't know. It's very big for me. But the first set I think it was very good, and the second I think it was worse. 

 Q. She started playing much better in the second set. What were you thinking as it got tight at the end?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think in the first set she played bad. Not bad, but so many mistakes. In the second, she was better. But I play still I think the same. And I think the reason why I won was the serve. 

 Q. Nine aces. 
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think 13. 

 Q. If it had gone to three sets, how were you feeling? You looked tired. 
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think I was tired. It was very hot. I don't think I would win in the third set.

 Q. Did you get a little bit nervous when you were serving for the match?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not nervous. But, I don't know, it was very bad game. It was like 40-15 and then game. I don't know, it was very bad. 

 Q. When you were a kid, did you have idols like Martina Navratilova?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I don't have any idols. I just play. 

 Q. I read you played doubles with Navratilova. 
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: We played in Prague. It was an exhibition.

 Q. What was like that?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It was great. I play with my sister. I think we play well. We were 13 or 14 years old. 

 Q. Did you beat her?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No. But, I don't know, it was not so bad. 

 Q. Was it on a clay court?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes, it was on a clay court in Prague.

 Q. Did your sister give you any advice about how to play her today?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah. My sister give me something and coach also. So I know everything about her. But I play my game. That's all. 

 Q. One of the strengths you seemed to have was temperament. She was losing it a little bit on the other side. Does that help you when you see that?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes. I think she has better forehand than backhand. I try to play offensive to her backhand and also to her forehand. Maybe with the serve I won the match. 

 Q. Normally a lot of the players dislike playing against a left-hander. I think you are used to it because of your sister. 
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, for me is no problem because I have it every day in Prague. 

 Q. You played at the senior level, WTA Tour. How big is this title for you?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, it's big, but I would like to win it in woman, not in junior. This year I have no chance to play here. So next year I hope. 

 Q. Which place did they do the tattoo that you have?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: In Prague.

 Q. What does it symbolize?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Nothing. I don't know. Everybody ask, but I don't know. Picture. 

 Q. You go to play a seniors event from here, is that right?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes.

 Q. What about the rest of the year in the junior Grand Slams? Will you play them?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes. I think when I will get to woman's tour, maybe Roland Garros, Wimbledon, I will play the juniors after when I will not be in the final of the woman's.
