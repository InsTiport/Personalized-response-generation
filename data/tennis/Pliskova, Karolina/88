WANG QIANG/K. Pliskova   
6-4, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You looked in good control in the second set, then things changed.  Talk through what happened there.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it was only one break, so it was not really under control.  But I felt like I was playing much better in the second than in the first, more aggressive.  I think she just likes my game a lot.  She likes the pace from me.   
Maybe I could play more clever or different way a little bit to try different speed, different balls to her.  But I think she played very well today.   
 Q.  What aspect of her game do you think contains yours, given the last two matches?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I think for sure it's about me in those two matches, even in the one in Wuhan, even today.  But I was just not able to play good at some points, some games, on my chances.  She just played better.   
She's not doing much, you know, playing.  It's more about me.  I miss or I make winners.  I just had more mistakes than winners, that's it.   
 Q.  Coming to the Asia swing, you said your primary goal was to enter the Singapore final.  Given the results for the past two tournaments, what is your schedule before Singapore?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I go Tianjin now for sure the next week, then I will see.  We will see what is the situation after this tournament.   
 Q.  You're going to go to Tianjin?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes.   
 Q.  Is that by wild card?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.
