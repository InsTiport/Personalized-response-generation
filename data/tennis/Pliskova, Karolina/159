K. PLISKOVA/D. Cibulkova   
6-4, 4-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Second final of this year.  Can it be a second title?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, hopefully.  We will see.  I don't know my opponent yet.  Every final is tough.  I think there's going to be Wozniacki.  But I just wait after they finish.   
It's tomorrow night.  So first I just going to rest a little bit today and get ready.   
 Q.  What about if it's Puig?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, that would be probably better.  Not that she's not a good player, but I beat her a few times already, so...   
But I don't think that's going to be Puig.   
 Q.  What is your score with Wozniacki?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think they told me now it's 0-3.  But I think we didn't play for, like, last three, four years, so...   
 Q.  It was 0-3 with Cibulkova.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I know it doesn't really, like, mean much in women's tennis.  Let's see.  Everything can change.   
 Q.  How much did the final of the US Open change you?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't think much.  It was just a good two weeks, a good result.  Especially on Grand Slam, I needed this kind of result.   
But, yeah, maybe definitely it gave me a lot of confidence coming into big tournaments, to play some big players, as I was playing Williams sisters there and beat both of them.   
But overall I don't think much.   
 Q.  How many times did you get between your two matches?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: How many times what?   
 Q.  Did you get to rest between the two matches?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, first one I started at 12:30.  Then I was waiting till, I don't know.  We went on the court for two games, but I finished at like 7:30 or something.  Was a few hours between the first set and second set in the first match.  Then I had an hour after the first one that I won.   
 Q.  On the court you are realistic.  You just got one breakpoint in the third set.  How do you manage this breakpoint?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, it's always tough with returns.  I always believe if I can hold my serve, I have a chance to break her.  Then, like I said, I was on the better side.  I was with the wind, the game when I break her.  I believe if I play aggressive, I have a good chance, and it happen.   
With the wind, anything is possible.  There was some up and downs, especially the second set.  I was quickly Love-4.  Then I would say it was 50/50.  So it was about a few points.
