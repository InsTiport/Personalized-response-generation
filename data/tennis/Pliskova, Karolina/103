N. OSAKA/K. Pliskova
6-2, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A tough match, tough conditions.  Just talk us through.  What do you think didn't work for you tonight?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I think I guess everything was a little bit off from my side, for sure, today.  She was playing very well.  I think hitting her spots, forehands, even the backhands.
So, yeah, I just battling all the way, even in serving, returning.  I was definitely not feeling the best.  A little bit tired I felt maybe because of the waiting.  I don't know.
But these conditions, the evening one, it's totally different compared to day.  So just couldn't get to the game what I was playing.  I think I was playing pretty well the last few matches here.  So I just couldn't get to the rhythm what I had during the day.
Q. Did you see any differences compared her play last time you played against her?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I don't see any difference.
Q. What do you think...
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think the difference was in my side, not in her.
Q. What is it about her game that impressed you, if anything, today?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: As I said, I think she played well.  She started well.  From the beginning, I was little bit off.  So it's just tough if you start 0-2, 1-4, so 1-5.  So it's tough to get back into the match.
Anyway, I had some chances, and she just played a little bit better.  That's it.
Q. The evenings here have been actually warm.  Tonight is obviously a little bit different.  How much does the cold air change the conditions?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I think the balls are still pretty fast here.  But with the wind, together, I think I just didn't feel that well tonight.
Yeah, obviously it was a little bit colder than the other nights, but I was not playing any night match.  So it was totally different through the day matches what I was playing.
But I would not say it was that slow, but it was just different.  And with the wind, I just didn't feel my shots at all.
Q. Today's performance is obviously disappointing, but you have had two semifinal runs, now in the quarters.  Still very good tennis for this event.  How do you feel here in general?  This is an event that works well for you?  For your game?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think I have been feeling well here last few years, not only the last two when I was playing semis, but also before had some good matches here, for sure, beating good players.
Even this year, obviously this one was not the best but still I feel like I played much better than in the beginning of the year, the matches, and still had pretty tough matches here.
Yeah, this tournament I feel like in future it can be one of my favorite tournaments to win maybe, and for sure I will come back.  You know, this was a tough one, but still, like I said, I had chances, so it's not like I would be without chance in this tournament.
So for sure next year I just going to try to go back to semis, and we will see in future in this tournament.
