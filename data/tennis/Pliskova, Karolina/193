S. HALEP/K. Pliskova
  6‑4, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Did you think you would manage to turn it around at the end there?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I was trying to.   She's still great player, so I didn't have that many chances.   I was just trying to do my best and trying to stay in the second set still, but even if I would have win the second set, I don't think I would have win the whole match or maybe then you never know, I don't want to say anything that I would have won the match, but it would still be hard because she's not giving up on every point.   She's running really, really well, and so that's hard to kill the ball to her.
Even my serve wasn't that good today.   I would not say it wasn't good, but she's just great returning and everything just playing back.

Q.   Was it a back problem in the end of the second set?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   No, it was a left hip problem, but I just think it was nothing serious, I hope, but it's too many matches for me in last month (smiling). 

Q.   What's the general emotion or feeling for you right now after that match?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, of course I lost, so I'm not really happy, but obviously I'm happy for the week and for the last two or three weeks what I just had.   And I'm still going to Doha tomorrow, so I will enjoy one day off finally. 
Yes, so I'm really happy for this week.   I had so many matches here and beat obviously good players.   I'm not disappointed at all.

Q.   You have played the most matches on the WTA so far. 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Yes.

Q.   Is there any thought of, thinking about your schedule moving ahead, to make sure you rest?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I will think about the schedule and I will change it for sure, because like this I cannot continue anymore.
But, no, I don't feel ‑‑of course I feel tired, but I don't feel like bad.   So when I'm playing well, I still think I can keep going from tournament to tournament.   But it was hard because of the Fed Cup and everything, and because Australia and then Canada and Europe and here, Asia. 
So it was a little bit different than normal, and there will be more tournaments in Europe during the year so it's not going to be that hard.

Q.   During the offseason, you had a very short break, so is that... 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I had a month and a half, so I went for one week actually here to Dubai for vacation, which was great.   Then I was like three or four weeks practicing at home, which I think for me is enough.   I can't practice more, because then I'm getting bored from practice.
So it was fine.   I started the year well, so I hope the preparation, it was good.

Q.   Why did you choose to come to Dubai for vacation?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, because there is a direct flight from Prague, and I didn't really want to go any far and it's only six hours and anywhere closer.   I stopped pretty late this season, because I was still playing‑‑ I was still in the Fed Cup team, and then I was still in Sofia, so there was not that much time to go somewhere, I don't know, 13 hours or something like this, so I chose to go to Dubai.

Q.   When you were here, did you do anything tennis or it was totally vacation?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   It was only vacation.   No tennis at this time. 

Q.   Monday you will be No. 12 in the world and we are not even in March yet.   How do you feel to accomplish that so early in the season?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I wasn't really thinking about the ranking during this week, but it's amazing.   For first time in my life this week I was 18, now 12.   So it's going to pretty high.   I'm really happy.

Q.   What do you think you can take as positives out of this?   Because you have played against a top 5 player, you have matched her, you know you can do it.   If you were to take something out for the rest of the season, what would this be?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, for me it was first time to play against Simona, so I didn't really know how to play a little bit in the beginning, and she was playing really well.   Even my serve was okay today.   I had I think what I saw 90 or 87% of first serve, which is not normal.
But she's moving really well, so it's really hard to play with her.   But I'm happy that I played already once with her.   Maybe if we meet somewhere in the Grand Slams or something so I know how to play against her.

Q.   You have the WTA tournament in Prague.   How important is that to you for you to be there?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I'm really happy that we have finally won WTA in Prague or at home so I don't have to sleep in hotel finally.   After so many years it's for first time we had won in Prague, but it's already like five years ago, I think.   There was 100K in this club, and it's my club.   I'm practicing there, so I'm really happy to be there and looking forward to the tournament.

Q.   You're No. 4 in the world to Singapore now.   Do you have an eye to be... 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   No, not at all, because it's still far and there is still many tournaments to go.   Everything can change quite easy, so I'm not gonna think about this one at all.

Q.   How much of a mind game was this match for you tonight?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, it was a little bit difficult, because I was‑‑ you know, the other matches that I was playing against the players which are playing fast, as well, and doing mistakes like me, similar game like Ana or Lucie, yesterday GarbiÃ±e, but today it was more about my mistakes because she's not doing any.
So that's why it was a little bit tough.   But I had to fight for every point, and I didn't get not even one point easy, so that's why it was hard today.

Q.   Do you think you've come up so fast these last few weeks, the high 18, now 12, do you think you're going to have to learn how to think of yourself as a top player as opposed to somebody looking to get there?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, maybe a little bit, yes, because I still can't imagine myself I'm 12 on the ranking, but I just hope it's gonna come by itself and I'm just going to start to feel like I belong there.
We will see the next few weeks and next tournaments how it's gonna be.
