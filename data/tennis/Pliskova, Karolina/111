K. PLISKOVA/A. Cornet   
6-2, 6-3   
 Q.  Karolina, how did you feel playing through that match?  I mean just given everything that's kind of been going on before, being sick and everything.  Happy with it?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.  I think it was a good start.  Overall from the baseline I was feeling quite good.  Just on the serve I was a little bit off.  So I think my energy was kind of low with the serve, but, yeah, it was enough today.  A little bit windy, so I think it helped me kind of the wind today.  I was used to it from last year.  I remember it was almost the same wind.  So I think she can play well.  For sure she doesn't give me much mistakes, so I had to most of the time play the points and play the balls.  So I think it was a good start.  Could be better, but it's a start I'm satisfied with.   
 Q.  You're a good wind player?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not really, but I feel like I can use the wind sometimes.  So if I really hit the right ball, I can use the speed and actually, I like to play more against the wind than with the wind.  So I can hit for power.   
 Q.  It's easier to control the ball that way.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.  Exactly.   
 Q.  But yeah, in terms of your leadup into the match, were you practicing very much or full at all?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Full, not at all.  But I did hit yesterday.  We came in Monday pretty late.  So I just hit once yesterday and once today.  But I was not like off that much.  Maybe just a couple of days, four or five days.  And before I was practicing quite a lot.  So I felt like it's not everything away.  Just maybe physically a little bit slower and weaker, but overall I think the shots stayed there.   
 Q.  Next match against CiCi Bellis, young American.  How much do you know about her and what do you expect from that match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: For me for sure surprised that she won today.  So I think she has to play well here, for she won a couple of matches here.  We played in Brisbane, actually, which is not that far.  It was pretty easy match there, but I don't want to think it's going to be that easy again.  So I think never -- when you play those two matches in a row, it's never easy and never the same.  So for sure I'll have to play a little bit better than I was playing today, serve much better and play aggressive because I know she's tough from the baseline, so I'll just try to push her a little bit.   
 Q.  I know we talked earlier in the season about this, but since weeks have now gone by, how are things going with your new coach and are you happy with how it's been going?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: So far I think it's pretty good.  I've been feeling my game from the baseline.  It's just fine.  So I've been having a couple of matches already this year.  I think I've been playing solid.  Not the best for sure, but as a start I think it's similar to last year, the start.  So we'll just see in the middle of the season.  Now it's tough to say.  I was practicing pretty well, but got too sick.  I was sick twice, once in Thailand, once now, so hopefully I'm not sick anymore during the season.
