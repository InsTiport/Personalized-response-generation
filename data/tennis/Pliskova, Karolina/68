6-3, 6-2   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Two good strong matches, lots of aces.  You have to be pleased with how you're playing here?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I think I was solid today.  For sure not the best.  I somehow felt strange and the match was strange.  I think also by playing her first time, actually, and so I didn't know much what to expect.  And I think she can play strange somehow (smiling).   
But my serve was good, the match before also, now also.  So I think the last four sets, if we don't count the first one which I lost against Doi were pretty solid.   
 Q.  How are things going here with Conchita and is it just her that's here?  I saw Rennae.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: She was here couple days.  She left already and now is just Conchi and yeah, all is good.  We are doing a lot of practices, a lot of stuff on the courts, even some gym.  Because, you know, I have been here a week, so I just had enough time to do something more and to prepare.   
You know, she makes me work every time, more and more (smiling).   
It's good for me.  Yeah, so far all good.   
 Q.  The weather, significant changes we have had.  How have they impacted your experience here and your play and preparation, all that?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I know in the evenings it can get chilly, can be quite cold.  But during the day, I never had actually, you know, these kind of temperatures.  Like, it was 18 maybe today or not even.  It's pretty cold.  I prefer, of course, a little bit different weather, a little bit more sun, and, yeah, a little bit warmer.   
But what can we do?  So I think for my game it's not the best, but I'm still in the tournament.  So I know in the end of the week should be better, so hopefully I can get there.   
 Q.  How is a tournament like this for you just from a rhythm perspective?  Because normally when we play big tournaments on the WTA Tour, it's one week.  You guys kind of play back-to-back matches.  You're used to it.  Here it's kind of a hybrid between a slam, one day on, one day off.  Do you like that?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think sometimes the day offs can be quite helpful.  Especially when you play tough matches or when you play the late-night matches, it's tough to recover from that by getting sleep earlier, or sometimes when you just finish late it's not possible.  So I think the day off sometimes it's just needed.   
But depends on the conditions.  It can be, you know, 30 degrees, you can be destroyed, so anything can happen.  So sometimes it's helpful.  You know, after maybe matches like this, what I had today, I just prefer to play the next day immediately.  Sometimes you have just day off.   
So I think it's maybe good to combine like this, not Grand Slams that you have every day, after every match, there is a day off.   
So I prefer actually to play matches.  But, you know, sometimes -- actually in Australia I just didn't need day off in the beginning of the tournament.  But then after serious match, would be quite helpful, too, the day off.  So sometimes it can help.  That's how it is.  I think always the one half is a little bit different because they have the day off and we play.   
But so far right now for me doesn't matter because the match was quite quick and easy, so I can play tomorrow.   
 Q.  Then you've got Kontaveit next.  I think you guys only played once before.  What do you make of that match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: We played Stuttgart last year, so, yeah, I was playing well there.  It was quite quick.  I was serving well.  It's going to be more about I think serve, because on the serve I think I can be better, for sure, if I keep on serving like I was the last two matches.   
I think she's solid in everything, what she does.  So she's good in defense.  She can attack also from the forehand.  So I think she's fighting a lot.  So it's gonna be tough.   
Of course more about me, so I have to just go for it.  And then I think I have a good chance to win.
