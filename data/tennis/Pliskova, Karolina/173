K. PLISKOVA/G. Muguruza   
6-2, 6-7, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Really tough win today.  How much did that mean to you to get it done tonight?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, very difficult because obviously in the second set I was up a break, then 3-0 in tiebreak.  So I was so close to win it in the second set.   
Then I have to just say she improved really her game and her serve and everything.  She was more solid.  She stopped missing that much like she was in the first and then beginning of the second set.   
So it was really tough for me.  I was just somehow trying to hold close to her and waiting for my chance, and I got few chances.  Really wasn't easy.  All the games are pretty close in the third set.  There were a few, I think two, long games on her serve.   
So really tough match today and really happy to be through.   
 Q.  At the start you were very composed, calm.  Was there any stage where you felt that was beginning to unravel before you came back again?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I think I was calm the whole match actually.  Like I just said, I don't think there was any problem with me.  I think I was playing the same game as I was playing.  I was maybe a little bit better serving in the end of the first set than in the end of the second.  The serve didn't help me in the tiebreak.  Zero first serves, I think.  That's a big mistake.   
But I don't think I did something wrong.  She was just playing well.  There is not much to do if she's hitting it well.  It's the same with me.  If I am hitting well, there is also not much to do.   
You have to always just wait for the chance.   
 Q.  How grateful are you that there is Hawk-Eye here?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I mean, yeah, I had the feeling like everything is against me, even the line umpires.  Yeah, it was really about few balls, like I said.  Even all the balls are pretty close.  She was hitting some lines; I was hitting some lines.  There was some net.  Yeah, really close.   
The Hawk-Eye in the end helped me.  I was a little bit mad because few balls were against me, the Hawk-Eye what I lost, but in the end really saved me.  Could be 1-5 and could be really tough to come back.   
 Q.  How aware are you of the fact that you have a certain game style that can flip these scorelines around very quickly?  If you nail a few first serves, hit some clean returns, that even double break down you can flip the scoreline.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I mean, I still know I have the game.  One break didn't mean anything for me because I can be back quickly.  Two breaks it's already a lot, especially against Garbine.  She's serving pretty well or she was serving pretty well until 5-2.  Then it's really tough to break.   
So I was really happy with every game what I did, with every point what I put back on her serve, and was waiting for my chance.   
Then I don't know if she was nervous or just want to finish so quickly, but she started to do so many mistakes from the baseline.  So I just was waiting and just holding the ball in the game.  She always missed.   
 Q.  Obviously you had a wait tonight for the match before you.  Were you following it at all, and were you aware that Sveta cut off like a chunk of her hair during it?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I saw it.   
 Q.  What did you think?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, it's not the usual thing, but if it helped her, then why not?  I don't know why she did it.  Maybe the hairs were disturbing her, yeah.  Because of the humidity her she was probably sweating a lot, so that's why.   
Yeah, was a surprise for me.   
 Q.  Talking about the humidity, you talked about the court conditions in All-Access Hour.  What did you think of the surface and all that in the match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: To be honest, I didn't feel really good in the practice week what I had here.  I came on Wednesday, so I was here quite few days practicing.  I didn't feel that good.   
But I think today in the match I improved a lot and I felt much better during the match and I find my game.  With me it's still the same.  Everything is starting with the serve.  Then I have to be active on the legs and still moving forward, because the surface here is kind of not -- I would say slow, but it's stopping somehow few balls.   
Then when she started to play the high balls into the backhand that's really tough.  I just have to move forward and follow the ball.   
 Q.  It's 2:00 in the morning.  Is it the latest you've ever given a press conference?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I think so.  I didn't play quite late for a long time like this.  Yeah, it was because they were playing so long and then I was obviously playing so long.   
So that's probably the latest for me.   
 Q.  How do you move on from here?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Sorry?   
 Q.  How do you get on from here?  Do you go and do everything as usual, or will you just go and rest?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I'm going to just do my stuff, so massage, to eat something, and prepare for the next day what I have.  Tomorrow, see when I wake up.  I don't know if I wake up.  Maybe I wake up on Wednesday.   
Let's see, you know.  I have to get back to my work, so I'll try to hit tomorrow afternoon and get ready for next match.
