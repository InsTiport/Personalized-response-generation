K. BERTENS/K. Pliskova   
6-3, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  What is your overriding thought after that loss?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Of course, a little bit disappointed because I think I had a lot of chances in this match.  Still was two sets.  But so many chances in the first set, so many in the second set, starting with three breakpoints on her serve, then having 40-15 on my serve, all the games I lost.   
Yeah, for sure I had chances.  I think she played very good match, not many mistakes, was serving pretty solid.  I didn't have many chances on the break points because she always put the first serve in.   
But still, I started too late, so it's tough when you start with it's 6-3, 4-1.   
 Q.  Another top-10 seed going out.  Why do you think there have been so many shocks this year?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't want to talk about this any more.  I answered this question, like, 10 times.  I don't know why all the seeds are gone.   
 Q.  Did it play on your mind at all before?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No.   
 Q.  Is it particularly disappointing, considering the draw seems to be so wide open?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Look, there are still players.  I don't know if it's disappointing or not.  They are not seeded.  She was seeded.  It's not that there is free till the final.  You still have to beat the players.  There is Kerber, there is Williams.  I don't think the draw is open, for sure.   
This was match which I maybe should have won, if I maybe play a little bit better I can win.  It's not that you get something for free.  This is not what is disappointing.  Disappointing is that I lost, but not the draw.   
 Q.  A comment on Jelena Ostapenko.  She won today.  Had a tough time in Paris.  She hits the ball very hard.  Can you put her game in perspective, her chances on grass?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, for sure she hits the ball very hard.  Doesn't matter which surface she is.  I think she can play well.  Obviously on grass, I think this game, it can be very dangerous.  I never played her on grass.   
But I didn't see her match, I didn't see anything what she played this tournament.  Of course, she's a good player.   
 Q.  In terms of today's performance, the match, did you feel okay coming out there?  It seemed a little bit flat.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, little bit.  But overall it was about the same all the matches here, except the one with Azarenka.  I think was still the best match here.   
But I think my shots were not that bad, but still just get into the match pretty late in the second set, down a break.  I think she just finished the second set pretty strong, playing the tiebreak, didn't miss, played all the winners almost all the shots.   
I was starting to feel better in the second set, but still was not enough time to, you know, coming back.  But I think my game was improving little bit match by match.  But, yeah, for sure not the best match.  So many chances I had.  I didn't serve -- there were so many negative things about this match.  Overall I would like to take this Wimbledon as positive.   
 Q.  What do you take as a positive from this?  What are the specific things?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think all the matches what I won here were not really easy and I was not really playing the best tennis, which is good that I can still win matches with this tennis.   
Also by knowing that I still was losing here in the second round every year, I was able to turn couple of matches on my side, especially the one before yesterday, before two days ago.  This was also close to turn it for my side.  I think it's positive that I was still fighting.   
I think my game improved little bit, especially after what I didn't feel that well in Paris.  I think overall everything is fine.   
By being in the second week here for the first time, that's for me positive.   
 Q.  Were you surprised by how aggressive she played today?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Little bit.  But I know she can play well.  She played couple of tough matches.  I think she just went for it.  She beat Venus.  For sure, I didn't see match, but she had to play this way because Venus on grass you don't just beat by running and putting the balls back.   
I know she can play well.  For sure she feels confident after having quite good season also on the clay, also here, winning a lot of matches.   
Lot of balls she just played I think she doesn't even know how (smiling).  She was serving well and playing pretty (indiscernible) from the backhand.  I think the backhand can be off sometimes.   
I didn't play that bad, especially the second set.  The first set was not very good.  I think the second set was quite good quality.  We played a lot of rallies.  She was still in the rallies.  I think she was very strong, but not a surprise.
