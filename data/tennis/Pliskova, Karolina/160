K. PLISKOVA/A. Blinkova
6-0, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How happy are you with losing four games in two matches?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, happy.  I think the opponents were not -- I don't want to say "that good," but obviously I was better, so...
Yeah, definitely better match today than the first round.  Still happy to be there in just an hour.
Q. You get Ostapenko next.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.
Q. Thoughts on her?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I have played her in Cincinnati in the first round, so I know a little bit about her.  It's third round, so she won two matches, as well.
I'm expecting a tough match, but hopefully I can still improve my level and play it a bit better.  Hopefully it's going to be enough.
Q. Your sister's playing Kerber tomorrow.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.
Q. That's obviously one of your big rivals.  You have played her in a lot of big finals.  Have you talked to her about that matchup already, or will you?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No.  I have my own tournament here, so we didn't talk yet about her.
I just won my match.  So I have doubles, she has doubles.  Maybe we'll talk later.
Q. You're one of the favorites for this tournament.  Everybody is saying you're playing so well since last US Open.  How do you feel?  Do you really feel confident, or do you like to be a challenger now?  You have changed a bit even from us, journalists.  We really think you can maybe win a Grand Slam.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I will try.  So let's see.  I'm feeling pretty good on the court, confident.  I have some matches already what I won this year.  I didn't lose yet, which is also good thing.
Yeah, I think I'm playing good.  Even the opponents were not that high level, I would say, but still, I felt pretty good out there.  Third round is going to definitely more tough than the first two.  Also people are talking I have a good chance to win a Grand Slam, but we are just in third round, so let's see.
