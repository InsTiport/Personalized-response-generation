Q. KarolÃ­na, welcome.  I know that you had to arrive late because of Fed Cup.  But how are you feeling just health wise?  I know you had to pull out there.
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: Yeah, I was sick a little bit and still a little bit sick, but it's better now.  So I think it really helped me that I was not playing during the weekend.  I had some antibiotics.  Just went to hit today for the first time after a couple of days.  But it was okay.  So hopefully I'm going to be fine tomorrow in my match.
Q. Were you able to kind of hit -- I kind of forget the venue.  No.  You were indoors -- hit outside?  Is this the first time you've hit outside since Australia?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: Yes.  Yeah, because it's still freezing cold in Czech.  So we are not able to play outside.  Of course, so we were indoor in the venue.  Yeah, so today -- I got here yesterday afternoon, so I went to play today.
Q. How are you feeling just on the court, then, just managing the health and also getting used to the conditions?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: I think the conditions are quite okay.  It was quite hot, but not that bad.  So it's not that long time ago when I played outside.  Australia was just a couple of weeks.  So I feel okay.  So from the place when I don't have to move as good, my hands are okay.  So we'll see tomorrow in the match.  I didn't really push today in the practice that much, so I just want to get ready for tomorrow and to rest a little bit more.
Q. What do you like about Doha as a tournament and as a city?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: I like Doha since last year when I won the title here.  (Laughs).  Before, I was not playing very well here.  So from last year I like.  And I will come back I think every year if I can.  And overall I just enjoy the tournament.  I think it's also one of the best tournaments.  The hotel is amazing.  I know it's not the high season here, so there's not many people, which is great for us so we don't have to get inside of many people in the restaurant.  There is a small beach which is nice, so you can rest on the beach.  And I didn't get to see city much because either the years before I lost and I left or last year I was winning.  So you cannot go sightseeing when you are in the tournament.  So maybe this year because waiting for Dubai after.  So maybe I will find some day to go somewhere.
Q. Have you been following the winter Olympics at all?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: I was following but only Czech Republic.  And only during the weekend.  I don't know if you know them.  You don't know the women's.  But there was a biathlon on TV.  And winter the skiing or what.  So the fast skiing.  Or no skiing.  Skating.  Yes.  So I was following this because it was the only thing that was on the weekend, and we have women there competing.  So I followed.  And I know overall like about the Czech people who are there.
Q. I mean do you -- I assume you're a summer, warm-weather person, but in the past was there ever a moment where there was some winter-type sport that captured your imagination that you wanted to play?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: No.  And there is not even one which I like, maybe like to watch only but not to compete because I'm not a winter person and I don't like winter.  And I don't ski.  I cannot do anything on ice and snow.  So nothing there for me.
Q. Have you tried like the ice thing like hockey?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: I tried once skiing and didn't end up good.  I didn't get injured, but I didn't end up good.  And last year I think I went to skate, like.
Q. Ice skating?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: Yes.  Yes.
Q. You're good.
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: Whatever.
Q. So defending title here, I mean have you gotten used to what that feels like, you know, kind of, does it feel different at all?  I know people say, oh, I just treat it like a brand new tournament, but is that actually true or do you feel an extra pressure when you defend?
KAROLÃNA PLÃÅ KOVÃ: No.  I feel somehow like better on tournament which I know I won.  Doesn't have to be like only last year but maybe the years before so I just know that I can play well here.  So it's tough when you go in a tournament and you are losing every year in a row.  So it's just good that I know I can play well on this tournament, on the stadium.  So I don't feel any pressure.  I don't put any pressure on myself, so when the tournament I'm getting used to it.  Everybody has some kind of pressure.  Either you have pressure defending points or you have pressure that you want to go far or you're playing seeded players or something.  There is still something.  So I don't put any pressure about defending points.
