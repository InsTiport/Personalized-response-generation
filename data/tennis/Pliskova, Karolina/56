THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your season didn't start very well but then came the Rome title.  Now people are talking about you, one of the favorites here.  How do you feel about your game after a few trainings here?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I came Wednesday, so I have been hitting three times already here.  I feel good.  It's a little bit different, of course, the conditions with the last two weeks, Madrid and Rome.
But I feel confident after I made the title in Rome, so there is no reason why I should not be feeling great.  Even the practices doesn't have to be amazing, but, you know, I can always pick up the level in the matches.  That's what I know.
I start on Sunday, so that's good.  I think I'm ready.  So we will see.  The draw is not going to be easy.  I saw a little bit, but, you know, it's every Grand Slam like this, you need to go through some tough matches, tough moments, and then you gonna have chance to go far.
Q. Since you have been working with Conchita.  There is progress, you're feeling confident?  How much did she contribute to your game?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think she understands my game well, so that's why everything is working.  That's why I feel good, and we have the same goal.
I mean, all the team around me is doing great job.  That's why I feel good.  I'm not injured, so we can fully practice.  Then I can, you know, compete at 100%.
So that's why I think I'm playing well.  I'm feeling well.  I'm feeling confident.  From the beginning of the year, before when we did the preseason, I started to play a little bit better.  I was enjoying more.  And of course Conchita, she has good influence on me, so she's helping me, especially now on the clay.
Q. Simona Halep said she's training with you every tournament.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.
Q. What's the story behind that?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't know.  I think always the practice is quite relaxed, you know.  So there are some players which they are just too intense for practice sometimes, and you don't want to be stressing, you know, in practice, because there is enough stress and nerves in the matches and when the tournament starts.
So I think we are, like, I always enjoy to play her always.  It's a guarantee that the practice gonna be good level, because she always plays good.  She always fights in the practice.
But on the other hand, it's like, like I said, it's relaxed.  We can laugh.  We can, you know, even talk about something, you know, stuff, not about tennis.
So that's why we enjoy.  Yeah, it's not always that I ask and not always that she asks.  Sometimes it just goes.  The practice is always good.  I think that's why we always try to hit.
Q. The French Open has changed the rules this year regarding bathroom breaks.  They have changed it in both the men's and women's.  You can only have one per match.  Do you think that's fair, that that applies to the women the same as the men?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Tough to say, because I never use bathroom break (smiling).
But of course for men's it's a little bit different, because they can play maybe five, six hours, easy, the match.  Maybe I think they should have two or -- I think it would be better.  But for women's, I think one is enough.  Maybe too much (smiling).  Because you always have time to go before.  But sometimes you just take the toilet break for, you know, refresh and just to leave the court for a little bit.
But with men's, I think maybe, because the weather can be, it can be hot, so I think they should maybe have two.
