  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. With the conditions this year being a little different, how do they impact your chances?  How confident are you of your game?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   No, of course the conditions are not the best.  It's pretty much same for everybody.  It's going to be a little bit heavier than we are used to, especially on clay.
 I mean, we know I can play on clay, but maybe little bit different weather than we having now.  Anyway, I think the chances are still the same.  We still in the beginning of the tournament.  I just hope to start well.  I had some matches in Rome.  I think I played some good tennis.  Hopefully I can continue in this.
 Q. How is the injury feeling right now?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   It's much better.  I was playing today and yesterday.  Slowly it's getting there.  I'm lucky I'm going to be playing probably Tuesday, so there's a couple more days to heal.  Hopefully we going to be almost 100%.  Not there yet, but getting there.
