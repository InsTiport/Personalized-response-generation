7-6, 2-6, 6-1   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How did you feel today in the match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not the best, but I won.  The end was happy.  I think she played very good.  I know she beat my sister last week in Eastbourne, so I was ready for a tough battle.   
I knew she has a good game on grass because the shots are pretty fast, staying pretty low.  Yeah, but my game was not the best.  My serve was not the best.  Yeah, still managed to find little bit my rhythm in the third set.  That was much better.  It ended up 6-1.  Maybe if I play a little bit better in the beginning, it could be a little bit different.   
 Q.  In terms of your serve, playing on grass, are there any adjustments specifically you have to make?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it's different surface, so the movement is different.  Sometimes you choose different shots compared to maybe the hard or clay.  But not really.  It's still the same game plan what I had on all the surfaces.  Maybe you use slice more, some slice serves as well.  Otherwise I have still one plan.   
 Q.  How do you feel the condition of the courts are this year compared to last year or any other years?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It's tough to say.  I played just two matches last year.  For me the court was good.  It was pretty fast.  Maybe also because of the weather.  So far the weather is amazing here.  It's pretty fast.  The balls are flying.  It's first couple of matches on these courts, so obviously the courts were in a good shape.
