K. PLISKOVA/C. Wozniacki
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Do you think about No. 1?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No.
Q. Not yet?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not yet.  I have other goals than being No. 1 right now.
Q. What are those goals?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It's to win a Grand Slam.  I was in the final, so now the next step would be to win it.
Q. Where do you think you have the best chances?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, obviously with my game, I think would be hard court or Wimbledon.  So definitely French Open would be the last.
Q. Do you think it's possible you could win a Grand Slam this season?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, there's just three left now.  One of them is on clay.  So this one would be really difficult.  So everything what I play there would be a bonus.
Then I'll just prepare myself the best I can for Wimbledon.  I have a coach now which won Wimbledon twice.  So maybe he can help me little bit in this way.
Then obviously US Open, it's going to be difficult.  I'm defending there a lot of points.
Tough to say.  I would love to do it this year.  If not, I still think I have a good chance the next few years.
Q. When you came here, you said your movement is the weakest part of your game.  You seemed to have changed in a week's time.  How is it working with the new coach?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it's not only about the new coach.  I changed after last year Wimbledon completely my team.  So I have a new fitness coach since last year's Wimbledon.  We're trying to work on the movement a lot.
I think it's still improving.  Even today they told me the movement was quite good, but still I think it can be better.  Obviously there are some things what I still want to improve in the game, which is my backhand, my forehand.  Yeah, still a lot of things to work on.
Like I said, with a new coach, there's still things what he wants to teach me.
Q. You will now head off to Dubai.  Being unseeded, you have a tough draw against Roberta Vinci.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It's my sister playing against Vinci.
Q. Generally, the amount of tennis being played in this period, from Fed Cup to difficult conditions here, then off to Dubai, is it easy to deal with?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Not always it's easy.  I felt little bit tired after Fed Cup.  The weather here was strange.  First two days I had off.  It maybe helped me little bit to stay in this week, to get some new power, to be ready for all those matches what I've played in last three days actually.
So not always the traveling, the matches are easy.  But, you know, it's just one-hour flight to Dubai.  I just going to get ready.  I have a bye in first round there.  I'm playing on Tuesday.  I'll just try to do everything.
Definitely the conditions going to be different there.  But I'll have a title now.  Even if there I will not play good or anything, just next tournament.  But I'm just happy with this week now.
Q. You mentioned your sister.  Sometimes unless the name comes on the screen, it's difficult to tell who is playing.  Has it ever happened that you are confused for one another?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Like you see, it's happening almost every day, like hundred times.  I almost got used to this thing.  But still it's surprise me.
Yeah, I think we have different first names, so maybe the people could see the draw and just don't make sure they're still confusing us.
Sometimes it's not really nice, especially for her.  But, yeah, we are identical twins, so...  We have to count with that.
Q. Did you speak with your sister after the win?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I didn't almost speak to anyone yet.  I just did my stuff.  I'm not sure if she was watching.  She has her own match tomorrow, so...
I'll talk to her later.
