A. KERBER/K. Pliskova
  6‑7, 6‑3, 7‑6

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What are the main positives you can draw from today's final?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, it's definitely that many matches what I played here, especially before the Wimbledon. 
So that's why I came here to play this tournament, to have some matches before the Wimbledon.   I had five, so I cannot be more happy, even though it ended not really the way how I wanted. 
Still, I think it was a great match and I can take lots of positive from that.

Q.   What's next ahead of Wimbledon in terms of what you would like to work on? 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I still have one more tournament to go before Wimbledon.   I'm going to Eastbourne today, so there is still many things to work on.
But I have to say I was happy with the way how I played today.   There wasn't that many mistakes.   Still, you can improve everything.   Like the percentage of the first serve I think can still be better.
Yeah. 

Q.   Grass is a tricky surface and you need to move and you need to sort of get down low to the balls.   Do you find that's kind of a struggle at times?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, this is really tough, especially for me because I'm quite high.   So it's tough.   I'm not used to go in the knees that often, but I'm trying. 
Especially with Angie, she's playing so flat balls so you have to go even lower than normally.   That's why I think she's playing this good on grass.
It's tough, but I'm definitely trying.   I think I did a good job this week.

Q.   If I'm not mistaken, you hadn't won back‑to‑back matches on grass before you came here.   That's got to give you some confidence going to Eastbourne. 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Of course.   I'm feeling great and I had the feeling I was improving with every match.   Like I said, I'm going to Eastbourne, so I hope there I can have few more matches to go. 
I'm just happy to play the matches before the Wimbledon.   Like you said, grass is a special surface and you have to get used to it.   I hope I will be ready.

Q.   What made it click this year for your grass game? 
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I already said that when I was coming here those two years before I always lost in first round; you just have to survive somehow the first round because it's not always easy.
I wasn't practicing on grass.   We don't have in Czech Republic grass, so it's tough.   I was practicing on hard court, so the first round is always tough.   But if you can get through it somehow the next round are better and better.
That's the main thing.   I almost lost the first round here as well, but I survived, and I think that's why I came stronger. 

Q.   On the brink of the top 10 in the world now, is that your main target going into Eastbourne?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Not really, because for me it doesn't really mean anything.   It means, but it's not the main thing why I'm playing, to be 11 or in top 10.
So there are few more spots to go and few more points.   I hope if I can continue to play like this I will get there.
