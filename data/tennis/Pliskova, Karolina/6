 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. I don't know what you can say about Jelena.  She just played amazing today.  Was there anything you could have done on your side of the court?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I'm sure I could do much better.  I know that she can be tough if she's playing well, but I think everything started with me.
 Definitely I was not playing great.  I think maybe same level as the match before but of course she's much better player.  Not much to say about this match.
 Q. What do you need to do from here to sort of like correct those areas and finish the year strongly?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I'm not thinking about finishing the year.  I think maybe the year is finished.
 Q. Where would you like to improve on this when you come back next year?  Anything that you would like to see next year at Roland Garros?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Maybe better conditions.  But so far I cannot really think about anything what I can do better.  Of course there is plenty of things which I have to improve, but not thinking about next year at all.
 Q. Can you see Jelena going on to win the tournament like she did in 2017 the way she's playing now?
 KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I'm not sure.  There is, what, five more matches to go?  I'm not sure if she can hold the level.  For sure if she plays like she has a chance, but there are tough girls in the draw.
