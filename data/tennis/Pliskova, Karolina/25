THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Caroline Wozniacki will quit after this tournament. Will she be missed on tour? How will you remember her as an opponent?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I'm sure she's going to be missed. I think she's a great person and great player, too. So I'm sure also a lot of fans, they going to miss her.   
I think she played very good tennis and very good to watch, too. Also in the practice, she always tried hard. Always in the match, I think was great quality match always against her. A lot of fun, too, because she can be funny here and there off the court, too.   
For me, it's very sad that she's going to not play any more. But I'm sure she knows what she's doing. I just wish her all the best.   
 Q.  In terms of the couple days since Brisbane, how much of it has been spent practicing, how much of it has been spent taking a time-out to let everything recuperate?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I had couple days little bit easier, yesterday and the first day after Brisbane. But in between I was practicing quite a lot, I would say. Just getting used to the conditions here, obviously they are a little bit different than in Brisbane.   
But nothing new. I just continuing what I was doing in Brisbane. I thought it was working well. So did some good days of practice. Now it's more getting into the rhythm of tournament by playing matches very soon.   
I think there's not going to be that many practices any more. I play Tuesday, so we have couple days still before I go on court.   
Everything is fine. I feel physically good. Mentally, too. So I think I'm ready to start the tournament.   
 Q.  You have your opening round against Mladenovic, a player who plays up to the moment, but maybe doesn't have the form right now. How do you manage kind of a tricky matchup there?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I don't know actually in which form she is right now. I know it's going to be a lot about me. Even if she's playing great, I think I can still beat her. Of course, I need to match the level and be little bit better.   
Of course, I know she can be dangerous. We played some matches in the past, some good matches of course. Maybe the best one was on the Fed Cup in France.   
I'm sure it's going to be difficult. For sure not an easy round. At least I think it's going to be good test and I need to be ready from the first ball, first moment. We will see. At least I know which level I can play here these days. We will see.   
But for sure not an easy one.   
 Q.  It's Saturday, and you don't play till Tuesday. On the days before a slam begins, what is the feeling like for you going through these days? Do these days feel long? Does it feel short?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Actually by winning Brisbane, I think it's good to have this week off. That's why I always choose to don't play tournament before Grand Slam, just to get used to everything what is here. Still it's much bigger attention, more people. The tournament is just more bigger.   
I think it's good to have couple days just to move the mind and everything just to different tournament, different place. That's why I always am here a week before the tournament.   
But I think everything stays the same as on the normal tournaments. I don't really want to do stuff differently than I'm doing on the tournaments where everything is working. It stays the same. Maybe I just practice before the matches little bit less because it can really be long, those two weeks.   
Yeah, but there are days off in between in the tournament, so I think the schedule depends how long I play the matches, depends how I feel. There is plenty things which you can do. But I don't think really anything different compared to last week in Brisbane.
