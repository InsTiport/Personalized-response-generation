Ka. PLISKOVA/E. Alexandrova
6-2, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Your thoughts on that match?  It seemed to be a breeze for you.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah.  Well, for sure, the score, and my feeling a little bit too.  But I think the beginning was quite tough.  There were a couple of moments which I had some breakpoints.  I didn't make it.
So sometimes I had deuce on my serve, but I think I just did well in the, you know, in important moments, I played just better.
I think she was kind of on and off.  I don't know if she wanted to, like, totally kill me, or I don't know what she was trying to do.  I think she just went for too much sometimes.  Also the serve.  And I was just putting pressure every time I could, especially on the second serve.  Yeah, was good.
Q. The conditions here today have been quite blustery, very windy.  Do you think that was a factor, that you handled the wind better than she did?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, maybe yes, not that I would be super good in the wind.  I think nobody likes.  But for sure she was a little bit worse than me.  She was missing too much.  Also double faults.
But I don't think it was that windy actually.  I think it just went little bit off the wind maybe because also the Court 1 is behind the center court, so it was not that horrible as it was in my practice, so I was surprised.
But anyway, in Eastbourne I think it's better to count with the wind because it's been windy quite many times when I was here.  But I think I just managed well the conditions today.
Q. Do you think opponents get a bit demoralized against you when you are playing really well?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think it's tough because I can serve well.  It's about couple, I think, points.  If you just don't do well, then I can just really not kill you every time but I can just, you know, hold my serve quite sometimes easier, sometimes not really, but I can also serve, like, breakpoints down.
So it's tough.  And then I think more mentally it's tough that they just leave.  Not that they would leave.  They just, I don't know, try to play too much, I feel like.  And I don't mind this game.  Then there is too much mistakes from them.
Q. So you feel like they get to a point where they don't feel that they can win anymore?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, for sure today she had that feeling.  I don't know.  You should ask her.  But it seems to me like that she didn't really see any way how to beat me (smiling).
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, you against Kiki Bertens finding her way on the grass.  She will freely admit this isn't necessarily her favorite surface.  Your thoughts on tomorrow's match?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, mine too.  It's going to be tough, for sure.  I think she played quite okay.  I saw a little bit today.  Of course she made one final already on the grass, so she's been one more week than me.  I think she's fine.
For sure, it's not her favorite because I think she loves to defend a little bit more, so the clay and the hard is maybe better for her.
You know, she beat me last year in Wimbledon.  She did quarterfinal in Wimbledon, so I don't think it's the worst surface for her.
She can serve well.  She can also hit big, hit some slices.  I think it's not gonna be easy, for sure not.  For sure I can be better on the serve than she.  That's what I know.
I need to be patient, because for sure she's not gonna give me that much as maybe today she did, Alexandrova, so there is not going to be that many mistakes.  But of course I will have maybe more time.
Q. When you think back to that Wimbledon match, what do you think made the difference?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think I was not playing good last year these tournaments at all.  Maybe, like, some matches better but some worse.  But overall I think the feeling was not the best.
And also, Wimbledon, I was almost gone in the second round and almost in the third round, and then really in the fourth round (smiling).
Yeah, and I think she was just too solid, too good for me.  I just start to play better, but it was too late in the second set.  And she was serving quite well.  I think she also doesn't like the wind much, so if it's windy I think it's better for me.  So let's see.
Q. Do you feel completely different this year?  You said you didn't feel like you were playing at all well last year at this time.  Do you feel completely different one year on?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it's still me, but I feel I play better this year.
