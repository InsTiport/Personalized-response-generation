4-6, 6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Did that come down to missed opportunities?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, for sure there was one situation which I would maybe change if I can. That's the second set, 1-All, 40-Love, three breakpoints in a row. I think I could definitely do something better or just different. She played well, of course.   
Overall I think she played just great on the breakpoints, important points. Always first serves. She was just tough today. I think there was not many things I could do better. Of course, the energy with the time we played went a little bit lower and lower.   
Her game is just too difficult playing without energy. You always have to go down to the slice. She makes you run a lot. Then the serve, you need to be super quick to react.   
I think I was missing a little bit later in the match. But overall I think she didn't do anything wrong. She was playing great today. I'm also kind of happy with my performance.   
Of course, it's sad that I'm out of the tournament. I think I did well.   
 Q.  How would you rate your performance this week?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It was little bit mix of everything. Compared to how well I played some matches, I lost the first match which definitely I think I could have won. It was close. I think somehow I played better than the result is.   
I think even today I was not really playing bad. I had so many matches where I played, like, horrible, for sure I didn't deserve to win. I think today I didn't do many mistakes and many things wrong, but still didn't go my way. That's sometimes how it is, you play against top eight players.   
I don't know if it's luck or if it's something in me, but I think definitely it could go little bit better than it went. In the end, again, third semifinal, so it's not bad.   
 Q.  I don't think Conchita came down for coaching throughout the week. Is that a new thing you're trying, flying solo?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think she was there once in the first match. I'm not sure. But, no, I felt like I know what I should do so I didn't call.   
 Q.  Now the season is over. Any plans for the off-season and preparation for 2020?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: The season is over, that's true. Well, I have of course some holidays, maybe about two, three weeks. I have to see. I want to see when I feel like playing tennis. I also want to enjoy the off-season.   
I probably go deny to Tenerife like I was last year. It was great off-season. I might do some things which worked, then we will see.
