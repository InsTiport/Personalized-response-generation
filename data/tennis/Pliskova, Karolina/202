  K. PLISKOVA/A. Ivanovic7-5, 6-4THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. Obviously this is a big victory for you.  Just talk about how pleased you are with this outcome.KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think I played one of my best matches this year.  I know I had really good year and I was playing good in practices, past matches, also. I wasn't surprised by the way I played, but I was surprised that I won, because I was not expecting this.  So I'm really happy for that.Q. She came into this tournament, played a great first-round match.  This is a top-tier player.  What did you do out there that you think made the difference in this match?  She mentioned your serve, for instance.  If you could, just talk about it.KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes, of course.  My serve, that's the main point.  I was serving well.  But I was trying to play aggressive.  I know if will not be that aggressive she's gonna do more winners than I, so I was trying to stay aggressive and to go to every point. Well, of course she's great player.  She played good.  But she did few mistakes which I think was the deciding point.Q. This is the second time you have defeated a top-10 player; first time you've gotten into third round of a Grand Slam tournament.  Do you really feel this is a breakthrough time in your career?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I have been playing good matches in past, as well.  Those matches I have more against top 10.  I played Serena, so I know I have more like experience with these matches. Yes, maybe this is the main thing.Q. How does it feel to be in the third round of a Grand Slam?  It's the first time.KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes, of course it's great.  I was waiting for this quite long because I was losing still in the second round this year.  So I'm happy.Q. What do you think is the biggest change in your game between years previously and now that's seen you go up the rankings as quickly as you have this year?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, definitely I'm older.  I'm getting more experience.  I'm practicing a little bit more, changing some things about moving and so.  Really focused on my game to just hold my serve and then trying to go more into returns. But like I said, I had quite a lot of matches against these top players.  So I would say that's because of that.Q. How beneficial is it in terms of your development?  As you mentioned, you played Serena and quite a list of top players.KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't understand this question.Q. As you said, you faced a lot of the big names in women's tennis.KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yes.Q. How beneficial is that to you in terms of growing and being able to go deeper in tournaments, maybe win tournaments and Grand Slams, that kind of thing?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it's really important because if I want to win, say, Grand Slams or tournaments I have to beat those players, so every match against them it's important.Q. A lot of Czech players have been playing well with Petra's Wimbledon win.  How do you feel that's motivated you?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I'm not looking on other players.  I know they are playing really well.  I know Petra.  I know Zahlavova Strycova.  She's playing also really well.  But I'm not really watching them.Q. How hard do you think it is now?  How long does take to really understand what it takes out here on the circuit?  We have teenagers winning big matches pretty young.  What's the process like, do you think, these days?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, yes, of course it takes some time, you know, when we are starting to play juniors.  And then we won some matches like Grand Slams in juniors, and then going to women's it's totally different tennis in women's. So then you're starting to play ITF.  Everything is needs time.  Then you need those matches more against better players and better players. So years (smiling).Q. What's the hardest part about it?  They figure out your game and figure out how to adapt to you and then you have to change your game again?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, no, no.  Me, I'm not changing my game at all.  I'm just trying to play my game and improve in my game.  I'm not changing anything in this.Q. Do you think you would have had what it takes to beat Ana a couple of years ago, or you need the time and experience to do that?KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I need the time.  I didn't change anything in my game.  Of course I'm improving, practicing, everything, but I would say it's only about the experience and that I was calm.  I wasn't like surprised that I'm on center and those stuff.
