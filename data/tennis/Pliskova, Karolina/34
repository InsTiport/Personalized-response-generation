7-6, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Tough tiebreak. Walk us through that. Have you ever played one that long?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, was about couple points the first set. It was very important I think. I think that decided all match. Even though I had some chances in the second set, too, it was a big part of the match, the first set.   
For sure I had some chances. Like I had a quick break, so I think I could do better to stay little bit longer up with my break and my serve beginning of the match.   
I think she just played well. I think she didn't give me much. Everything what I just won was because I made a winner or because I was pushing her. Overall I think she didn't give me many mistakes.   
I think it was quite disappointing to lose but also positive start of the tournament.   
 Q.  You have a leading head-to-head with her. This is the fourth match in a row she's won. What has changed about her game?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think she didn't change, well, anything because she's still playing the same game. I think it's just every time what we played the last matches, we played last year Singapore, she won, and here. I think the surface is better for her than me. Even today, even last year, it was about couple of points.   
I don't feel like I lost last four matches. I'm not going to be scared from playing her again because I feel every time I'm going to have my chances, so it's always going to be about me.   
 Q.  It looked like she was able to read your second serve well. Do you think that was what made the difference? How will you adjust in the next match?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't know, I think it was not about my second serve this match. I think I had some chances which I still could play better. It was not about my second serve. Everything was in the rally. I don't think she was killing my second serve.   
 Q.  No stranger to the round-robin format. Is it tough to reset after a tough battle like this?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Of course. But there is a day off which for sure helps. Everything starts from zero. There is two more matches, so everything is possible. Everything still can happen.   
Let's see who is going to win, who is going to be my opponent for the next round. I'll do my best.   
 Q.  We talked about the speed of the court. With the people inside the stadium, does that affect the speed at all, slightly warmer?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, actually I don't think so. I've been practicing there a couple days already. I think it's still slow as it was the first day. I think it just stays the same. For me it's going to be always slow.
