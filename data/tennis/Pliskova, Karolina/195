THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   That's the fifth time you've beaten a top‑10 player, I think.   Give us your reaction to that.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I'm not really thinking about if she's top 10 or out of top 10.   I just went on the court.   I played her this year three times already and always it was a tough match.  
She's playing really good on hard court and clay, so I think just grass is not the best surface for her.   I just was happy with my game.   I was trying to play aggressive because I know she's really good running and just having good hands.  
So it wasn't that easy how the score looks, but I'm happy that I made it.   
   
 Q.   When you reach the semifinal of any tournament, is there is fundamental change in the mindset that you have in term of approach.   Do you feel there is sort of a higher level of focus needed?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I didn't came to this tournament to thinking about semifinals or finals or winning the tournament, because it's first tournament on grass and it's always a little bit different to get used to the courts, to get used to grass.  
It's a little bit different game.   I was happy with the first‑round win and then the second‑round win, so now I am in the semifinals.   I'm really happy.   But I wasn't really thinking about this.   
So I'm just happy to be in the semifinal and will do everything to get in the final.   
   
 Q.   Yesterday was quite a challenge because obviously you'd been on and off the court the day before and then you had to get off with a quick start.   You had a slow start against Jo to begin with, so can you walk us through yesterday.  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, the first set I have to say I started really bad, but I have to also say that Joanna was playing really well.   Also it was her second tournament on grass, so she was probably more used to the grass.   
So she was definitely better the first set, but then I improved a little bit.   The weather that day wasn't that good so it was hard.   We were three times off the court and still getting on and off, so it was a little bit difficult.  
Then I made the first break in the third set, and that's what probably was the deciding point.   And then I was just happy to win this match 6‑4 in the third.   
I improved a lot in the second when I was playing the second match.   It was also 6‑2, 6‑2, I think against Zarina Diyas.   And I don't also think she's a grass‑court player, but it wasn't as easy one.   The score also looks like it was easy but it wasn't that easy and the games were quite close.  
Yeah, I feel better and better match for match, so we will see how I play do tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   It's an interesting point you make about the grass and the scoreline.   So the scorelines have looked easy; games have been hard.   Are you finding it hard to adjust to that, on grass especially?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, of course.   And like I said, the score, it was two times in a row 6‑2, 6‑2, and I didn't win like this ever I think this year, like this easy score.   I always was winning in three sets.   
So I'm just also happy to have some matches like this because I didn't have many of those.   I think it's also good I'm not that tired in the next matches.  
So I feel fine and I'm looking forward to do semis.   
   
 Q.   You had two first‑round losses here before.   Are you beginning to like grass?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I always liked grass, but Birmingham wasn't my best place and best tournament for me till now.   I'm happy that I went through here finally and that I won some matches here.  
I was always feeling good, but I didn't have that easy draws for first round.   Even here I almost loss in the first round, so I'm really happy to be the semis here, especially in Birmingham, and also to have some good result before Wimbledon on grass.   
   
 Q.   Do you mind me asking, you've got two tattoos, one on your shoulder and one on your thigh.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   Do they mean something in particular?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   No.   Doesn't mean anything.   
   
 Q.   They don't mean anything?   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   No.   
   
 Q.   You had them done...  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, the first one which is on my arm, I've done that when I was 15; and then I had the other one, and it's actually getting a little bit bigger and this was like three years later.
