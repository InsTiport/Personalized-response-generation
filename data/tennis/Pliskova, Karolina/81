E. SVITOLINA/K. Pliskova
6-3, 2-6, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. How long did it take to get that third game out of your head and kind of like reengage?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: A set (smiling).  I think it was a huge game.  It was pretty similar to yesterday, day before when I played against Caro.  So it was also huge game, the third one.  It change completely.
I was pretty negative about the way how I played my break points and that I lost the game.  But overall, I was just unlucky also on one hand.  This game, I could have won it, it could be different, but it was not.  And maybe, you know, I should not think about it too much, because I think it had big influence on the first set.
But anyway, I just, you know, reset after the first set, and I think I played very good match after.
Q. In terms of third set, what was the difference there?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think my serve was not great today at all, but it's also, on the other hand, she's returning pretty well, so she's putting a lot of balls back.  So there is the pressure that you always have to play the ball after the serve.
Yeah, I think I didn't have that many points from the serve, but I think I was great at the net today, so that's pretty positive for me.  That's what I want to remember.  You know, I think the second set was overall I think maybe one of the best sets what I played this year.  So pretty positive about that.
Obviously the third set I didn't hold much my serve, which is always frustrating, but, yeah, she's a good player, too, so I was not there alone.
Q. You have had a lot of success against Elina in the past.  What is she doing, in your opinion, different maybe in the last couple of matches that have made things more difficult for you?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, it's few years when we played when I was beating her, so I think she improved a lot.  She has a lot of good quality matches on good level, so she has confidence.  But I don't think her game changed.  I think she's still playing similar.  She was playing -- before maybe she's missing much more.  Maybe she improve a little bit the serve.  But otherwise she's just defending.
I think every time it's going to be about me with her.  That's what I know.  Not always I'm able to, you know, play good and beat her, because she's just running well, defending well.  She won good match against Petra so she was feeling confident today.
Like I said, I don't think I played bad but she was just maybe a little bit better in some points.
Q. And Petra, it will be kind of a big shift from the other opponents you have had thus far.  How will you make that adjustment?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, maybe a little bit more, gonna be more mistakes, more winners, less rallies.  But so far I don't want to think about Kvitova now.
Q. I know you don't want to think about Petra, but what do you need to do to beat Petra?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It's gonna be completely different match, for sure, than those two.  We played this year once.  Always when I played her she won the tournament, so maybe this time it's gonna be different (smiling).
