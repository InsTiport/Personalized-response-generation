 K. PLISKOVA/G. Muguruza
  6‑4, 5‑7, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You finally got the break in the end but you were down Love‑40.   How did you stay composed during that game?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, it was a really long match.   I had so many chances on her serve, and in the end I did the break quite easy with 40‑Love.   She did few mistakes there.   I always had only 30‑Love on her serve but couldn't make the third point.  
But this game I made it, and it made the break.   And immediately I was losing 40‑Love, so it was quite difficult situation.   I was already a little bit thinking about the tiebreak in the third set, but then I made the first point, and then I was thinking it's only two points.   You can make it.  
And I was hoping I can do some ace or some point from the serve, but I didn't, actually.   So everything went through the second serve, and so it was quite hard.   But when I made the deuce, I was there I was thinking I can make this game.   
So, yeah, I'm really happy it didn't go to a tiebreak.  
   
 Q.   The kind of match that's that close, can you say what really allowed you to be the winner?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I don't really know.   There was so many close points and close games.   I was losing.   She had some break points in the third set, as well.   There's just few points which is deciding.   I don't even know, I cannot say which point which was the deciding one, but it was ‑‑I think it was a good match.   
The first set was a little bit tricky from both of us.   We were doing quite a lot of mistakes.   She was not serving good at all.   She was doing double faults.  
Then the level went a little bit up and we were both playing well, and each set was one break, so it's tough to say.  
   
 Q.   This year you're leading the tour so far with aces served.   144 aces in 20 or more matches.   Talk about that as a big weapon.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Of course my serve is my biggest weapon, but I did some double faults here, as well, so I don't know if I'm not leading the other side of the double faults, as well.  
   
 Q.   We will check.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Okay.   Thank you (smiling).   
No, last year I was behind Serena in aces, so I'm happy to continue to be in the race first, but still there is a lot of improve in the serve, but I'm happy that it's working.  
   
 Q.   When the weather is like that all day and you can see the sandstorm and everything, does it throw you off?   Because the serve is a big thing with the wind and everything.   Were you worried stepping on the court?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, today was a little bit windy, more than normally, more than the other days.   That was my first match what I was playing under the lights, because I was playing every day during the day.   So it was a little bit different.  
But I didn't feel like any difference in my serve or in that game.   I just felt same like the other days.   So, yeah, there was a little bit sand on the court, so it was maybe a little bit faster than during the day, but also, if you're playing during the day serve is faster because it's hot.   So I felt like it was quite same.  
   
 Q.   Simona or Caroline.   You don't know yet.   Thoughts on both of them?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I didn't play Simona yet at all.   Maybe in juniors somewhere.     I know one match it was eight hours‑something, like till 14 or something, but doesn't really count anymore.   So maybe I would like to play her.   
But on the other side I played with Caroline twice.   I lost in three sets and was always good match.   I don't really mind to play both of them, because they have good game for me, not like GarbiÃ±e.   She was really attacking the ball and fast in serving and going into returns.   So I don't really care which one, whatever.   
   
 Q.   I believe this is your biggest final now in a Premier 5.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be in this position?   Did you start the year knowing that you could be able to be in this position?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, you know, it's always hard to start the year after one‑and‑a‑half months of practice.   You don't really know what's going to happen in the first three, four tournaments.   But I already started the year good in Brisbane and then in Sydney, of course.   So I was feeling already I won Fed Cup and then I was playing quite good in Antwerp, as well.   
But I was already tired in Antwerp because I came from Canada and to Antwerp.   Here I was thinking if to play or if not to play.   I came like during the night   and then the other day I was playing, so I didn't really hit here at all, any practice.  
But sometimes it's better, you know, than to be here and practicing a week.   So I was not really thinking that this could happen, and I didn't expect it at all that this can happen before the tournament, so I'm really happy to be in the final.  
   
 Q.   So you're saying you almost didn't play this tournament?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I would play, for sure, but I was thinking, because they said if you want to be draw, you still have to go there to the tournament.   My coach was already there with the family, so I was thinking ‑‑and I was so tired from the planes and from the traveling and everything.  
But I would play, but I was just thinking, okay, I will just go on the court, try, and maybe I will lose, I will not be mad at all.   But then I won and I'm still winning.   
   
 Q.   In the final, either way you're going to be playing someone who is a higher seed and more experienced.   What's your mindset when you get into a final like that?   Is it like nothing to lose or is there pressure?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I already played two matches here, yeah, two matches, I think, and the girls, Lucie and Ana, they were better than me.   So I don't care if she's two spots in front of me or ten or whatever.   I know them both.   
I played already Caroline, so I will try to not be scared and just enjoy the time in the final.   Then everything can happen in the final.   Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that.   
   
 Q.   No matter what, you're probably going to be somewhere around 11 or 12 when the new rankings come out.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I heard (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Everybody looks for top 10.   Are you feeling like great about that?   Are you feeling like, wow, that happened so quickly?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I don't really feel to get into top 10 yet, but, you know, everything can happen.   So maybe with this match, if I gonna win the final, I can maybe get there.   I have no idea how the points are there.  
But my coach already told me that it looks good now with my ranking next week, so I'm going to be somewhere around 12 or something.  
Well, it's definitely great.   I wasn't expecting that at all.   And like I don't know how much point I have here, but it's a big tournament, so if I can make this, I can maybe go even more up and then I have still the whole year in front of me, so I hope I can still improve.  
   
 Q.   Do you ever think about the prize money that you're earning?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   If I'm thinking about that?   
   
 Q.   Big prize money here.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I know.   I saw that.   I will buy something for myself, for sure (smiling).  
   
 Q.   Like?   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I'm thinking about some watch to buy, but I'm not sure yet.   And we will see what they gonna have in the store.  
   
 Q.   You can get a watch sponsorship.   You will have to find something else.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I don't have any (smiling).  
   
 Q.   Your sister was the in the semifinals in her tournament.   Have you been in touch?   She's had a very good week as well.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, yes, of course we are talking before the matches and after the matches, as well.   I'm happy.   I got the message before I went on the court that she won, so like an hour before my match.   So I was really happy that she won and she can play her game finally, as well.   
I hope she can even do better this week.   We are supporting each other.   She was ‑‑I think she was following me, I don't know in the TV or only the result, but she texted me after the match.   We are having great relationship.   I'm really happy to have her.  
   
 Q.   What kind of experience do you have playing her in matches?   I know it was always uncomfortable for Venus and Serena when they had to play.   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, yes, we both hated to play each other.   It didn't happen for quite a long time, I think two or three years already, because we are now in different tournaments a little bit.  
But before, we played I don't want to say unimportant matches but not important like maybe to final or some Grand Slams or something, and we are trying to play it every time, but it's always hard.   
I cannot play my best against my sister, and I think she has the same.   So it's just not a good match to watch and not a good match for us, as well.
