K. PLISKOVA/K. Siniakova
6-4, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Given some of the conditions out there today, how hot it is?  How relieved are you to get the win in two sets today?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I came few days earlier before the tournament.  I felt pretty good, I have to say, already from yesterday or the day before.  I got little bit used to it.  It's completely different, but in Europe was about 35 degrees now every day.
It's not that much difference.  Just the humidity is different.  I'm happy I finished in two sets, that I didn't have to stay longer on court.  I think I would be fine to play even a little bit longer, but two sets were better.
Q. What made the difference in the second set?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think I started little bit more aggressive in the beginning of the second set, that's why I got the lead 4-1.  Could be 5-1, 6-1.  Little bit shaky in the end.  My serve I was not able to hold.  Did not serve well throughout all the match.  Lot of double-faults, not really much first serves.
I think she's very dangerous.  She hit few shots.  I missed few shots.  That's all about it.  Overall pretty solid for me.  I felt good.  Nothing special, but I think solid start.
Q. You mentioned the heat and the humidity on the court.  Do you actually feel the effects of the heat in your play?  Do you feel maybe less energetic, less powerful in your strokes?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I think that's why you practice, to feel good on court during the match.  That's why I came few days early, to get used to it.  Like I said, in Europe it's not much different.  It's everywhere like this now for few months already.  I just got used to it.
Obviously sometimes, especially when you are losing, you are little bit negative, then you feel maybe little bit weak or tired.  Just trying to stay positive even if the second set was not really going my way, after that, when I got the 4-1.
I just don't have much problems with this weather.  I like to play in this weather.  The conditions are better for me.  It's faster.  The balls are flying, so everything is fine.
Q. The last one about the heat and humidity.  Do you prepare yourself before the game with something special to play in those kinds of conditions?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, not really.  But I just try to be on the court as much as I can just to get used to it, to do some drills, maybe to go for a run little bit.  It also depends.  The schedule can be so much different.  You can play in the morning, which is still quite okay.  You can play in the evening.  Still the humidity is here.  But completely different conditions this morning and evening, so you cannot really plan this.
I just try to drink and just to rest and be ready.
Q. Up next is Kiki Bertens or Carol Zhao, a Canadian.  How do you prepare for the next match?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't know anything about the Canadian.  I will try to watch a little bit, if it's possible, of this match.
Of course Bertens I know.  It was my last match on Wimbledon.  We played Stuttgart, as well.  There's not going to be a surprise if I play her.
So far we didn't play on hard court, I think.  It's going to be completely different.  I'm just happy to be back on hard court.  Still my favorite surface of all those years.
So, yeah, I think it's going to be different than on grass or even on clay, but for sure tough.
Q. Speaking of surprises, how long had you been planning the wedding?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: For you guys it was a surprise (smiling).
I think for let's say two, three months, like pretty early.  We had it in Monaco, so you had to plan few things, the dress and everything.  For me, I just didn't want to talk about it.  I had tournaments, different schedules.  That's why for you guys it was a surprise.
Q. How much was that in the back of your mind in those tournaments leading up?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, it was something I was looking forward to happen.  But for sure not having any influence on my Wimbledon tournament or on the tournament before.
It was very small wedding.  There was not many people, not many things what we had to plan or what we have to do.  It was more like I would call it a family lunch.  I had just my really close friends.  We just enjoyed.  It was not stressful at all.
Q. The engagement was also a surprise.  How important is privacy to you and when do you feel comfortable sharing that sort of thing?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, actually I wanted to share it by myself, but there were some Czech newspapers, they find out.  It was not like really from my side that I would put it first on Instagram or somewhere.
I think my personal life is important for me, also for my career.  Now my husband, I don't call him husband, I call him Michal, he's been working for me in some ways in lot of things, so everything I think is working pretty well with us.
It's been almost three years, so it's nothing new.  Yeah, just the wedding, it was the next step for us.
