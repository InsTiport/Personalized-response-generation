 K. PLISKOVA/S. Voegele
  7‑6, 6‑4 
   
 Q.   You had to work hard for that match today, didn't you?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, yes.   It wasn't that easy.   Also, she qualified, so she had three matches here and it was my first match here.   And I felt a little bit tired, which is, I would say, normal.   But I'm happy that I went through it and I won the close first set, which helped me.   And the second set, it wasn't easy, but it was a little bit better than the first one.   So I'm happy that I didn't play three sets and that I won.  
   
 Q.   How different were the conditions compared with Dubai?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I would say it's a lot different because there was, of course, more hot than here, so the balls were flying more.   And it was everything a little bit faster.   You were sweating here not at all, and it's a little bit more windy of course, so it's different.   
But I'm happy to have won one match here and happy for the in the second round and hopefully it's going to be better.  
   
 Q.   How much time did you have to practice before?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   Well, I had Sunday off.   We came from Dubai.   And Monday I went to hit just once, because I didn't feel really well, a little bit tired from the whole week in Dubai.   So I just hit like 40 minutes with my coach and today just warm up, so not really much.  
   
 Q.   You've played a lot of matches this year.   Are you feeling tired at all?   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I am.   I am.   But still I'm in the tournament, so I just don't want to think about it, about that match, and try just to do my best here and then I will take some off after the tournament.  
   
 Q.   Can you just say how happy you are with the way your year has gone so far?   
KAROLINA PLISKOVA:   I'm really happy because I wasn't expecting anything from the beginning of the year.   After the preparation it's always hard.   You just don't know what to expect because one or two months you're out of the tournament, so it's a little bit different.   
But I'm happy with the way how I started the year and it's going pretty well, so I'm really happy.
