K. PLISKOVA/S. Peng
7-6, 6-4
Q. Just tell us how you feel in general today.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, my second win on grass, so I think it was a little bit better than the first round.
Yeah, a little bit tough match.  We were both struggling a little bit in the first set, but then I think I improved in the second one.  Just happy that I got to play today after two days of waiting and happy that I got the win.
Q. The first set seemed quite difficult.  How did you manage to get through the tiebreaker?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, started really slow because I didn't have warmup.  So was kind of tough to start.
I was down 4-1, but then it improved a little bit.  I started to serve better and tried to use a little bit the wind and my weapons, which I have.  Then it was better.
Q. How will you prepare for the next match?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I rest a little bit.  I don't know how much time I have till the next one, but I try to eat, rest, and then I will be fine.  I just played two sets now, so it's going to be fine.
