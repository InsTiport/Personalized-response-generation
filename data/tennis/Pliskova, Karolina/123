A. BARTY/K. Pliskova   
4-6, 7-6, 7-6   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Obviously a tough match.  What do you think changed for you?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think she was playing just little bit better today.  Even though was, like, really close, one or two points, but I think she was just more aggressive.  In the end of the sets, she was just going for her shots, which I was not able to make because in tiebreaks I didn't hit any first serves.  That's the biggest problem.   
Obviously, like all the games, I think it was pretty close.  Even in the second set, there was not many chances, break chances.  I got one.  I played some kind of rally which I think I could play better.  In the second set, it could be different if I do this break.  Then obviously those 30-Love which I think, you know, it could be 4-6 in the third.   
I was so close to lose it.  From nothing, I was just so close to win it.  But from that time, I think she played just much better.  She didn't miss.  She gave me some free points at that time.  But since then I don't think she did anything wrong.   
 Q.  Seemed like you were frustrated at the start of the third set, took you time to reengage.  Do you think that's accurate?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I felt like I was close.  I felt like I can play the tiebreak better.  Both tiebreaks I think she played just very well.   
But like I said, in both of them, I didn't have any first serves, any points which I would need, any free points from the serve.  I think she served just better.  So everything went quite fast both of the tiebreaks.   
But I had I think the biggest chance, of course it was those 30-Love at 6-5, but I think it was the breakpoint in the second set.  Would be up a set, a break.  I think the match would be over.   
I felt like my serve was not really the percentage high.  A lot of serves I went through second serves.  She had more time to, you know, making me run, which she was trying to do, not play many shots in one space.   
But, yeah, credit to her.  I think she played one of the best matches.   
 Q.  What do you think about her game?  What parts of it are tough to play against?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I think it was close.  What I think about the game?  I think she played very well.  We played few times already.  I know little bit what she's going to play.   
But, well, it's understandable.  I think she played some good matches here, so she was feeling free.  She was just going for her shots.  I'm right now in different position than she is.   
I think she has a very good forehand.  She can use it cross-court forehand.  Good serving.  I didn't have many chances on the serve.  Even in the second serve is pretty good.  I think she didn't do any double-faults.  If she did, then one.  So I think just on the serve she's solid.   
 Q.  Is her topspin different to other players on the tour?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: I don't think it's different.  I think just the game is little bit different.  She's using a lot of slices, trying to come in close to the net.  But I don't think that was the key of this match.  Like, I could -- I should play better.  Not I could, I should play better and I would have won this match.   
 Q.  On your father, how involved has he been in your career in the past?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: What?   
 Q.  How involved has your father been in your career in the past?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, we go few tournaments every year.  I was talking about this earlier.  He know me.  He is sometimes going to my practices when I'm at home.  We spend quite a lot of time together, so...   
 Q.  What do you take out of this tournament?  Obviously the frustration today of not playing as well as you maybe did yesterday, which seemed like you were quite happy with.  Where do you think your game is at this point in the season?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I think so far I was feeling good.  Obviously tough to say after this match.  There were some good moments which I think I didn't have during the year.  Again, trying to take positive out of it.   
I think even the Tokyo tournament I played okay.  I felt okay on the court, which is sometimes more important than the result sometimes.  But it can maybe in the future help me to win some matches like this and maybe tournaments.   
But, yeah, I had three good matches.  Could have been maybe four good matches, but right now have three.  So time to move on to Beijing.  Last tournament before Singapore.  So let's see.   
 Q.  That's your plan, is to play through Beijing and then wait until Singapore?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, that's my plan.  So after Beijing, I don't want to see racquet for four days.
