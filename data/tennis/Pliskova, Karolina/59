K. PLISKOVA/M. Brengle   
6-2, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.   
 Q.  Karolina, how does it feel to start Roland Garros this year with an impressive win?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: It feels good obviously.  First round is always tough, tricky.  You don't know how you're going to feel, how you're going to play.   
But I had good couple days of practice, so I felt fine.  Not perfect, but fine.  And it was solid today.   
 Q.  And for the media, you are amongst the favorites for this year.  Does that put any pressure on you or do you just concentrate on your own game?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Maybe a little bit, but I feel good, so there is no reason why I should feel some extra pressure or why, you know, I should be nervous from this.  It's only positive.   
Because I'm having good season, so of course there's going to be pressure that I have to go far in the tournaments, but that's normal.  That's almost every season is quite similar.   
Of course, this one is so far the best, but always there is some kind of pressure, so I'm fine with that.   
 Q.  And what will you need to do over the next few weeks for you to play your best tennis?  
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, I started good today.  Of course, when you continue in the draw, there is tougher opponents later.   
So it's going to be difficult.  I have Slovak girl next one, so it's going to be tough.  But, you know, I feel like every time when I play tournaments, match from match, I improve.  So hopefully that's going to happen here too.
