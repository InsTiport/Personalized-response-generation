6-2, 7-6
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. That looked like it was tougher out there than it had been in the whole week at Eastbourne.
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, but I think it's tough to compare with the week in Eastbourne.  I think was quite normal.  Of course, it went little bit longer and I almost drop a set.  It's still almost.  I played two sets, that's fine.
Of course, first rounds can be tough, so...
Q. How was kind of the turnaround?  Is it too quick from Saturday to today to play?  Is it an easy transition?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: No, I would not say quick.  I think my timing was a little bit off today.  I just didn't have any chance to hit on the match courts, which I felt they were totally different than Aorangi courts.  Always kind of, you know, struggling here with this because you just practice there and then the courts are just different.
Of course, it was different compared to Eastbourne.  But I feel fine, physically perfect.  Maybe even better that I didn't really stop and I could just continue what I was doing in Eastbourne.
Of course, there wasn't much time.
Q. When you say that the match courts play different than Aorangi, can you explain what you mean?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Well, my feeling was that it was a lot slower than Aorangi, than Eastbourne, than Birmingham (smiling).
Yeah, I think the grass, it's kind of quite high, I would say, and long.  So I don't know, the ball just stays, doesn't really go.  It doesn't really slide.  Even for the serve, I thought if I still hit good serve, you can still have a point.  I just thought it was maybe more rallies than I thought there was going to be.
Yeah, sometimes I thought I hit a great shot, but she still was there, she was still able to make it.  I don't know if she's that good or the court is that slow.  But my feeling was my timing was a little bit off.  I thought I still have everything little bit too much in front.  It was kind of slower.
Q. We always talk about your chances at Wimbledon, things like that.  Do you think that is something, that difference in how the courts play, because everybody assumes grass courts play the same, no matter the tournament?  So do you think that's something people don't realize as much, the courts play differently at this club compared to the other ones?
KAROLINA PLISKOVA: Yeah, I think so.  And I think, you know, with grass, it's like it's totally different than hard court and clay.  I feel like every court is different.  You can play still match court, but I think the grass still can be different because it has to be so tough to make similar courts.
Yeah, I think you can play still well in Eastbourne, and this grass can be just little bit different, it can be longer, slower, faster, whatever.  Doesn't mean that I played well in Eastbourne that I have to play well here.  But I should because I should be that good just to play good on any surface.
Little bit I feel like here still it's not the best for me.  But let's see, I'm going to try to change.
