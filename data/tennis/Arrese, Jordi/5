CAPTAIN JORDI ARRESE: We'll wait and see for him to play. If he plays, I'm sure that Tommy will play with character, and he'll play his absolute best. 

CAPTAIN JORDI ARRESE: Right now we don't have any more information. We know that his hand hurts and he wasn't able to play today. He's going to be going to the hospital later this afternoon. And once they get information, they'll know more. 

JUAN BALCELLS: I honestly don't think it was my best playing, but I did put forth my best effort. 

JUAN BALCELLS: No, we're accustomed to playing the same way. So, no, it didn't change our type of playing. And we've played together before. 

CAPTAIN JORDI ARRESE: I haven't considered a change, not until we go out. We're very happy with Tommy's play. 

CAPTAIN JORDI ARRESE: Tomorrow, you'll know. You'll see tomorrow.
