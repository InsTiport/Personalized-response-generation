 Q. How are you able to combat the big serve and stay in a match like that?
 
 LINDSAY LEE: I had to watch her serve straight from the racket. I knew going into the
match that I would have to return well to even have a chance of staying into the match.
And I think in the first set, she missed a lot of first serves and I had the opportunity
to staying in the match and I think towards the end of the third set, few games, she just
hit four big serves straight in a row and I mean, there is nothing you can do. Great
serve, and she -- I think that is what won the match. 
 
Q. Is it frustrating, I mean, you could almost say you outplayed her in the other
aspects of the game to hang around that long and --
 
 LINDSAY LEE: It is not really frustrating because you know going into the match that
she is going to serve well; that she has a huge serve and you have to deal with it. If she
served 100 aces; then she can have the aces. It is just part of the game. That is her
game. 
 
Q. Lindsay rank this match with some of your other matches; how were you playing today
compared to other goods days?
 
 LINDSAY LEE: I think today I was playing really well. Played pretty solid. Returned
very well, I thought. And I think it is at pretty much at the top of the line, but I had
to play well to stay on the court. She is a top 20 player, top 15 player; you have to
raise your level to play her. 
 
Q. What would you do to raise it one more notch should you play again?
 
 LINDSAY LEE: Well, I think it was close until the end and I had a few opportunities to
win the match and I think her serve -- she rose her level on the serve and I think that
was the main aspect.
