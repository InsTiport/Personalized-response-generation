  6‑2, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Tougher day today compared to your match against Serena.   Could you talk us through it. 
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, she's a great player.   She played really good today, so aggressive.   Maybe I couldn't show my best tennis because she all the time pushing me. 
I missed a lot of easy balls because I need to make maybe more harder.   But I think she played really good today. 

Q.   Did you go into the match with a game plan?   You'd played once before. 
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, of course.   For sure I should move her and let her run.   Sometimes I didn't make that good today because she played so aggressive and pushed me all the time.   It was difficult. 

Q.   Was it hard emotionally after such a big win in the fourth round over somebody who has won so many Grand Slams?   Was it hard to come back mentally?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, that's hard because I didn't used to it.   It was hard, yeah, because everyone is like, Well done, well done.   You should forget about that day and that game.   It was different day. 
But Maria was too good today. 

Q.   Whereabouts was your game compared with where it was against Serena?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   They're two different players.   I don't know.   I think I played my tennis against Serena.   Maybe Serena wasn't that good on that day. 
But today, yeah, sometimes of course I missed some balls.   But Maria was great today. 

Q.   Being a fellow Russian player, do you know Maria very well off the court?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I don't know her at all. 

Q.   Have you ever practiced together, hit together?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   No, no, never. 

Q.   From what you saw today, do you think she can win here?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I think all four, they can win because they play great tennis.   I think always the semis and the final is real big different between all rest of the tournament.   Just good luck for all of them.

Q.   After you beat Serena the other day, did you go out and have a nice dinner, mark the occasion, or treat it like any match?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, the same day we had some dinner, but nothing like a big dinner celebration because the tournament didn't finish.   Of course, we all real happy.   But it wasn't that big celebration. 
On the next day I had doubles, so we couldn't. 

Q.   Any goals for the rest of the year?   Are you looking at top 20 now?
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Who? 

Q.   You. 
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I wish to be in top 20.   I will try to work hard.   I really want to be there.
