    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What are your feelings or impressions from today's game?   You took more games off her than almost everyone else combined.   
    EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, she's in a great shape.   She's playing unbelievable, so aggressive, and just in the right spot of the court.   It's really tough to play against her now.   
    I wanted to be a little bit faster.   I didn't really think that I moved that well today.   But she's, like, so great now, it was really tough.   And, yeah, in the end I just was fighting for the games, because in the end already I was thinking that, yeah, it's tough to beat her.   
    I just tried to get more games.   
   
 Q.   What is it she's doing so well that's making her so dominant?  
    EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I think she's feeling so good now because you should play so long try to get her back.   If you didn't play that long, so she just came into the court and played so aggressive one, two shots and finished.   
    Yeah, it's really tough.   She's great now.   
   
 Q.   What was your approach to try to stop that?  
    EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Well, I tried to play as long as I can, not too aggressive.   But my game, I think, today it was really tough to do that because she was a little bit faster than me.
