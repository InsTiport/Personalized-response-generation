THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   Today was not such an easy match.   How did you manage to pull it through?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Such easy, you said?   
   
 Q.   Not an easy match.   It was a difficult match.   
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah, uhm, well, she's now really in a good shape.   She's hitting so hard.   She's so aggressive, serving really good.   
It was really tough to stay calm, solid, don't be scary, you know, just to try to play your game, more active like she is.   
So I think the first and third set, it was more my game, like I dictated my game.   I'm really happy that I came through.   
   
 Q.   Did you notice she was getting tired and played accordingly?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   No, I didn't think about it, that she is tired.   You mean that she was playing two matches before?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I didn't think about it because she is playing really quick points, like two great shots.   So we didn't really run so much.   
I think it was just more about the concentration and who is more aggressive.   
   
 Q.   What are you most happy about this whole week?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I didn't think about it.   
I don't know.   I'm really enjoying to be in MontrÃ©al, to spend my time with my mom.   I came quite late from Washington so I didn't have a lot of times just to walk around or do something else.   I'm just playing every day.   I'm playing doubles and singles, so it's quite busy schedule this week.   But I'm happy.   
I'm really enjoying to play here.   I don't know, go out there and fight.   
   
 Q.   What is it about your game that you're happy about?   What is working well for you this week that you find is making the difference?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   I'm happy quite, I don't know, about maybe my physical form.   You know, I'm pretty happy from Wimbledon.   So I'm trying to keep it with me.   I feeling pretty good.   I try to hold it until US Open.   
   
 Q.   You played well today, have a great all‑around game.   What is your favorite surface?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   What is my favorite?   
   
 Q.   Your favorite surface.   
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Well, I think I like more grass and hard court.   I want to play on grass more than three tournaments, yeah.   But I like when it's fast, so...   Definitely grass and hard court.   
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you might play Azarenka.   Can you tell us a bit about her, what the key would be to beating her?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Well, she's a great player.   She was No.1.   I played against her couple times.   I don't know.   It will be interesting match.   Doesn't matter who going to win today, Radwanska or Azarenka.   We'll see who going to win and then we'll talk.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us a bit about Radwanska, what kind of player she is.   
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   She's playing really smart, yeah, without power.   She's playing from power of her opponent.   
Actually, maybe Vika is something similar.   Against them definitely the key will be to be as aggressive as you could.   
   
 Q.   How much of a comfort is it for you to have your mother around?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   It's really comfort.   I don't know.   I don't spend so much time with my mom.   Yeah, I'm traveling more with the coach.   
These two weeks, it's happen because my coach had holidays with her family.   I'm really enjoying, you know.   At the juniors I traveled more with my mom.   It's kind of difficult when you spend more time with parents.   But now when I don't spend as much time with my parents, I'm really enjoying that moment.   It's everything comfortable.
