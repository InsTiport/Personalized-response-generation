THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You just love Eastbourne, don't you?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yes, that's true.   (Smiling.)   I really love this city and tournament.   I'm really enjoy to be here and enjoy my game.  
It's such nice grass, and I really feel good here.  
   
 Q.   What was the secret of your success today?  
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   It wasn't any secret.   I was really ‑‑I had nothing to lose, so I just tried to play my best game.   She's really tough opponent.   She's playing unbelievable on grass, so I was just really enjoying it.   Just wanted to show my best tennis.   
It helped today.  
   
 Q.   What did you think when you got that draw?   It was incredible, really, Wimbledon champion on grass.   
EKATERINA MAKAROVA:   Yeah.   I was in Birmingham, and I saw the draw.   I wasn't really happy, because she was here final last year and win the Wimbledon.  
So, yeah, I understood that it would be really tough match.   But nothing I can do.   I cannot change the draw.   So I just came out and played.   Didn't think anything much about her win last year.
