Is this the best you've played at Grand Slam tournament?EKATERINA MAKAROVA: Well, not really.  I have been at the US Open semis, so -- but I'm so happy, yeah, that I'm showing my good tennis here and already in the quarter; third time here in Australian Open. So I'm so happy that I beat today Julia.  She's tough opponent.  She's in great shape.  She played great her matches.  So I'm happy that I came through.Q. You may well play Simona Halep next.  How would you approach that?EKATERINA MAKAROVA: Well, we played once in New Haven I think not the last year, the year before.  I lost 6-1, 7-6, something like that.  She's one of the greatest player now, and I'm really looking forward.  If she wins today, depends, yeah.  I will want to forward and forward step by step.Q. As you said, you have reached quarterfinals and a semifinal, but do you feel you're now ready to take that next step and push towards a Grand Slam final or maybe a title?EKATERINA MAKAROVA: Well, I think I was feeling that I'm more confident already during the US Open, so this year before US Open and the US Open, I felt differently then.  It was before.  Now it's quite the same feeling.
