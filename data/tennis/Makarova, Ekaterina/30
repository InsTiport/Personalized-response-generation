 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. It seems like you couldn't show your best game today. Is it true or not?
 EKATERINA MAKAROVA: I don't think so, that I didn't show my best tennis. I really played good and I really happy with my game and my coach happy. 
 She's really great player. So in important moment, like in tiebreak, she played unbelievable and fighting for every point. I just have to hit every ball because if like waiting the mistake, is no chance to win, beat her. 
 So for me I played good tennis today. 

 Q. Don't you have any regret? 
 EKATERINA MAKAROVA: I don't understand. 

 Q. Do you have any regret? Are you sorry? 
 EKATERINA MAKAROVA: No. Actually I'm good for this tournament. I'm really happy. Was great matches, unbelievable matches and memories. So I'm happy for these weeks and tournament. 

 Q. You said she played unbelievably well in the tiebreaker. Is it difficult to make a point after she brings back a ball with her split?
 EKATERINA MAKAROVA: It's not really difficult, but she's playing and she's like moving me and put all the balls in to the right place. So, of course, it's really difficult to play against her. I should play really unbelievable tennis without any mistakes. 
 But like she has a lot of experience on the big courts and everything. So in these moments, she was better.
