Q.  How much does getting a call or not getting call affect you during a match? 
 
SANDRINE TESTUD:  That is a good question.  Yeah, I think I had a few bad calls during this match.  Actually I am a little bit upset about when I was up 4-3 in the second set and 15-30, you know, she was running for the shot and she was -- I mean, she played the shot and missed it and the umpire just gave two balls because the ball was coming in the back, but she was not, you know, she was already playing the shot.  So I don't know what she can, you know, it was going to be 15-40 so it can change the match.  It makes a big difference. 
 

Q.  Did it affect you mentally when it happened?
 
SANDRINE TESTUD:  I was a little bit upset of course, but that is the way it is.  It is happening many times, so, I have to deal with it. 
 

Q.  What is bothering your knee?
 
SANDRINE TESTUD:  I pulled a muscle, hamstring, last week in Philadelphia. 
 

Q.  Did it bother you?
 
SANDRINE TESTUD:  Yeah, because I couldn't practice for the whole week.
