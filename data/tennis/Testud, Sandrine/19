Q.  What was the difference between the first and second sets?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  Well, I start pretty good the first set, was up 5-3.  I was playing good, but she always put a lot of pressure on the opponent.  At 5-3, I just couldn't, you know, keep my mind concentrate on each point.  She came back.  After the first set, it was over.  I was tired mentally.  I couldn't keep concentrate.  Once she's ahead, it's very difficult.  She played better.  I was a little bit down.  That went very quickly.


Q.  What is your injury?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  Oh, I have no injury.  I'm fine. I have a leg problem since February.  I pulled a muscle in February and I still very tight if I don't put this tape on.  You know, it's just -- I don't want to be injured again, nothing bad.


Q.  That did not affect your game today? 

SANDRINE TESTUD:  No, no, it didn't affect my game.  Like I said, I was just a little bit tired mentally today.  I just couldn't finish the first set.  Maybe if I was a little bit feeling better, less tired, maybe I would have won the first set.  But then, you know, you never know.  She played much better in the second set.  She put a lot of pressure on me.  That's what made the difference.


Q.  Do you think in general that the younger women on the Tour are getting closer to people like Seles and Graf and Sanchez?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  Yeah.  I think you can see it in this tournament.  A lot of seeded players lost early in the tournament.  I think it's good for women's tennis that you can see other players coming up and playing also good tennis.  I think it's good for women's tennis.


Q.  Did you play Seles before she was stabbed in Hamburg?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  No.  It was my first time.
