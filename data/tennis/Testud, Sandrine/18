VERONIQUE MARCHAL:  Questions in English first.

SANDRINE TESTUD:  I have to speak English.
  

Q.  Can you talk about your singles match first?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  Yes, sure.  Well, I think I played a really solid match today.  I mean, 6-Love, 5-2, I didn't make any mistakes almost.  I don't know, she didn't play great, but I didn't give her the chance, you know.  I was just concentrate on my game, try to don't make any stupid mistakes, and that's it.  It came out good until 5-2, and I was a little bit nervous of course to finish.  She's the kind of player, she's tough to beat because she doesn't give you many points after.  So 5-2 she came back.  At 5-All, I just tried to stay concentrate on my game.  I served good, so hopefully I made the game 6-5. Then it finish.  The game after was good for me because I was starting to be a little bit tired.  That was a good end.  It was better to finish for me in two sets than going for a third set. 
  

Q.  Arantxa mentioned she was tired in the match.  Did you see that in her game?

SANDRINE TESTUD:  Well, not really because last week I played her in Indian Wells.  I was the same.  I won the first set.  We play more or less the same match.  I just made more mistakes.  You know, she's the kind of player where she didn't look really tired.  She was running everywhere.  Maybe she was tired mentally, I don't know. Well, for me it didn't look like she was really tired, and she didn't give up.  I mean, she was still fighting.  She came back.
