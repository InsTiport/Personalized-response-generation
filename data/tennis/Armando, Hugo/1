Q.  Was it exciting to go out there against a Wimbledon champion?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Definitely.  It was something I was really looking forward to.  Last few days, I just couldn't wait to get on the court.  You know, it was fun.  I definitely enjoyed it.  I wish I could have done a few things a little bit better, but I have no regrets.

Q.  Were you hyper when you went out there?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, I was  -- I'd say I was feeling pretty good when I went out there.  Maybe a little bit nervous.  But overall, I was feeling pretty good.

Q.  Any way to read it when he tosses? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Not really.  I mean, there's a couple times where I kind of picked up on a couple things and kind of moved to one side early, and I had a couple good returns when I did that.  But it's not easy.  It's really hard to read his serve.

Q.  When did you become an American citizen?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I was born in the US.  I've always been an American.

Q.  Born in Miami?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Born in Miami.

Q.  Grew up in Key Biscayne?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yep.

Q.  Now you're with Bollettieri's?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yes.

Q.  Now you live in Bradenton?

HUGO ARMANDO: Yes.

Q.  Were you at Wimbledon?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I played the qualifier there.  I lost second round.

Q.  Did you see Goran win?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I saw him win on TV.  I was in The Netherlands actually.  I was very happy, very excited for him.  I'm actually a big fan of Goran's.  It was good to see him win Wimbledon.

Q.  Have you always been a big fan of Goran's?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah.

Q.  How about today?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Not today.

Q.  Who gave you the nickname?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I don't know.  It was a long time ago.  It was down at a training center they had at Key Biscayne.  I think I was 14 or 16.  One of the press guys there said, "Hey, Hurricane."  I guess everybody started calling me that after that.

Q.  Hurricane Hugo. 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah.

Q.  There was one, right?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, one that hit South Carolina.  I'm not sure if it was in '89 or '90, somewhere around there.

Q.  Why do so many other players root for Goran?

HUGO ARMANDO:  He's a nice guy.  You know, he comes out, he says "hi" to everybody all the time, and he's just like one more player.  You know, even though he's a big star and he's a great player, he's just like one of the guys.

Q.  When you see the way he sort of connects with the crowd and connects with people, you could probably identify with that a little?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, he's got charisma.  He's an outgoing guy.  That's why the crowd loves him.  That's why everybody was so happy for him when he won Wimbledon I think.

Q.  How about on that last point, matchpoint.  They're all motioning.  What are you thinking when he takes his little bow?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Just got to smile.  You know, what can you say about it?  He's had a great year.  He's waited, I guess, all his life to win Wimbledon.  He finally has.  I'm sure he's enjoying it.  More power to him.

Q.  You hit the challenger trail now?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I'm playing one challenger before I go to play a tour event in Bucharest on clay.  Then there's a 125 challenger in Poland.  Then after that I'll go to Palermo and play another tour event.

Q.  What was the event The Netherlands?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Challenger.

Q.  In Amsterdam?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Scheveningen, a week before Amsterdam.

Q.  On the ocean?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, by the sea side.

Q.  Were you with other tennis players watching him win?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, I was actually in my hotel room.  I remember we had a rain delay.  I was in my hotel room with my dad watching the match.  My dad and I were both pulling for him.

Q.  Had you ever seen a tennis match with that much noise?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, I thought it was great.  I thought it was great to see that, to just see the crowd going wild like that and get into it.  I thought it was great.

Q.  Did you scream at all?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, no.  Just clapped a couple times after he won it and got happy for him.  And that was it.

Q.  Did you ever ball boy at the Lipton?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, never did. 

Q.  No desire to?

HUGO ARMANDO:  What's that?

Q.  Never had a desire to do that? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Not really, no. 

Q.  You out there a lot when you were a kid? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I spent a lot of time at Crandon Park, I guess you could say that.  We had tennis courts where we lived.  We lived in Key Colony, we always played there.  My sister started playing, and that's how kind of I got into it. 

Q.  Are you used to seeing the two sides of Goran?  Is that what you expected?  Being a fan of his, you must know about them.

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I mean, I guess it's kind of like everybody.  I think we all have two sides.  It's a matter of moods.  Also, sometimes you come out, you're feeling good, everything's going well for you.  Sometimes you get up cranky and then every little thing bothers you.  I wasn't surprised to see both sides.  It's just human.

Q.  He said his serve wasn't working so well today.  How did it look from your side?

HUGO ARMANDO:  He said that?

Q.  Yeah. 

HUGO ARMANDO:  I wish I had a bad day serving like that.  But it looked pretty good from my side.  I mean, I couldn't read it at all.  Just seemed to me like he was hitting the spots dead on. 

Q.  What's it like when you feel there's so much pressure coming from his serve?  What does that do to you on your serve?

HUGO ARMANDO:  It puts more pressure on you to serve better.  I think you try to go for a little bit more.  He forces you to make mistakes.  You know if you hold your serve, next game he could just hit four aces or four good serves and then that's it.  You got to serve again.  He forces you to put a little bit more pressure on yourself when you're serving, so that's kind of difficult. 

Q.  That's probably the best first-round match he's ever played here.  He hasn't had a very good history here.  Did you feel you could beat him?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I feel I had a very good chance going into the match.  I've been playing really well lately.  I was serving very well lately.  Today, it kind of let me down.  I don't think I served as well as I had been.  But then again, like I said earlier, it's probably because Goran was serving so well, he put a lot more pressure on me to serve even better. But I did think I had a chance, yes, I did.

Q.  How tall are you?

HUGO ARMANDO:  5'11'' three-quarters, but I like to say I'm six feet.

Q.  Like Justine Henin trying to get that extra quarter?

HUGO ARMANDO:  That little bit.

Q.  That's with the hair?

HUGO ARMANDO:  With the hair.

Q.  Do you live in Bradenton?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I do.  I lived in Bradenton probably for about 13 years now. 

Q.  Why did you move up there?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Let's see, when I was four, my parents decided to go to Argentina.  I lived there for about four years.  And then when I was eight, we came back to Florida and I lived around Miami, Fort Lauderdale area until I was about ten or eleven.  And we moved to Bradenton, and I've been there ever since.

Q.  Did you ever live on Key Biscayne?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah. 

Q.  For how many years?

HUGO ARMANDO:  For four or five years. 

Q.  Okay.  Then you were eleven, you said?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I was eleven, yeah.

Q.  You moved up to Bradenton?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah.

Q.  Near the beach?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Actually, you know where the Bolletierri Academy is? 

Q.  Sure. 

HUGO ARMANDO:  About two blocks from that.

Q.  Have you ever worked at Nick's?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I practice there.  I work out of there.  I go and use the facilities there.  Nick helps me out every once in a while when he can.

Q.  You're an IMG guy?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No.  Actually, I'm not.  Nick, that's one of the first reasons why I moved to Bradenton  - Nick offered me a scholarship when I was around ten or eleven.  We moved up there, my whole family moved up there.  We've been there ever since.  So even though I'm not an IMG guy, I'm part of the family.

Q.  You took the scholarship?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I took the scholarship when I was eleven or twelve and have been there ever since.

Q.  What do you do in your leisure time?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I like to golf.  Golf, fish  whenever I have a chance, whenever I'm home.  I'm a big soccer fan.  Watch some soccer.

Q.  Did Goran say anything to you after the match ?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, he said, "Tough match," you know.  "Good playing."  That was it. 

Q.  Did you finish high school?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yes, I did.  Bay Shore High School.  It's right across the street from Nick's. 

Q.  That's the good school? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Huh? 

Q.  That's the good school?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, it's a public school, yeah.  Most of the kids that go to Nick's either go to Bradenton Academy, St. Stephen's.

Q.  Is Spanish your first language?

HUGO ARMANDO:  No, English is.

Q.  But you do speak it?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, I do speak Spanish. 

Q.  When you got a wildcard, did you expect it? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Not really, to be honest.  I haven't had much luck with wildcards in the past.  I haven't received much help from the USTA.  Don't know why, but, you know, I've always felt like I played well enough to maybe deserve one or earn one in a few tournaments that I have asked for wildcards.  But, unfortunately, I never got one.  This was my first big wildcard you could say.

Q.  What went into your head as soon as you saw the draw and saw your name?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I was actually at home.  I looked it up on the Internet and I saw I played Goran.  It's exciting, you know, to get to play a Wimbledon champion, a great player like Goran.  It's exciting.  You can't ask for anything more.  I mean, I knew it was gonna be tough and it was gonna be a battle.  But, you know, it's great to be able to say that, "Hey, you know what, I played against a Wimbledon champion."

Q.  Is that the biggest crowd you ever played in front of?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, probably.  I played in front of a pretty big crowd in Kitzbuhel when I played Kafelnikov.  That was third round, a pretty big crowd.  I think this might have been a bigger crowd.

Q.  Were your parents here?

HUGO ARMANDO:  My father's here.  I have a few friends that live here in New York that came up with me, and my fiancee is here.

Q.  What does your father do?

HUGO ARMANDO:  He coaches me.  He's my coach.

Q.  His name is?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Hugo Armando also. 

Q.  Hurricane Senior?

HUGO ARMANDO:  Hurricane Senior, there you go.

Q.  What was it like to have so much of the crowd obviously behind Goran?  I mean, you know, everyone was yelling, "Go Goran." And, I don't know, just what was that like for you? 

HUGO ARMANDO:  I kind of expected it.  I mean, like we talked earlier, I know Goran is a big fan of the people and people like to watch him.  It's really exciting.  So I kind of expected that.  My dad told me, "You know you're going to go out there and even though you're American, most of the people are going to be with Goran just because of what he's done and everything."  I kind of expected it, and I was kind of prepared for it so it really didn't bother me that much.

Q.  You had some fans.

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, yeah.  I heard a few "Go Hugos" out there.

Q.  Three girls. 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Yeah, it was good to hear.  Definitely good to hear. 

Q.  Can you imagine what it was like to be that linesman that got hit by that 128-mile-per-hour serve?

HUGO ARMANDO:  I've gotten hit a few times playing doubles.  I think I know what that guy felt like.

Q.  Describe that. 

HUGO ARMANDO:  Sting.  Very sharp sting.
