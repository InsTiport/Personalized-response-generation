  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Slovakia.   
   
 Q.   For anyone.   What are you expecting out of Team USA?   
CAPTAIN MECIR:   I think the U.S. team is the favorite.   They have strong doubles.   They have very good first player, who is much higher ranked than our first player.   
But I think our team is experienced, also young.   They not afraid.   We have to put up a good fight.   
   
 Q.   What is your favorite part about representing your country in the Davis Cup?   
MARTIN KLIZAN:   I just can say that it's a pleasure to represent your country every time.   Doesn't matter if it's tennis or soccer or any kind of sport.   
So, I mean, it's a pleasure, and that's it.   
   
 Q.   You have had a chance to practice a little.   How is the court?   Does it favor a big server, any type of player, from what you can tell?   
LUKAS LACKO:   Well, I think the surface is pretty much same as we have back home in Slovakia.   We are pretty much used to it.   
Yeah, I think we don't have any problems here so far.   
   
 Q.   What is the key when you face guys with huge serves like Isner and Querrey?  
LUKAS LACKO:   They have this strength.   Even if they don't play well from baseline, they can still serve.   
I mean, it depends on the day.   Sometimes you just have to focus on yourself and not on them.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of the area here?   Have you been able to get out or done anything in the area since arriving?   
NORBERT GOMBOS:   I mean, the stadium, it's pretty nice.   We are a pleasure to stay here.   But I was suspecting that we will be closer to the main town from Chicago, but it's pretty far.   It's like 40 minutes from here.   
But anyway, hotel, it's really good.   Everything is fine.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
