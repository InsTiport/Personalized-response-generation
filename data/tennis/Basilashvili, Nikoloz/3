  N. BASILASHVILI/R. Federer
 3-6, 6-1, 7-5
 Q. How does it feel, winning against Federer?
 NIKOLOZ BASILASHVILI:   It feels really good, obviously.  He was my idol.  And just to play against him, even in match, practice, whatever it is, I'm happy.  He's for me one of the greatest of all time.
 To win means a lot.  I'm happy to be in the semifinal.  I had terrible last eight months, so I'm happy to win match by match and point by point and I'm really happy that I managed somehow to be in this semifinal here.  It was a good tournament so far.
 Q. What about your next match with Taylor Fritz?
 NIKOLOZ BASILASHVILI:   I think, yeah, they said I played him four years ago.  I don't know if I win or lose.
 He's really good player.  He's in great shape.  Will be interesting match.
