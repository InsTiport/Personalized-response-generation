Q.  Jana, obviously the key to the match was when you were up a break in the third set and Aranxta just made some great shots on your serve  -- 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  She did, yeah, when she was down she played real well.  I don't think that was the key point, I think the key point was, at the end I was a little more tired than Aranxta was and, you know, that's why she won.  I was not able to produce something extra on the important moments because I was too tired and I was still playing for the ball it's been a tough week for me I played alot of straight set matches and--  
 

Q.  I was going to say -- 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  -- a lot of many long matches so it's been tough but, you know, great ending for the season.  
 

Q.  It seems like, you know, everybody goes back to moment at Wimbledon but from what I've seen this week that has kind of changed around, turned around where everybody's gotten on you a little bit about the mental toughness, the lack of, and I think from what I saw this week it's elevated a little bit? 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  No sign of that, yeah.  
 

Q.  Exactly. 
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  Yeah, really, until the last point it was not over, it was a really great match, yeah, she is a great fighter, Aranxta, she's running, she's fighting, doing well.  Thank you.  
 

Q.  Thank you.
