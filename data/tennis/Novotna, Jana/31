Q. Jana, how you feel now? You haven't played so much after since Wimbledon. How do you
feel right now?

JANA NOVOTNA: I didn't play very much because I was injured. The last time I played, it
was in Atlanta last week. But I feel pretty good. I mean, coming into this Grand Slam,
didn't have much match preparation or toughness. There was nothing I could do about it. I
think I was playing quite well today. It was a long day, difficult hanging out all day. I
think I'm quite happy with that.

Q. Who do you think will be your next opponent?

JANA NOVOTNA: Well, I don't know. That's why I want to take the time to go and watch my
next opponent. I believe they are playing on the court. If it's going to be Mirjana Lucic,
that's why I want to see her; I never saw her play. Heard quite a lot about her. That's
why I want to stay a little bit longer and watch the opponents. Whoever wins, I will be
ready to face them.

Q. What did you hear about her? 

JANA NOVOTNA: That she's a young, upcoming player, had a good tournament on clay in
Strasbourg, not much else. That's why I want to look at it myself and see what is true
about it.

Q. Tell me, let's predict it will be Mirjana Lucic. Of course, the match is not over.
Do you have any, let's say, scare of her, that young, upcoming girl?

JANA NOVOTNA: No. Not at all. I'm always prepared to face anybody. Basically I'm
looking for the challenge, you know. I'm sure that it will bring quite a lot of attention
to everybody. I think it's always good, so hopefully we can get a good court, both play a
good match. If she's the winner, we'll see after that. I can tell you more after the
match.
