Q.  Jana, were you not able to come to the net as much as you'd like on this service?
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  Well, I was trying to.  It was definitely my game plan to come in as much as I can.  And even though I was serving quite well today, still when -- she kept me a pretty good game.  It was hard to come in and when I finally did, either she made a good passing shot, or I missed the first volley.  It was a good match.  And bad luck for me. 
 

Q.  Were your expectations -- what were your expectations coming in here?
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  My expectations were very high.  And even though I knew that my year wasn't as successful as it was last year, because I was going through a lot of sickness and a lot of injuries.  So I had the expectation, of course I wanted to win the first round.  And I was hoping to play other matches.  But I gave my best, and there's nothing I can do. 
 

Q.  What do you think of Kimiko's chances now, based on the way she played?
 
JANA NOVOTNA:  Well, I thought she didn't have a good start, but then  she picked up her game.  She started to play much better.  And of course, it depends really who she will have to play in the second round.  But she did really well the last two years.  It seems like she likes to play at the MSG.  We'll see how well she can play.  And it depends also who she will play.
