 Q. Can you talk a little bit how that medical time-out might have affected you? 
 
 JANA NOVOTNA: Well, I think it helped in a way because the previous game, just before
she took the medical time-out, it was a really tough game. That was the first time I broke
her serve basically. So, you know, it was good for me. I needed to calm down a little bit,
think about the next coming game. So it didn't affect me at all. In the beginning of the
second set, I thought about it a little bit. I said maybe she's hurt, how well she's going
to play, what is bothering her more? She kept on playing. I just decided to stick to my
game, not to worry about it too much. 
 
Q. What about the next round?
 
 JANA NOVOTNA: Well, Lindsay Davenport is a really tough opponent. I played her a couple
times before. Didn't do really well, you know, in the previous matches. But I think she's
playing well right now, but so am I. You know, I'm expecting a tough match, hopefully a
good match. We'll see who is going to be better. 
 
Q. What about being doubles partners? Is that strange at all?
 
 JANA NOVOTNA: Well, it is strange in a way because it's more or less that we know each
other so well. We will go after the weaknesses. But, you know, it doesn't bother me at
all. I don't see any problem coming up.
