K. FLIPKENS/T. Paszek
  6/4, 6/7, 6/2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You could've had an easy win today, couldn't you? 
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Yeah, I could, but I like grass too much. 
It was a tough second set.   I knew it was only one break, but, yeah, then you have match point.   I don't know, two or three, I think.

Q.   Two match points as 5‑2.
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Yeah, so she played good on one point.   She hit a winner down the line on the line. 
Yeah, a match can change in two centimeters.   If it's two centimeters more wide, then the match is finished in two easy sets.
That's tennis.   That's the game. 
Yeah, I'm actually really satisfied by the way I managed to win. 

Q.   Did that put you off, the tiebreak?   You played that rather badly, didn't you?
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Yeah, I did.   I mean, first point she got lucky with a net point.   Then I'm up 2‑1.   On my serve, I lose next two points.   I should have won already on 5‑2. 
Yeah, okay, that's tennis. 

Q.   Did her injury at the beginning of the third set, did that in some way put you off a little bit?   It was an awfully long time. 
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   It was long.   Almost ten minutes.   It was two injuries, so she got six minutes.
Yeah, I took a toilet break as well before, so only played two points in 15 to 20 minutes. 
Yeah, it wasn't easy, but you have to stay focused.   I played a few serves just to keep warm.
Yeah, I think it didn't change much about the score. 

Q.   Are you very conscious of having been a semifinalist last year and what's expected of you?
KIRSTEN FLIPKENS:   Yeah, I'm just trying to do my best every match, and we'll see how far I go.
