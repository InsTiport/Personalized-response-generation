A. RUVLEV/Y. Nishioka
6-1, 6-3
Q. Another great performance again today.  How would you assess your playing?
ANDREY RUBLEV:   I played really well today also.  I don't know, I'm happy the way I'm playing.  I'm happy that I'm feeling confident in my shots, that I'm trying to go big and in the end I feel that I will make it.  So we'll see, I was missing this feeling, I was missing competing and the first two matches went really well so we'll see what's going to happen next.
Q. Closing in on the semifinals what's your thoughts on Russia's performance so far?
ANDREY RUBLEV:   I mean we're still in it.  I will go support my team and I hope we will do well.  I know Daniil's going to give his best and I know this and we'll see what's going to happen.  We have a great team.  It's true.  But here all the best teams are.  So many countries have amazing teams.  And then there is only spots for four countries.  So not everyone will make it.  We'll see.
Q. Talk about the team captain and the team giving you a lot of encouragement from the team side?
ANDREY RUBLEV:   I feel amazing with my coach.  He's one of my best friends, so I know him since a long time ago, we have great connections.  He knows everything about me and I feel really comfortable with him being near by my side because he's one of my best friends and he's the one that I trust, one of the guys that I trust the most.  So it's always nice to have someone that you trust the most near to you, so I feel really amazing with him by my side.  So we'll see.  There's nothing much to say.  I feel great, I'm playing well, we'll see what's going on with Daniil and we'll see where we're going to be.
