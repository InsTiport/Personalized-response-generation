As dictated by Joe Lynch.


 JOE LYNCH:  Talking about the similarity to past matches he has
had with Agassi.

 MICHAEL CHANG:  I was conscious of what happened.  In the third
set in San Jose when I got up a break and lost the match.  I didn't
want to let it slip away again.  I put the pressure on and got
another break which made things easier.  It is always satisfying
to beat the top guys, especially someone like Andre who is very
talented.  I lost to him quite a bit in the juniors and he has
had the edge as a pro.  I hope things lean my way as we progress
in our careers.

 This is a good confidence boost for me.
