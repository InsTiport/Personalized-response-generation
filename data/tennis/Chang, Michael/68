Q.  Michael, you were a set and 4-1 down, but you came back.

MICHAEL CHANG:  Well, I feel like even though I am - I know that I was out of the tournament already before today's match -  I felt like I still had to go out and really go out and give my best for the Lord.  I think that it just seems to be a little bit of my character to not go out and play a match halfheartedly.  It is still a match.  It is still important to me in my heart.  So, regardless of whether I come off the court having won or lost, I think it is still important to go out, to give it my best.  So, that is just the way I feel: like I needed to go out and do things and approach things with that kind of  attitude.


Q.  You seemed pretty down yesterday after the second defeat.  How important is it to you to finish the season on a high, with a victory?

MICHAEL CHANG:  Well, I can say that not many guys get a chance to do that.  Obviously, I was a little bit down yesterday because I think nobody wants to ever be out after two matches.  And, I think, obviously, it is great to be in the latter stage of a tournament like this.  I think that as disappointing as those two matches were, I think in everything everybody has times where they fall, and you really just have to go out and pick yourself back up and try again.  So, that is the way life is and is the way that you need to be.  I think it is pretty important in every aspect of life.
