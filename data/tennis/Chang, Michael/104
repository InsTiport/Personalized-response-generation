Q.  How well do you think he played from the  moment you broke to go 2-1 up in the second set?  
 
MICHAEL CHANG:  I think, I had a little bit  of bad luck, actually after that because I had the  first point right away, and it hit the line; it skipped  off the line and then I think I had a couple other  points that I think I could have won, but, you know,  those are the breaks.  I mean, sometimes those things  are going to happen, and I don't think he really  changed anything.  I don't think he really, at that  particular time, really raised his level of play.  I  just think that some of the key points just happened to  swing his way.  I mean, I had a few points at the net  where I had a great chance to win points at the net and  just wasn't able to do it.  One point when I was a foot away from the net  I am touching my racket and it just didn't go over.  Those things sometimes just happen.  So...   
 

Q.  Happy with your year obviously moving  forward?  
 
MICHAEL CHANG:  Yeah, I feel -- yeah, I think  it has been a very good year.  It has been a very  blessed year, and I hope that it continues and  hopefully will get better an better.
