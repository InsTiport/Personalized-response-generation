This time on clay.  What do you think about this match?VIKTOR TROICKI: Well, I know Simone very well.  We are good friends.  He's very good player, very nice shots.  Yeah, good forehand, good backhand, hits the ball well. But I beat him both times this year, even though it was very tough.  Going into that match with confidence.  We never played on clay so it's going to be different, but I know what to expect and what to play against him.  It won't be easy, definitely. Again, I'm expecting a tough match, but I hope it goes well for me.
