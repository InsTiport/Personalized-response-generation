 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Not the result you were after tonight, but still a good preparation for next week?   
 VIKTOR TROICKI: Right now I feel bit disappointed, but definitely it was a good week. Also a good match tonight. I feel I had a lot of chances that I didn't use, and obviously Gilles doesn't suit my game. For the last five matches already I haven't been able to figure out how to win a set.   
 So I think I was playing all right today, but not enough to beat him. Good week for me, as I said. Yeah, I hope I continue to play good in Melbourne. I play my first round already on Monday. I hope I get ready for that match.   
 Yeah, I need to also recover a little bit physically from this tournament. I hope I will be ready for Monday.   
  
  Q. You were quite emotional out there. What were you frustrated by?   
 VIKTOR TROICKI: Well, when you're losing, I mean, you get frustrated. Gilles played good. He was hitting some amazing shots. I mean, it's not that I get frustrated because of -- it just, I mean, comes to me.   
 You get a little bit nervous and maybe a little bit -- you know, like you start to think about everything, and then you have to -- sometimes you just let it all out.  
 I would say I was a bit -- yeah, I was a bit nervous in some moments, and I had to get it all out.   
  
  Q. Was it tough in that second set tiebreak? The foot fault was a really tough call.   
 VIKTOR TROICKI: I mean, in the finals in the tiebreak of the second set, at 4-2, to call a foot fault, I mean, I haven't seen it so much in my life. Obviously I was -- I mean, I don't know if it was or not; maybe it was. I don't want to say anything.  
 Still, to call it, I mean, it's a pretty rough call. I get a little bit pissed because of that, for sure.
