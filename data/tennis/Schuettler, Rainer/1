 D. SELA/R. Schuettler
  7-6, 6-3, 6-2 
   
  Q. Could you comment on the performance of Dudi Sela?  
 RAINER SCHUETTLER: He played well.  
  
  Q. Anything that gave you particular trouble in his game?  
 RAINER SCHUETTLER: He's a very complete player. He plays very solid with a very good backhand, doesn't serve so hot, but very consistent. I've played him a few times and I've never beat him, so I think he likes my game.
