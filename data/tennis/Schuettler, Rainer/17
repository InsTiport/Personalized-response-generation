Q.  What kind of match do you expect with Schalken, the same type of match as at Wimbledon?
 
RAINER SCHUETTLER:  Of course, it will be a tough one.  I'm in good shape, he had one five-set match.  I mean, today I think it was three sets.  I didn't see anything.  Of course, it will be a tough one.  I just go on court and try to win.  He's trying, yeah, to do the same.  That's it.  The better one wins.  
 
Q.  Do you feel better now on the hard courts?  You might have a slight advantage over him?
 
RAINER SCHUETTLER:  Actually, I feel good on grass, as well.  But, I mean, he had some problems with his foot in Wimbledon.  I had some problems with my leg.  I think it wasn't a very good match in Wimbledon.  So it will be, I hope, much better here.  
 
Q.  What will be decisive, mental strength, because you have the same kind of game?
 
RAINER SCHUETTLER:  Yeah, it depends.  I saw a couple of points when he played against Lars.  I mean, I only saw the first two sets actually.  He made a lot of mistakes there, but then he played better.  I tried to make him work for his points.  Of course, that's his game, too.  Then we see who is playing better.
