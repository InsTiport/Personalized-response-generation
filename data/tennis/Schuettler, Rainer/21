THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  What was wrong with your ankle?

RAINER SCHUETTLER:  It was my leg.  In the middle of the first set, I was running to a forehand, I don't know, I had a little bit of pain in my leg.  I mean, it's tough.  If you cannot run a hundred percent against someone who is playing from the baseline, it's always tough. 

Q.  You weren't coming up to the net.  Neither was he.  Seemed like you were playing on clay.  It wasn't a grass court game because of your injury?

RAINER SCHUETTLER:  No.  It's because of his game and because of my game.  I mean, if I play serve and volley against him, I have no chance at all because he's a great returner and he's playing great passing shots.  I think, yeah, he thinks a little bit the same about me because my strength is to return and the passing shots.  That's why we played from the baseline.
