 MODERATOR: Questions.  
 
Q. How well do you think Pat can progress in the tournament? Do you think he has the
ability to win it?
 
 RAINER SCHUTTLER: I don't know. I mean, he played I think pretty good. It's tough to
break him because he's a great serve-and-volley player. For sure he can go pretty far, but
I don't know how far. He's a very good grass court player. He was last year in the semis.  
 
Q. Lost to Agassi. 
 
 RAINER SCHUTTLER: Lost to Agassi. He can win it, for sure.
