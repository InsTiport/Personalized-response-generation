P. CARRENO BUSTA/H. Gaston
6-3, 6-2
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
Q. Tough luck today.  I'm wondering how did it feel to be back competing in Paris after the run you had at Roland Garros?
HUGO GASTON:   It's good.  Of course today I'm sad.  Play against Pablo.  He's a very good player.  It was a tough match for me, and congrats to him.
But of course to come back at Paris for me it's good.  It's nice.
Q. What was it like for you after that run in terms of getting yourself emotionally ready to go back to play challengers or other tournaments?  What was it like for you mentally?
HUGO GASTON:   For me, it's normal to play challenger.  It's my tour, so I have to be good in challenger for playing Grand Slam every time and Masters 1000 like here.  It's good for mentally to be back in challengers.
Of course I want to play Bercy every year, but I have to be top 100, and we will see.
