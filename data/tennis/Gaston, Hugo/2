 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. A great run and magnificent performance today.  Sorry it didn't go your way.  What would you say you have learned about yourself and the efficacy of your game these last ten days?
 HUGO GASTON:   I think I'm more stronger in the game in every shot.  Mentally also.  I'm very happy about that.
 Today of course I'm sad, but I'm also happy.  So that the thing is.
 But still a good tournament for me, yeah.
 Q. How did it feel to get the response from the crowd on Chatrier and the love that they sent to you?
 HUGO GASTON:   For me, it's amazing.  Today the crowd was just amazing.  I love to play in Paris.  Of course I'm sad today, but the crowd just amazing today, and thanks to them for support, really.
 Q. Were you surprised at how effective your dropshots could be against a player like Dominic Thiem and how it gave you the ability to really control the match, especially in the third and fourth set?
 HUGO GASTON:   Yeah, sure.  I love to do some dropshots.  But I can do all the shots in my game, so it's important to change, never the same ball.
 Of course I love to play a dropshot (smiling).
 Q. What are your plans for the rest of the season now?
 HUGO GASTON:   For the moment, I don't know.  Go to the (indiscernible) I know after.  But after tournaments or something like that, I don't know.  We will have to talk with my coach and we will see.
