THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Very close to having our first 12-12 tiebreaker.  Was that on your mind at all?  Talk us through what a long match that was.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, I never played such a long match, I think not even on clay.
It was tough.  I was happy I could make last game to break her and we didn't have to play a tiebreak.
Q. Was it on your mind at all the tiebreak could obviously go either way?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: You know, I was trying all the time to break her, so I was more focused to hold my serve, till I have 12.  And I was happy obviously that I broke her.
Q. She broke your serve and she was sort of serving for the match.  What was going through your mind?  She's a really strong server usually, but she sort of crumbled a bit at the end.  How did you keep focused there?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I just tried, you know.  I went for it.  She also came with some mistakes, but I was going for it and I tried to play more aggressive.
Yeah, it worked out (smiling).
Q. Personally for you, is it a big surprise to have reached the last eight at this stage of your career?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, I'm super happy about it.  Surprise?  I thought I can go far in this tournament.  I felt pretty confident in last matches.  It was tough match today.  Yeah, it's kind of surprising, I think.
Q. We were talking to Strycova earlier.  She's sort of the old stager of the Czech players.  She was talking last week about you as being one of those coming through.  Can you talk a bit about the Czech experience at the moment?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, we have a lot of players.  I have definitely some players to look up to and to learn some things.  I didn't know she was talking about me.  That's nice from her (smiling).
Yeah, I mean, we have many players.  I'm happy to get into that kind of group, too.
Q. What's the story with you and Rebel Wilson?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: You know, she texted me last year at the US Open.  She likes tennis.  We're friends.  She's super nice.  She texted me today about tickets, so I gave her tickets to my box, and she enjoyed it, yeah.
Q. Was that the first time you met her, US Open last year?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, last year.
Q. How did you meet in the first place?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: We went for dinner in New York.
Q. How did you first meet her?  Like, people saw Rebel Wilson in the box and thought, how do these two people know each other?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, it's crazy.  She texted me on Twitter last year when I beat Muguruza, so she texted me.  I was, like, Wow.  I was surprised about that.  Yeah, she's just super chill and super nice person.
Q. What's she like at dinner?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: What's she like?
Q. Is she, like, cracking jokes all the time?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, she's super funny.  Whatever she says, yeah, she's cool person.
Q. Had you seen Bridesmaids before?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.
Q. I mean, she took that first set, and at what point did you feel as though you were, like, in the match?  You know, you're playing the Czech No. 1.  You're the underdog, all of that.  When did you start to think, I can win this?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I think the start of the second set I started to play better.  I mean, she's super steady.  She's awesome player.  She didn't give me much chances to take.  But, yeah, that start of the second set I went for my shots.  I was going more to the net.  I felt like I could make it.
Q. It was a packed court out there, a lot of fans coming in as that match was going on.  What was the environment like for you to play that sort of match?  I know you had that big match in Prague, as well.  But to have that kind of big stage and...
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, it was super nice.  People were supporting a lot.  Yeah, it's definitely gave me energy, and I enjoyed it.
Q. Three-and-a-quarter hours, longest you ever played, quick turnaround.  How do you feel you'll be tomorrow?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, I will try my best to recover for tomorrow.  Obviously I'm a little tired.  But, yeah, still after this press I will do my best to recover for tomorrow.
