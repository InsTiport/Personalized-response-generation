THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. That was a pretty long physical match. How are you feeling with the win, your play and physically all of that.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Thank you. For the win, I feel very good, and, yeah, it was physically very tough, so I just actually had some time with my physio. It was very tough and we just tried to make everything like that I will feel good or best as possible tomorrow for another match.
Q. Anything specifically bothering you or just fatigue and the result of a long match?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, well, everything was bothering me, he's helping me with that, so, yeah, we did maximum.
Q. We know you came here pretty late, can you explain to us what happened in the past few days and how happy you finally made it.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well the last few days I was mostly traveling here. So, yeah I came late, I didn't come very prepared as I would wish I am, but, yeah, it's how it is and I just try to make the best of it.
And, yeah, I won today a very, very tough match, I was struggling from the start, but, yeah, happy with the win.
Q. I believe you were ranked outside the top 100 at the start of the year and here you are now in the year-end championships. What do you think of your improvement, what do you think that's allowed you to achieve this sort of level more consistently?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I think it's just like consistent work, actually what I'm doing with my team already since last year and we just keep on doing, keep on improving stuff. And, yeah, I think it's because of that, I have a good team around me and I'm just taking advantage of it.
Q. I've noticed that in your game there is a lot of net rush, especially in the first set. So is it your normal game style or is it some kind of special strategy?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Net rush?
Q. Yeah, charge to the net.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I don't know if it was in the first set, but, yeah, it is my game and I try to go to the net as much as I can. As I prepare to hit the ball, I try to go there, so it's definitely my game.
Q. And while most of the players in your generation choose to stay behind the baseline, why do you play this kind of game style for yourself?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, because it's me, I play like, I played like that always, I think. So I think it's also good if everyone -- I actually don't think that everyone is staying on the baseline at this time, I can see that more and more players are coming to the net and trying to play more aggressive and I'm doing the same.
Q. Do you think you should change something for facing your next opponent, Sofia Kenin?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Maybe to play better from the start. She is a good player, so I will have to play very good and consistent tomorrow. I don't think I should change any specific thing, I'll just play my game.
