7-5, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Thank you very much from an old journalist like me because you play some serve and volley.  How come?  Your father?  Your experience?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: What?
Q. How comes your serve and volley?  Was your first teacher -- I don't know.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: First teacher?  I think like since I'm a kid, I was playing kind of different.  I like to play creative.  Serve and volley, it works on the grass.  I like it.  That's why I play it and I enjoy that.
Q. Do you have any idol?  Was it Martina Navratilova, someone?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Like everybody, I like Roger.  That's kind of my idol.
Q. Got off to a great start.  Did the fatigue from yesterday catch up to you?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I think it was a little.  I was obviously a little tired today.  Still I think I could make it in the first set.  It was 5-2.  But, yeah, my energy level was going down all the time.  Somehow I couldn't put it back.
Yeah, she played great, so it was tough then.
Q. Now that you can look back on it, making the quarterfinals here, the wins you got, having the two weeks, what do you take out of this tournament to apply going forward?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, I made quarterfinals of Wimbledon, so I beat good players.  Yesterday we had awesome match with Kaja.  It's many positive things from this tournament for me.  Yeah, I will just keep going.
Q. Is there a better belief now that your game can compete at this level, at the very top echelon of the women's game?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah, definitely.  I think I still need to improve some things.  There is a big room for me to improve that.  But, yeah, it showed me I can play good tennis against good players.  I can even win.  So it's nice.
Q. Barbora won her quarterfinal also.  You play similar, both with a lot of variety.  Was she someone you ever looked up to?  What do you make of her result?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Not really.  Yeah, she plays great.  It's not like I'm looking up to her.  Yeah, she has some good game.  I'm happy for her that she made it today.
Q. You grew up in a city that was far away from Prague, right?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yes.
Q. You only recently moved into the city?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Last year I moved to Prague.
Q. From the outside, we look at the Czech team, we assume everybody knows each other well.  Are you connected?  Do you know them all well or not really yet?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I do few of them.  Not really all, like, Petra Kvitova, like that.  Like we never practice together or like that.  They're playing in different clubs, so I don't really know them.  But like 'hi' and that's it.  I know few.
But I'm fine with everyone.
Q. You have a strong relationship with your father, a former soccer player.
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Yeah.
Q. Did he learn you something special to be strong, something for your mind?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, he brought me to sports when I was a kid.  So I guess that is all the movement, all the things I did.  Why I'm playing tennis is because of him.  So, yeah, that's it.
Q. Getting these results, playing on the bigger stages, more people have now seen you play than before Wimbledon.  People seem to be entertained by the game style.  How does that make you feel?  Yesterday against Pliskova were discovering you a little bit.  How do you feel having the game style that can excite tennis journalists and fans?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: Well, I'm happy.  I get many nice messages, positive, like, people around telling me positive stuff.  It's really nice.
But I don't play that game because I want to people like that.  I'm trying to improve so I can win some matches and get my goal or where I want to be.  Yeah, I'm happy that people likes it and they support me.  Was really nice yesterday and today as well.
Q. I read that you study English on Netflix.  What is your favorite series?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: I don't even know now.  I wasn't on Netflix a long time now.
Q. Are you following something now?
KAROLINA MUCHOVA: No.  I'm not watching TV much.
