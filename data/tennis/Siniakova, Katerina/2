M. KEYS/K. Siniakova
6-2, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English, please.
Q. Congratulations on a good run here in the tournament.  What do you think made the difference in today's match?
KATERINA SINIAKOVA: Yeah, I didn't feel so solid in this match.  I was really under pressure and maybe I was trying to do something that I'm not comfortable.  So I think the worst was the beginning.  And I could come back, and it was that I couldn't, like, finish the comeback.
So when she had already set up, so she started play even more aggressive and she was more confident.
So, yeah, today I was more fighting with, like, the consistent game.
Q. You said trying to do something normally you don't do?  What did you mean by that?
KATERINA SINIAKOVA: You know, when you don't play any good shot and it's a winner, so it's -- you don't want to -- or me, I don't want to keep it like this.  So I'm trying to speed up or trying to change the game.  So that's what I mean.
Q. You of course had a big victory in your previous match, beating No. 1 player.  What are the challenges or difficulties in going back out there the next time trying to follow up a big, emotional, important win like that?
KATERINA SINIAKOVA: Yeah, it's tough every time.  I mean, every match is different, and it shows this match today.  Because I was really playing well these four matches, and today, yeah, I wasn't just enough solid for her.  And she was, like -- yeah, she was the one who was dictating the game.  And, yeah, she deserve it.
Q. About Keys, then what was it that she did particularly well today that was hard for you?
KATERINA SINIAKOVA: I think the main thing was that she was aggressive.  So she pushed me back.
And even if I was trying to fight every point and trying to push so many balls back, she just keep her level.
And today was probably was her day.  But even when she didn't finish it second shot, today she finish even with the fifth one.
Q. And just going back for a moment to the idea of coming back after the big win the other day.  Was that hard either because of emotions, or whatever, after being at that sort of high to then try to follow it up again today?
KATERINA SINIAKOVA: I mean, I just wanted to play another match.  So I was trying to focus on my game.  Of course every time is hard because you beat the No. 1, and the expectation from low is, like, big and everyone expect you now to beat everyone.
So from this side is really tough, but I just wanted to go there and try to show again the good tennis.  Today wasn't so good, but I can just keep few good memories.  And hopefully next time I can continue all tournament.
