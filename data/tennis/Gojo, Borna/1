SPAIN 2, Croatia 1
NADAL/Gojo 6-4, 6-3
THE MODERATOR: Any questions in English?
Q. I want you to answer me, what feeling do you have leaving Madrid in that way with the team, with five defeats and the pressure with the main champion? Thank you.
BORNA GOJO: Yeah, it's definitely not good. But we tried our best. Obviously Borna couldn't play today with his injury. He tried also Monday, gave his best. And I just made my debut on Monday also, and today was my second match. So I think we gave it all, really. It just wasn't a great situation for us here.
But, you know, as we were the World Champions, and next year we are going to try and be in the full, let's say, full lineup and try to attack the world title again, I believe.
Q. You just played Rafael Nadal in center court in Madrid. That's got to be a pretty incredible experience. Actually, I think if somebody had said in advance, here's a guy who is ranked, whatever you're ranked, 231, I think.
BORNA GOJO: It doesn't matter.
Q. Here's a guy who has played college tennis, has played one main draw match on the ATP Tour, which he got into with a wildcard and he's playing Rafa, many would have predicted double bagel. How do you feel?
BORNA GOJO: I don't feel great because I lost, and that's just my perspective. Obviously, I played the world No. 1, an unbelievable champion. One of my favorite players, you know, that I have watched on TV.
You lose 6-4, 6-3, you should go, It's okay, didn't get killed out there. But for me and how I was raised, it's just about winning, really. On one hand I'm happy with how I performed. I think I could have done better. But on the other hand, I'm just not happy that I lost.
So I just hope I can get better in the future and, you know, maybe try and attack Rafa again or any one of the greats.
THE MODERATOR: More questions in English? Let's move to national language.
