T. FRITZ/M. Baghdatis   
6-4, 6-4, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You stepped up to hit that backhand passing shot at the end and you see it go past him, what's going through your mind?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: It just felt so good.  You know, just the emotions of finally winning my first Grand Slam match, I have had to wait a really, really long time for it, and I think this is my seventh try of winning a Grand Slam match.   
As soon as I hit that by him, I told myself to really go for it, and as soon as I hit it, I knew that was going to do it.  I don't know, just the rush of emotions, like, that's the best part about tennis.  The best part about winning is that rush you feel right after you win.   
 Q.  How much different was kind of the mindset and emotions for you heading into the match this year?  Last year you played a long match against Jack in front of a big crowd.  Was it kind of different for you this year?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I'm just more experienced, I guess, this year.  But going into the match is the same thing.  I think I have had some tough Grand Slam draws in the past.  I have been playing a lot of good players.   
I feel like the way I have played in a lot of my matches I would have beaten a lot of other players.  I think it just wasn't really meant to be a lot of the other times, like, against Jack, Isner, or Muller or Wawrinka or any other ones I played, you know.   
So, you know, I just approached it with nothing to lose, not put too much pressure on myself, play my game.   
 Q.  How special was it -- I think you have Jordan here.  Did that make it even more special for you?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Of course, having the whole family here, my wife, my son, my mom, dad, having them here for this experience also is just -- it's amazing, you know.  I wouldn't want it any other way.   
You know, it's always been my dad's dream to see me win a match at the US Open, so, you know, he's made my whole tennis game, as well.  That was special, as well.   
 Q.  Did he say something to you after the match?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: He just said he's so proud of me.   
 Q.  Having your family here, and obviously this is a tournament you did great in juniors and have a connection to, do you feel more pressure or energy because of the surroundings?  Does that create a little bit more pressure because it's a big event for you?  Do you sort of get energy from it?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: You know, I have made that mistake luckily really early on when I played the men's qualifying.  It was when I was the No. 1 junior.   
So I had a lot of expectations on myself in the men's qualifying two years ago, and I just played a horrendous match because I had so much riding on it.  I expected so much of myself.   
Since then, I have kind of learned to just take it easy.  Obviously I can't trick myself into thinking, you know, it's not the US Open, it's not a really big deal, but I just try and, you know, take it like any other tournament and just try and play my game, not focus too much on expectations or anything.   
That's something that's caused a lot of bad performances from me, I think, is expectations.  You know, I have my family here to support me, and, you know, everything is going well.   
 Q.  We had Nick Kyrgios in here before you and he talked a little bit about how he struggles to find motivation to compete and train and get up for every single week and that's why he's so up and down.  Can you talk a little bit about why that's not an issue for you?  Is it more like love of the game, passion, you love the sport and you give it everything?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: You know, it's different for everyone.  Sometimes it's tough to find motivation when you're doing all the right things on and off the court and you're not having the results you want, because you kind of get this feeling of what's the point of doing all this, you know.   
But for me, it's never been so much of an issue just because I, one, off the court, I just really enjoy hard work.  I guess I'm just lucky that my mind works like that.   
You know, I'm really driven to be the best.  I have my family.  My own personal goal is to be the best player I can be.  I mean, I think everything about it is motivating.   
Let me think here.  Just the feeling of winning, just being in the spotlight, winning big matches on big courts, winning tournaments, providing for my family.  What else?  I mean, making money, of course (smiling).  And also love for the game, as well.  I mean, there are so many different reasons.  I don't even know which one to say, what motivates me.   
I think it's just everything keeps me going, and my passion for winning and the sport and just being the best I can be, I think, is all the motivation I need.   
 Q.  Obviously earlier in the year you had a big win against Cilic.  I don't know if you have looked ahead yet or just been staying in the moment, but how do you go into a match like that against a guy like Thiem who is one of the best players in the world?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: You know, you have nothing to lose, so the pressure is on them.  They know that I'm going to have no pressure on myself.  I'm capable of playing good tennis, you know, when I'm playing well.  You just really have nothing to lose.   
It's not too surprising when I see a young player test or beat a big player, because, you know, your level rises when there is no pressure, and I'm just going to go out there and play my game.  You know, I'm playing good tennis.  I'm very confident.   
 Q.  How would you describe your next opponent, Dominic?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I mean, he's a great player and a really great guy.  I know him pretty well.  We have practiced before.   
You know, he's a really strong player, great forehand, and extremely hard worker.  I know he likes clay more, so luckily I'm not playing him on clay (smiling).  I'm playing him on my favorite surface.   
You know, I don't know what to expect from it, but I'll be ready to play.   
 Q.  Obviously you're now traveling the tour far and wide, but a little while ago this summer you went up to Aptos, played the challenger there, a seaside setting.  Could you talk about what it's like to play in your home state, what the challengers are like?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I love playing in California.  The first two challengers I ever won were in Northern California.  Indian Wells, I had a good tournament there this year.  So it's really nice playing, you know, at home, because the U.S. is so big.  Home would be more so California.   
I think I always have the crowd on my side.  It just feels like I'm just playing in, like, my backyard when I was a kid, I guess you could say.   
Aptos is a great challenger.  Definitely one of the best.  I think it's the longest running in the U.S.  The club is amazing.   
You know, I have a decision after the Open if I want to go play more challengers in California.  So, you know, we'll see.   
 Q.  Also, just specifically, when you're in a comfortable setting and the crowd is with you, is it just your whole body is more relaxed?  You can swing more freely?  How does that translate or does it?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Not sure exactly.  I think you just feel -- I think you just feel confident because it's a feeling that you are used to.   
 Q.  Did you watch Frances?  Could you just tell us who you were rooting for?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Well, I didn't watch the match.  It was a bit too late for me.  I was second on today, so pretty early.  I like to sleep a lot.  I got to sleep before.  Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it.   
I'd say I was rooting for Frances just because I like to see the young guys do well and we're good friends.  That would have been a great win for him.  But, you know, he did a great job pushing Federer to five sets, and from what I heard it was, you know, up and down.  Could have gone either way.  It's great for him.
