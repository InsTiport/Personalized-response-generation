THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Have you started to play your best tennis again after maybe not quite getting there during the summer?  What are you taking out of this?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah, I played a good match.  I had a lot of chances.  I didn't take them, but I was right there.  I've been playing well the last four, five weeks.  I'm excited for the rest of the season.  Excited to get back to work, see where it takes me next year.   
I finally feel like I'm back playing solid tennis.   
 Q.  Any thoughts about not so much a sluggish start, but you didn't make any breakpoints, some of the key points didn't come through?  Were you feeling it?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah, I mean, the first set he came up with some incredible shots to save breakpoints, win breakpoints.  I mean, I felt like I was completely in the first two sets.  I feel like they could have gone either way.  I think we had the same amount of breakpoints in the first set.  I think I had more in the second.  It really just could have gone either way.  It came down to a couple points.   
 Q.  That was a new court.  How did you like playing on that court?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: It was fine.  It's not a permanent court.  I don't know when they're going to have the new Louis made.  Next year.  But in the meantime that court is great.   
 Q.  Do you remember the old Grandstand?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah.  I played a match on it once.   
 Q.  The tree is still there, but anything like the old Grandstand?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I liked the old Grandstand a lot because I felt like everything was really close to the court, like the seats were so close.  It's kind of like closed off.  This court is more open.  I mean, it's in basically the same spot.   
 Q.  Who did you play in the old Grandstand?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I played my first match of juniors.  First round of juniors, my last year in the juniors.   
 Q.  Do you feel you have to go for your shots, be aggressive?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah, when I'm playing my best, I'm aggressive.  When I see the shot I like, I take it.  I go for it.  I try to hit a winner.  I try to hurt my opponent.  I'm not the guy that's going to stay back and rally, rally, rally, wait for a miss.  I wait for my chance.  As soon as I see my chance, I go for it.  Just a very aggressive player.   
 Q.  To play that style of tennis, you have to have self-confidence, and you do.  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah, there's no second-guessing your shots.  There's no being nervous about your shots.  You just have to be loose and just go for it.   
 Q.  What are you going to do for the rest of the year?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I'm not totally sure yet.  I have doubles tomorrow.  After the US Open is done, I'm going to take a couple days.  I've been playing a lot of tournaments without any rest.  I'm going to take a couple days, then just get back to training.  Most likely go to Asia.   
 Q.  You're in contention for the NextGen, are you?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Still.  Not sure how that's going to play out.  I'm going to have to have some really strong results in Asia if I want to make it into the top seven or eight.
