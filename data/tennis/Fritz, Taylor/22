THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How is the knee?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: The knee?  Oh, I just scraped it.  I do it all the time when I slide.  I scrape the back knee.  It's fine.  Just a cut.   
 Q.  Wasn't any real damage to it?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: No, I just scraped it.  It happens all the time.   
 Q.  What is your analysis of today's match?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: It was a really good match.  I think overall it was a good match.  But I really should have been able to win the third set.  I was up a break two different times.   
Someone like me who has a big serve, really I think my serve is one of my best shots, so I was disappointed.  I was up a break twice in the third and wasn't able to win the third set.  That was a tough one.   
He played better than me in the third set tiebreaker, for sure.  He played really well, so he deserved to win the third-set breaker.  Should have never really gotten there.  I should have definitely served out the third set, been up two sets to one.  Go from there.   
The rest of the match was fine.  I played really well the first set.  He played well, got me the second set.  Small margins both sets, the whole match.  Couple points here and there.  He won a few breakpoints, I won a few.  That's how the sets were being determined.   
 Q.  Being an American, can you talk about what 50 years of the US Open means to you?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I think it feels like home here.  It's awesome to have the crowd support, like especially today.  It was amazing having the crowd cheering for me.   
I think it's awesome that we're 50 years into the US Open being the US Open.  It hasn't always been here.  It's growing every year.  Getting better every single year I come here.  I think I've been playing as a pro for three years.  I played three years as a junior.  I guess this is my sixth year here maybe.  It's awesome.   
So I'm excited to see this event grow as my career goes on.  And, yeah, it just feels like home here as an American.  I bet all the other Americans would say the same thing.  It's what we look forward to all year.   
 Q.  You had to stop because of the weather.  Is it difficult to get going again after that?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: It's definitely tough when we stop for that long and we weren't allowed to re-warm up.  I thought, This is going to be good for me, because he's going to have a tough time serving after this long of a break.  It was.  He double-faulted three times.  I was able to break.   
But then I came around, Oh, no, I have to serve.  My legs were so stiff, I couldn't make a serve.   
So it is really tough.  You could see how it was tough.  We both played bad service games, traded breaks there.  That's because we played four sets basically, then just sat on nothing.  It was cold.  Just did nothing for like 10, 15 minutes, then had to stand up.  I bet he was stiff, as well.  It's just what happens.
