THE MODERATOR: Questions?   
 Q.  Taylor, I was wondering what was the moment in which you were thinking that you were really taking the game? Was it the tiebreak, the end of the tiebreak, second set, third set?  
TAYLOR FRITZ: The tiebreak could have gone either way. I felt pretty in the match from the beginning, you know, having a chance to break on the first return game. Then just, you know, losing the set in, you know, just one break at the very end.   
So I felt very pretty in it the whole time. I really felt like I started to play a lot better tennis in the beginning of the third, I felt like I started hitting my forehand a lot more, going after a lot more and missing, making less errors and then even serving a lot better. Midway through the third I felt like I started kind of catching on to his serve a bit better.   
So I think everything started flowing for me in the beginning of the third set.   
 Q.  What do you think are your prospective as a team to go to the quarterfinal? Because we are thinking, as journalists, about the different scenarios and it is really difficult to understand what is going on.  
TAYLOR FRITZ: I haven't even looked at it or checked what the different scenarios are and what needs to happen, you know.   
I think we're just focused on winning this doubles match. You know, I'll go out there and cheer the guys on, and hopefully we win. If we go through, we go through. I don't think we're really stressing about it too much. We just know we need to win. So that's what we're going to do.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
