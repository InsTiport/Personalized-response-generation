DR. SAM REBER:  Jiri Novak is withdrawing because of symptoms that are that of a viral flu.  He has stomach pain and feels weak and dizzy.  There's been 11 players so far in the tournament that have complained of that, varying in severity.  Some have been able to continue playing, and some have had symptoms that have forced them to withdraw.  This appears to be a flu-related illness, not any food-related illness.  It's presenting in multiple players over multiple days, not one single event.  It seems to be relatively short-lived.  They have their symptoms that seem to disappear within about 24 hours and then they are left with a weakness after that, but recover fairly quickly.
