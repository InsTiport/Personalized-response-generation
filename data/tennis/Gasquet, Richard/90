THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Talk about how difficult it was to play two matches, five sets, starting as early as you did and playing right up until 20 minutes ago?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, for sure it's tough, but I think he played one more hour than me in morning with Monaco so it made a little bit difference, I think. 
I saw him a little bit tired at the start of the second set.   First set he played very good.   I couldn't do nothing.   He was playing very good from the baseline, going to the net. 
But I tried to fight a lot and then I defend well and I did a good match.   But for sure to play two matches in a day, it's very difficult. 

Q.   Can I ask about your next round.   You're be playing one of the two top servers in the game.   Have you had a chance to watch much of Milos Raonic, and do you have an impression of the type of game he plays and the challenges that he will present if you play him?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I know them.   I see them a lot of times.   For sure it's very difficult to play this kind of server because they are serving pretty well. 
I'm in semifinal.   I'm feeling confident, so I'm sure I can win.   But for sure it's a big challenge to return these kind of guys.   But it's not the same way of playing like Berdych or Fish, typical players, but I'm sure I can win. 

Q.   Mardy had your number the last three times you faced each other.   What was the difference this time?
RICHARD GASQUET:   I think the court is slower than in Cincinnati.   Then I think he played this morning.   I played too, but he played win more hour.   I think I was fresher than him.
For sure I played well.   I'm feeling confident.   I play well this morning, so I was playing very good.
