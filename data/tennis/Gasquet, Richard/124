  R. NADAL/R. Gasquet  
6-7, 6-2, 6-1  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What did you think when you had Rafa in the first set there?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I was playing incredible, maybe my best set in my life. But you have to win two sets to win him. I had three breakpoints in the second set, and after it was really difficult for me.   
 But he never miss. He has an incredible forehand and incredible backhand, physical, so it's really, really hard to win him.   
 I think he's playing just incredible.   
  
  Q. Did fatigue play a role in the second set at all? Were you a little tired?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah. I was a little bit tired, but I knew it was a really difficult for me to win the match because Rafael is just a good player and such a great fighter.   
 I tried to play my game so I was a little bit tired. It was harder for me with my forehand, with my serve. I didn't have easy points with him.   
 It's hard, but I try to do my best. I have to work to try to play a better third set.   
  
  Q. What's it like trying to put him away? It took six set points in that tiebreak, which was a really a remarkable tiebreak, and he just kept coming and coming.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, he was playing great, but physically and mentally it was really hard to win this tiebreak. After it was physically and mentally really hard to continue like that.   
 But I knew with him it's the same. He never miss. He's like that all the match. You have to play so aggressive. If you don't play aggressive he has such a big forehand. He's the best player in the world for me, and it will be really hard for one player to win him.  
  
  Q. Is there anybody else in the sport who matches his mental strength?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Maybe, but in tennis, he's the best for sure.   
  
  Q. Overall, this week gives you confidence moving forward for the rest of the hard court season. How do you feel your game is at the moment?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I'm playing really good. I played great shots in the first set and all during the match. For me, I am confident for next week and US Open because I won a set against Rafael. It was a big set. I did my best, and I'm confident for the season.   
  
  Q. At 1-1 in the second set you had a couple of breakpoint chances there. How disappointing was that right there?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I was really disappointed after it because it was really important for me to do it. Maybe with my serve I could do 3-1 after. You never know what could happen. We never know what could happen if I won this game.   
 But, you know, it's really -- I don't know, maybe it will be a better match after.
