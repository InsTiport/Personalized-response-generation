An interview with:
RICHARD GASQUET
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. A quick analysis of the match and why you think you won.
RICHARD GASQUET: I start bad.  I was not feeling confident on the court.  He was playing great.
I think the second set was really important for my confidence.  I start to return better, serve much better than the start of the match.  I did the third set.  Then the fourth set, I saved many breakpoint.  Then I did mine.
The difference, I finish 6-1.  It was a great match for me and a big victory.
Q. You had a couple tough matches in the first round and now tonight.  What kind of a factor is fatigue at this stage of the tournament?  Do you feel tired now?
RICHARD GASQUET: No, it's okay.  I'm feeling good.  It wasn't humid tonight, not so hot.  The court was really fast.  We didn't do many rallies.  Of course, I'm a little bit tired.  In two days I will be fresh, no problem.
