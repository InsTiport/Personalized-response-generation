R. GASQUET/A. Seppi
  6‑4, 6‑7, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How difficult was that match? 
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it was very tough because I could win in two sets.   I could win 6‑4, 6‑4.   I had two match points.   He played two big shots, and then he took a lot of confidence after that playing an incredible tiebreak. 
That's why it's starting to be difficult for me.   He broke me in my serve.   Yeah, he had the control of the match.   I think he did two bad games at 4‑2 and 4‑All.   That's why I could win that match.

Q.   How do you feel you're playing overall?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I'm feeling great to win.   The condition is difficult.   The ball is a little bit flying. 
The court was fast.   It's not the best condition for me, but I'm trying to do my best.

Q.   That beautiful backhand of yours, it was flowing a few times tonight. 
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I tried to play with that shot.   It's my best shot.   It's important I'm playing well with, and I could manage to play some good shots.

Q.   How is the back? 
RICHARD GASQUET:   A bit tired at the end of the game, but I think it's okay.   That's the most important.   I have to recover tomorrow.   I think I get no problem on Wednesday.

Q.   I understand you're facing Roberto Bautista Agut or Dominic Thiem next.   What would either player... 
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, both are very good player.   I lost against Bautista in Bercy.   He's a great player.   It will be tough for me to play against him.   I took confidence winning tonight, so everything is possible. 

Q.   You haven't lost to Andreas Seppi I believe since 2008.   Were you aware of that going in?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, of course, because he won Roger in Australia, played the final in Zagreb and semis in Doha.   I knew he was in confidence. 
It's never easy to play a guy who is in confidence.   It was the case tonight.   He played well, so I was a little bit scared playing against him.   We played 2:20, so it was a big match.
