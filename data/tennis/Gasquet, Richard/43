  6‑4, 4‑6, 3‑6, 6‑4, 11‑9 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   What do you think was the difference today between you and Stan?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Close match.   He could win that match.   I think the difference, yeah, he was leading me two sets to one, then I try to tell myself to fight better because I did a bad serve set.   I didn't want to lose in the fourth doing nothing.   
Of course, I had to fight because, Stan, he is one of the best player in the world.   I was leading 6‑4, 5‑3.   Then it was tough for me to lose that game because I could reach the semifinal after that.   It was very difficult for me to lose that serve at 5‑3 in the fifth.   
Then I kept fighting.   That made the difference because I was able to fight.   Even if I lost that game, he took a lot of confidence after that.   
Then I play a very good game at 10‑9 to finish the match.   I had a lot of emotion, a lot of feeling in that match.   It was my best victory for me.   
   
 Q.   You showed a lot of mental toughness.   You looked very confident.   Where did that stem from?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, of course, I tried to fight.   Even if I lost, as I said, this important game at 5‑3, I kept fighting a lot.   It was important because I know it's a great match.   Playing the winner of Roland Garros on quarterfinal in a Grand Slam.   So I need to keep focus, to stay focus, and to fight.   
Of course, it's a very nice victory for me to win against him 11‑9 in the fifth.   It's great.   
   
 Q.   Can you compare this match with your previous meeting with him in Roland Garros where you lost 8‑6?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   It was quite the same match, of course.   On his side, it was a tiny one, he won.   It's a revenge for me a little bit.   
But it was a tough match.   He's serving great.   He's a big fighter.   He's playing very, very good.   He has a lot of confidence.   
Of course, it's great to win, come back here in semis eight years later.   After 2007, it's a long time.  
   
 Q.   Can you say a little bit more about when you say it was an emotional victory?   Can you say why it was so particularly emotional?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Because there is a lot of things.   Because it's Stan, he won in Paris.   You know, I'm French.   I know what it means to win that tournament.   It's a quarterfinal in the biggest tournament in the world.   I won 11‑9.   I was leading 5‑3 in the fifth.   
I fight.   I fight a lot.   To win that match, it's very important to me.   
   
 Q.   Compared to 2007, in what way are you a different player and a different person now?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Older, for sure.   Eight years more.   I'm 29 now.   I was 21.   Yeah, I have more experience.   I know what it means to be in semis.   It's a long time I didn't do it.   
Of course, I'm proud because there are big players in semis.   I'm the worst when you see Federer, Djokovic and Murray and me (smiling).   There is something, I want to enjoy it.   
   
 Q.   What is the key for you on Friday to have chances against the world No.1?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, to play a big game, to be aggressive, try to be very aggressive.   I played him in Paris.   I tried to control the game.   Of course, he was playing much better than me.   I couldn't do many games in that match.   I don't remember exactly the score, but it was tough.   
So I want to enjoy it, to play a better match than I did in Paris.   It's important for me to think I can win this match.   That's the most important.   To go on the court and think you can win, it's something I need to do it on my mental part, to be there to win.   
   
 Q.   In the previous semifinals you played Federer, then Nadal, now Djokovic.   What can you say about Djokovic?   What will be your game plan?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Of course, it's incredible player to face in semis to be in Grand Slam final.   You need to win these guys in semis.   Of course, I'm there.   I want to enjoy that moment and to try to reach the final, of course.   
Novak is the favorite.   Everybody knows that.   But I want to take my chance and we will see what will happen.
