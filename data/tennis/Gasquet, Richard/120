 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Did you like the Davis Cup atmosphere or did you think the fans were a bit over the edge?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it was Davis Cup atmosphere. I played some matches in Davis Cup. It was the same, yes. It was a lot of people. It was very, very big match, yeah. 

 Q. How are you feeling at the moment? Take us through your emotions. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Really sad because, you know, I lost. I had match point. Bad luck with the backhand. 
 But I couldn't do better than I did so... That's tennis.

 Q. How does it rate with some of the five-set matches you've played?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I played some matches in five sets. But it was one of my best. It was a really big match. 
 But unfortunately, I lost it. 

 Q. Do you see any similarity with the game you had at Wimbledon with Andy Murray?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I played better today than there. I was physically better. I played the best match against him than Murray. 

 Q. There's a lot of strong French male players this year. Do you think one of your teammates has a chance to win?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah, I think. They are in the fourth round, so yeah. All three can win the tournament, yes.

 Q. Which one do you think is strongest?
 RICHARD GASQUET: They are playing the same game. They are all playing very good, so I really don't know. 

 Q. Were you hampered by your foot during the match?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I broke my nail. Not easy to play, yes. 

 Q. When you were leading two sets to love, were you confident you could finish it off then?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, but he fight a lot. You have to win three sets. He's a great player, so I knew it could be hard to finish the match. 
 But I try my best. 

 Q. Do you think you've hit many better shots than that passing shot to save a set point?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I played a big match. I'm really sad. But that's tennis. He played unbelievable. He fight a lot, so... It was a big atmosphere and a big match, yes.
