 THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.
 Q. You had never lost to Diego before this afternoon.  Is he a better player now than when you had played him previously?
 RICHARD GASQUET:   Of course he's much better.  He's No. 8 in the world or 9.  He did semis in Paris and final in Rome.  Yeah, me, when I was playing against him, I told you yesterday, I was top 10, top 15.  He was maybe 30, 40.  So he's another match, another opponent now.  It's three years later, two years later, so it's not the same at all.
 I try my best.  I know he has good rhythm, been really good from the baseline.  He didn't miss at all.  So he's playing fast.  He was a tough opponent for me.  It was very tough especially losing the first set but I try my best.  He was just better on the court.
 Q. Is this your last tournament of the season, or will you play Sofia?
 RICHARD GASQUET:   I will try to play next week.  Let's see if I'm entered in the draw, if I'm in the draw.  I won't go to the quallies but if I am in the draw, I think I will play.
 Q. How would you categorize your season overall this year?  Are you satisfied with your results?  Is there something you wish you could have done better?
 RICHARD GASQUET:   Well, I lost to big players.  Since US Open I lost to top 10, top 20.
 No, I try my best.  I'm not playing bad.  You know, I just need to be higher physically.  I need to be better with the rhythms, high intensity.  When you're facing these kind of guys, you need to get the highest intensity.  That's why I'm working on it.
