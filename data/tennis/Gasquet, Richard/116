   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Richard. 

 Q. How are you feeling?
 RICHARD GASQUET: A lot better. I had several MRIs. It's not hurting anymore. I get treated three or four times a day. I'm going to continue treatment during the whole week and I hope next week will be better. 

 Q. Monte-Carlo was too early for you?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, much too early. I hadn't practiced on clay yet. I had to stop for 10 days, so I had no choice. But now apparently it's a lot better. I have four tournaments to prepare for the French Open. It's good enough. 

 Q. When you say this tournament was 'too early,' isn't it good practice to play here without any pressure and without ambitions for the tournament? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: I prefer to play a tournament when I'm well-prepared. I know I have another four tournaments after this one. I'm not in a hurry, although I'm eager to play in tournaments. 
 But it's better to start properly instead of playing one or two matches. My shoulder is more important. 

 Q. But you have to practice. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes. But on clay you have to play against the Spaniards, the Argentines. 

 Q. Do you only have to rest or do you have a special treatment?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I have to do exercises, put ice. It seems better. 

 Q. When did you start hurting? Was it at the end of last year?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I was not able to play in Toulouse. I couldn't serve any more. That's when it started. And it was hurting in Australia. It's painful. I have to be very careful with my shoulder. 
 I'm coming now to the clay season having had sufficient rest. I believe I'm ready for Barcelona now. 

 Q. All this is very frustrating in the beginning of the season?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I played many matches since the beginning of the season, though, so it's okay. But it's frustrating because I wasn't able to play here in Monte-Carlo. 
 But I have four tournaments before the French Open, so I believe I can be in good shape by then. 

 Q. What is your schedule? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Barcelona, Rome, Madrid. 

 Q. In Australia you played an extraordinary match against GonzÃ¡lez. Do you believe you are paying the price for the efforts you made during such a long match?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, it started hurting there. That's when it really started. In Davis Cup it was painful, but I really wanted to play, so I forced it. 
 Now I feel better. I'm very positive for the future. I do a lot of physical training. It's good to have that kind of preparation before playing on clay, and this is what I'm doing. 

 Q. How do you feel when you play three, four times every day for practice?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I get laser treatment and I do more physical conditioning. It's been five, six days that I've been playing three or four times a day.

 Q. It's not an injury needing surgery?
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, not at all. I'm not worried about that. But I have to be careful, though. Shoulders are very fragile.

 Q. So now you're starting to feel better? Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is there. How can you explain all these injuries? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know how to explain them. 

 Q. What are your memories here in Monte-Carlo?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't have many.
