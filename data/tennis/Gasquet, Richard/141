   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  You looked to be possibly on your way to a victory there till the middle of the second set.  Can you give us an idea of what happened there? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I was playing good.  The key was my serve.  It was important to serve well against Rafa, because when you have to play with a second serve it's really hard because he has a lot of topspin, so it's hard for me with the backhand. 
 So I have to serve well and after to go to the net.  It was perfect.  I was winning 6-3.  It was a perfect game for me.  He wasn't playing incredible.  But I played a good -- my best tennis, so that was the key. 
 And after, he's a fighter, he fight a lot.  I missed some shots.  And when you miss some shots against him, the set is finished.  No, I had to play a perfect match to win him.  I did the perfect first set, and after I fight.  But I played incredible.  He has such a great forehand. 
 So, no, it was a good match.  I played a good tennis.  It was a good match. 

 Q.  There are three players in your group who for the first time come to Shanghai.  Novak has aims for the championship.  David has had good performances recently.  What's your expectations for your first Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I will try to win my first match because I lost one time.  If I lose my next match the Masters is over for me, so I have to win David or Novak.  But it will be hard.  They will be the favorite against me because I never won against them. 
 But I'm confident.  I played well today.  It was very close with Rafael.  I think I could win this match, no?  I have to work.  Next time I think I can win Rafael. 

 Q.  You really seemed to understand the geometry of his game in the first set in particular.  When he was pulling you wide on the forehand side you won several points with really formidable forehands that kind of caught him wrong-footed.  Was this a deliberate strategy that you had anticipated using or something that just happened? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  No, my strategy was to go to the net every time, to serve well, and serve to try to go to the net.  Because if you play at the baseline with him, with a lot of long shots, it's really hard.  Physically it's hard with him, so you have to serve well and to try to go to the net. 
 No, my serve was good.  I did a lot of aces.  I played well with my forehand.  So, no, it was -- my strategy was perfect.  But after you have to stay technically incredible, mentally.  So, no, he fight.  To win Rafael, you have to play a perfect match.  I did a perfect first set. 
 After it was a really good match.  But to win Rafael, it's hard. 

 Q.  Nadal has more fans here in China.  During the match you got a huge support.  Your support overwhelmed Nadal.  Did you expect this? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, of course I had a lot of fans on the match, but Nadal has more.  It's normal because he won three times Roland Garros, he's 2 in the world.  It's normal. 
 But, yeah, I was happy with the crowd.  The crowd was really nice with me.  So, no, I love this match because I did great shots.  I was playing good.  The crowd was nice with me.  No, I enjoyed the match, for sure. 

 Q.  You are the first one in five years to qualify in the Masters Cup for France.  We can say that the situation right now in France is not good, especially for the men's tennis.  How do you feel about that? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, we have a lot of players in top 100.  But, for sure, in top 10, top 20, it's not good.  There are a lot of young guys.  I'm sure in the future there will be three or four in the top 20. 
 We have to work a lot.  We will see.  But we are trying to play like the Spanish, Argentinian.  But, yeah, we are working.  We will see. 

 Q.  How did you feel walking in the stadium with all the smoke in the air and the lights out? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  It's great for me.  It's the Masters Cup.  It's incredible for me because I qualified last week in Paris.  No, I enjoyed the match for sure because I was playing against Rafael.  He's a great player.  I was playing in the Masters Cup.  A lot of people in the crowd.  The court was perfect.  The atmosphere, too. 
 I really enjoyed the match.  I hope I will win the next match. 

 Q.  What do you think about the punishment for betting, nine months without playing?  Do you think that's fair for the players? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Spanish tennis is incredible.  They are better than French guys now, yeah.  A lot of Spanish player won Roland Garros.  Ferrero, Moya, Nadal.  It's incredible for Spanish tennis.  We are working.  We are trying to play like them. 

 Q.  How do you feel about the player entrance ceremonies, just like the NBA.  How do you like that? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, it was incredible.  Yeah, the court was nice.  Everybody was nice with me.  The entrance was really funny.  With the lights, with everything. 
 So, no, I really enjoy the match.  It's an honor for me to play the Masters Cup.
