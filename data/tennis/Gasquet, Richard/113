R. GASQUET/P. Starace
  6-3, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. You were a semifinal last year here. How satisfying do you feel after last year to be back in the semis?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, for sure. The third time I am in semifinal in Sydney. I lost two times in semis, so I hope this year I will be able to go in the final. I will try my best. 
 But, yeah, for sure I'm coming back not so bad. It's good I won some matches, so I'm really happy with it.

 Q. Do you feel like your play is getting better? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Better and better, yeah. Not my best level because I didn't play a lot last year, but it's not bad. I think I'm playing good and I'm serving well, and the most important I am happy to play and to be there. 
 You know, even if I am losing, that's okay. I do my best, and I am on the court. 

 Q. You return the ball very well today. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I played a good tiebreak because he was playing great. I lost 4-1 after I did a lot of passing with my backhand and I served well, so it was a nice tiebreak. Very hard. I could go to a third set, and you never know what could happen in the third. 
 It's better to play, for sure. Not so hot and not windy. So nice condition. 

 Q. You seem pretty confident you'll to get back to where you were two years ago. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah, for sure I am really happy. 
 But as I said, I have less pressure than two years ago. I had so many things very hard to do last year, so now I play for fun. I try my best to win, and that's the most important for me. 

 Q. Do you feel like you've got a good opportunity to win this tournament? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Last year I had to play Nalbandian. It was very hard, so this year maybe my opponent will be not stronger than Nalbandian. 
 But I will try to win. You never know. There are good players, but for sure I will try and go in the final.

 Q. Give us your thoughts about the next match, Benneteau or Mayer. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: They're good players. Benneteau won Federer in Bercy. Mayer, I don't know him really well, but he's a good player. He's in quarterfinals, so, you know, it's a semifinal. Everybody can win everybody.
