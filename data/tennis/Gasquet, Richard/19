G. MONFILS/R. Gasquet   
7-6, 5-7, 4-3 [Ret.]   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  What is it now, frustration, disappointment, or fate?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Disappointed.  Nothing's ever written in stone.  I had had back problems for the past two, three weeks with a kind of neuralgia in the leg.  No sensation in the thigh.  Very painful, but my back is better.  I did my best for this neuralgia to disappear.  I think the nerve is probably still a bit irritated.   
I tried as much as I could, but towards the middle of the second set I understood it was going to be very hard.   
So disappointed, of course.  My back doesn't hurt so much, but in fact I simply couldn't go on any longer.   
 Q.  In a way, did you not also give up out of generosity for GaÃ«l so he wouldn't lose too much energy?  
RICHARD GASQUET: No, no.  GaÃ«l or anyone else, it would have been the same thing.  It's a tennis match.  It's just that I couldn't play.   
Of course he's a friend, but I couldn't play.  I had reached the end of my tether.  It was too painful to go on, GaÃ«l or anyone else.   
 Q.  GaÃ«l didn't really look in top form on the court.  Do you think you could have gone further?  
RICHARD GASQUET: No, my opponent was the way he was, but it was just me.  I just couldn't go any further.   
If I saw that he's not necessarily on top form himself, but I simply couldn't do anything at all.  I'm going to get an MRI.  My back's better.  I think it's not as serious as what it was before, but this area there is affected and I really can't push my thigh anymore.   
 Q.  How did you feel yesterday?  
RICHARD GASQUET: First set, not great.  I'm trying to put it out of my mind.  7-6, then I ran two, three times.  The pain was just getting more and more intense.   
 Q.  You have had quite a few physical issues over the past years.  Is it just bad luck?  Are you going to change something?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I even had appendicitis and almost with severe infection.  No surprises.  I felt great in Australia, I felt great in February, and, yes, it was a stroke of bad luck, because I do all my best to feel better every day.  But there, definitely bad luck.   
 Q.  GaÃ«l is going to be facing Stan.  You had a big fight on Suzanne Lenglen against Stan a few years back.  What tips would you give him?  
RICHARD GASQUET: GaÃ«l knows Stan very well, too.  GaÃ«l is at Roland Garros, and Stan is very difficult to beat.  But I think he can win.  I believe it for him.   
Then it's true he is not necessarily at his best, but Roland Garros is always difficult, whatever the situation.  It's going to be a big match.   
 Q.  What do you think the key is for this match?  
RICHARD GASQUET: We know what GaÃ«l is like.  He just needs to be in top form.  He needs to play hard.  He needs to play long.   
Stan hits very hard and very well from both sides.  He's hugely powerful.  That needs to be kept in check.   
But it's obviously going to be a super match.   
 Q.  There was this game against Wawrinka that we all remember with a fantastic battle of the backhands, of single-handed backhands.  How would you judge Wawrinka's backhand?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Incredible backhand.  It's true that he has amazing power.  He's very muscular, very strong, and when he's at his best, it's truly impressive.   
He won three Grand Slam tournaments, and he played incredibly well each time.  He's just pure force.   
 Q.  The technical differences between your backhand and his?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Maybe a little bit more spin in mine, but his was very powerful.
