THE MODERATOR:  Questions. 


Q.  Well done. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Thank you.  Thank you. 

Q.  Is it as good to win your second Grand Slam as it was to win your first?  When you won in France, it was great.  Was it different winning here? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah.  I am very, very happy to win a second Grand Slam because I had a lot of pressure with me at the beginning of the tournament.  Because if I won here, I could be No. 1, and I won another Grand Slam. 

Q.  Which is more special: Being No. 1, or winning another Grand Slam? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  No, winning another Grand Slam, because I don't play all in junior tournament. 

Q.  The first set, he was ahead and he seemed to get a bit nervous at 5-3. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, he was a little bit nervous.  But I was too tired because yesterday I had a difficult match. 

Q.  So you were tired at the start, so you started slowly? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, yeah, I was very tired.
