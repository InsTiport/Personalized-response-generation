   THE MODERATOR:  Questions.   
  
  Q.  What did you think about your first game?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I played really good today.  It was a great match because Volandri is a great player.  He's 30th in the world, so he's a great player.   
 I did three sets, I won in three, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.  I am happy to win my first match in Australian Open.
