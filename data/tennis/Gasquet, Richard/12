R. NADAL/R. Gasquet
6-3, 6-2, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions in English.
Q. You played him so many times.  Did you think of trying something maybe different today, or...
RICHARD GASQUET: No, I tried to play my game, you know.  It's not easy to do, to find another game.  I tried my best.  I tried to serve well, but I think it's tough for me, because my best stroke is the backhand.  With him, I'm going on his forehand.  And on the diagonal, he's just better than me.  That is a big key for me.  That's why it's very difficult for me to play against his game.
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. Beyond your loss, which is logical, don't you think the score is a bit severe?  If we think of the game balls you had.
RICHARD GASQUET: There may have been many game balls.  I don't know.  I haven't played at that level for a long time.  This has nothing to do with anyone else, especially on the center court.  Lots of rebound.  The court was slippery.  Against one of the best players in the world who is left-handed.  It's very atypical to play against him.
His forehand comes out very strongly.  I started badly.  I didn't have many focal points on the court.  0-30, I could have maybe gotten in this game.
But whatever.  He was stronger than I was.
Q. Can you tell me about this feeling when you're in your diagonal against his forehand you think once again I'm in it?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, you can see it.  You see the quality of his ball.  He strikes strongly.  Deep ball.  When he plays on his backhand, he has an intensity which is monstrous.  You know it, you have to hold on for all points.  But I really have trouble with his forehand that comes to my shoulder every time.
It's not easy for me, for my game, and it's what hurts me against him, because 90% of players I can control this diagonal, and with him it's complicated.
Then it's the center court.  There was a lot of rebound, very high rebound today, so with his quality of ball, it wasn't easy.
Q. You said the court was slippery.  Why was it slippery?  Is it different from previous years?
RICHARD GASQUET: No, no.  The weather is good.  The court is very good, but it's clay.  It's slippery, and it was very hot on the court.  The conditions were fast, quick, but the court was good.
Q. You talked about the complicated start of the match.  Was it your feelings?  You didn't feel the ball?  What was it?
RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know.  No, it's different.  He has a different game.  It's difficult to practice with players who play like him.  You know, between right-handed and left handed, it took me time to get into the match.  He won't give you a point when he gets ahead of you.  You know it's going to be very complex.
But the quality of his forehand hurts.  But it's no surprise to anyone.  But that's it.  It's an incredible strength every time he strikes a forehand.
Q. Some kind of euphoria at the end of the first set.  Did you think, I have to serve on this, I have to start the second set properly?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, it hurt me when I was Love-30 on his serve.  He had double fault.  I was getting better, but I didn't manage to get that game, and it was a pity for the rest of the match.
But overall, for the match, he is stronger.  He has a lot of assets.  His average ball is very strong.  He takes an advantage with this point, and then I missed a lot of game balls.  Once he's ahead, it becomes impossible.
Q. For this last match, okay, but how do you come out of this Roland Garros?  You hurt yourself earlier?
RICHARD GASQUET: Like in Australia, I wasn't very successful playing Federer over there and Nadal here.  Same thing.  I managed to get to the third round, but then I have to play the best players in history.
So it becomes quite complicated that as soon as I'm in front of Federer or Nadal, it's very strong, very difficult.
I tried to win these two matches.  The public was behind me.  Today it was fabulous.  I tried to do my best on each point and to fight till the end, but he was simply stronger than I was.
Q. Is it disappointment, frustration, feeling powerless?
RICHARD GASQUET: None of the three, really.  I'm disappointed to lose, but you always want to do better, but I'm not frustrated.  I'm disappointed, obviously.
But I don't feel powerless.  I will start practicing again.  I know he's the most difficult player for me because of his style of play.
And then I'm not injured.  I have had more difficult moments.  It's always great to play in Roland Garros.  I hope to be able to continue for a few years.
Q. Can you tell me about your program before Wimbledon, and do you appreciate grass?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes.  I was twice in the semifinals in Wimbledon, so I like that surface.  I'm going to play a tournament before, so no problem.  The important thing is to always be motivated to continue.
