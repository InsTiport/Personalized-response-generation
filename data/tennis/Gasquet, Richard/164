THE MODERATOR:  We'll start with some English questions.  
 
 
Q.  You ran out of steam at the end a little.  You played many matches in the last three months. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I played a lot in the last one month because I played Queen's, I won Nottingham.  Yeah, I was too tired in the third set.  It was too difficult for me.  So he played a very good match.  I can win the second set, the first.  And after, was too difficult with all my matches I played, so I couldn't play more.  
 
Q.  I think you said you saw a little of his match against Murray.  Did you feel from what you saw that maybe you could do better than Murray in this match?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No.  Each match is never the same match.  He can play better against me than Murray.  No, every match is not the same.  It's never the same match.
