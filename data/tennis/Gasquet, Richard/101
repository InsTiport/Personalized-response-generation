 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You made good starts in both sets but couldn't really capitalize.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, because I think something that very difficult against him, is I was not following through with my serve. He's the best -- he returns incredible, that's for sure.   
 So to make some points with myself are really difficult. That's why he broke me a lot of times.   
 That's a big weapon for me, the serve, and I couldn't do points with it. He played really good, yeah. He played solid. For sure was the more difficult for me was his return, because he's always on the ball, never missing, so...   
 That's all.  
  
  Q. It's not about today's match, but you came to Japan almost every year. I think you have some idea about what's happening in Japan now. Could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on Japan?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Like everybody, it's terrible. What do you want to say more than that? Yeah, I went all the time there. The people were really kind. That's terrible. I have nothing else to say.   
 I hope everything will be better in the future. Here we are lucky; we play tennis, you know. It's a great life. But we are thinking to the country, to Japan.  
  
  Q. Can you assess this tournament for you? You know, there are a couple of top 10 players you disposed of, and...   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I played really good. I'm really happy with it. I took a lot of confidence. I won two top 10 in a row, so I'm feeling good, especially today. I played good. I played not bad. He played maybe a little bit -- he played better than me.   
 I did my best, so I think for sure for Miami I'm playing better now than two weeks ago. I'm coming into the top 20 maybe, so I'm feeling good.  
  
  Q. What's different playing Djokovic than playing Roger or Rafa? What makes him different?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: All three players are incredible, for sure. But his return for me -- Djokovic has the best return. Compared to Rafa and Roger, he has the best return.  
 But after, they are all -- they can win everybody. Djokovic can beat Nadal and Federer; Federer can beat Rafa and Djoko. Maybe Novak has confidence right now, but for sure against Roger, if he has to play against him in semifinal, it will be always a tough match.   
 For me, the return of Novak is incredible.   
  
  Q. Do you see a difference in Novak this season?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I see him feeling confident. That is what I am seeing, because he won Davis Cup. He took a lot of confidence there, and after Australian Open.   
 So, yeah, we see a confident player. That's why he's playing really good right now. But after, he can do everything on the court.
