T. BERDYCH/R. Gasquet
  6-2, 6-0

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French for Richard. 

 Q. You had nothing to lose? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: He's an excellent player. He plays in the top 10. I never found my game. 
 He played incredibly well. It was an easy match for him. In fact, I lacked stamina, so it was easy for him. 

 Q. Are you disappointed? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes. I lost. So I lost. I will recover. 

 Q. You're now playing doubles?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, with Jo. We'll try to play good doubles. 

 Q. What is your schedule now? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Barcelona and Tunis. In Tunis, the players are not so strong, so I'll try to get some wins.
