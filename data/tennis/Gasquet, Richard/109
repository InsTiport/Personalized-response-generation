  6-3, 6-3 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. You looked very comfortable out there. Did you feel very comfortable?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah, it was a good match. I have great sensation and great feelings on the grass court even if I didn't play here last year. Two years ago I didn't play, but I like to play on this court, for sure.  
 He's a great opponent, so I am happy to win 6-3, 6-3. It's a good match for me.  
  
  Q. Have you been training on grass between the first round of the French and here?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: A little bit in France, in Paris. There is a court.  
  
  Q. One?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, three, three, since last year. Two years ago we went to England and Bercy, in Paris. There is a grass court. But this year there are courts in grass in Paris. It's nice to play.  
  
  Q. What do you have to do to change, to make that change from clay to grass?
