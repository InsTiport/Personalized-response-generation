THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Did you win that match, or did he lose it?

RICHARD GASQUET:  You're starting strong (smiling). Why are you asking that?  For sure he played one bad game, but I was the one that won the match.  Maybe he wasn't having a very good day, but I really won that match.


Q.  What happened at 3-Love?

RICHARD GASQUET:  I was tired.  I played many matches recently.  I was not lucky because I had many breakpoints.  I had breakpoints, I could have won that first set, but that's the way it is.  At least I played well during the second and the third, and the result is there.


Q.  You played very good backhands.

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, this is my strongest shot.  When I play well, that's where I am the most efficient.  You don't always play your best tennis, which was my case today, but at least I won.


Q.  You won four games to win the second set 7-5.

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I knew he was frustrated that he lost the second set.  I tried to start very well the third set.  Of course I was broken back at 2-1, I played a bad game, but I was able to break him again at 3-2.  He started making mistakes, and I tried not to miss.


Q.  Did you feel the support of the crowd?

RICHARD GASQUET:  It is clear that when a player fights a lot the crowd is behind him.  I was very pleased with that.


Q.  Between the challengers and this tournament, how do you feel physically now?

RICHARD GASQUET:  I feel tired.  I also was sick recently.  The first three tournaments went well.  Now I am tired. But the quarterfinals are coming up, and it will be a great match.


Q.  It might be against Federer.

RICHARD GASQUET:  I have a lot of respect for him.  He's my model, and on top of it he's a very nice guy. But even if I respect him, I'll still try to play a very good match.  He's one of the only players I didn't practice with yet.  This might seem pretentious, but I will try to win - at least I will try my best.


Q.  The fact that you admire him, will it disturb you?

RICHARD GASQUET:  It's true I admire him, but during the match I will have to forget about it.  I will do like I did against Safin three years ago.


Q.  You will have to serve more first serves.

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, but I was tired today, and tomorrow the only thing that can happen is that I will serve better.


Q.  Since that great match against Safin three years ago, did you mature a lot?

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I matured a lot, and I'm ready for Federer.


Q.  Was today's match your best victory?

RICHARD GASQUET:  No, it's one great victory among several great matches in my career.  It's part of it.


Q.  Against Federer, there's no tactics?

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, there is.  He's like every other player.  Of course he has very few weaknesses, but there is always a shot you can choose to play.


Q.  If he has weaknesses, what are they?

RICHARD GASQUET:  Well, he has a very good forehand and he comes to the net very well, so this is the type of thing you need to avoid.  He's very strong everywhere, but you have to prevent him from dictating the point with his forehand.


Q.  You felt tired today?

RICHARD GASQUET:  I didn't serve well.


Q.  Would you say this is your worst match in a while?

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes.  I can play better than I did today.  The greatest victories are those where you don't play your best tennis.  It's pretty rare that it happens to me, and that's why I'm happy for this victory.


Q.  He was serving for the match and you broke him.

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes.  I was feeling confident.  It happens often to me, I'm down 6-5, 5-3, and I win.


Q.  But did it happen to you against a player who has such a good ranking?

RICHARD GASQUET:  No.  That's why I'm happy to be here and that I won this Round of 16.


Q.  Did you suffer from the heat?

RICHARD GASQUET:  No, it's not really hot here.  It's not like Australia or America.


Q.  You played a lot of dropshots.

RICHARD GASQUET:  I wanted to bring him forward because he is very strong when he plays from the baseline, forehand and backhand.
