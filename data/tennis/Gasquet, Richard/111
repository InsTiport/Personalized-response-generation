M. BAGHDATIS/R. Gasquet
  6-4, 7-6

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Was that good buildup for the Australian Open, a good week?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I prefer to win this tournament. You know, it's always a title, so it's important. 
 But I did final. I lost to Marcos, a great player. For sure I feel confident for Australian Open, even if I have tough draw.
 But I'm ready, yeah. I'm disappointed, because it's always difficult to lose a final.

 Q. What didn't work for you in the last set there?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know. The first set he played better than me from the baseline. I was a little bit too far from the baseline. 
 After, in the second set, I was leading 5-2; 5-3 I served a bad game, and I had a big trouble in the tiebreak. I lost a lot of free points, so that made the difference, yeah. 
 But he played well and played a good game.

 Q. What was going through your head in the tiebreak? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know what happened. I'm not Federer, maybe. But for sure I played a bad game. Really bad choice. Next time. 

 Q. Is the support that Marcos gets a bit distracting or good fun? How do you see it?
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, I know he has a lot of Cyprus fans here, so that's not a big problem for me. You're used to when you play in Davis Cup or everything, so that's okay.
 I really don't care. He just played better than me. Even if I was really close in the second, I couldn't win it.
