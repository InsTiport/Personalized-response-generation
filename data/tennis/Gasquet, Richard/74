  7‑6, 5‑7, 7‑5, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Where did you feel that went wrong for you?   
RICHARD GASQUET:   No, I think it was a very tough match.   I think he played very good, especially in both tiebreak.   He played very clever game.   He serve incredible during all the match.   
So I think it was the key of the match.   He serve very good.   I couldn't break him so much.   But he didn't break me too much, too.   So it was a big match.   
I tried my best to perform and to win.   But, as I said, he played just a little bit better than me.  
   
 Q.   Entertaining match for the crowd.   Could you feel them enjoying it?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it was a very nice match, a lot of nice rallies.   It was a big match.   I think I play my game.   I try my best.   
He just serve very good.   I'm not solid in the tiebreaks, and that's why he win.   I think he deserve this win.   He play very good.   Congratulations to him.   
   
 Q.   Did you hear the noise coming from Court 2?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I realize, but for one second after I need to serve.   It was 5‑4 for him, so...   I didn't care so much.   
   
 Q.   It didn't unsettle you in any way?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   No, no.   I didn't care at all.   I'm happy for her if she won.   It's very nice.   
   
 Q.   You had four tiebreaks in the tournament.   You lost them all.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   I don't know.   There is no reason.   Sometimes I'm winning; sometimes I'm losing.   No big reasons.   I think all the tiebreaks the guys play well.   I try my best to win them, but I couldn't.   
That's not a real reason for that.
