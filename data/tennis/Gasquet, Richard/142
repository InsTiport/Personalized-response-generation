   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  You were practicing earlier this morning.  What happened? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I tried to practice, but I couldn't play.  I get fever yesterday night.  I had a big problem, I get fever.  I can't play in three sets in my match today.  It's impossible for me. 
 I am really, really disappointed because it's an important tournament for me.  I can't.  It's impossible.  I did my best.  I practice this morning, but...  I did my best.  Nothing is possible for me. 

 Q.  When did it start coming on? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Maybe two days ago.  I knew I had two days to recover.  But yesterday it was worst than two days ago, and this morning it was the same than yesterday. 
 So it's impossible to play a tennis game in three sets.  I can't.  I really can't play this match. 

 Q.  Why can't you play?  It's not your legs or your shoulder, your arm.  What is so difficult about playing? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  When you have a fever, when you have a problem with angina (sic), you can't go to the court.  I'm sure you understand. 

 Q.  If you were sick, why did you play at all?  Why did you even consider playing at all? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Because I wasn't sick, of course. 

 Q.  What would you consider your chances to be to win here, the whole thing? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  With my illness, I'm sure I can't win this match. 

 Q.  No, no.  Before the tournament, what did you think your chances were? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I'm sure I could be in the second week because I'm seeded.  The fourth round was my goal.  But I had bad luck with my illness. 

 Q.  Did you think maybe to give it a shot, maybe in a few days you'd get better, go out, maybe retire in the match? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I don't want to retire of the match.  I know I don't have chances to play my best tennis, to play a tennis game, so I really don't want to stop the match.
