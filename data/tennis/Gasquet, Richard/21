THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It was the latest start to a slam match.  Did it bother you at all?
RICHARD GASQUET: It's always difficult to play that late.  But it can happen.  The match were very long.  That's tennis.  It's the same for both players.  It was okay.  Especially, of course, it's never easy to play at 12.  That's the same for both players.  No excuse about it.
Q. In the past you've had the better of him.  What was different about his game tonight?
RICHARD GASQUET: Big confidence.  He won in Brisbane, winning big players.  He's playing very good.  Especially the court is tough for me.  It was very fast.  The balls weren't heavy.  The toughest condition for me, the best for him.  It made the difference.  He play well.  I have not so many chances against him today.
