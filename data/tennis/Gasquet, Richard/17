R. GASQUET/M. Zverev   
6-2, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.   
 Q.  It's a good victory.  What did you feel today?  
RICHARD GASQUET: I'm very happy I won that match.  I was a favorite.  But he played extremely well.  At 6-2, 3-2, I had a bad period.  He started playing very well.  I had to save some breakpoints.  It was becoming very difficult, and rallies were long.  I really needed to fight back to be able to win the match.   
It was very important for me to win it.   
 Q.  The 500th victory.  
RICHARD GASQUET: Of course I'm happy I did it here rather than in Budapest.  I was happy to do it.  There are very few players who have achieved this.  I don't know exactly how many.   
I certainly am among the worst of players, among the 50 players who achieved that.  But I'm happy I did it in Monte-Carlo 16 years after my first victory.   
Well, you know, it was a long time ago.  But I'm happy I did it here because I've been a long time on the tour.   
 Q.  Do you have the feeling it was a long time ago?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, it was a long time ago.  Time went by pretty quickly.  At the same time it was long.  I'm going to enjoy the last seasons I can play on the tour.  I'm happy to be back in the quarterfinals here and to be able to win matches and be fit.  I'm lucky I can play tomorrow again.   
500 match wins, doing it this year, it's great.   
 Q.  Do you feel physically you're getting better?  
RICHARD GASQUET: It's getting better.  The opponents are playing well.  I feel better.  I changed my racquet.  It was a good thing.  I need to play many matches.  I've been able to do that since last week.  This is the only way I can get back to my best level.   
 Q.  Mentally you were injured pretty often.  Was it pretty difficult to manage that?  
RICHARD GASQUET: It's extremely difficult.  That's the most difficult part.  I didn't have very serious injuries, but I had to stop several times, and it's extremely difficult to get back.  You need a lot of time and effort.   
The main thing for me is now to remain healthy because it is depressing for me when I have to make a comeback.  It's too difficult.  I really hope I'll stay healthy for the rest of the season.  This is the only way you can expect to win good matches.   
 Q.  So how can you find your motivation to come back?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, I remember those competitions I played.  I know I was able to win and play well.  I want to feel the pleasure to play well again, especially like here in front of a good crowd.  I'm hoping I will be able to do that again.   
It's getting better.  I was happy the way I played today.
