THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. Can you tell us how you're feeling and what the problem is?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I have back problem. I felt it yesterday playing against Ramos at the end of the match. This morning I tried to warm up, it was okay. Then during my match, I felt something wrong and I couldn't move after that.   
   
 Q. Did they tell you what it was specifically?  
RICHARD GASQUET: No, nobody knows for the moment, of course.   
   
 Q. More tests to come?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, more tests to come.   
   
 Q. Does it feel bad that you feel it might affect Davis Cup?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Of course, I think it will affect Davis Cup. But for the moment I'm here in Wimbledon and I'm sad 'cause I couldn't finish the match.   
   
 Q. What concerns did you have that you would do more damage to yourself by competing today?  
RICHARD GASQUET: I don't think so. We will see tomorrow maybe.   
But for the moment, I don't know.
