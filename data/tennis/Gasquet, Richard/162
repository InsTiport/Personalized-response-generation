THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English. 


Q.  Just your thoughts on the match and dealing with the heat? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  The heat was good, better than the last day, no?  I didn't suffer about the weather.  I played a good match today.  I start very good.  I didn't lose myself today.  I think it was the key because the court is very fast.  I played the wonderful strokes in the tiebreak.  I played very, very good today because Youzhny, it's a great player. 

Q.  In the last 12 months, what has changed? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  (Through translation.)  He's been practicing very, very hard for six, seven months.  His victory against Roger Federer in Monte-Carlo really was the key moment. 

Q.  Playing in Montreal, in front of French Canadian fans, I know the building was only one-third full, but it seems they embraced him and his game very much. 

RICHARD GASQUET:   No, it was very good because I played on Centre Court.  It's special for me to play on the Centre Court for a first round.  There were a lot of crowd today for me.  No, it was really good.  I can speak French here.  It's better for me (smiling). 

Q.  I understand in a Masters tournament, every match is going to be difficult.  On paper it looks that you have an especially difficult draw, particularly Grosjean, Nadal in the third round. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  No, it's really difficult.  If I win Grosjean, Nadal, it will be wonderful for me.  But it's a very, very difficult draw for me, yeah.  In Hamburg, in Monte-Carlo, it was better for me, for the first and second round.  Now it's difficult.  We will see.  I am happy to win this match today against Youzhny.
