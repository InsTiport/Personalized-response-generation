   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  Your thoughts on the US Open, the atmosphere here? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I like all Grand Slam.  I think it's the best -- I prefer to play in Roland Garros, for sure, but that's the best Grand Slam. 
 Everything is nice here, the locker rooms.  Everything is okay for me.  I like to play in New York.  So it's the best Grand Slam for me.  They did a lot of efforts for the tournament.  For sure I like to play in this tournament, yeah. 

 Q.  Are you happy with the way you're playing? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I feel good.  It's a Grand Slam.  It's always different for me.  I like to play this tournament, like all the Grand Slam.  I like.  So that's okay for me. 
 I have no blisters now.  I feel physically great.  I am in a great shape to play my second round. 

 Q.  What do you know about your next opponent? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  He progress incredible.  I saw him last year.  This year, he's not the same guy for sure.  Last year he was really young.  This year he's young too, for sure, but he plays really, really good.  I think he will be in three or four years in the top 10 for sure. 
 If he's patient, he will be great for sure.  He plays like a little Rios.  He has the same game like him.  No, he has a lot of talent.  It's great for American tennis.
