THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Richard Gasquet. 


Q.  You said you preferred to play Costa.  Are you comfortable now with the clay court specialists rather than players like Davydenko? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I kind of like the Spanish players.  But if I have to play Davydenko, I'll also try to win. 

Q.  Do you remember this incredible first set against Costa, then there was a rain delay and it was an entirely different match? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, it was a big match for me.  After that, he won the tournament and I was the only one to steal a set from him. 

Q.  Today at 5-4, 40-Love, did you take it too easily?  He seemed to give you a dark look. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I tried to play an ace on my second serve and that was stupid.  I also missed my dropshot.  It was a stupid game.  But I was able to break back immediately although I was down 30-Love.  By myself I was able to win that point at 40-Love. 

Q.  And then at 6-5 there was a very long rally.  Then you made two dropshots. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, because I was tired and I wanted him to run.

Q.  You now have the ability to react.  How did you work on that? 

RICHARD GASQUET:  I try not to get nervous, and the reason why I won that match today is because I was able to break back at that particular moment. 

Q.  There's a risk that you will be the only French player left in the draw tonight. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  I hope not, because Santoro will certainly win his match; he has a chance.  Cyril is in a difficult situation, though. 

Q.  It's the first time you are reaching the third round in a Masters Series. 

RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I know now that I can go far in those tournaments.  I have the level to win matches.
