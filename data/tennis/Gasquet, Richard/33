R. GASQUET/T. Bellucci   
6-1, 6-3, 6-4   
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.   
 Q.  Three sets for the first round.  How does it feel?  
RICHARD GASQUET: I'm quite satisfied.  I knew it was going to be a rough first round, and I have done other tournaments where the draw is better.  This one was not good for me.  He could have won.  I'm very glad I made it.   
I knew it could have been a very long match, as well.  There have been other long matches today, with the rain.  So finishing in three sets is a good thing for me.   
Last set, 5-4, if it had gone differently, I would have had to come back tomorrow.  I'm glad we didn't.   
 Q.  6-4 in the third set.  That was a challenging one.  How did it feel?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, Bellucci is a great player.  I have had tough, tough matches before.  He's a hard hitter, and he has very fast balls.  When he plays Djokovic, he plays very well, every single time, so I knew it would be tough.  Winning this evening in three sets has made me very happy.   
 Q.  How about the draw?  It's not easy.  You've made it through the first round, but there are some rough ones ahead.  
RICHARD GASQUET: All matches are difficult.  Look at Murray.  It's been rough.   
Round 3, round 4 are typically the most difficult ones.  I'll take it step by step and we'll see.   
 Q.  We always hear that it's difficult to stop a match because of the weather or the night.  How does impact you?  Do you find it disturbing?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, I'm happy to have a day off tomorrow.  It was very close.  5-3, you know, at 5-4, I had a match point.  He did one great point at that point.  I was really happy to wrap up the match.  You know, if not, you know, we would have been back tomorrow morning, which means you have to warm up again.  Then it can put you into trouble.   
I'm very happy to have the day off tomorrow.   
 Q.  Generally speaking, what state of mind are you in?  How do you feel physically?  
RICHARD GASQUET: Physically I'm okay.  I'm actually feeling better and better.  It took me a long time to come back.  Physically it's not easy.   
You know, I have had some injuries at the beginning of the season, and it's not easy to get back into the groove.  But Madrid was okay.  You know, at Roland Garros, when you're here, I want to play my very best.   
I haven't won tons of matches so far.  I haven't lost that many.  I know that physically I'm good.  I think that's good news.
