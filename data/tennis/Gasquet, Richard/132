 THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You started off well. Was it the lack of preparation? Were you surprised?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: I had several breakpoints. And if I could have won them, I might have been able to pull it out. During the third set, I felt tired. At 4-3, I felt my legs being very heavy. I felt tired.   
 The pain in the back and the lack of preparation didn't help me. But if I had made those breakpoints, maybe I would have won.   
  
  Q. What about your back?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: It bothers me when I play. But this is not the reason why I lost. I stayed late last night and I didn't have the ideal preparation for that match.   
  
  Q. At the end of the second set, what did you do wrong?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I think I lacked some matches and I was tired. But losing those breakpoints hurt me a lot.   
  
  Q. There were positive parts of the game. Is there something positive to take out of it?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: It's always difficult to see positively when you just lost. If I had had an extra week of preparation, I might not have lost that match.   
 But he served well. Also I didn't have enough freshness and my legs were too heavy. But this is tennis.   
  
  Q. He's a complicated player to play against?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Well, he gives you no rhythm, and he serves very well. Now I'm going to try to prepare for the other tournaments.   
  
  Q. Are you going to Munich?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: No. I'm going to have some rest because I came in late and I had physical problems so I need rest and I need to stay out of tennis for a couple of days.   
  
  Q. Are you taking a lot of medication?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: A lot of antiinflammatories. It bothers me, but it didn't prevent me from playing today. I think I panicked at the end of the match. But I tried to stay there until the end. I'll do better next time.   
  
  Q. Those breakpoints affected you?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I should have also missed less. Maybe if I had had more energy, I would have been able to miss less.   
 But now I must think about something else.   
  
  Q. Compared to yesterday, what didn't you do as well?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: It was difficult to go backwards because the court is smaller than center court, so this was not ideal. Also I was dominating the game during the first two sets. I must say, he was a bit lucky. Sometimes you lose a match and it's quite difficult to explain the reason.
