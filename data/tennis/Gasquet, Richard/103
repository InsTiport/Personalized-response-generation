  5-7, 6-2, 6-4 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Congratulations on your win.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Thank you.  
  
  Q. He really dragged you in the last set, kept you on court a long time.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: With Gilles I know if I win against him, it's already difficult because he's putting all the balls in the court very fast. So you have to run a lot and to put a lot of balls in the court to win him.  
 So it's always difficult to win against Gilles. No, I'm happy because I played a good match.   
  
  Q. In last 12 months, where do you see yourself? Do you think you're growing well?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I'm playing good. I'm not playing in the top 10 for sure, but I'm playing -- yeah, when I'm playing good, I'm top 20 for sure.  
  
  Q. So the last six month you felt like it was getting better and better?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I'm playing better and better, but I have to be consistent, to be healthy. That's the most important.   
 But today it was a good match, yeah.   
  
  Q. You said that sometimes you get a bit frustrated with yourself. When you lost the first set, though, you didn't. You seemingly had a confidence that you could turn it around.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it's very, very important to do it, to be not frustrated. Especially in the third set to finish the match I was very tense. I had to serve to close the match.  
 No, I were losing 15-40, so it was really tough for me. But I served well and I went to the net, and it was a good choice.   
  
  Q. That backhand was quite a weapon at certain points. You must have an awful lot of confidence from that shot.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it's always my best shot. I have to be good with it and with my serve. It's my two best shots, so when I win -- all the time when I am winning a match, it's with these two shots.  
  
  Q. Roger up next, a player who you've given difficulty to in the past. I presume coming off a win like that you must be confident of doing so again.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, but I know I have to play my game, not to try to play too good. When I play him in Bercy last year, I wanted to play very good, to play all the lines, and I did a lot of mistakes.  
 So I just have to try to play my game. For sure he's the favorite of the match.  
  
  Q. How is the fitness going? I think we saw like the gap between and you Gilles, we saw it growing throughout the three sets.  
 RICHARD GASQUET: It's very important to have a good fitness, especially in the tennis today. Everybody has a big fitness, especially in the top 5; they are the best.   
 So Gilles too has good fitness. Today I did it. No, I run a lot, and it was a tough match. For sure, in a tennis match, fitness is very important.
