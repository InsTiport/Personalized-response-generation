 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. What happened out there today? Just a bad day?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Nothing happened today. I played my worst match maybe of the year. Nothing happened on the court. I was lost.  
  
  Q. So no explanation, just you were feeling fine and just didn't have it today?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I was feeling good last week. It was not incredible at practice, but it was okay.   
 I didn't expect this match, for sure. I have now to forget it.   
  
  Q. You look as though you are maybe not enjoying tennis at this moment; is that right?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, for sure. When you're playing a match like that it was really, really difficult on the court.   
  
  Q. But did you feel good beforehand?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes. Not really good, but good. Didn't expect this match, for sure.   
  
  Q. So what are your plans now?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Doubles and I'm home next week.   
  
  Q. (In Italian.) You said were you feeling a bit lost. Is it lack of stimuli? What was missing?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: After I start losing the first set I lost all my confidence and I was really lost on the court. It was difficult for me to play.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised by the level?   
 RICHARD GASQUET; I knew he could play this game, but everybody could win me for sure today. Even everybody in the draw. But he's a good player, for sure.   
  
  Q. Is it tough sometimes being the first match of the tournament on center court, and a new court?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, but when you're playing like that you can't win a match. I don't know if it's -- it was my first match. No, it's not this problem. . For sure it's not this problem.   
  
  Q. What do you think you need to do to rediscover your form?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: To play matches, to win some matches, for sure. To win and to enjoy on the court. To play well and win matches, like everybody.
