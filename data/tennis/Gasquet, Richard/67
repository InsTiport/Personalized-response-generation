 J. DEL POTRO/R. Gasquet
  6‑7, 6‑3, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Where do you think the match changed for you?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, because I think it's Del Potro.   He's one of the best players I know.   I tried to fight as much as I could.   And I, yeah, played well.   It was a great match for me.   I think I was really close to win that match.   
As I said, I tried my best.   He did very good, too.   It was a long match.   Very tiring for me.   I think he was just a little bit better than me.   
   
 Q.   Does your performance tonight give you confidence for the two more matches?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I think I took a little confidence after this match.   Of course, I'm a little bit disappointed because I could win that match.   I was really close to win.   
It was important for me to win the first match.   Now I need to play two big players again, so it's very difficult.   Masters Cup, the level is very high.   So every match is a final for me.   
Tonight I play well.   I was really close.   I hope I will play good in the next two matches.   
   
 Q.   How is the energy out there?   
RICHARD GASQUET:   It's a big stadium.   You need to play well.   You know, it's a big event for me.   You know, it's very big.   The stadium is full.   You are playing one of the best player in the world every day.   So I need to play well.   
I want to perform here.   Tonight I did it.   I was really close to win.   Of course, it's disappointing for me because I think I could.   But, as I said, I try my best, and I will do the same for the two matches, even if I know is very difficult to play all these guys.   I think I'm able to play good matches.   
   
 Q.   There was the close Hawk‑Eye call late in the third set.   We couldn't hear what was going on on the court.   What was going on with that call?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   The line umpire did (indiscernible) wrong, but it happens many times on the tour so it's not a big problem.   
   
 Q.   We came here for a woman player, wheelchair player, Esther Vergeer.   We are looking for some quotes from the top players about her.   Can you make some statements about her.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I think she's a great champ.   It's very difficult to do wheelchair.   I'm following that, so I have a lot of respect for this discipline.   I hope she will have a great party.   I hope she will play well in the future and have a great party in The Netherlands.   Thank you and good luck.
