THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Are you disappointed?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, of course I am disappointed because I lost in three sets in the first round.  No, it's normal to be disappointed today because I didn't play really good.  No, it wasn't a good match for me.  So, yeah, I'm disappointed.  
 
Q.  Do you think the expectations of you are reasonable or do you think people expect too much almost?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I don't know.  I know that I didn't play really good before the tournament because I was injured.  It wasn't easy at the beginning.  But I wanted just to do a good match.  It wasn't good, so I'm not happy with the match. 
 
Q.  Do you feel you've run into the most dangerous unseeded player at the tournament?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, because I'm not lucky.  If I play another player, if I don't play really good, I think I can win.  But with him, it's impossible.  He is a great player.  
 
Q.  Is he in the kind of form that could really trouble players all the way through the tournament?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, he can go far, yes.  
 
Q.  What happened in the second set?  You seemed to be on top, then you seemed to lose a little concentration. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I was leading 3-1.  I have two balls to do 4-1.  After, if I did 4-1, it would be more easy for me.  But I did 3-2.  After, it was another match.  If I would win the second, it was easier for me.  But after two set to love for him, it was...  
 
Q.  What are your goals for 2006?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  To play a great season than last year.  
 
Q.  Do you have a ranking in mind, performances at Grand Slams?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I don't know.  Just to play a full season, no injuries.  After, I will see.
