  6‑1, 6‑2, 6‑3 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions in French.   
   
 Q.   You have lost the match.   It's a tough blow.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   He's the No. 1 in the world, so I'm not going to be disheartened.   He's a better player.   There is no doubt about it.   Nothing else to say.   
He was stronger, he was better, hit a better ball, returns better than I do.   He serves better than I do.  
What can I say?   Nothing else.   He's better.   That's all.   
I tried to play, so we played for two hours.   There are games that I could have won, but I didn't manage to get them.   
The way he hits the ball is amazing.   He doesn't give away lots of points.   He runs everywhere, so it's tough.   
   
 Q.   In the first set, maybe you could have hurt him.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yes.   1‑Love at break point.   So I did get off to a good start.   But then the rest of the match was tough.   
   
 Q.   Why can't you keep with him?   
RICHARD GASQUET:   He doesn't give you neutral balls.   So the quality of the backhand is totally undermined because he hits the ball very well, deep balls and hits the ball early.   You don't have time to organize yourself.  
It's almost beyond the player to do that.   You don't have time.   For me, he's the best player because he doesn't give you a lot of time.   We played for two hours.   I mean, I did my best, but it was tough today.  
   
 Q.   The start of the match, the third game, I mean, was it a sort of turning point?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Not necessarily.   I could have led 2‑Love.   The first set would have been tighter.   But if you consider the match, he was better than me.  
So one game wouldn't have changed the match.   So he's been No. 1 in the world.   He has a great game, a tough game to cope with.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that he's better than the previous years?   Playing against Nadal, is he the favorite?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   It will be a tough match.   It will be a huge match between the two players.   Nadal has been playing well so far.   He's big.   Djokovic is exceptional, outstanding player.   Nothing else to say.   
I can't give you a result, but he hasn't lost lots of matches, only two matches.   So Djokovic is unbelievable.  
Of course, he's the favorite, but by a whisker.   Rafa has won the tournament nine times.   It will be a great match, a big match.   This is a match that we all expect, and I want to see this match.   
   
 Q.   Maybe this is the best player you have ever faced?   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Federer can play some unbelievable tennis.  
   
 Q.   I'm talking about this match.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yes, he's unbelievable.   He plays great tennis, he plays perfect tennis.   The way he hits the ball, the way he strikes the ball is amazing.   
It's very difficult to step in the court.   You are short of time.   It's like a Ping‑Pong game.   It's unbelievable.   And the quality of his return is great.   His footwork is amazing.   He's certainly one of the best players of all time in tennis.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like watching the match?   Why do you want to watch this match?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   6‑1, 6‑2, 6‑3 today, and if I were to eat crisps and beer ‑‑ I mean, I won't do that, I will try to avoid that ‑‑ but of course, if I can watch the match, I will watch it, because they play unbelievable tennis.   It would be an unbelievable match, there's no doubt.  
But what is crazy is that the match will be only a quarterfinal meeting.   So everybody is eager to see the match.  
   
 Q.   Since Estoril, lots of nice things have happened.   What about the future?   
RICHARD GASQUET:   I'm very happy.   I didn't play tennis for six or seven weeks.   I managed to win a tournament.   I played here at the French Open 10 hours.   I had some matches, four‑set matches, five‑set matches, and my back doesn't hurt me.   So I'm quite happy.  
But today it was tough.   But no pain with my back, and I played matches with a lot of pressure, and I handled pressure very well.   
So we have grass courts just around the corner, Wimbledon, as well.   Nice things to do.
