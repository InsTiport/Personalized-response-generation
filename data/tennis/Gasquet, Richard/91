R. GASQUET/J. Tipsarevic
  6‑3, 6‑3, 6‑1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Richard, you played beautifully today.   How did you feel on the court?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I felt well because I start well.   I broke him early in the match.   I think it was important for me.   I served well.   I won 6‑3, 6‑3. 
After, he lost a little bit his confidence.   I felt well, as I said.   No, I played a good match.   It's good for me to win in three sets.   I'm very happy to be in fourth round.

Q.   Is your confidence rising when you play that well?
RICHARD GASQUET:   For sure, I think I play very well with my serve and my backhand.   I try to change the rhythm on my strokes. 
No, it work a lot.   I'm very happy to be in the fourth. 

Q.   There's a lot of French players in the draw this year.   Do you all get around and help each other and support each other at the slams?
RICHARD GASQUET:   For sure, they're friends.   They're my friends.   So, yeah, for sure I support them.   I hope we will go farther in the tournament.   It's starting to be more difficult and difficult.   We try our best to go further in the draw.

Q.   How do you see your chances going far into your home slam, Roland Garros?
RICHARD GASQUET:   I played well last year.   I think I had good matches against great players.   I will try to go farther.   I'm sure I can be better this year.   It's very good for us to play at home.   It's the best sensation you can have. 
I will try this year to be better than the fourth round. 

Q.   Do you feel more pressure there than you do playing here?
RICHARD GASQUET:   A little bit more.   But now I'm older, so less than before, for sure.   But, yeah, you want to play well because it's in Paris.   But it's always a big pleasure to play there.
