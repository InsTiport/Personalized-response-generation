R. GASQUET/B. Tomic
6-4, 6-3, 6-1
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Can you talk us through that shot around the net and the moment you had with Bernie afterwards?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I think it was the best shot of the match for sure.  When I saw, when he put it on the net, I saw it, I saw could do it, and of course it's a lucky shot because if it's not touching the net I can't do that.
Of course it's an incredible shot, so I'm very happy with it.  It's very funny for me.  The crowd loved it.  That's very nice.
Q. When was the last time or had you ever had a fist pump for your opponent during the match?
RICHARD GASQUET: No, I don't think so.  I think I never did it.  Bernard is a great friend of mine, so I think I can do it with him.  You don't do it with guys you don't like.  With him, he's a great friend.
