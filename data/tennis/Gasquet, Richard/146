   THE MODERATOR:  Richard Gasquet.   
  
  Q.  How much did the match you played yesterday and your ankle today affect you?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Everything was difficult because I finished at 8:00 yesterday, I have to play at noon, so that's not easy.  I was tired.   
 I played against Roger, so it was a little bit tough.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it was fair that they made you play at 12:00?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I don't know.  Yeah, it was maybe early for sure.  But I wasn't lucky with the rain.  After a match like Roddick yesterday, I need to rest a day, but we couldn't with the rain, so it was bad luck.   
  
  Q.  Were you able to speak with anybody from the All England Club to tell them you were unhappy?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I have to accept that.  You can do something, maybe it was earlier, but...   
  
  Q.  Can you tell us about your injury.   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I played a lot yesterday.  With the ankle, I couldn't run too much.   
  
  Q.  During the first set you were certainly playing as well as Roger.  You had a good chance.   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I wasn't far because I had two breakpoints at 5-All.  If I did this breakpoint, everything can happen if I win the first set.   
 He served too well today for me in the second and third set.  I was tired.  It was Roger.  It was maybe impossible.   
  
  Q.  Has this run this year given you confidence you can come back next year and win sometime in the future?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah.  I'll have one year more next year, so everything, yeah, is possible to win the tournament.   
  
  Q.  Will you play a tournament next week?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I have (smiling).
