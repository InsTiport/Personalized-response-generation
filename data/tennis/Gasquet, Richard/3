THE MODERATOR: Richard is withdrawing due to the left knee so he is here for a short press conference if
you have any questions for him.
Questions in French, please.
Q. Why can't you attend this tournament this week?
RICHARD GASQUET: It's the left knee since Basel. After the match I felt a cyst behind. It's still not resolved. I tried till the end.
I tried to play this morning but very quickly I saw that I couldn't make it.
Q. Could you give the highlights of your season? It was very weird with ups and downs but sometimes you went further than what you expected. What was the result?
RICHARD GASQUET: I'm disappointed not to finish the season any better, because you never know what could happen after the second round. I'm disappointed that I couldn't attend, but I'm going to be among the first hundred.
The beginning of the season was no good, but then I've played all the tournaments since then. I didn't feel any pain. It went out well in the end. I did what I could with what I had.
But it's a disappointment not to be here for RPM. And I'll try to relax, be prepared for the 2020.
Q. Were there too many matches at once, back to back?
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, I haven't done that many matches lately because I lost quite quickly. I don't know how it arrived. There's no specific reason for it. It's hard to admit. For the moment, there's no reason for it. I'll try to heal.
It is true that the season was tough on a physical point of view. I'll try to heal as quickly as possible so as not to have pain for next season.
Q. With all the problems that you've had recently, it's just bad luck according to you, or does it mean that you have been doing it for 15 years and now that maybe it's you're getting old now?
RICHARD GASQUET: That's the main reason indeed. I've had a surgery. And this pain is due to 15 years on the tour. When you have matches and ties back to back all the time, of course it's going to be tougher and tougher each time. I'll try to drag on as long as I can, one year, two years.
I haven't lost my appetite, but I want to see how it will turn out from a physical point of view. When I play well, when I'm fit, then it's easy. But then after all these years on the tour, I need to pay my debt.
Q. The injuries you had, do they make you change your game?
RICHARD GASQUET: You can't have injuries when you're on the tour. It's so hard. One has to be 100%. If I can't manage to reach that level, I can still try to move to the net still, but I still have to do my utmost to win.
Q. With your good achievements this year, do you still have a positive judgment about your season?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes. I want to take as much pleasure as I can from my career. I want to be in good health. I want to be fit. To have important ties, this is what matters to me in the end.
