D. GOFFIN/R. Gasquet
6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. It seemed like David was playing lights-out tennis today.
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, he was playing good.  He's one of the best players.  Very fast from the baseline.  He has no weaknesses, so it's always tough to play him, especially with his return.
No, he's a very good player.  He played a great match.
Q. How would you assess your own performance in the match today?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I think he was a little bit tougher for me, but I tried my best against him.  Physically is tough.  But as I say, he's a very good player, tough player to play.  Very fast, very powerful.  He's a great player, so I tried my best, as I said.  He was just better.
Q. This is your first Masters 1000 semifinal in a few years, so even with the loss today, can you still take a lot of positives moving into New York?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, of course, a lot of positives, because physically I had many matches, not injured.  Just need to recover a little bit now.  Of course it's positive for me.  I'm playing great, so it's good for New York.  I try my best there.
