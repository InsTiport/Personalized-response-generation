R. GASQUET/N. Almagro
6-4, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. It was supposed to be a difficult first round.  You were able to win.
RICHARD GASQUET: I'm happy that I won.  He's a very good player.  He played in South America.  He made it to the finals in Buenos Aires.  He plays very well on clay.  I've known him a long time.
At 4-All he started making some mistakes, and I was able to keep him down.  I was playing well.  I didn't make many mistakes.  I was playing far behind the baseline, but I was feeling physically fit.
It was not easy to win a match like that.
Q. Are you injured?
RICHARD GASQUET: No, nothing serious.
Q. (Question regarding having Noah present.)
RICHARD GASQUET: It's good that he's here, that he comes and sees the players.  It's good for the players that he's here.
Q. Playing on clay, is it good?
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, the fact that I'm not injured, I haven't been for two months, it's always good.  I prepared well on clay last week.  I know I can play well here.
But every match will be difficult.  We never know what can happen.  But for the time being, I'm feeling quite good.  We'll see later.  For now I feel fit and in good shape.
Q. How do you adapt to clay?  Is the game very different from hard courts?
RICHARD GASQUET: What is very different is the movement.  Sometimes you have bad bounces, which you don't have on hard courts.  On hard courts you can hit the ball and it always goes in, whereas here you have to be on the ball, and your footwork is much more difficult.
This surface is more demanding than the others.  This is why it's different.  You need to work hard and be ready physically.  It's a tough surface.
Q. Is it more difficult physically?
RICHARD GASQUET: On this surface, the serve is not as important.  Even if you're down a break, it is not as bad as on hard courts.  On hard courts it's tough to break back, whereas here it is easier, easier than on other surfaces.
Q. Do you enjoy playing on this surface?
RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, I like this surface.  When I'm fit and when I have no pain, no injuries, I enjoy myself.  I'm happy to play on this surface.  I have always played well on clay.
Q. Do you know where the location is for the next Davis Cup tie?
RICHARD GASQUET: It's not Ostrava?  You know, Czech Republic is not that bad.  It can be good.
Q. For you, Ostrava is worse?
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, Ostrava is a big city.
Q. The place is 30 kilometers away from Ostrava.
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, especially in the summer we will need to win.
