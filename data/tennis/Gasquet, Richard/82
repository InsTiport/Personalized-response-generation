R. GASQUET/L. Lacko
  6‑1, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Are you relieved that it was much easier than yesterday?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, every match is different, but I start better than yesterday.   Then you never know in the second set what could happen.   He could break me and up 2‑1.   He could lead the game, and he could take more confidence. 
Yeah, I'm happy because I served all break points, and then I returned better and served better than yesterday.
Yeah, it's a good match for me.   I'm happy.   I feel more confidence than yesterday.   It's a good win for me.

Q.   Did you also concentrate much more on the strengths that you know that you have today?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, yesterday I was concentrate, too.   That player was good, too.   I tried my best.   I tried to fight as yesterday. 
Yesterday it was a big fight, so I felt confidence after that.   That's why I played better today.
I'm happy to be in semis.

Q.   And the backhand was flowing today. 
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yes, backhand is the most important shot for me.   I have to play with this shot, and I did.   That's why I played better.

Q.   Obviously Lacko had his ankle problems.   Was that something you were thinking about as the match went along, and were you trying to keep him moving to kind of take advantage of that at all?
RICHARD GASQUET:   I don't know for sure if something in the ankle, but, you know, I had to stay concentrate because he's talented.   He play very good with his forehand. 
He could lead 2‑1 in the second set, so after, I think everything could be different.   I have to be concentrate, and I play my game. 

Q.   Are you surprised that you're not playing GaÃ«l Monfils next?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I think he was the favorite of the match.   A little bit surprised maybe, but I know Brands is powerful, is dangerous player, because he plays with his serve and his forehand.   You have no time to play.   So it's tough to play these kind of guys. 
He's tall.   He played well.   I saw the match.   He played very good.   I think he had nothing to lose, and I think it will be the same for me tomorrow.

Q.   Because of the way Brands plays coming in, he will give you a target to aim at.   Will that suit you?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it will be for sure very tough, but I have to serve well, to return well, and to fight as I did since the start of the week.   We will see. 

Q.   You know, this new rule, 25‑second rule, it seemed to really bother Monfils yesterday, but is that something at least this week that you've thought about?   How do you feel about... 
RICHARD GASQUET:   I think it's too difficult, you know.   It's too difficult.   For me, it's tough yesterday with the guy I played, Zemlja.   We played unbelievable rallies.   And then 25 seconds to recover, it's not enough for me. 
So I think 30 seconds would be better, but that's my point of view and we will see in the next week.
