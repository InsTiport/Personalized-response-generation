   THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. 

 Q.  How much were you limited by your injury? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  I had a problem with my foot.  But I didn't -- it's not why I lost today.  It was difficult for me to play sometimes, but not because -- it's not why I lost in this match. 

 Q.  What do you put the loss down to? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  The first set was very bad.  I didn't enter in the match.  I never played on the center court.  It was little bit difficult for me. 
 But after I fight, but I wasn't relaxed on the court.  You know, I tried to -- I was far from the baseline, and I have to go to the net more often.  But he served well.  Third set was important for me, in the tiebreak.  I didn't win it.  It was difficult, but he played well. 

 Q.  Was it difficult for you confronting a friend? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, for sure.  It's never easy, but it's okay when you are on the court.  It's over.  You have to play your friend. 

 Q.  What does it say about the game in France, you as the top-ranked Frenchmen beaten by a Frenchman here? 
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, there are a lot of good French players, a lot of them.  So it's -- I prefer to lose against a French player.  It's not big problem for me to lose against a friend.  I try to win, but next time.
