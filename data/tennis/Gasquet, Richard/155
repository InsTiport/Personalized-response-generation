 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. Q. You must be pretty happy with your form, your tennis at the moment?RICHARD GASQUET: I didn't play good match today. It wasn't really good because I stay far from the baseline, really far. I didn't hit the ball with my backhand, so it's my best stroke and today I played bad with my backhand. So I could serve better, but, no, I played my match, I did my best. It was difficult, because I wasn't the favorite today. But he played a wonderful match. I fight a lot, and I am really happy to fight like that.  Q. What are you expecting from Lleyton next match? RICHARD GASQUET: I think he's the favorite of this match because he has a great experience. He's a great player. So we will see. I have to play my match, to do the best, and I can win this match. Q. Do you have to play more aggressively?RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I have to play more aggressively, to hit the ball harder than today. But I think I can do that. FastScripts by ASAP Sports...
