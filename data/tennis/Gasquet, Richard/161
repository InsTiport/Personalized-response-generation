THE MODERATOR:  Questions.  
 
 
Q.  Next opponent will be an Italian player, Galimberti.  Do you know him? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I played against him two years ago in a challenger in Italy.  I won in Napoli 6-4 in the third.  Not easy.  It's in the second round.  It will be a difficult match for me, of course.  But I know his game, yes.  
 
Q.  Talk a little bit about how things have changed over the last year for you.  You come in here, you're seeded, had a big win over Roger in the spring.  Talk about what the changes were, both in your game and your life, in the past year. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  It's really good for me to be 13 in the world.  Last year I played here, and it wasn't a good tournament for me.  So this year I am 13 in the world.  There is a lot of achievement, a lot of improvement.  Nothing change for me because I practice a lot since one year.  I am just happy to be in this ranking today.
