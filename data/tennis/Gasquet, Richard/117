D. FERRER/R. Gasquet
  6-2, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. He did play well, didn't he? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Sorry? 

 Q. He did play well. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: He did, yeah. He played really well. That's the worst guy for me. His game is the worst for me because he has no fades in his game: He has a big backhand, big forehand and he runs everywhere, so that's really hard for me.

 Q. You had a lot of chances in the second set. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah, to break him, but he was better than me. 

 Q. The fact that you couldn't play Andy Murray and you had that day off, did that kind of affect you? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: A little bit. A little bit. Maybe my game, even if I was -- if I played yesterday, he played wonderful, two days. He's a great player. I've played against him a lot of times. It will be the same. It will be the same. 

 Q. And what is it about his game that you don't like?
 RICHARD GASQUET: He is doing everything, big forehand, big backhand, he is serving well, he is running. He's never missing a ball, so that's hard. 

 Q. But you beat him the last time you played him. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I beat him one time, but I lost him a lot of times. Tonight he played his best ever and me not my best. 
 THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions in English? Okay.
