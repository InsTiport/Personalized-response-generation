  Q. The French contingent here in Wimbledon is fantastic, 15 French players in round 1 and now 12 in round 2.  Why are the French so good on grass?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, we play better than on clay court.  I don't know why, because for sure we grew up on hard court, not on clay like Spain or Argentinian players.  Us, we play on hard court, and that's why we are better on that.  Grass physically is maybe Spanish and Argentinian are really, really good, so in five-setters maybe they can be better than us sometimes.   
  
  Q.  Is it to do with because you are taught a way to play on a hard court when you are young that enables you to be able to play on any surface?  Is that the secret do you think?   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, yeah, if we want to play in Roland Garros we have to grow up on clay court.  Me, I played on clay court at 12 or 13 before I played on a hard court.   
 And in Spain you play -- at six, seven you play on clay court, and you do a lot of physical education.  In France you just did it less.   
  
  Q.  Do you personally feel as though you are in the best shape that you have been in physically, mentally and technically to do well at Wimbledon?  Because you have a tremendous record on grass.   
 RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I feel good on grass.  I like to play on grass court.  I don't know, because I can play good on clay court, too, so that's not a problem.  But maybe there are less players on grass court, less Argentinian or Spanish, yeah, less players play good on grass.
