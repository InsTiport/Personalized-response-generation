R. GASQUET/T. Bellucci
  6-1, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions in French. 

 Q. You just dropped five games per match. That's the rate. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: That's true. I also played a very solid match today. At the beginning of the match, it was very important because I had several breakpoints to save and I was able to save them. It was very important for me to be up soon in the set. It helped me gain confidence. 
 After that, I was able to play a good game to break him, and I held my serve. Overall it was a very good match. 

 Q. So what about your game? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: I served well. I was able to run well. I played better than yesterday. I won playing well. I was able to go for my shots, to move forward, and to hold my serve, which was not always easy. 

 Q. What about Almagro for your next match?
 RICHARD GASQUET: He's top eight. Of course, he's not Djokovic or Nadal. He's still a very good player. It's going to be tough. He hits hard. He never lets you play. I will need to play well. 

 Q. Did you play him already?
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes, once. I lost. But it was on clay. I believe it's his best surface. But it's normal I'm playing a good player because it's the round of 16 of a Masters 1000. 

 Q. Are you going to ask your doubles partner how to play him? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, because my game is different from Gilles' game. Also, this is hard courts, which is also different. Right now I'm happy because I was able to play two matches already. This will be good for the rest of the season. 

 Q. You beat Bellucci easier than in the past today. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Well, each match is different, as I was saying. Maybe next week I might lose against him. Today I was able to stay focused and I played a good match. 
 This is very good with a view to the US Open because I spent some time without playing and it's important for me to play many matches. 

 Q. Physically you seem to be well, too. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yes. I've been working hard. I feel better today than yesterday. What is important for me is to play matches. I will not end up playing in the US Open with only two first rounds under my belt. So I'm happy.
