 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Just wondered how you felt about your match, how things went. Did you feel like it went pretty much the way you expected it to?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I played well. I won 1 and 6 against a guy who's 23 in world match. Every match is very a tough to win here in Cincinnati, a lot great players, so for sure I'm very happy to win.   
 I did a pretty good tiebreak, a lot of tension, but I knew it was important to win it, because in the third set you never know what could happen.   
 So I'm happy.   
  
  Q. You seem like you've been a lot more consistent this year. What do you think has helped that?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know. I have been 7 in the world, so I've been consistent, too. But since last two years, yeah, I a, playing better now than last year.  
 Yeah, so I'm feeling more confident. I won a lot matches, so that's why.  
  
  Q. Is there anything you changed?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, I just keep going. I practice a lot. I played a lot tournaments and I played well.  
 After, I feel more confident with the match I won, so that's why I'm feeling better.   
  
  Q. The weather had to be a pleasant surprise considering the way it's been here in the past.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it can be very, very hot here, so you never know. But I prefer this weather. It's not too hot today, so that's better to play.
