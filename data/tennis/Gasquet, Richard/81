R. GASQUET/D. Brands
  7‑5, 7‑5

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you talk to us about the match and how it went for you?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yes, I think I played very well.   It was tough opponent.   He played well.   He was very powerful, serving the forehand.   So very talented.   I think I played a very good match. 
I was mentally tough, and I played well, you know.   7‑5, 7‑5, it's a big match for me.   I'm happy to be in final.

Q.   You saved all the break points that you faced.   Was this very important for you to get through this match without getting broke?
RICHARD GASQUET:   For sure, it's very important.   I take more confidence with it, and I save a lot of breakpoints.
Yeah, it was important for me to do it, and I managed to do it.   As I said, I'm really way with the way played.   I served well.   I didn't lose my serve.
It was a big match for me.   Very tiring.   I run a lot, but I'm happy to win. 

Q.   You seem right now to be in a high point in your career.   You have had some ups and downs and everything.   What do you think is going right right now?
RICHARD GASQUET:   I don't know.   I'm feeling well.   I practice a lot.   I played well last year.   I'm confident with my game. 
Yeah, every day is different.   Tomorrow I have to win this final, but, yeah, it's true, I'm feeling well.   I hope to play better and better in the future. 

Q.   You seem pretty confident.   Are you hoping to make a push for the top 5 this season?
RICHARD GASQUET:   For sure I will try to do my best.   I don't know what I can do this year.   But on every match I will try to fight, and I will try to prepare better on Grand Slams, to win some tournaments, to start in Doha, you know, in the final, so it's important to win.
And we will see.   I will see this year how I can go.   I will try to do my best. 

Q.   You seem to improved mentally as the match went on.   You got better and better.   Do you know how or why that happens, or is it something which is hard to explain?
RICHARD GASQUET:   No, I won a lot of matches, so I know how to win, how to fight, and how to be concentrated.   So I won some big matches in my career.   So for sure that's not a new thing for me to play well.

Q.   That inside‑out forehand that he has and the way he comes to the net and his serve, does that make him one of the more awkward opponents you have faced?
RICHARD GASQUET:   He was very powerful.   He takes the ball early, use a lot of power.   It was a big match. 
He was confident.   He won against GaÃ«l yesterday.   He had a lot of confidence.   I played a big match to win him.   It was tough for me.

Q.   Did you seek to deny him angles with that forehand by perhaps playing a little further forward?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I tried to serve and return well.   It was the key of the match against that kind of player, big serve.   I managed to do it, and I played well.   It's a big win for me.   I played clever, and I defend well.   Everything was perfect.

Q.   Just look a little bit of the possibilities of tomorrow, either Nikolay or David?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, both are very good players.   Will be tough to win against that guys.   As I say, it's the final, it's important for me to win it, and I will do my best to do it and to enjoy that moment.

Q.   They both make their opponents run a lot.   Are you happy that you played earlier so you get just a few extra hours of rest?
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I'm feeling good.   Typically I have tough matches this week, but, you know, tomorrow is the final.   I will forget that and I concentrate on my game and try to go to the net to play offensive, to serve well.   As I said, I will try to do my best to win this match.
