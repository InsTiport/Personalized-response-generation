 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Your ranking, you've been as high as 7, went out to mid-80s, now 33. Do you look at the number next to your name? Is it something you notice?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: For sure I prefer to be 7 than 33, but it's very, very difficult. There are a lot of good players but I'm trying to go farther; I'm playing.  
 I need to win guys like Berdych next round to climb in the ranking. But, yeah, I will try to do my best to be higher in the ranking.  
  
  Q. When you see Berdych who is now 6, do you think, That should be me?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: I don't know. I really don't know. But I'm sure I can be better than 33.  
  
  Q. Is the journey now getting back to the top harder than getting there in the first place?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I will see. I have a big match against Berdych. He's the favorite of the match. I will try to be my best and, yeah, to play better, to take confidence.  
 I needs matches like that.   
  
  Q. But for you as a player, you got to 7; is getting back there now harder?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Well, I think it's -- there are a lot very good players. Maybe it's harder, but I will try to come back the best I can.
