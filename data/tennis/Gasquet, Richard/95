A. MURRAY/R. Gasquet
  7-6, 6-3, 6-2

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. Was the first set tiebreak the key to that match? Because last time I played him at Wimbledon it went five sets. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it was very important. The first set we play almost one hour. I have some opportunities to win the first set, some break points, one break point at the start of the match. 
 But he served very well, especially in the second set. I tried to keep my serve, but he played well. You know, he's doing everything. He has great backhand, good forehand, he's running a lot, he's clever on the court also, so he's a good player.

 Q. Is he a better player now than three years ago at this stage? 
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, for sure. He's 4 in the world now. Three years ago he were 15 or something.
 So he's better, yeah.

 Q. Did it make any difference to you that you were playing in front of Prince William and Princess Caroline, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge? It's not every day that royalty shows up at Wimbledon. 
 RICHARD GASQUET: It's very nice for tennis and me to see them. It's a great. I will have a great memories from that for sure. 
 But after, it's tennis. I didn't lose because they came, no. 

 Q. It was not a distraction, it was a privilege more than a distraction?
 RICHARD GASQUET: No, it's very nice for them to be there. For me, it's nice to see that. I will keep a lot of great memories from that for sure. 
 But after...

 Q. Did you see Andy's bow afterwards?
 RICHARD GASQUET: No.

 Q. You had already left the court?
 RICHARD GASQUET: I had left the court.

 Q. It was very theatrical.
