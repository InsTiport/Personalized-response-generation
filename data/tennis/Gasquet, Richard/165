THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English.  
 
 
Q.  Have you managed to catch any of the action on the Centre Court? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I saw the fourth set.  It's bad luck for Murray because he can win this match.  Nalbandian is a great fighter.  Now I think is difficult for him to win this match.  But, yeah, maybe he can win, but it will be difficult for him now.  He miss his luck at the fourth set, I think.  
 
Q.  What do you think of Murray as a player? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  On grass court, he plays -- I saw him on clay court.  I don't know how he play.  But on grass court he plays good.  He has a good serve, a good return.  He never miss in the point.  Now he plays really good.  I would like to play against him.  
 
Q.  Did you ever play him as a Junior?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, never.  
 
Q.  Did you ever see him play as a Junior?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I saw him in challengers in Italy and now on grass court is the first time.  
 
Q.  At the moment, who would you prefer to play out of these two?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Murray, I prefer to play against him, yes.  I would like to play against him.  He's a young player, so it will be a great match for us.  
 
Q.  Do you see a comparison between you and Murray?  You're roughly the same age.  He's doing for British tennis what you are doing for the game in French.
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, he is a good tennis.  Yes, it's the same we are.  Hopes in my country and him in England, yes, it's similar.  
 
Q.  Do you think your game has improved this week on grass?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, it's the same than the last week because I won a tournament.  I played really good there.  It's the same in Wimbledon, yeah.
