 R. GASQUET/M. Klizan
  6‑3, 6‑4 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How is the back?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, better and better.   I think I had no pain since Roland Garros.   Of course I stopped for two months.   It's always difficult to come back.   You are questioning yourself every day on your body.  
Now I think I have no more pain, so I hope it will be the same tomorrow and then in Wimbledon.  
   
 Q.   What level would you say your fitness is at the moment?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, I'm playing, practicing every day more and more.   I am practicing on my physical condition.   I run a lot last week.   So I'm starting to be better.   
You know, I'm not one 100% on my game and everything, but I think I'm playing better and better.   I won two good matches.   Tomic and Klizan are good players.   
I served well.   I could play with power.   It's a good start of the week for me.  
   
 Q.   Are you pleased with the way the week has gone so far?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, of course.   I can play matches.   That's why I came here.   I need to play matches.   I need to play, to feel no pain and be confident in my game.   I can play tomorrow in semifinal.   
It will be a good match.   I hope I will be ready.  
   
 Q.   You won this tournament back in the day when it was played at Nottingham twice.   It's going to be the last year at Eastbourne.   It's going back to Nottingham.   Do you have any thoughts on the venue here and how it compares?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Both tournaments are good.   I remember Nottingham was a nice tournament.   Here is very good.   Organization is perfect.   The centre court is beautiful.   
To prepare for Wimbledon it's perfect for me.   So next year I will be in Nottingham again.   I came there seven years ago, I remember I won, eight years ago, so maybe I come back with pleasure there.   It will be nice.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it's a shame that it's leaving here?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   I don't know why they left here, you know.   I'm not director of the tournament, so I have not all the ‑‑I don't know what happened, you know, but what I know is both tournaments are nice.  
   
 Q.   Obviously the weather yesterday and today is a help both with your back and your preparations?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yes.   We all know in Wimbledon   sometimes it can be tough.   So in England sometimes is difficult with the rain, because on the grass, even if it's raining just a little bit, you can't play.   
On clay, even if it's raining a little bit, you can play, it's okay, but not on grass.   So of course it's difficult.   When the weather is perfect like today, it's wonderful.  
   
 Q.   The wind is usually a problem here, but it seems very still.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, for the moment the tournament is perfect.   We will see tomorrow.   It's nice to play here.  
   
 Q.   Obviously made for you in your preparations.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah.   But I was born in south of France, so for me the wind is okay.   Most difficult is the rain, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Are you a football fan?   Will you be watching the World Cup?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah.   Every day we are watching the World Cup.   France is starting well, so of course I'm supporting them every day.   Of course I hope they will go far in the tournament.
