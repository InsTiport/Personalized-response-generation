THE MODERATOR:  Questions in English.  
 
 
Q.  A lot of teenagers coming through in the draw.  Do you see yourselves all as rivals for the next few years or do you look to the established players as your main rivals at the moment? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Both.  It's both because they are old player, but they can play very good, too.  The new player can play good, too.  But old player can play a lot.  It's difficult to win everybody, the old and the new converse.  
 
Q.  You play probably Nadal in the next round.  He's big news at the moment. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, it's very difficult to play against him on grass court, on clay court.  He's a fighter.  It's always difficult to win him in three sets.  I have to do a perfect match to win him.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about the difference of the match on grass versus clay, if you end up playing him, how you will approach it, what you need to do?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, it's not the same.  On clay court you have to play baseline.  On grass court you have to go to the volley.  The serve is more important than on clay.  Yeah, you have to serve better and too return better than on clay. The key is the serve and the returns.  
 
Q.  Do you think you have a better chance on this surface than clay against him? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Against who?  
 
Q.  Against Nadal. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I think on three sets I have a better chance on grass court, and two sets is the same.  
 
Q.  You like the volleying? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, I like to go to volley.  It's fun when you play a good volley.  It's fun.  I like to do a good volley, yes.  
 
Q.  How much have you played on grass?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I played on Queen's.  I played the quarterfinal.  I won last week in Nottingham.  Yeah, I played a lot of match.  It's good for the confidence.  
 
Q.  Before this?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Before I played on Queen's two years ago.  Last year, just quallies in Wimbledon.  
 
Q.  Why did you miss Wimbledon Juniors?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I was tired after a lot of tournament on clay court.  I was too tired to play this tournament.  
 
Q.  Do you feel the match you're going to play against Nadal will be the first of many?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, I hope.  We are young, yes.  Maybe we will play a lot of matches.  I think so, yes.  
 
Q.  I mean, to contest finals?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I don't know.  We have time.  Maybe.  I don't know when, but, yeah, I think we can play finals in the future, yes.  
 
Q.  Can you tell us how much you know about the other players of your age?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Of my age?  
 
Q.  18, 19. 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, there is Gael, too, Monfils.  There is Czech players, Berdych.  Not a lot.  There is four or five very good players.  
 
Q.  Nadal thinks he can't win here at Wimbledon because he's not confident enough on grass.  What about you and your confidence on grass? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I think I can't win, too, because it's too long to play.  I have to play five matches.  It's too difficult for me now.  But I think I can go far.  We will see.  I don't know when I will lose, but I think I can play a good tournament.  
 
Q.  How confident are you on this surface?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I am very confident because I played a lot of matches.  I won last week my first title in Nottingham.  Of course, I have a lot of confidence, yes.  
 
Q.  How well do you know Nadal?  You are friendly? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yes, we are friend.  Is difficult because we don't speak English very good.  It's difficult for us.  
 
Q.  You communicate in English?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah, in English.  Not a lot because we speak so bad.  
 
Q.  How long have you known him? 
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  A lot of time because I played him in Tarbes, Les Petit A's.  
 
Q.  When was this?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  13, six years ago.  
 
Q.  What did you learn from playing him recently at Roland Garros?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  No, I learned nothing.  No, nothing.  I was disappointed to lose.  I know how I have to play him on grass court, so I hope to play against him.  Yeah, I have information to play him.  
 
Q.  It's very unusual for a Frenchman or a European to like grass.  You seem to like it.  When did you discover that you had a great feel for grass?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  I think French players play better on grass court than on clay court.  
 
Q.  Really?
 
RICHARD GASQUET:  Yeah.  Me, I didn't know how I can play on grass because I don't play a lot.  So, yeah, when I went on Queen's, I won two matches, three matches.  After I was a little bit confident.  But, yeah, it was after my title in Nottingham, I know I can play good on grass court because I won a tournament.  It's a great surface for me.
