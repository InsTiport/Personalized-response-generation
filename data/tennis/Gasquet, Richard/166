THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please.


Q.  Did you enjoy your appearance on Canal+ last week?

RICHARD GASQUET:  (Through translation.)  Yes, I did enjoy it very much. I was a little bit scared at first and I was a little bit tired, but then it was great.  It was really amusing.


Q.  Were you embarrassed at all by maybe one of the other guests on the show?

RICHARD GASQUET:  (Through translation.)  Yes, I was a little bit embarrassed by the girl who sat next to me because I'm not used to people who do that job, but it was fine.
