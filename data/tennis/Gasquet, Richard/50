  R. GASQUET/J. Duckworth6-2, 6-3, 7-5An interview with:RICHARD GASQUETTHE MODERATOR: Questions, please.Q. You played James Duckworth at Wimbledon a few months ago.  It went up to 5 sets.  Was today a bit easier than you thought it might be?RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I thought I start better than in Wimbledon.  It made the difference because I could break him very fast.  It was important for my confidence.  I think I play very well.  You never know what could happen in a serve, but I kept my serve.  And I'm really happy to win in three sets because this is very dangerous player.  He has a big serve.  He's talented going to the net.  I think he would be a good player.  For me it's a great result to win him in three set because I played in Wimbledon I did five.  He can play well.Q. It was hot out there today.  Think you were the only person without any head gear on.  Does the heat bother you at all?RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it was hot on the court, but the Aussie fan was nice with me, so it was a great atmosphere on the court.  So even if it was hot, the court is great.  So it was a lot of fun to play today on the court.
