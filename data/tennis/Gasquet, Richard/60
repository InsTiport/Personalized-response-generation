 F. LOPEZ/R. Gasquet
  6‑3, 6‑7, 7‑5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Was that a tough defeat to take?   It was a close match.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Always difficult, you know, to lose the final.   It's always very disappointing, but I try my best.   
I think on two break points I could do a little bit better, maybe return faster than I did.   But, you know, it's tennis.   I try to fight the best I could.   
And of course I'm very disappointing after losing 7‑5 in the final.   You don't win a title every week.   So of course it's tough.   That's the sport.  
   
 Q.   He was particularly difficult in the first sort of set and a half.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, he's playing good.   He serves incredible.   He start to play with the slice.   So he has a perfect game for grass court.   He fight a lot, tough mentally in the third set.   Didn't do mistakes.   
He deserve this win.   But of course it's always tough, as I said, to lose in the final, especially when it's 7‑5 in the third.  
   
 Q.   Overall, though, can you take consolation from the week after the injury problems you have had earlier in the season?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, of course I'm happy.   Of course it's tough half an hour after I lose, but of course I will take positive and I try my best next week again.   
You know, it's tennis.   You try your best.   That's the most important.   The win was for him, and next time I hope it will be on my side.  
   
 Q.   Have you looked much at the Wimbledon draw?   Have you kind of analyzed it much?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Not so much.   I saw my first round.   I'm happy to play on Tuesday.   I try my best and go farther possible and we will see.  
   
 Q.   How do you kind of feel you are going into this Wimbledon compared to previous years?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   I think I'm coming back from injuries.   I stop many times.   So physically I'm feeling better.   I hope tomorrow to feel good, to have no pain again.   Then I think I will be ready for London.  
   
 Q.   Are you disappointed it's the last Eastbourne tournament?   You have been down to Eastbourne the last few times.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it's nice tournament.   Of course it's disappointing not to come back next year.   I don't know exactly why, but it's a nice tournament.   I will keep great memories from Eastbourne.
