J. LONDERO/R. Gasquet
6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French, please.
Q. Your reaction to this loss?
RICHARD GASQUET: It's always sad to lose.  I didn't start the match well.  I didn't have strength in my legs.
I managed to win the second set.  As for the third set, he played it well.  Then there's 3-Love.  During the fourth set, I could have 4-Love, but then I missed a bit of everything.  My serve, my fitness.  Nothing is surprising, really.
Q. Do you think that the lack of warm-up matches is what is missing basically?  Lack of practice?
RICHARD GASQUET: Well, yes.  Madrid was three beings weeks ago.  I started three weeks ago.  I'm happy to do four sets.  When you're playing a match.  You want to do better.  I would like to have played a fifth set.  You never know what can happen.  But I'm trying to make a good comeback.
It's never easy.  I'm already happy to feel good after this match, and I'll try to move forward and to play other matches in other tournaments.  I'm trying to pay more attention.  This is more important than the result of the match.  Of course it's always a pity to lose no matter what.
Q. I'm having a story on Court No. 1.  It was your last match on this court.  Could you talk about your best memories and what it embodied for you?
RICHARD GASQUET: There is a great atmosphere.  Historically also.  It's the fastest of the tournament.  The sound is very specific.  I didn't play a lot of matches when I was junior maybe.
But it's part and parcel of history.  It's a pity that it is going to be destroyed.  And it is quite atypical, but it's a wonderful court.
Q. Have you scheduled your grass season?  How are you going to prepare?
RICHARD GASQUET: I don't have any injuries.  I've done four tournaments in a row.  I've had a huge break.
In Holland where I won last time, in Halle, up until Wimbledon, I'll try to step up my game week after week.  Already it's the first time that I've been playing two weeks in a row.  In Madrid, I couldn't play and in Lyon either.  So it's great that I could go so far, and I will try to step up my game.
Q. Of course you're disappointed to have lost, but are you relieved to have played a good match?
RICHARD GASQUET: That's the most important thing for me.  Of course it's always a pity to lose.  I could have done a fifth set, but my opponent was fitter than I was.  But with the experience, you never know what can happen.  My fitness is not there yet and this is what I was lacking mostly.  It's nearly a miracle to have won during the first round.
I will try to play tennis better.  Because I've made a lot of mistakes.  It's not only a matter of fitness, but I have to work on a lot of things.
But things are not that bad when compared to the beginning.  I've been starting to play again not that long ago, actually.
