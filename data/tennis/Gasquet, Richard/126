  A. MURRAY/R. Gasquet  
5-7, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. It's getting darker and darker on the court. The crowd is howling for Murray. What were your feelings?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I was winning two sets to love and 5-4, so I had to win. But he fight a lot.   
 And after, when I lost the third, my confidence was down. He played better. He served better. He returned better. The crowd was for him. It was natural. But it help a lot Andy, for sure.   
  
  Q. What were you doing out there so late? Were you asking yourself, Why are we out here? It's so dark.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah. When I was a child at eight years old I could play when I was in south of France, I could play with the dark, to finish a match in the club.   
 But in Wimbledon, it's strange. But that's for both. That's the same for Andy, so is no excuse. But it was a bit difficult with the dark, for sure.   
  
  Q. Do you think they should have called off the match, suspended play earlier because of the light?   
 RICHARD GASQUET: I understand they want to finish the match because it's better for Wimbledon, but maybe, yes. But that's not on excuse. He won the match. He played well. He fight a lot.   
 I'm sure he fight more because he was in Wimbledon, so it was maybe the key. He played with the crowd. It was difficult for me when I lost the third.   
 But in the fourth and the fifth he returned better than me. It was maybe the key. He served and returned better than me.   
  
  Q. Have you ever played in a situation like that before, where you know if you could win one more game, probably it will be suspended at 5-5? Was that a pressure?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, yeah, for sure. But it was positive for him. He was leading 5-4 with the crowd, with everything. It was difficult for me to return with the dark.   
 But, no, he played well. I'm sad because I didn't do 6-4 in the third. I had to win this game.   
  
  Q. You played big Davis Cup matches before. What was the effect of the Centre Court crowd so intensely for Andy?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it was difficult for me because in the fourth and the five (sic), the crowd were, you know what I mean, pushing him a lot for sure, and it was not easy.   
 But that's natural. He is in England. It was maybe a Davis Cup match. I am sure if I am leading 5-4 in another Grand Slam I would win this match, for sure.   
  
  Q. Did you feel very alone out there on Centre Court?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, but I hope to play against him in Roland Garros for sure. I won't be alone this time (smiling). So I'm waiting him.   
  
  Q. How far do you think he can go in the tournament?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: I really don't know. He has to play against Nadal. For sure Nadal is the favorite. It will be hard for him because, yeah, sometimes -- you know, I practice sometime as lot with Fabrice Santoro. He's the same. He's doing a lot of dropshot, a lot, a lot.   
 With Nadal, you have to play more to the net, more aggressive, more powerful. But he's a good player on grass court. With Rafael it will be very hard, but for sure he's really talented. He feels a lot the game. He's really clever. Andy is really clever on the court.   
 If he serves well, you never know. In three set, Nadal is the favorite, for sure.   
  
  Q. In the fourth set, on set point, I think it was a backhand volley. It went far to the outer court. What were you thinking before Andy retrieved it and made that incredible shot? Did you think you had the point?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: In the tiebreak?   
  
  Q. Yes.   
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, the crowd were pushing him. He was really happy because he won the tiebreak. I knew it could be really difficult for me, the fourth, because he was really positive. Me, I wasn't. I lost the serve.   
 But that's tennis. That's the tennis. I played good in the three first set, and I tried my best to fight in the fifth. It was difficult, but that's tennis. He played well.
