 G. MONFILS/R. Gasquet
  6-4, 7-5, 7-5 
  
 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How do you think you've managed to go through without dropping a set so far?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, I think that's my fault, maybe, a little bit. I had set point in the second set; I could do the passing with my backhand.   
 And the third I have chances to win the set, but that's tennis.
