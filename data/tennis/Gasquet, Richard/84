 R. GASQUET/G. Zemlja
  6‑7, 6‑4, 7‑6 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You fought very hard for a very long time to win that match, didn't you?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it was very tough.   Unfortunately I lost the first set.   I could win.   I had two set points.   
I'm sure if I am doing this set in another match I can win in two.   When you're losing the first set, then you have to fight.   He feel more with confidence, serve incredible.   He's a very good player.   
I knew he was a good player, so as I said, I fight a lot and I am happy to win.   I did my best.  
   
 Q.   Did those set points get away from you in the first set because it's early in the season and the first tournament?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it's always difficult to lose the first set 7‑6 after one hour of play, so you are a bit disappointed after that.   You need to fight to come back.   
It's what I did in the second set.   And even in the third I was losing 5‑2, but I fight a lot.  
   
 Q.   You looked as though you were mentally stronger than him at the end.   
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, it was a big tiebreak for me, played well.   As I said, I fight a lot.   It was very tough.   It was so close.   We played two hours, 40 minutes.   It was very difficult.   
   
 Q.   Can you just talk about your next match?   I think you play Lukas?  
RICHARD GASQUET:   Yeah, he's a very good player.   He's playing good.   As I said already, I'm the favorite of the match so they have nothing to lose and they play well.   
So I have to serve better.   I served bad today, but I will try again to do my best and fight as much as I can.  
   
 Q.   Does it help that you went through a tough match today that you can go tomorrow more confident, or you prefer to finish...   
RICHARD GASQUET:   It's better to win in two sets.   You know, it's less tiring.   I prefer to win in two sets.
