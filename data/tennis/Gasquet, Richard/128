  R. GASQUET/S. Grosjean (Retired)  
  
  Q. What did he say to you at the end of the match?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Like he couldn't continue the match because he was injured. I saw it at the end of the second set. He couldn't run so good, so it was a little bit difficult for him. I was playing well, too, so -- it was a little bit too much for him, and his body wasn't ready for the match.  
  
  Q. Because he had a problem at Queen's Club, the same problem?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, so I told him to recover, to take time to recover.  
  
  Q. So you were sympathetic?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, he's a friend, a French guy.  
  
  Q. He likes playing on grass?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Likes being in London?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah. He's a really good player. He played great in Wimbledon five years ago or four, I don't remember when. But he's a really good player and I'd love to play a good match against him, but he was injured today.  
  
  Q. Two semifinals here so he has a good record here?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So that was a little bit of a surprise to have a win, to walk over? A bit of a surprise?  
 RICHARD GASQUET: Yeah, it's not a lot. It's maybe my second time a guy has retired against me, so that's not usual. But sometimes it's good to have an easy round.
