It was a very tough match for you, but maybe more easier than it was in Sydney at the beginning of the year.  What do you think about it?LEONARDO MAYER: (Through translation.)  I play very well here.  The surface here was much more slower so it helped me a lot in terms of my game. That's why I got a big advantage.  I have a better adaptation to these kind of courts than him.Q. I guess you were a little surprised that Jerzy won the third set.  What happened in the fourth set when you started 4-0 at the beginning?LEONARDO MAYER: (Through translation.)  When I was down in the score I was playing much better, but when the game was leveled I noticed that my opponent was a little bit tense. That's where I could get the difference in terms of games.Q. In your opinion, what was the key to win this game today?LEONARDO MAYER: (Through translation.)  The surface was one.  My adaptation to this kind of surface, it was quicker for me than my opponent.
