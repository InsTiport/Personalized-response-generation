THE MODERATOR: Questions for Francoise?  
   
 Q. What's next for you after this?  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: I think I'll be playing Vancouver, and I'm hoping to see when else I can play. I'm not sure yet. But Vancouver is part of my plan. I'm also playing doubles here, so I'm looking forward to that.  
   
 Q. And you know yourself, you're one of the rising stars for Canada. What does that mean to you to have this experience this week?  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: Yeah, I mean it was a good experience. Like I said, I feel like it's a match I could have won, but just I feel like she played better on key points. She was more solid in the third set, I would say. So that's unfortunate.   
I think a loss is always disappointing, so even though she was the favorite, I feel like I still had my chance to win the match.   
   
 Q. What changes are you planning to make for Vancouver?  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: What changes?   
   
 Q. Any changes that you have in mind?  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: In my game?   
   
 Q. Yes. For your next tournament.   
FRANCOISE ABANDA: No. I don't think I'll make any changes. I just think‑‑ I have a new coach now, Antonio, so that's already a change, so I have to adapt and see how it goes with him. I think it was a good match for tonight, but maybe‑‑ I feel like I kind of served well. I think it wasn't that bad. I think it's a good match under my belt and hopefully I can grow from that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?   
   
 Q. What is your biggest struggle? What are some of your struggles at this point in your career? What is the biggest struggle that you're encountering?  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: Well, I don't think I'm struggling.   
   
 Q. That's not what I mean, struggling. A challenge or something that you're‑‑  
FRANCOISE ABANDA: I mean I think this match would have been like really great for me. You know, when I won the first set, I was excited. I was like, this could possibly be an upset. So I think that was a challenge for me, and I feel like I was close, so it kind of hurts to lose in a close match like that, but like I said, I wasn't the favorite and I'll just try to build from that and do better.
