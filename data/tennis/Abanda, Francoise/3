C. WOZNIACKI/F. ABANDA
6-0, 6-0
THE MODERATOR: Questions in French.
Q. I'm under the impression that you don't want to share anything, but what can you tell us nonetheless?
FRANCOISE ABANDA: Defeat is defeat.  So she played very well today.  So I was quite tired.
In the future, I hope that I will be in the main draw in order to save some energy in order to go deep in the tournament.  So it's very difficult when you have played matches in a qualifying tournament.
Q. Were you impressed by her game?
FRANCOISE ABANDA: I wasn't impressed at all.  As I told you, fitness-wise and physically, I was tired.
Caroline played quite well.  She was smart.  I think that she played her second match.  I played five matches.  Physically, I couldn't sustain the challenge.  I hope that I will be able to qualify for the main draw.  It's very difficult to get out of a qualifying tournament and to have a deep run in the final draw.
Q. What are your plans in the future?
FRANCOISE ABANDA: No idea.  I will take part in some grass tournaments before Wimbledon.
