THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Well played.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   You were hitting the ball pretty well at the end.   I saw the last couple of sets from out wide making passing shots.   Did you feel you hit the ball really well by your standards?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Well, yeah.   I think I hit the ball‑‑ overall the match was great I think from my side.   I hit great shots.   Sometimes I hit a little bit too much, too many double faults at one point, but overall I think I played great.   I played great points.   For get the break in the fifth set I hit great passing shot.   
So I'm happy with my performance.  
   
 Q.   How did you deal with his serve, second biggest serve in the big in the game?   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Well, you know that you have to deal with it.   You just try to be focused when you serve, because one break against John is probably one set.   This is what I have to do, no?   
I'm so lucky because I have also a good serve.   So I think to play Johnny the way I played today I have to be happy, because this is really difficult player to play.
