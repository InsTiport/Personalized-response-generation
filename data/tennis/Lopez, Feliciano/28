THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. I don't know if you have the feeling that you could have won this match in the third set.
FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, of course it's clear that I had my opportunities.  I think at the end the third set I had a break point.  It was a very hard-fought point where I had my chances.
At the end I missed an easy ball and he won the point.  After that the game was in the middle; it could go anyway.
I think in that moment I had the opportunities to break at any moment.  I could have been a little bit more solid.  I was in that point.  Then after I had that opportunity he had another opportunity to break me.  He didn't.  After that in a stupid game at 40-15, he broke me.
So in these matches, playing at this level, they are very hard.  We played in very tense moments where to could go either way.
Q. I don't know if it hurts more because it's your favorite tournament and you never made it past the quarterfinals.  What are you feeling right now?
FELICIANO LOPEZ: I'm conscious that this tournament is very hard.  I won 6-4 in the third set the other day; today it was match against a top 20.  All the matches in a Masters 1000 are very tough matches.  This year wasn't different.
I knew it was going to be very difficult.  I played him two times before.  I beat him twice:  one in Indian Wells recently and another one in Canada, which was very hard.
When you're facing very tough players in the top, every match is a little bit more difficult.  If I had won today, tomorrow I would probably be facing Djokovic.
As I'm saying, each day matches in these kind of tournaments are very difficult.  A Masters 1000 is one of the most difficult tournaments to win these days for me.
Today's match didn't fall on my side.  There's nothing I can do.  I just have to keep going and look forward to the next one.
