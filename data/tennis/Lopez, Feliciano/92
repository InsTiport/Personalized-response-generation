Q. How would you explain your form? How would you explain your performance today? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Was tough match. First set I was playing very good, the beginning, but I could not break him. And then we went to the tiebreak and I was playing very confident with my serve, and I finally won the first set. That was so important for me because after this he lost a little bit his confidence, then I break him easy in the second game of the second set and then the match was getting easy for me.  
 
Q. Would you say you improved a lot from your first round match? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: First round was totally different. I was playing also good, but I had a terrible injury in my head after the first set. It was not a match to compare I think with the match I play today.  
 
Q. There's no injury any more? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: No. It was a headache because of the warm.  
 
Q. Because of the heat? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Yes.  
 
Q. How was the heat today? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I think the temperature was getting down I think from yesterday.  
 
Q. Did you feel Marat was very motivated? How did he feel as an opponent? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I'm quite motivated. Olympic Games is very important for me, even for all the players. I think this win today is going to give me confidence for the next match, but is going to be also difficult because I play to Grosjean, who is a very good player.  
 
Q. I'm sorry? 
 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I'm going to Grosjean next match, and he's very good player also. But, of course, this match was important for me. Is very good player, Safin. Is always good to win these guys.
