  6-3, 6-4

 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

 Q. No matter what, a Lopez was going to win today (laughter)?
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, I think I played great. As I said on the court, it's been a tough year for me. I didn't win so many matches, so I have to be happy for being in the second round here.
 I think I played great match, as I said before. And especially in the beginning, I was very focused, playing very aggressive, and I keep playing in the same way I think for the whole match. So that's probably the key. 

 Q. Considering your year, how important is it for you to play well these last few weeks of this year going to look forward to 2010?
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, it's very important. It's still a few more tournaments coming now, and I feel very confident for this tournament here in Shanghai, and there's so many indoor tournaments after this one. 
 And I always play good, so I hope to get some points to improve my ranking, and because I need, no, to start the next year in good position. 
 So I only can say that I'm so happy to be in the second round, and I don't want to think any more now.

 Q. You talk about points for next season, but there is a big rendezvous at the end of the year for you with the Davis Cup final. Is that also something that makes you say, you know, I need to get confidence and get the matches?
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Yeah, yeah, of course. It's very important for all of us, no? And the captain has tough decision to make, no? Because we are so many players, and I hope to be in the team, but I understand that there is a lot of players also hat that they can be on the team, no? 
 Of course it's very important for me to play good the rest of the year and show the captain that I'm going to be ready for this tie.
