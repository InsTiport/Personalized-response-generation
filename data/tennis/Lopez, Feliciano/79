  F. LOPEZ/B. Dabul
7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4

 Q. You have a game that's a little bit different than a lot of the Spaniards and you've obviously had good success here at Wimbledon, in the quarterfinals. But we're seeing some of the other Spaniards doing well on grass. What do you think is happening? There was a time when they skipped grass altogether, a lot of the Spaniards. 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I think in general the Spanish players, we improve a lot on all the surface, no? Especially on grass, the last two years, Rafa, he played the finals here. Me, I was playing good, also, a few years. David, he is also very good on grass. He reached, I think, the fourth round against Hewitt one time, and now he's improving the game a lot on grass, I think.

 Q. Has the mentality changed a little bit do you think?
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Yeah, for sure. When you see one of your friends playing good on grass, you believe you can do it yourself again, and that makes everything more easy. 

 Q. Is it at all the surface itself, also? Is it slower? 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I think it's slower than before. Since the first year I played, it became more and more slow. That's my opinion. I also speak with other guys where they were playing here a few years ago, and they agree with me. I don't know why, but it's much, much slower. 

 Q. Did you ever think of skipping Wimbledon when you were coming up? 
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: No, no. Since the first year I played here, I really liked the grass. But it is true that it was faster before.
