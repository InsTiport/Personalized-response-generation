  6‑4, 6‑4, 6‑2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How well do you think Rafa is playing? 
FELICIA NO LOPEZ:   Well, I think Rafa, he's in a good shape.   If you take the match he played today, I think he's 100% physically, which is very important for him.
I think he's playing better and better every day. 

Q.   Do you think he's going to be overlooked because of Novak and Roger and even Tomic, that he's been a bit ignored? 
FELICIA NO LOPEZ:   No.   Rafa, he has never been ignored, I think, to be honest.   I mean, he's in the top three favorites for winning the tournament, so he wouldn't be ignored, I think.

Q.   He mixed it up a bit.   He said he likes to mix it up against you. 
FELICIA NO LOPEZ:   Yeah, I mean, he's one of the players that I don't like to play because of the way he plays.   I think him and Andy, they're probably the two players I don't like to play.   Compared to Novak and Roger, I might play better against Novak and Roger than Rafa or Andy.

Q.   Why is that?
FELICIA NO LOPEZ:   Because he has a different game, no?   He plays the balls really high.   When I play against Rafa, I have to play different shots that I normally don't have to play, which is very unusual for me.
He takes me out of my rhythm normally when I play against him.
