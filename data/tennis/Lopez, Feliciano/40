THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.  
   
 Q.   It's the third time you make it to the semis in Shanghai, but also the third time you lost.   How do you feel about this kind of situation?   Do you feel lucky or unlucky?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Well, to reach the semis is always great.   If I look the week overall, I have to be happy.   I won a couple good matches here, so I have to be proud of my performance this week.   
I had a very good chance today.   But I think he was a much better player.   Today on the court I was feeling since the beginning of the match that he was stronger than me today.   I really tried different things.   I went very aggressive.   I did something different.   But didn't work either.   
I think he was a better player.   I have to be happy for the week anyway.   
   
 Q.   Were you a little bit surprised at how well he served?   You didn't get one breakpoint chance in the entire match.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Is not only that he was serving great.   I mean, he was playing the point very good after the serve.   I think even though I was a little bit slower than normal from the baseline, he was very solid.   So after the serve he was playing very good.   He was not missing.   He was going aggressive when he has to go aggressive.   
I think he did everything.   He passed very well.   A few times I came in and he hit a very good passing shot.   He returned well also.   So I think he played better than me.   
   
 Q.   Next week you will go back to world No.14 or 15.   How do you feel about this?   This is your best ranking in your whole career.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, I think 15 was my best until now.   I think I'm going to be 14 next Monday.   So, yeah, obviously I have to be proud of getting this number and reaching this position in the rankings because I'm 33 now.   Yeah, I was not expecting to be that good at that age, so I have to be proud.   
I still have three more weeks left this year.   I think if I keep playing like this, I can maybe finish the year a little bit higher than 14.   
Let's keep it up and hopefully the next three weeks, they're going to be good also.
