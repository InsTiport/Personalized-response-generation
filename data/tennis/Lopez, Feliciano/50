F. LOPEZ/G. Simon
  7‑6, 6‑7, 6‑0

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Can you remember playing in conditions like that before?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   (Smiling.)   No, no.   No, I didn't play in conditions like this.   Was really tough.   I mean, sometimes was about pushing and putting the ball on the other side of the court.   Especially when we were serving, it was almost impossible sometimes. 
The wind was so strange.   It was coming from everywhere.   Normally it's one side to another.   Today was so strange. 
So we made the best we can, to be honest.

Q.   A bit harsh to get a warning, then?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, was difficult.   I hope we can play better at Wimbledon. 

Q.   What if any impact do you think this has on your match at Wimbledon?   Do you think it means anything in those terms?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Well, I said yesterday that for me this match was really special, because it's great to be in the finals and it's an opportunity to win another ATP event, but playing the same guy in two days, it's also important to have some feedback even though we know each other very good, because almost every week we see each other, we practice, we have played a few times, I think, but then today in these conditions it's tough to get any feedback from the match, to be honest.
It was about to put the ball on the other side almost the whole match, so it's tough to take something, you know, for the match on Tuesday.

Q.   It was so tight the first two sets.   Were you a bit surprised by the third?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, it was so strange, no?   I lost the tiebreak in the second set.   I was so unlucky in a few shots.
Then I start serving the third.   I made an early break at 2‑Love, and then at 3‑Love it was this crazy game.   I had Love‑40, a few more break points, and finally I won this game.
So two breaks on grass is too much, no?   I think he really lost the hope that he can still win after two breaks down in the third.

Q.   You have reached the quarterfinals, what, three times, didn't you, at Wimbledon?   How would you assess... 
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Every time I play at Wimbledon my expectations are high.   I'm normally very motivated to play there, because I love playing on grass and I love playing Wimbledon, and Wimbledon is the Slam where I have played better in my career.   I have great memories playing there. 
Every match is a battle.   I have to beat Gilles.   Then it will be another one.   So I don't want to think about, you know, going into third, fourth, or quarterfinals or something.
I mean, I just want to beat Gilles on Tuesday.   That's all.

Q.   How does it feel to get your first grass court title?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   It's nice.   It's nice.   It's great.   It's my third title in my career.   It's a great feeling definitely, no? 
I think grass is my best surface, and to have at least one title on grass is very nice feeling.
