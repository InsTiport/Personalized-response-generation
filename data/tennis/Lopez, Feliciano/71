 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. How would you sum up your first experience on Ashe?  
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, I think it's difficult to play out there, no, with the wind. Takes me a long to adjust to conditions. Took me almost one set and a half to start playing like I like to play because of I didn't play there. Rafa, he was more used to it, no? He played two matches already there.   
 But is not an excuse. So I think he played very solid, and he plays better than me.  
  
  Q. You had said in the prematch that you had not had a lot of wind during your matches, but today was the worst of it for you?  
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, I think in general I didn't play bad, but he played better in important points than me. First set I had Love-40 to get the break back and put the score 3-All. I didn't take this chance. And Rafa, he doesn't give you so many chances in one match.  
 It was very difficult to play on the other side against the wind, and all the breaks came from this side. So that's probably the most important thing. I could not, you know, face it today.   
  
  Q. Besides just the stadium, is it at all different or strange to be playing well past midnight, to be playing at 1:00 as opposed to 1:00 p.m.?  
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Yeah, yeah, of course. It's difficult. You have to be awake. It's a long day for Rafa and for me. But we knew it's gonna be like this, no?   
 Probably we should have played a little earlier, but then Venus play before Clijsters, and then Clijsters played a long match. We went on the court very late, and of course we're not used to play very late.   
  
  Q. You don't practice at midnight ever?  
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: Not really (Smiling).
