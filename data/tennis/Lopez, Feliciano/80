  F. LÃPEZ/M. Baghdatis  
5-7, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6, 8-6  
  
 THE MODERATOR: Feliciano LÃ³pez.   
  
  Q. How do you feel you played today? Are you pleased with your success?  
 FELICIANO LÃPEZ : Yeah, of course, no? Have to be happy to be in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, no? That's pretty obvious.   
  
  Q. Were you spurred on by your success last night with Spain winning the title?  
 FELICIANO LÃPEZ : No, no. Spain that day don't make me win. Of course, they make me so happy yesterday, as all of the Spanish people, no?   
 Once we are on the court we don't have any support from them, no? But, of course we are so happy that they won the Euro. It's so important for the country.   
  
  Q. You feel confident you can go further now?  
 FELICIANO LÃPEZ : Well, when you are in the quarters you're always thinking about going farther. But to be honest, I have to meet Safin or Wawrinka the next round, which is going to be really, really tough, no?   
 I want to focus on this match and I don't want to think about going farther than that.
