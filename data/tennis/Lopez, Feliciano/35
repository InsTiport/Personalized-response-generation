  6‑3, 6‑4

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Is that about as good as you have seen Andy play?   He looked efficient; few flaws today.   Is that the best you have seen him?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, I think he's been playing great this year since Australian Open where he reached the finals.   He seems to be in good shape.
Yeah, I think he played great today.   He hasn't missed any ball almost.   He was very solid, consistent.   I think I needed to do something extra, you know, to win the points.
Yeah.   This what happen basically, no?   He was the better player I think.

Q.   How do you like his chances in the next round?   He will play Novak and Novak will have an extra day's rest with Bernard not playing. 
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   You never know.   Tennis can change a lot from one day to the other, and I think Andy and Novak, they have played in the past so many times. 
All the matches, they were very close, so I won't be surprised if Andy wins this time, but I think Nole might be the favorite because he's been winning almost everything he played. 
But it will be a great match to watch, obviously.

Q.   What's your evaluation about your tournament?   You had a nice run to get here to the quarterfinals.   How do you feel about your tournament?
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Well, I have to look at the week this way.   I reach the quarters first time.   I beat Kei yesterday, which is a great result for me.   Yeah, it's definitely a great week. 
Hopefully I can continue playing like this in Miami.   And, yeah, I'm very happy.   I think I have been playing some of my best tennis this week.   With Cuevas I played great.   Yesterday I played also great match.   I'm very confident and I looking forward to playing Miami.   Hopefully it can stay like this the rest of the year.
