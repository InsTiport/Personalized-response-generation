THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel out there today?   How would you rate your performance?   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Happy, no?   I'm in the third round at Wimbledon, so I have to be pleased because of being in the third round again.  
The match was very close.   I think he was really confident.   He had a great win against Falla in the first round.   It was tough for me.   It was tough for me to return his serve.   He was serving very good.   
Yeah, the match was very close.   Finally I find a way somehow to make the break in the third again and I won, so I have to be happy.  
   
 Q.   You have quite a good record here.   How deep do you feel you can go this year?   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   I take it one match at a time.   I mean, this is the way I always did.   This year is going to be the same.  
I play against John now, which is going to be very close match.   He's serving like an animal, as you saw against Nieminen.   It's going to be a very close match again.  
Nothing I can say.   I have to play my best if I want to beat John.  
   
 Q.   What's your history with him?   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   We played once in Australian Open and I beat him.   He beat me in Houston.   I don't remember if we play any other time.   
   
 Q.   How do you combat a player who serves like an animal?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Tough.   It's going to be close.   You have to be focus all the time and be patient, because doesn't give many chances when he serves.   So I have to be very focused in case he gives me some of them.
