 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Please comment on your match today. Next match you will play with your countryman.   
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I think it's going to be a very tough match. David is a top player right now this moment, so I know it's going to be tough to beat him.   
 He's a fighter. He's very fast. He's one of the best returners in the game right now, so I know it's going to be a difficult match.   
 If I want to continue winning, I have to play the way I was playing today and yesterday.   
  
  Q. You said that Florian Mayer plays in a strange way.   
 FELICIANO LOPEZ: I just say that he plays different than normal, from the rest of the players. Tennis today, all the players play almost the same, no, from the baseline, great strokes, backhand, forehand. But he plays from different angles, different shots. He comes in a lot, which is pretty unusual in the tennis today.   
 So that's why I said he played different.
