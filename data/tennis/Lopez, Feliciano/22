A. MANNARINO/F. Lopez   
5-7, 6-1, 6-1, 4-3 (ret.)   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  I just wanted to know what happened exactly.  
FELICIANO LOPEZ: I don't know really.  I started to feeling the pain, the foot, in the left foot, beginning of the first set.  I thought it was going to be okay after a few games, but it was getting worse and worse, and then I was trying.   
I took a pill, but didn't work.  Did the treatment, as well, with the trainer.  Didn't work, either.  I don't know.  Was just trying to hang in there.   
But by the end of the match, I realized that being like this on the court doesn't really worth it to keep playing.   
 Q.  So you don't know exactly what kind of injury is it?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ: No, it's pretty early now.
