FELICIANO LOPEZ: Yes, the serve is very important. It's the essence of my game. I've always held my serve well, except in the second set with two breaks of serve, where I lost my focus. He was more under pressure when he served because if I broke him, it was hard for him to break back. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: In Wimbledon, I thought I could win, beat better players than me. It made me gain confidence. That helped me in the Asian circuit, where I beat Safin. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: The first set was good for me because I was a bit tense, my first match. The second set, I relaxed too much, that's why I lost it. I think the key was confidence, and I got it back in the third set. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: All the matches here are hard. This year he's been playing well. Every match in this tournament is hard, so I think it will be hard. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: I need to play very loose, relaxed. I have to win, even though he's seeded. I'll try to play my best. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: No, no, I feel very supported by the public. I'm surprised with the crowds that have supported me during my match. It's nice to play some tournaments at home, in your home country. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: Well, I missed some easy points, actually. But normally from the baseline I feel comfortable. It's not that I have to improve a lot, because I'm generally very consistent from the baseline. 

FELICIANO LOPEZ: This year has been very good for me, not only for the confidence, but also because each tournament, I realize that I can beat anybody actually. You believe more in yourself, and your confidence improves with each win.
