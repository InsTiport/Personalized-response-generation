  6/7, 7/6, 7/6, 7/5 
  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Took a bit of a battering with the serves there.   86 in total aces.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, I'm just having a look now at the statistics, and, yeah, a lot of aces.   Tough match to play.  
As I said before, I knew it's going to be like this.   I knew we going to play a lot of tiebreaks, so this is the match I was excepting to play.   
Luckily I made it.   I'm very happy to went through.   It was a very difficult one for me today.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling tired?   You played so many matches in the last three weeks.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, a little bit, but my body is responding good and I'm feeling full of energy for tomorrow.   
Yeah, I don't think it's going to be an issue for me.   
   
 Q.   Confidence must be very, very high.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, yeah.   When you beat players like John, when you go through a difficult match like this, you have to be proud of yourself.   To beat Johnny on that court is such is difficult task, and I made it.   To play him, it's always difficult.   You know, there is no rhythm; a lot of aces; a lot of points where you don't play.   You have to be always aware until the chance is coming, you know.  
This what I tried to do during the whole match.   At the same point, it's tough to be focus all the time.  
   
 Q.   Is it the height the serve is coming at that makes it so difficult?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   A lot of things.   Angles he goes, they're different obviously because he's very tall.   His percentage is very high.   Always over 70, which is unbelievable for these kind of serve.  
Second serve he goes for sometimes also, so this is another thing you have to put in your mind.   
Yeah, it's No. 1 in the game I think right now.   
   
 Q.   Even though this is a bang‑bang kind of match, is it fun to play that kind of match?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   No, it's not fun.   I mean, it's fun because I won it, but it's difficult match to play.   
You know, these guys, they play like this, and you know already what are you going to face.   So I knew the match is going to be like this.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised that he went for a second serve on this last break point?   He went for a first serve and hit like 130.   
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   He did in the match few times, so I was expecting a bomb again.   But sometimes I was guessing, no, where he's going to go, because it's so tough to return his serve.  
Even though you know where he's going to serve, sometimes it's really difficult.   So I was guessing.   Sometimes I made it; sometimes I don't.  
   
 Q.   Is it a relief that the final set was 7‑5 given the schedule that's ahead of you potentially over the next few days?   Are you happy that it finished quickly?   It could have gone or for a while, couldn't it?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Yeah, I'm happy.   I didn't play on Friday.   On Saturday I didn't play either.   
So, yeah, I knew it's going to be busy week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday if I keep winning, obviously.  
   
 Q.   What about facing Stan?  
FELICIANO LOPEZ:   Totally different match, but, yeah, he's confident.   He won already three matches here, and I think I have to play very good if I want to beat Stan tomorrow.
