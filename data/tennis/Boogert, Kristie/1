Q.  When you broke at the start of the second set, your reaction suggested that you had the match under control.  Did you feel at that point you were going to win it?
 
KRISTIE BOOGERT:  Well, I was up serving for 5-1.  Seems like you have the match in the pocket.  In my mind, it was close, but also far away.  It was one break.  The pressure that Justine was putting on me, I could feel it already.  She started to play better and I started to get a little bit more cautious. 
 
Q.  The crucial game was the one when you were serving for 5-2.  Did you suffer then from tension and nerves?
 
KRISTIE BOOGERT:  Yeah, partly, partly.  Partly nerves but also, like I said, the pressure from Justine was becoming more and more.  You can expect that from somebody that's in the Top 10, I think.  If you give them one opportunity, they're going to take it.  
 
Q.  Did your game fall below the previous standard in the final set?
 
KRISTIE BOOGERT:  I think I played a little bit above my level in the first set and a half.  Maybe Justine was a bit surprised.  By then I think she could only play better and I could only play worse.  So I think that's sort of what happened.  She took up her game and I just went down a little bit.
