PENG‑HLAVACKOVA/Barthel‑Minella
  6‑3, 6‑3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   Now you have a new partner in the doubles.   How is it feeling after the victory?
SHUAI PENG:   (Through translation.)   It's my first match together with Andrea, and indeed there is something different.   For example, the pace and the style of playing matches.   So in today's match we tried to adapt to each other.   We hope that we can get more familiar with each other through more matches.

Q.   (Through translation.)   Yesterday you published a Weibo post responding to Li Na's retirement seemingly. Do you want to say something about that?
SHUAI PENG:   I don t think it s necessary to explain anymore. I say everything through Weibo. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   Since the US Open, foreign media tend to compare you with Li Na, something you don t want to do.   Does that frustrate you a lot?
SHUAI PENG:   (Through translation.)   I was not frustrated.   It's just that people keep asking questions like this, and I keep answering again and again, and I m tired of answering these kinds of questions.   

Q.   (Through translation.)   About your new partner, Andrea, how did you two find each other?   Who took the initiative, you or her?   And how did you two make the decision to play together in China Open and Wuhan Open?
SHUAI PENG:   (Through translation.)   As for Wuhan Open, she came to me first.   Actually, when I was playing ‑‑ originally I planned to play the Asian Games representing China, Unfortunately there were some changes.   
I planned to play China Open in Beijing with Hsieh Su‑Wei, but due to some unexpected changes we had to find new partners.   Eventually Andrea and I decided to play Beijing and Wuhan Open together.

Q.   (Through translation.)       You played well in both doubles and singles.   You advanced to the semifinal of US Open.   In the future, would you like to consider playing more singles?
SHUAI PENG:   I'm very happy that things are going very smoothly in both my singles and doubles, and in this year I have made new breakthroughs in my singles as well as doubles. 
In the future I think I will pay equal attention to both.   But, for example, in some major events I will attend both singles and doubles, but in other not‑so‑important events maybe I will give up the doubles due to physical limits.   But it does not mean that I will give up my doubles. 
Next year will be another Olympic circle.   But I really love doubles.   I love playing doubles, and it is not uncommon for singles players to play doubles.   Many excellent players also play doubles.   So maybe if I can make myself physically stronger, I can, you know, do well in both.

Q.   (Through translation.)   Now people are all expecting you to win the doubles championship of Wuhan Open, because we will really be happy about this championship.   So how will you get out of the failure in your singles?
SHUAI PENG:   (Through translation.)   Now we are playing in China.   Of course I will have a special state of mind.   You know, the better you want to play, the more pressure you will have on your shoulder. 
I mean, it is different from playing in other countries.   You have a new partner, and you actually do not have a good understanding of each other.   You defer from each other in terms of ways of playing, your paces, and other things.   So naturally you get nervous.
But I really want to have better performance in doubles.   There are several rounds ahead in Wuhan Open, and currently I just want to get better prepared for the next round.   Hopefully that we can go further. 

Q.   (Through translation.)   Will you continue your partnering with Andrea after the China Open in Beijing, or will you change another partner?   Because you have won the doubles championship of Grand Slam.   Will you set a higher criteria in terms of choosing a partner?
SHUAI PENG:   (Through translation.)   Well, Andrea is a very good doubles player, but I think it's a little bit too early for me to make the decision.   I will play with Andrea in Wuhan Open and China Open and with Hsieh Su‑Wei in the final in Singapore, and I will leave the decision to be made later.
