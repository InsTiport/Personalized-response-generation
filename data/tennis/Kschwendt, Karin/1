Q. What do you think?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: I prefer winning. I want to finish first one
round, it doesn't matter where, especially because I never won
on center court, because usually if I play against Seles, I played
Australian Open on center court, court number one in Wimbledon
the day I was playing like Navratilova and Capriati, so it's the
first time I ever win on center court.

Q. This year have you played on center court?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: No, this was last year, two years ago, three
years. I played here against Seles three years ago on center court.


Q. First round?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: No, third round.

Q. Who else have you played?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: I played Seles in the Australian Open on center
court and Navratilova on court one in Wimbledon. 

Q. When was that?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: This was in 90. Long time ago.

Q. Anybody else?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: No, I mean, on the smaller tournaments, but these
are not really center courts.

Q. You mentioned Capriati?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Yes, I played Capriati in Boca, but it's not
a real center court there. I played Capriati in Filderstadt. It
is a small center court.

Q. So we're talking Grand Slams here--

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Grand Slams and Lipton.

Q. So this is your first ever win on center court?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Yes. First time I don't--

Q. Probably the last time this week?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: I think so.

Q. What did you think of the surface; you were pretty happy
with it?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: It's very good, I like it a lot. I think it's
good because you can play any style. You can play from the back,
you can play slice, top spin, everything, so it's pretty fair.


Q. What do you mean when you say that; that it is a little
bit slower than most hardcourts?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: No, I would say it's medium, it's good. I think
can you play any style of game, so it's good.

Q. You were down 3-Love, 4-1 second set, how did you turn it
around?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Well, I think I did a couple of unforced errors
in the beginning and she played some good balls, but then I was
more concentrated on the big points. She made some easy mistakes,
it's going very fast in tennis, and yeah, couple of points there
I got, they were very important and I turned it around, and then
I was very confident playing the big points, and-- so I just thought
about playing the next point, I didn't think about it.

Q. Were you more excited to be playing not only in a stadium
court, but on the first day?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Yes, yesterday when I looked at the schedule,
I looked at it and for five minutes, I looked and said, I'm not
playing tomorrow. Is it possible? First round women is not going
to be played tomorrow, and finally somebody said, look, you're
first match on stadium court, it is a joke, so, yeah first couple
of minutes I was very nervous, but then I was really excited.
I think it is a great opportunity.

Q. You served first?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: Yes, and I won the first point and I won the
match.

Q. Describe the first point?

KARIN KSCHWENDT: I think we had a long rally and I had a forehand
winner. So, good feeling.

Thank you.
