THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Did you come together a bit more in the second set with the way your game was working?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah.   I started slow.   From the outset at 1‑Love, two bad errors, and then he pressed me, and then I struggled straight from then on in for the first set.   I was in a bit of trouble.  
But I got in myself end of the first set and thought I did pretty well from then on.  
   
 Q.   How much of a step up do you think of playing a Grand Slam champion?  
DANIEL EVANS:   I think in the rallies I was ‑‑ you know, second set especially I was in all the rallies.   I didn't feel that‑‑ didn't feel that different, to be honest.   I felt pretty comfortable, just I gave him more free points than he gives me.  
   
 Q.   We all seem to be saying this is Davis Cup year, but you've got all the potential, you've got all the shots.   It's just getting up there among these quality players, isn't it?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah.   Yeah, it's pretty much what it is.   I need to do it in these sort of tournaments.  
That's why this week is a good week, puts me up the rankings a little, as well, gives me a bit of a benchmark to try and reach and a bit of a platform, as well.   I thought this week was a very good week and especially yesterday's match.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any sort of target for the rest of the year in terms of your ranking, for example?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah.   I mean, it's ‑‑ yeah, and that's not like what I'm really comfortable sharing.  
   
 Q.   Do you prefer playing against this quality opposition than some of the players you play against away from the limelight?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, definitely.   You know, I think anybody wants to be good at what they do, if you don't like this sort of arena sort of thing and the atmosphere, then I think you're doing the wrong thing.   
You know, always seem to play out there and get amongst it, it's probably, you know, it's a pinnacle for me for this year, I guess.   
   
 Q.   If you can reproduce the form you have shown, especially the first two matches here, are you confident in qualifying next week?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, definitely.   Wasn't just here.   I was playing especially well in Nottingham and before that in the two weeks leading up to it on the grass, which it wasn't an accident that I won matches here and at Nottingham.   I have been working hard and, you know, I'm raring to go.  
   
 Q.   Do you just put that down to knuckling down a bit more?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, I think so.   Better regime, more of a workload and people behind me who believe in me, got my back, trust me.   You know, it's a nice environment to be working in.   
   
 Q.   Just looking at Davis Cup, Andy has said he will play in September.   Would it be a particular target of yours to try and force your way in there as the second singles player?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, it would be nice to play.   But, I mean, it's a pretty long way away, isn't it?   
I haven't really thought about it that much since the last Davis Cup, so I'm just sort of hoping to get another good run together on the grass.   That was my main objective is to get a good run of matches, so I started pretty well.  
   
 Q.   I think I am right in saying that Magnus is leaving the LTA in the summer.   Do you think getting some kind of coaching stability is also an important thing for you to have in the next six months, a year or so?  
DANIEL EVANS:   Yeah, it's a tough one.   I mean, I don't know the ins and outs of why he's leaving.   I can't really comment on that, but, you know, it would be nice for him to stick around, but the coaches at NTC are more than capable to coach me.  
   
 Q.   Who else do you work with?   There are times he's not there, so who else do you work with?  
DANIEL EVANS:   He's been there every week since I have been there, so there hasn't been really that much of a void or anything.   It's just that he's just been there.     
I mean, Nick Weal a little bit and when Leon is around he helps.   So it's more than‑‑ like I said, everyone is capable of filling in and helping.   I mean, it's a pretty good team atmosphere.   We're all happy.
