D. EVANS/A. Kuznetsov   
6-2, 3-6, 6-3   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Maybe you could explain the emotions you're feeling after sealing a spot in the final.  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, a good match.  Played really well, actually, throughout the whole match.  I thought he played pretty well, also.  I feel pretty good going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  How did you cope with the rain delays there, an opponent you started being on top of but came back.  Was it hard to keep your concentration?  
DANIEL EVANS: No, because we didn't really go off the court, so it wasn't like a Wimbledon rain delay where you're back in the changing room and waiting around for ages.  It felt like a normal match, to be honest.  It was pretty straightforward.   
 Q.  Both being unseeded in the semifinals.  Does that add any kind of nerves or indication or expectation that you could or should be winning?  
DANIEL EVANS: No.  I think he sort of maybe did feel that a bit.  I thought he started pretty slow.  I got up pretty early on him, so it was ideal for me.   
But then obviously he's in the semis for a reason.  Came back at me, so it was a tough night.   
 Q.  What have you done well this week that's clicked?  
DANIEL EVANS: Well, I have served pretty well throughout the whole week.  It's a little easier when I'm serving pretty well.  I have enjoyed not having such long rallies when I'm serving pretty well.   
 Q.  How are you feeling physically?  Jo Konta goes through the entire tournament without dropping a whole set and you have had three sets each round.  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, I feel a bit tired, to be honest.  But, yeah, I might not get another opportunity in the final, so it's push hard and then see what happens.   
You know, it's about tomorrow for me now.  It's nothing to do with Melbourne or anything like that.  See what happens here and then go over to Melbourne.   
 Q.  Is it easy to keep your focus?  I know a couple of the players said today they knew the draw could come out, who they are playing, but you still have a tournament here.  How easy is it to keep your focus here on Sydney?  
DANIEL EVANS: No, it's pretty easy.  Like I said, I don't get these opportunities often, so, you know, to win here, and if anything bad happened in Melbourne, like, I went out first round, I'd sign for winning here and losing first round in Melbourne.   
It's just that's how it is.  No, just focusing on tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to playing.   
 Q.  Have you watched much of Gilles throughout the week?  
DANIEL EVANS: No, but I know him pretty well.  Obviously a great serve.  He likes to come forward.   
It's going to be a different match.  It won't be so fatiguing, actually.  Be sort of very stop/start.  He'll be hitting a lot of aces, so we'll see.   
 Q.  Are you aware of his record in finals?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah.  I heard a commentator.  He wasn't won one.  Nor have I, actually (smiling).   
No, we'll see what happens tomorrow.   
 Q.  How do you find playing lefties?  
DANIEL EVANS: I think I've got a pretty good record against lefties, actually.  It's obviously a little difficult.  He's got probably one of the best serves in the world, so it's going to be tough tomorrow.  Just hopefully pick his serve and see what happens.   
 Q.  Irrespective of what happens, it's been a pretty remarkable tournament for Brit players, hasn't it?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, it has, actually.  It's great that Jo won.  Hopefully Jamie and Bruno win.  Hopefully I win.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.  If I'm sitting here tomorrow, winning, and Jamie has won, that will be remarkable.
