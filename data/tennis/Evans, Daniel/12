3-6, 6-4, 7-5   
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  You must be pretty proud of that.  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, it was good. It's difficult to play Fabio. He's such a class player. Just happy to come through really. It was a good battle. I didn't actually get to play my game too much, but it was good.   
 Q.  How tough was it to hang in a match that was so long and so close?  
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, felt like he was on top forever really. Yeah, just hanging in. Good part of my game is hanging in, just staying in the match really. Points for double break in the second set, just stuck it out.   
 Q.  What is the toughest thing about playing him?  
DANIEL EVANS: His demeanor is so hard to play. No intensity, then he's right on it hitting the ball to the lines. It's tough to play him. He's obviously such a good player. Moves so good, as well.
