D. EVANS/R. Albot
7-6, 6-2
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. What's the thinking when you're getting closer to Wimbledon at this stage of a tournament in the week before?  Are you looking after yourself a bit, or do you still go flat out?
DANIEL EVANS: No, no, I got plenty of time last week to look after myself, so I can't pick and choose my tournaments yet.  So it's a great week for me here to try and get some points on the board again.
Q. A solid win today.  What's he like to play?  What are the challenges he presents on grass?
DANIEL EVANS: That court is pretty slow, so he was difficult.  He made a lot of balls.  He's obviously very quick.
You know, it was a good match, I thought.  I thought I played pretty good.  His serve is pretty deceptive, as well, on a grass court.  It comes through so it makes it a little more difficult.
Q. Your ankle?
DANIEL EVANS: It was fine.  It was just a bit greasy at the front where no one runs.
Q. How are you feeling physically?
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, I mean, today I felt a bit flat at the start but got into it.  You know, I hung around a lot last week, played dubs.  So I was a bit lethargic at the start, but I thought I got going and I'm pretty happy with the end of that match.  Yeah, it was a good match.
Q. I can't remember who it was said to me the other day, they thought actually while you were good on grass, they think that on the American hard courts you can maybe even take it up a notch.  Would you agree with that?
DANIEL EVANS: I like the grass, obviously.  There is quite a few who don't like the grass, so it gives me an advantage in that way.
But I think that's a fair point, I'd say, yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I prefer the American hard.  It gets a bit more chance to get into the points, you know.
Q. Obviously we're not at the end of Wimbledon yet, but are you going to give yourself time and have a break afterwards?
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, take a week after Wimbledon.  Maybe go on holiday for a few days and then get going again.
I'm entered in Atlanta.  Yeah, start again in Atlanta and, you know, it's pretty nonstop, so it's good.
Q. What happens after Atlanta?  Where do you go after that?
DANIEL EVANS: Atlanta, Washington, and then depending how the entries go for the Masters, yeah.
Q. There was some chatter yesterday about you becoming British No. 1.  Is that something you're conscious of?
DANIEL EVANS: No.  No, I'm happy with how I'm doing, and if that -- if I go into that position, it will make no odds to me whatsoever.  You know, all the three guys are doing pretty well, and that's what we want.
Hopefully the guys behind start coming up, as well.  And get four or five, six of us in the top 100 would be good.  That's obviously the aim for everyone who's behind.
Q. Have you seen much of Paul Jubb who we have spoken to yesterday?
DANIEL EVANS: Yeah, he's pretty controlled.  Great manner about himself, I think.  He's going to be a good player, isn't he?  Hopefully push forward, daresay quick, but I think he will, yeah.
Q. If you did become British No. 1, you could pick the ATP Cup captain.  Thought about that?
DANIEL EVANS: Well, it doesn't actually need a captain, because I think I read that it's like a hut.  Not a hut but like a dugout-sort-of style now.  So if we all have our coaches there, I don't see why we need anyone extra.  Maybe put, I don't know, a spokesperson or whatnot in for the week, but there's no point taking an extra guy if they're all just going to be on the side of the court, is how I heard it.
I wouldn't see any point in taking extra -- if that's how it is.  That's my understanding.  I don't know if you guys -- is that how you're understanding it?
Q. I didn't know that.  Do you think David could sit in the dugout basically?
DANIEL EVANS: That's what I heard.  I mean, that's how it's been interpreted to me that, you know, say it was me, Cameron, Kyle, and just say Andy -- is there five?  Andy and Jamie?  Everybody could have their coach in the dugout.
So it wouldn't make much sense having an extra guy, if you could just, you know, maybe, say, Hit your forehand a lot (smiling).
That's how I have understood it, but I might be wrong.  There's every chance I'm wrong.  I haven't read much into it (smiling).  That's just the snippets I have heard.
Q. Talking of team tennis and stuff, the Olympics, because the qualification period has already started, have you thought about that at all?  Is that a goal for you?  You're actually quite close at the moment to getting in.
DANIEL EVANS: I mean, I don't know.  I was asked to play or I qualified to play last time, and I chose not to.
I just think, you know, I need to take care of my ranking first and foremost before I, you know, start representing Great Britain and then missing out.  That would be a disaster for me.  And then not being in main draw of another tournament, that's a big -- you know, not being in a main draw of a slam because I went to play the Olympics would be -- you know, if my ranking slips, that wouldn't be good for me.  I'll have to see where my ranking is if I get in or not, yeah.
Q. I thought you quite liked the Olympics.  I'm quite surprised you're not quite keen on going there after last time, as well.
DANIEL EVANS: I'm not not keen on it.  It's obviously a great -- it's always an honor to represent your country, but it doesn't -- like Davis Cup, it's not so much, like, it doesn't seem like a team event.
You are playing individually, but Davis Cup feels like a team event where the Olympics you're playing individually.
So I don't know.  Like I said, if I'm in and I'm way inside the criteria and I don't need to play another tournament, I will play.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I have not really thought about it, either.  Yeah, it's the first anyone has mentioned the Olympics to me.  You're thinking ahead.
